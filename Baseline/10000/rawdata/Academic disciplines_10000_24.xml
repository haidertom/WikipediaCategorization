'''Active learning''' is a form of learning in which [[teaching method|teaching]] strives to involve students in the learning process more directly than in other methods.

Bonwell (1991) "states that in active learning, students participate in the process and students participate when they are doing something besides passively listening." (Weltman, p.&amp;nbsp;7) Active learning is "a method of learning in which students are actively or experientially involved in the learning process and where there are different levels of active learning, depending on student involvement. {{Harv|Bonwell|Eison|1991}}. In the Association for the Study of Higher Education (ASHE) report the authors discuss a variety of methodologies for promoting "active learning". They cite literature that indicates that to learn, students must do more than just listen: They must read, write, discuss, or be engaged in solving problems. It relates to the three learning domains referred to as knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSA), and that this taxonomy of learning behaviours can be thought of as "the goals of the learning process".&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S., Krathwohl, D. R., &amp; Masia, B. B. (1956). Taxonomy of educational objectives: The classification of educational goals. New York, NY: David McKay Company.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, students must engage in such higher-order thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Renkl, A., Atkinson, R. K., Maier, U. H., &amp; Staley, R. (2002). From example study to problem solving: Smooth transitions help learning. Journal of Experimental Education, 70 (4), 293–315.&lt;/ref&gt;
Active learning engages students in two aspects – doing things and thinking about the things they are doing.

==Nature of active learning==
[[File:Learning Retention Pyramid.JPG|thumbnail|Learning Retention Pyramid, based on [[Bloom's taxonomy]].  Active learning is above, passive learning below]]
There are a wide range of alternatives for the term "active learning" like learning through play, technology-based learning, activity-based learning, group work, project method, etc. the underlying factor behind these are some significant qualities and characteristics of active learning. Active learning is the opposite of [[passive learning]]; it is [[student-centered|learner-centered]], not teacher-centered, and requires more than just listening; the active participation of each and every student is a necessary aspect in active learning. Students must be doing things and simultaneously think about the work done and the purpose behind it so that they can enhance their higher order thinking capabilities. Many research studies{{By whom|date=August 2018}} have proven that active learning as a strategy has promoted achievement levels and some others{{who|date=August 2018}} say that content mastery is possible through active learning strategies. However, some students as well as teachers find it difficult to adapt to the new learning technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bonwell |last2= Eison |first1=Charles |first2= James |title=Active Learning: Creating Excitement in the Classroom |date=1991 |publisher=Information Analyses - ERIC Clearinghouse Products (071) |isbn=978-1-878380-08-1 |issn=0884-0040 |pages=3 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED336049.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active learning should transform students from passive listeners to active participants and helps students understand the subject through inquiry, gathering and analyzing data to solving higher order cognitive problems. There is intensive use of scientific and quantitative literacy across the curriculum and technology-based learning is also in high demand in concern with active learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bean |first1=John C. |title=Engaging Ideas: The Professor's Guide to Integrating Writing, Critical Thinking and Active Learning in the Classroom |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-06233-3 |pages=384 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes (1989)&lt;ref name=Active_Learning.ris&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Douglas |title=Active Learning |publisher=Leeds University TVEI Support Project, 1989 |isbn=978-1-872364-00-1 |pages=19 |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyriacou |first1=Chris |title=Active Learning in Secondary School Mathematics |journal=British Educational Research Journal |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=309–318 |jstor=1500835|year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested principles of active learning:
# '''Purposive:''' the relevance of the task to the students' concerns.
# '''Reflective:''' students' reflection on the meaning of what is learned.
# '''Negotiated:''' negotiation of goals and methods of learning between students and teachers.
# '''Critical:''' students appreciate different ways and means of learning the content.
# '''Complex:''' students compare learning tasks with complexities existing in real life and making reflective analysis. 
# '''Situation-driven:''' the need of the situation is considered in order to establish learning tasks. 
# '''Engaged:''' real life tasks are reflected in the activities conducted for learning.

Active learning requires appropriate [[learning environment]]s through the implementation of correct strategy. Characteristics of learning environment are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rich environments for active learning: a definition

=== Constructivist framework ===
Active learning coordinates with the principles of [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]] which are, cognitive, meta-cognitive, evolving and affective in nature. Studies have shown that immediate results in construction of knowledge is not possible through active learning, the child goes through process of knowledge construction, knowledge recording and knowledge absorption. This process of knowledge construction is dependent on previous knowledge of the learner where the learner is self-aware of the process of cognition and can control and regulate it by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anthony |first1=Glenda |title=Active Learning in a Constructivist Framework |journal= Educational Studies in Mathematics|date=1996 |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=349–369 |jstor=3482969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several aspects of learning and some of them are: 
# Learning through meaningful reception by David Ausubel, he emphasizes the previous knowledge the learner possesses and considers it a key factor in learning.
# Learning through discovery by Jerome Bruner, where students learn through discovery of ideas with the help of situations provided by the teacher.
# Conceptual change: misconceptions takes place as students discover knowledge without any guidance; teachers provide knowledge keeping in mind the common misconceptions about the content and keep an evaluatory check on the knowledge constructed by the students.
# Social Constructivism by Bandura and Vygotsky, collaborative group work within the framework of cognitive strategies like questioning, clarifying, predicting and summarizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rusbult |first1=Craig |title=Constructivism as a Theory of Active Learning |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/teach/active.htm#constructivism |accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science of Learning in Active Learning ==
Active learning has been definitively shown to be superior to lectures in promoting both comprehension and memory ([http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full Freeman et al., 2014]). The reason it is so effective is that it draws on underlying characteristics of how the mind and brain operate during learning. These characteristics have been documented by thousands of empirical studies (e.g., Smith &amp; Kosslyn, 2011) and have been organized into a set of principles. Each of these principles can be drawn on by various active learning exercises. They also offer a framework for designing activities that will promote learning; when used systematically, Stephen Kosslyn (2017) notes these principles enable students to “learn effectively—sometimes without even trying to learn.” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The principles of learning ===
One way to organize the empirical literature on learning and memory specifies 16 distinct principles, which fall under two umbrella “maxims.” The first maxim, “Think it Through,” includes principles related to paying close attention and thinking deeply about new information. The second, “Make and Use Associations,” focuses on techniques for organizing, storing, and retrieving information.

The principles can be summarized as follows:

'''Maxim I: Think it Through'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building the Intentional University: Minerva and the Future of Higher Education|last=Kerrey|first=Bob|date=2017-10-06|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262037150|editor-last=Kosslyn|editor-first=Stephen M.|language=English|editor-last2=Nelson|editor-first2=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Evoking deep processing: extending thinking beyond “face value” of information (Craig et al., 2006; Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972)

2. Using desirable difficulty: ensuring that the activity is neither too easy nor too hard (Bjork, 1988, 1999; VanLehn et al., 2007)

3. Eliciting the generation effect: requiring recall of relevant information (Butler &amp; Roediger, 2007; Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006)

4. Engaging in deliberate practice: promoting practice focused on learning from errors (Brown, Roediger, &amp; McDaniel, 2014; Ericsson, Krampe, &amp; Tesch-Romer, 1993)

5. Using interleaving: intermixing different problem types

6. Inducing dual coding: presenting information both verbally and visually (Kosslyn, 1994; Mayer, 2001; Moreno &amp; Valdez, 2005)

7. Evoking emotion: generating feelings to enhance recall (Erk et al., 2003; Levine &amp; Pizarro, 2004; McGaugh, 2003, 2004)

'''Maxim II: Make and Use Associations''' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

8. Promoting chunking: collecting information into organized units (Brown, Roediger, &amp; McDaniel, 2014; Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2003)

9. Building on prior associations: connecting new information to previously stored information (Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000; Glenberg &amp; Robertson, 1999; Mayer, 2001)

10. Presenting foundational material first: providing basic information as a structural “spine” onto which new information can be attached (Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000; Wandersee, Mintzes, &amp; Novak, 1994)

11. Exploiting appropriate examples: offering examples of the same idea in multiple contexts (Hakel &amp; Halpern, 2005)

12. Relying on principles, not rote: explicitly characterizing the dimensions, factors or mechanisms that underlie a phenomenon (Kozma &amp; Russell, 1997; Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000)

13. Creating associative chaining: sequencing chunks of information into stories (Bower &amp; Clark, 1969; Graeser, Olde, &amp; Klettke, 2002)

14. Using spaced practice: spreading learning out over time (Brown, Roediger, &amp; McDaniel, 2014; Cepeda et al., 2006, 2008; Cull, 2000)

15. Establishing different contexts: associating material with a variety of settings (Hakel &amp; Halpern, 2005; Van Merrienboer et al., 2006)

16. Avoiding interference: incorporating distinctive retrieval cues to avoid confusion (Adams, 1967; Anderson &amp; Neely, 1996)

Active learning typically draws on combinations of these principles. For example, a well-run debate will draw on virtually all, with the exceptions of dual coding, interleaving, and spaced practice. In contrast, passively listening to a lecture rarely draws on any.

==Active learning exercises==
{{see also|Cooperative learning#Techniques}}
Bonwell and Eison (1991) suggested learners work collaboratively, discuss materials while [[role-playing]], [[debate]], engage in [[case study]], take part in [[cooperative learning]], or produce short written exercises, etc. The argument is "when should active learning exercises be used during instruction?".  Numerous studies have shown that introducing active learning activities (such as simulations, games, contrasting cases, labs,..) before, rather than after lectures or readings, results in [[w:Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], understanding, and transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Brant, G., Hooper, E., &amp; Sugrue, B. (1991). Which comes first: The simulation or the lecture? Journal of Educational Computing Research, 7(4), 469-481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, D. L., &amp; Bransford, J. D. (1998). A time for telling. Cognition and instruction, 16(4), 475-5223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, M., &amp; Bielaczyc, K. (2011). Classroom-based experiments in productive failure. In Proceedings of the 33rd annual conference of the cognitive science society (pp. 2812-2817).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, M. (2010). Productive failure in mathematical problem solving. Instructional Science, 38(6), 523-550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, M. (2008). Productive failure. Cognition and Instruction, 26(3), 379-424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, M. (2012). Productive failure in learning the concept of variance. Instructional Science, 40(4), 651-672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapur, M., &amp; Bielaczyc, K. (2012). Designing for productive failure. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 21(1), 45-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westermann, K., &amp; Rummel, N. (2012). Delaying instruction: evidence from a study in a university relearning setting. Instructional Science, 40(4), 673-689.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of instructor guidance students need while being "active" may vary according to the task and its place in a teaching unit.
In an active learning environment learners are immersed in experiences within which they engage in [[meaning-making]] inquiry, action, imagination, invention, interaction, hypothesizing and personal reflection (Cranton 2012).

Examples of "active learning" activities include
* A '''class discussion''' may be held in person or in an online environment. Discussions can be conducted with any class size, although it is typically more effective in smaller group settings.  This environment allows for instructor guidance of the learning experience. Discussion requires the learners to think critically on the subject matter and use logic to evaluate their and others' positions.  As learners are expected to discuss material constructively and intelligently, a discussion is a good follow-up activity given the unit has been sufficiently covered already.&lt;ref&gt;McKeachie, W.J., Svinicki,M. (2006). Teaching Tips: Strategies, Research, and Theory for College and University Teachers. Belmont, CA. Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the benefits of using discussion as a method of learning are that it helps students explore a diversity of perspectives, it increases intellectual agility, it shows respect for students’ voices and experiences, it develops habits of collaborative learning, it helps students develop skills of synthesis and integration (Brookfield 2005). In addition, by having the teacher actively engage with the students, it allows for them to come to class better prepared and aware of what is taking place in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weimer|first1=Maryellen|title=10 benefits of getting students to participate in classroom discussions|url=http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-and-learning/10-benefits-of-getting-students-to-participate-in-classroom-discussions/|website=Faculty Focus|publisher=Faculty Focus|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''think-pair-share''' activity is when learners take a minute to ponder the previous lesson, later to discuss it with one or more of their peers, finally to share it with the class as part of a formal discussion. It is during this formal discussion that the instructor should clarify misconceptions. However students need a background in the subject matter to converse in a meaningful way. Therefore, a "think-pair-share" exercise is useful in situations where learners can identify and relate what they already know to others. So preparation is key. Prepare learners with sound instruction before expecting them to discuss it on their own. If properly implemented, it saves instructor time, keeps students prepared, helps students to get more involved in class discussion and participation and provide cumulative assessment of student progress. The "think-pair-share" method is useful for teachers to hear from all students even those who are quiet in class. This teaching method functions as a great way for all the students in the class to get involved and learn to work together and feel comfortable sharing ideas. It can also help teachers or instructors to observe students and see if they understand the material being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Kristina|title=Increase Student Interaction with "Think-Pair-Shares" and "Circle Chats"|url=http://www.colorincolorado.org/article/13346/|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=colorincolorado.org|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a good strategy to use in large classes because of time and logistical constraints (Bonwell and Eison, 1991). Think-pair-share is helpful for the instructor as it enables organizing content and tracking students on where they are relative to the topic being discussed in class, saves time so that he/she can move to other topics, helps to make the class more interactive, provides opportunities for students to interact with each other (Radhakrishna, Ewing, and Chikthimmah, 2012).
* A '''learning cell''' is an effective way for a pair of students to study and learn together. The learning cell was developed by Marcel Goldschmid of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (Goldschmid, 1971). A learning cell is a process of learning where two students alternate asking and answering questions on commonly read materials. To prepare for the assignment, the students read the assignment and write down questions that they have about the reading. At the next class meeting, the teacher randomly puts students in pairs. The process begins by designating one student from each group to begin by asking one of their questions to the other. Once the two students discuss the question, the other student ask a question and they alternate accordingly. During this time, the teacher goes from group to group giving feedback and answering questions. This system is also called a ''student dyad''.
* A '''short written exercise''' that is often used is the "one-minute paper." This is a good way to review materials and provide feedback. However a "one-minute paper" does not take one minute and for students to concisely summarize it is suggested{{Who|date=January 2010}} that they have at least 10 minutes to work on this exercise. (See also: [[Quiz#In education]].)
* A '''collaborative learning group''' is a successful way to learn different material for different classes.  It is where you assign students in groups of 3-6 people and they are given an assignment or task to work on together.  This assignment could be either to answer a question to present to the entire class or a project. Make sure that the students in the group choose a leader and a note-taker to keep them on track with the process.  This is a good example of active learning because it causes the students to review the work that is being required at an earlier time to participate. (McKinney, Kathleen. (2010). Active Learning. Normal, IL. Center for Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology.) To create participation and draw on the wisdom of all the learners the classroom arrangement needs to be flexible seating to allow for the creation of small groups. (Bens, 2005)
* A '''student debate''' is an active way for students to learn because they allow students the chance to take a position and gather information to support their view and explain it to others.  These debates not only give the student a chance to participate in a fun activity but it also lets them gain some experience with giving a verbal presentation.  (McKinney, Kathleen. (2010). Active Learning. Normal, IL. Center for Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology.)
* A '''reaction to a video''' is also an example of active learning because most students love to watch movies.  The video helps the student to understand what they are learning at the time in an alternative presentation mode.  Make sure that the video relates to the topic that they are studying at the moment.  Try to include a few questions before you start the video so they pay more attention and notice where to focus at during the video.  After the video is complete divide the students either into groups or pairs so that they may discuss what they learned and write a review or reaction to the movie. (McKinney, Kathleen. (2010). Active Learning. Normal, IL. Center for Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology.)
* A '''small group discussion''' is also an example of active learning because it allows students to express themselves in the classroom.  It is more likely for students to participate in small group discussions than in a normal classroom lecture because they are in a more comfortable setting amongst their peers, and from a sheer numbers perspective, by dividing the students up more students get opportunities to speak out.  There are so many different ways a teacher can implement small group discussion in to the class, such as making a game out of it, a competition, or an assignment.  Statistics show that small group discussions is more beneficial to students than large group discussions when it comes to participation, expressing thoughts, understanding issues, applying issues, and overall status of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harmann|first1=Kerstin|title=Assessing Student Perceptions of the benefits of discussions in small-group, large-class, and online learning contexts|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ965394|website=eric.ed.gov|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Just-in-time teaching]]''' promotes active learning by using pre-class questions to create common ground among students and teachers before the class period begins. These ''warmup exercises'' are generally open ended questions designed to encourage students to prepare for class and to elicit student's thoughts on learning goals.  
* A '''class game''' is also considered an energetic way to learn because it not only helps the students to review the course material before a big exam but it helps them to enjoy learning about a topic. Different games such as ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and crossword puzzles always seem to get the students' minds going. (McKinney, Kathleen. (2010). Active Learning. Normal, IL. Center for Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology.)
*'''[[Learning by teaching]]''' is also an example of active learning because students actively research a topic and prepare the information so that they can teach it to the class. This helps students learn their own topic even better and sometimes students learn and communicate better with their peers than their teachers.
* [[Gallery Walk]] is also an example of active learning where students in groups move around the classroom or workshop actively engaging in discussions and contributing to other groups and finally constructing knowledge on a topic and sharing it.

== Use of technology ==
{{see also|Technology-enhanced active learning}}
To have active learning experience, use of technology tools and multimedia helps enhance the atmosphere of the classroom. Each student actively engages in the learning process. Using movies and games the teacher can make the experience more effective. The theoretical foundation of this learning process are :
#'''Flow:''' Flow is a concept to enhance the focus level of the student as each and every individual becomes aware and completely involved in the learning atmosphere. In accordance with one's own capability and potential, through self-awareness, students perform the task at hand. The first methodology to measure flow was Csikszentmihalyi's Experience Sampling (ESM). 
#'''Learning Styles:''' Acquiring knowledge through one's own technique is called learning style. Learning occurs in accordance with one's own potential as every child is different and has potential in different areas. It caters to all kinds of learners: visual, kinaesthetic, cognitive and affective. {{Dubious | Reference_to_'Learning_styles'_needs_a_health_warning|date=January 2018}} 
# '''Locus of Control:''' Ones with high internal locus of control believe that every situation or event is attributable to their resources and behavior. Ones with high external locus of control believe that nothing is under their control.
#'''Intrinsic Motivation:''' Intrinsic motivation is a factor that deals with self-perception about the task at hand. Interest, attitude, and results depend on the self-perception of the given activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karahocaa |display-authors=etal|title=Computer assisted active learning system development for critical thinking in history of civilization|journal=Cypriot Journal of Educational Sciences|date=2010|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research evidence==

Numerous studies have shown evidence to support active learning, given adequate prior instruction.

A meta-analysis of 225 studies comparing traditional lecture to active learning in university math, science, and engineering courses found that active learning reduces failure rates from 32% to 21%, and increases student performance on course assessments and concept inventories by 0.47 standard deviations. Because the findings were so robust with regard to study methodology, extent of controls, and subject matter, the National Academy of Science publication suggests that it might be unethical to continue to use traditional lecture approach as a control group in such studies. The largest positive effects were seen in class sizes under 50 students and among students under-represented in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, S. et al. (2014). Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Scientists, 111(23), 8410–8415. https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319030111&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Hake (1998) reviewed data from over 6000 physics students in 62 introductory physics courses and found that students in classes that utilized active learning and interactive engagement techniques improved 25 [[percent points]], achieving an average gain of 48% on a standard test of physics conceptual knowledge, the Force [[Concept inventory|Concept Inventory]], compared to a gain of 23% for students in traditional, lecture-based courses.&lt;ref&gt;Hake, R. R. (1998). Interactive-engagement versus traditional methods: A six-thousand-student survey of mechanics test data for introductory physics courses. American Journal of Physics, 66, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Hoellwarth &amp; Moelter (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Hoellwarth, C., &amp; Moelter, M. J. (2011). The implications of a robust curriculum in introductory mechanics. American Journal of Physics, 79, 540.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that when instructors switched their physics classes from traditional instruction to active learning, student learning improved 38 percent points, from around 12% to over 50%, as measured by the Force Concept Inventory, which has become the standard measure of student learning in physics courses.

In "Does Active Learning Work? A Review of the Research", Prince (2004) found that "there is broad but uneven support for the core elements of active, collaborative,
cooperative and [[problem-based learning]]" in engineering education.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, M. (2004). Does active learning work? A review of the research. Journal of engineering education, 93(3), 223-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Michael, J. (2006). Where's the evidence that active learning works?. Advances in Physiology Education, 30(4), 159-167.&lt;/ref&gt; in reviewing the applicability of active learning to physiology education, found a "growing body of research within specific scientific teaching communities that supports and validates the new approaches to teaching that have been adopted."

In a 2012 report titled "Engage to Excel",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_feb.pdf President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. (2012). Engage to excel: Producing on million additional college graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Retrieved from whitehouse.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] (PCAST) described how improved teaching methods, including engaging students in active learning, will increase student retention and improve performance in [[STEM fields|STEM]] courses.  One study described in the report found that students in traditional lecture courses were twice as likely to leave engineering and three times as likely to drop out of college entirely compared with students taught using active learning techniques.  In another cited study, students in a physics class that used active learning methods learned twice as much as those taught in a traditional class, as measured by test results.

Active learning has been implemented in large lectures and it has been shown that both domestic and International students perceive a wide array of benefits. In a recent study, broad improvements were shown in student engagement and understanding of unit material among international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.3127/ajis.v22i0.1334|title = Do International Students Appreciate Active Learning in Lectures?|journal = Australasian Journal of Information Systems|volume = 22|year = 2018|last1 = Marrone|first1 = Mauricio|last2 = Taylor|first2 = Murray|last3 = Hammerle|first3 = Mara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.]]
An '''archivist''' (''AR-kiv-ist'') is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to [[Document|record]]s and [[archive]]s determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound and/or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.

==Description==
As [[Richard Pearce-Moses]] wrote:

:"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Moses, Richard. "Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?" ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives: A How-to-do-it Manual|last=Hunter|first=Gregory|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.|others=|year=2003|isbn=|editor=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory and scholarly work underpinning [[archive]]s practices is called [[archival science]].

The most common related occupations are [[librarian]]s, [[Curator|museum curators]], and [[records manager]]s. The archivist occupation is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate [[Professional association|professional organization]]s. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the [[metadata]], such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on [[provenance]]).

In addition, because archival records are frequently unique, some archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this regard, some would argue the archivist may have more in common with the [[Curator|museum curator]] than with the librarian.

The occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of [[records manager]], although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.

==Duties and work environment==
Archivists' duties include acquiring and [[archival appraisal|appraising]] new collections, [[manuscript processing|arranging and describing records]], providing reference service, and preserving materials.  In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: [[provenance]] and [[original order]].  Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of ''[[respect des fonds]]'', which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.

There are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, [[finding aid]]s need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Kathleen D.|title=Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts|year=2005|publisher=Society of American Archivists|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://saa.archivists.org/store/understanding-archives-and-manuscripts-afs-ii/339/|title=Understanding Archives and Manuscripts|last=O'Toole|first=James M. and Richard J. Cox|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=|year=2006|isbn=|editor=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists' work encompasses a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a [[Primary sources|primary source]] of knowledge, and influence [[collective memory]] and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, Elena S. (2010). ''The Ethical Archivist''. Chicago: The Society of American Archivists. p. 22-26, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielson (2010), chapter 1, "Codes of Ethics," p. 21-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of American Archivists first adopted a [https://www2.archivists.org/groups/committee-on-ethics-and-professional-conduct/code-of-ethics-history code of ethics] in 1980;&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;Horn, David E (1989). "[http://americanarchivist.org/doi/abs/10.17723/aarc.52.1.nk661527341j0610 The Development of Ethics in Archival Practice]." ''The American Archivist'', 2(1), p. 64-71. It was based on an earlier statement produced in training programs at the National Archives, under Archivist of the United States [[Wayne C. Grover]], and published as "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015071393535;view=image;page=root;size=100;seq=713;num=307 The Archivist's Code]" (''American Archivist'', vol. 18, no. 4, p. 307-308).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Council on Archives]] adopted one in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 ICA Code of Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929074919/http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 |date=29 September 2015 }}." International Council on Archives. Retrieved 2015-09-01. The ICA code is available in 23 languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist's job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as [[Manuscript processing|processing archivist]] and [[Reference interview|reference archivist]]) may be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Frances|date=|year=2000|title=Reference Service in an Academic Archives|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/science/article/pii/S0099133399001470|journal=The [[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=110–118|doi=10.1016/S0099-1333(99)00147-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists work for a variety of organizations, including [[government agency|government agencies]], [[local authorities]], museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, [[colleges]] and universities, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, [[genealogist]]s, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an [[individual]].

Archivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or [[outreach]] programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]], [[Advertising campaign|promotional]] events, or even media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/guidelines/cu_guidelines4.asp|title=Guidelines for College and University Archives, Section IV. Core Archival Functions, Subsection D. Service |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Encoded Archival Description]], along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade.  Many archivists are now acquiring basic [[XML]] skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml|title=Encoded Archival Description |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Archives Hub| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125702/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml| archivedate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Between_the_Forks_Exhibit.JPG|right|thumb|An Archivist and volunteer worker with an exhibit on local history.  Project management, preservation of historic materials, and research skills are just a few of the abilities required in an archivist's background to make such public education efforts effective and exciting. {{speedy-image-c|22 April 2007}}]] --&gt;

Because of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of [[skills]]:
* Those who work in reference and access-oriented positions should have good customer services skills, to help patrons with their research.
* A basic knowledge of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|conservation]] is needed to help extend the life of cultural artifacts. Many types of media (such as photographs, acidic papers, and unstable copy processes) can deteriorate if not stored and maintained properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Mary Lynn | last=Ritzenthaler | year=1993 | title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=Society of American Archivists | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although many archival collections consist solely of paper records, increasingly archivists must confront the new challenges posed by the [[digital preservation|preservation]] of electronic records, so they need to be forward-looking and technologically proficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|accessdate=3 April 2007 |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational preparation==
The educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.

===Australia===
The [[Australian Society of Archivists]] is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/accredited-courses|title=Accredited courses|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first University to offer archival training was the [[University of New South Wales]], starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.

Courses are now offered at [[Curtin University]] in [[Western Australia]], [[Charles Sturt University]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Monash University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[University of South Australia]] at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at [[Edith Cowan University]] is being phased out.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Courses are offered in a variety of modes, including online via [[Open University Australia]] and through a combination of online and internal units at the various universities.

===Brazil===
The profession has been regulated since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/1970-1979/L6546.htm|title=L6546|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities in Brazil, such as the University of Brasilian (UnB), the [[Federal University of Santa Catarina]] (UFSC), the [[Federal University of Santa Maria]] (UFSM) and the [[São Paulo State University]] (UNESP) offer the degree in [[archival science]].

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the [[Universidad de La Salle]] offers the degree of Professional in Information Systems, Library and Archival Sciences. It is a vocational training program, within existing legal standards aimed at providing knowledge, skills and abilities required for the design and management of information systems and documentation of various sorts. Its projection for the future is based on the application of new information technologies and communications for the management of information services economically viable. The program was created in 1971.

Other institutions that offers a degree in Archival Science are:
* [[Universidad del Quindío]] – Professional degree: Professional in Information and Documentation, Library and Archival Sciences.
* [[Universidad de Antioquia, Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Archival Science.
* [[Universidad Católica de Manizales]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.
* [[Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje]] – SENA – in chain training with the [[Antioquia Institute of Technology|Tecnológico de Antioquia]] Tecnológico de Antioquia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042453/http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Technical degree: Professional Technical in Archives, Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.

===France===
In France, the oldest Archivist School is the ''[[École des chartes]]'', founded in 1821. This prestigious ''[[grande école]]'' (literally, "grand schools) offers a diploma in "Archivist-Paleography" after a three-year curriculum. A part of its alumni pursue a State archivist career after an 18-month formation at the ''[[Institut national du patrimoine]]''. Most positions are reserved for European citizens.

Some universities offer master's degree in Archival Science: [[University of Angers|Angers]], [[University of Caen|Caen]], [[University of Dijon|Dijon]], [[Charles de Gaulle University - Lille III|Lille III]], [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3|Lyon III]], [[Upper Alsace University|Mulhouse]], [[Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University|Versailles Saint-Quentin]],

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the [[University College Dublin School of History and Archives]] offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, recognised by the Society of Archivists.

===New Zealand===
[[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only tertiary institution in [[New Zealand]] provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by [[Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia]]. Open Polytechnic of New Zealand provides undergraduate archival courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there are currently five full- or part-time postgraduate courses in archives administration or management which are recognised by the [[Archives and Records Association]] (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary [[work experience]] before obtaining a place on the UK courses; many undertake a year's traineeship. Also, professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.

===United States===
The most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in [[archival science]], [[public history]], history, [[library science]], or [[library and information science]]. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakel and Bastian |first=Elizabeth and Jeannette |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Archival Graduate Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=349–366 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/YakelBastian-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Society of American Archivists]] published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp#_ftn1 |title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies |accessdate=30 March 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406075051/http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SAA Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics |accessdate=2015-09-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|url=http://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

The [[Academy of Certified Archivists]] offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Certified Archivists|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317200502/http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/| archivedate= 17 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/about-us/presidents-address-2/|title=2016 President’s Address {{!}} Welcome to the Academy of Certified Archivists|last=Jones|first=Louis|date=|website=www.certifiedarchivists.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations and continuing education==
Many archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the [[Society of American Archivists]], the [[Association of Canadian Archivists]], the [[Archives and Records Association]] (UK/Ireland), the [[Colombian College of Archivists - CCA]], and the [[Australian Society of Archivists]], as well as any number of local or regional associations.  These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners.   In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of [[media preservation]] and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist's job in order to stay current in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmelman |first=Nancy |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Continuing Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=367–395 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Zimmelman-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the profession==
The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen's manuals of 1571.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest predecessors of archival science - Jacob von Rammingen's two manuals of registry and archival management, printed in 1571, translated by JBLD Strömberg.

Sandri, 'Il "De Archivis" di Baldassare Bonifacio', ''Notizie delle Archive di Stato'', Roma, 1950, p. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled ''Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques'' (''Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives''), in which he systematized the archival theory of the ''[[respect des fonds]]'', first published by [[Natalis de Wailly]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;F. Hildesheimer, "Les Premières publications des Archives", ''Histoires de France, historiens de la France'', Paris, 1994, p. 280-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the ''Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven'' (''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives''). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving [[provenance]] and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.&lt;ref name=Cook1997&gt;{{Citation

The next major text was the ''Manual of Archive Administration'' published in 1922 by [[Hilary Jenkinson]], then employed at the British [[Public Record Office]]: a revised edition appeared in 1937. In this work, Jenkinson states that archives are evidence and that the moral and physical defence of this evidential value is the central tenet of archival work. He further outlines his ideas of what an archive should be and how it should operate.

In 1956, [[T. R. Schellenberg]], who is known as the "Father of American Archival Appraisal",&lt;ref name=Cook1997/&gt; published ''Modern Archives''. Schellenberg's work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson's organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg's methods, especially in the United States of America, modern [[Records Management]] as a separate but related discipline was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Theodore R. | last=Schellenberg | year=1956 | title=Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Ernst Posner]] published ''Archives in the Ancient World''.  Posner's work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history.

In 1975, essays by [[Margaret C. Norton|Margaret Cross Norton]] were collected under the title of ''Norton on Archives: The Writings of Margaret Cross Norton on Archival and Records Management''. Norton was one of the founders of the [[Society of American Archivists]], and wrote essays based on her decades of experience working in the [[Illinois]] State Archives.

==Archives 2.0==

Archivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as blogs, [[wiki]]s, as well as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open source]] philosophies. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theimer|first=Kate|date=2011|title=What is the Meaning of Archives 2.0?|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.1.h7tn4m4027407666|journal=The American Archivist|volume=74|pages=58–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.

* "Open, not closed;
* Transparent, not opaque;
* User centered, not record centered;
* Facilitator, not gatekeeper;
* Attracting new users, not relying on users to find them;
* Shared standards, not localized practice;
* Metrics and measurement, not 'unmeasurable' results;
* Iterative products, not 'perfect' products;
* Innovation and flexibility, not adhering to tradition;
* Technology savvy, not technology phobic;
* Value doing, not knowing;
* Confident about lobbying for resources, not hesitant beggars."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; community use, or research and reference help.

The '''casebook method''', similar to but not exactly the same as the [[case method]], is the primary method of teaching [[law]] in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].  It was pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]].  It is based on the principle that rather than studying highly abstract summaries of legal rules (the technique used in most countries), the best way to learn [[Law of the United States|American law]] is to read the actual judicial [[opinion]]s which become the law under the rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (due to its Anglo-American [[common law]] origin).

==History and technique==
To set up the case method of law study, American law [[professor]]s traditionally collect the most illustrative cases concerning a particular area of the law in special textbooks called [[casebook]]s.  Some professors heavily edit cases down to the most important paragraphs, while deleting nearly all citations and paraphrasing everything else; a few present all cases in full, and most others are in between.  One common technique is to provide almost all of the entire text of a landmark case which created an important legal rule, followed by brief notes summarizing the holdings of other cases which further refined the rule.  
  
Traditionally, the casebook method is coupled with the [[Socratic method]] in American law schools.  For a given class, a professor will assign several cases from the casebook to read, and may also require students to be familiar with any notes following those cases.  In class, the professor will ask students questions about the assigned cases to determine whether they identified and understood the correct rule from the case, if there is one—in certain heavily contested areas of the law, there will ''not'' be any ''one'' correct rule.

A typical example in the law of contracts is ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today.  Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) consequential damages are limited to those foreseen by the parties at the time of contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover consequential damages if the other breaches.  Thus stated, ''Hadley'' seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will ''never'' say that.  Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision.

This teaching method differs in two ways from the teaching methods used in most other academic programs: (1) it requires students to work almost exclusively with primary source material, which can be written in obscure or obsolete language for older cases; and (2) a typical American law school class is supposed to be a dialogue about the meaning of a case, not a straightforward lecture.

In some law schools, the casebook method is used in conjunction with lectures or other more structured forms of instruction.  This is especially true in classes which are more heavily geared toward [[statutory law]], such as [[tax law]] (which in the USA is governed by the [[Internal Revenue Code]]) and certain areas of [[commercial law]] (particularly courses dealing with the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]).

This method is also used in other [[common law]] countries, including [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

===Law school outlines===
To facilitate the case method of study, "law school outlines" are used as legal topic [[study aid]]s. Typically, the outlines are created by [[law school]] students; however, there are professional outlines also available.  An outline typically provides a concise and direct statement of legal issues in a particular area of [[law]], organized according to the typical law school [[curriculum]]. In some cases, outlines are organized according to specific professors or courses. Outlines often remove many legal nuances and fact specific distinctions in [[case law]] to establish more generalized legal principles.  Students must remember to be cautious before relying on outlines written by others found on online databases.  They frequently come with copyright notices and may often be outdated.  Many such sites also warn their users that relying on these outlines alone will not be sufficient to prepare for an exam and they should only be used as a supplement to the studying process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">The '''Center of Molecular Immunology''' ('''Centro de Inmunología Molecular''') or '''CIM''', is a [[cancer]] research institution located on the west side of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. {{Coord|23.0755|-82.4708}} Opened on December 5, 1994, it focuses on the research and production of new [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the treatment of cancer and other nontransmissible diseases.

==Facilities==
The design and construction of the Center of Molecular Immunology  was modeled on current [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] guidelines recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] and adopted by Cuba, particularly those also adopted by the member countries of the European Union, then known as the European Community.

Research labs, production areas and administrative offices share the 15,000 square meters of the two floor facility.

Approximately 800 employees work at the CIM, most of them scientists and engineers. These personnel are administratively organized in three main areas: Research and Development, Production, and Quality Assurance.

==Research==
Basic research projects are focused on [[cancer immunotherapy]], especially the development of molecular vaccines. These include [[antibody]] engineering, cellular engineering, [[bioinformatics]] and regulation of the [[immune response]].

CIM conducts clinical trials in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy of varying origin, as well as other immune system diseases, in highly specialized hospitals.

In August 2011 it was announced that the Center of Molecular Immunology released [[CimaVax-EGF]], the first therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]] for [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-09/cuba-releases-worlds-first-lung-cancer-vaccine|title=Cuba Announces Release of the World's First Lung Cancer Vaccine|publisher=PopSci|date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, a new therapeutic cancer vaccine was approved by Cuban regulatory agency. CIMAbid (racotumomab or 1E10)obtained conditional approval for the treatment of lung cancer. This vaccine is an antiidiotypic vaccine targeting N-glicolil GM3, a tumor specific antigen. The project leader was Dr Ana María Vazquez. These vaccine has been associated with statistically significant extension of survival of lung cancer patients  with excellent safety profile and continues to be investigated in confirmatory clinical trials. {{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Products==

Today CIM produces biopharmaceutical products, such as anti-CD3 [[monoclonal antibody]] for the treatment of patients with organ [[transplant rejection]], human recombinant [[erythropoietin]] for the treatment of [[anemia]], [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] for the treatment of [[neutropenia]], and a humanized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the epidermal growth factor receptor for cancer treatment, as well as other monoclonal antibodies for [[tumor]] imaging.

==Commercialization==

Since 1992 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] has been devoted to the commercialization of [[biopharmaceutical]] products for the [[Cuba]]n market and abroad, especially [[monoclonal antibodies]] and other recombinant proteins for the diagnosis and treatment of [[cancer]] and other diseases related to the [[immune system]].

[https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235944/http://www.cimab-sa.com/ CIMAB S.A.] is the exclusive representative for the commercialization of the products and services of the Center of Molecular Immunology.

It was announced in July 2008 that CIM had also received approval from the Cuban regulatory authorities for a lung cancer vaccine, targeting EGFR.  The vaccine has been in development since 1992 and the project led by Gisela Gonzalez.

Established in 1981, it organizes China's scientific program for both the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]], and it provides logistic support to Antarctic expeditions. There are several; divisions, including General Affairs, Operation &amp; Logistics, Science Programs, International Cooperation, representation in the Chinese Embassy in [[Chile]], and a Winter Training Base.&lt;ref name="BriefIntroduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinare.gov.cn/en/index.html?pid=about|title=A Brief Introduction to CAA|work=chinare.gov.cn|accessdate=27 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307224446/http://www.chinare.gov.cn/en/index.html?pid=about|archivedate=7 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director is [[Qu Tanzhou]].&lt;ref name="chinadaily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-05/06/content_9814100.htm|title=Arctic research set to be beefed up|last=Qian|first=Wang|date=2010-05-06|work=[[China Daily]]|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAA organizes, coordinates and supervises China's polar program.  As such, its responsibilities include: developing an integrated national polar research strategy, developing policy to guide national polar research activities, developing a five-year plan which coordinates the national policy, updating the national polar plan on an annual basis, coordinating the annual national polar research expedition, promoting coordination of polar research programs with other agencies, and supporting polar research cooperation with other nations and international organizations.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAntarctic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riffenburgh|first=Beau |title=Encyclopedia of the Antarctic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRJtB2MNdJMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=Chinese+Arctic+and+Antarctic+Administration&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZTtOTMalFI_CsAOb39EL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20Arctic%20and%20Antarctic%20Administration&amp;f=false|volume=1|year=2007 |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-415-97024-5|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAA is affiliated with the [[International Arctic Research Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/gmap/|title=IARC International Collaborations, Partners, and Related Organizations|date=2009-02-13|work=iarc.uaf.edu|publisher=IARC, University of Alaska, Fairbanks|accessdate=27 July 2010|location=Fairbanks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515143417/http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/gmap/|archivedate=15 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the [[International Arctic Science Committee]].

==Projects==
A 2006 ''[[Shanghai Daily]]'' news report stated that Chinese scientists would begin naming 46 newly surveyed, anonymous Antarctic islands and that the CAA, with its teammate [[Sina.com]], would collect candidate names.&lt;ref name="ChinaEntersIceAge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/eyeonasia/archives/2006/04/china_enters_the_ice_age.html|title=China enters the Ice Age|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|date=2006-04-03|work=[[Business Week]]|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2009, the CAA organized a government sponsored research project to enhance its understanding of the legal, military and political issues associated with the Arctic. The agency also operates a winter training base at [[Yabuli Ski Resort]] in the northern province of [[Heilongjiang]].&lt;ref name="BriefIntroduction"/&gt;

The [[International Polar Year]] 2007-2008 China Programme included a partnership between the [[International Polar Foundation]], the CCA, and the [[Polar Research Institute of China]]. This included the participation of Jean de Pomereu, reporter and photographer, in the 25th CHINARE Expedition late in the year in 2008.  He traveled aboard the Chinese [[icebreaker]], [[MV Xue Long|Xuelong]]  ("Snow Dragon"), then reported from China's east Antarctic research station, [[Antarctic Zhongshan Station]].&lt;ref name="polarfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polarfoundation.org/projects/project_detail/panda_dome_a_station_25th_chinese_antarctic_expedition/|title=PANDA &amp; Dome A station: 25th Chinese Antarctic Expedition|work=polarfoundation.org|accessdate=28 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222001358/http://www.polarfoundation.org/projects/project_detail/panda_dome_a_station_25th_chinese_antarctic_expedition/|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition team sent by the CAA was also entrusted with starting construction of the [[Antarctic Kunlun Station]], China's third Antarctic station.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090106/full/457134a.html|title=China builds inland Antarctic base|last=Qiu|first=Jane|date=2009-01-06|work=[[Nature News]]|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xuelong'', China's only polar research icebreaker was purchased in 1993 from [[Ukraine]], and has made 24 research expeditions to the Antarctic and three to the Arctic. In 2009, the CAA began planning for a Chinese-built icebreaker due to China's expanding polar exploration activities.&lt;ref name="barentsobserver"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.barentsobserver.com/china-to-boost-arctic-research.4781463.html|title=China to boost Arctic research|date=2010-05-06|work=barentsobserver.com|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship, named {{MV|Xue Long 2}}, was laid down in 2016 and is expected to enter service in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-10/10/c_136669892.htm | title=First Chinese-built polar icebreaker gets name | publisher=Xinhua | date=10 October 2017 | accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64173">'''Research networking''' ('''RN''') is about using tools to identify, locate and use research and scholarly information about people and resources. '''Research networking tools''' ('''RN tools''') serve as [[knowledge management]] systems for the research enterprise. RN tools connect institution-level/enterprise systems, national research networks, publicly available research data (e.g., grants and publications), and restricted/proprietary data by harvesting information from disparate sources into compiled profiles for faculty, investigators, scholars, clinicians, community partners and facilities. RN tools facilitate collaboration and team science to address research challenges through the rapid discovery and recommendation of researchers, expertise and resources.&lt;ref name="F1000VIVO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istl.org/11-spring/article1.html|title=Faculty of 1000 and VIVO:  Invisible Colleges and Team Science - Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship|website=www.istl.org|access-date=2018-07-14|last=Carey |first=J |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fazel-Zarandi M, Devlin HJ, Huang Y and Contractor N (2011). "Expert recommendation based on social drivers, social network analysis, and semantic data representation". ''2nd International Workshop on Information Heterogeneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems''. pp. 41-48. (ACM, Chicago, IL)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
RN tools differ from [[Web search engine|search engines]] such as in that they access information in databases and other data not limited to web pages. They also differ from [[Social networking service|social networking]] systems in that they represent a compendium of data ingested from authoritative and verifiable sources rather than predominantly individually-posted information, making RN tools more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gewin | first1 = V |date =15 December 2010 | title = Collaboration: Social networking seeks critical mass | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7326/full/nj7326-993a.html | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue =7326 | pages = 993–4 |doi=10.1038/nj7326-993a }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, RN tools have sufficient flexibility to allow for profile editing.  RN tools provide resources to bolster human connections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Contractor | first1 = NS | last2 = Monge | first2 = PR |date=November 2002 | title = Managing knowledge networks | url =http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/16/2/249.extract | journal = Management Communication Quarterly | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–58  |doi=10.1177/089331802237238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they can make non-intuitive matches, do not depend on serendipity and do not have a propensity to return only to previously identified collaborations/collaborators.  RN tools generally have associated analytical capabilities that enable evaluation of collaboration and cross-disciplinary research/scholarly activity, especially over time. 

RN tools and research profiling systems can help researchers gain recognition. Active promotion of scholarship is an aspect of the publication cycle. Commercial and non-profit services help researchers increase visibility and recognition. Digital researcher services enhance discoverability, shareability and citability of scholarship. According to Shanks and Arlitsch,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanks|first=Justin|last2=Arlitsch|first2=Kenning|date=2016-04-02|title=Making Sense of Researcher Services|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01930826.2016.1146534|journal=Journal of Library Administration|volume=56|issue=3|pages=295–316|doi=10.1080/01930826.2016.1146534|issn=0193-0826}}&lt;/ref&gt; digital researcher services fall into three categories: 

* Author/Researcher Identification—these services provide infrastructure that may be used in the other two categories, such as unique identifiers and name disambiguation.
* Academic and Professional Networking—most succinctly described as “social networking for academics,” these services focus on connecting users based on research interest, affiliation, geography or other variables.
* Reference and Citation Management—these tools and services include some of the functionality and features of other categories, although their primary focus is on management of citations that a researcher compiles for use within a publication or for sharing with other researchers.

Importantly, data harvested into RN tools can be repurposed, especially if available as [[Linked Open Data]] ([[RDF/XML|RDF]] triples). These RN tools enhance research support activities by providing data for customized, web pages, CV/biosketch generation and data tables for grant proposals.

A '''computational scientist''' is a person skilled in [[scientific computing]]. This person is usually a [[scientist]], an [[engineer]], or an applied mathematician who applies [[high-performance computing|high-performance computers]] in different ways to advance the state-of-the-art in their respective applied disciplines; [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[social sciences]] and so forth. Thus scientific computing has increasingly influenced many areas such as economics, biology, law and medicine to name a few.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15983">The '''conservation and restoration of bone, horn, and antler objects''' is the preservation of objects made from or containing these organic materials by preventative methods and treatments. Because these materials are both versatile and durable, they have been used throughout history for various tools and/or ornamentation including clothing, jewelry, and decorative art. These objects can be found in personal collections as well as cultural institutions and their collections.

==Identification and composition==

Many museums contain objects in their collection that are made of bone, antler or horn. One of the most important steps in the conservation of these objects is determining which material it is.

===Bone===
Bone, which has a very similar chemical make-up to [[ivory]], consists of inorganic materials which provide strength and rigidity and organic components that provide the capacity for growth and repair. Unlike ivory which has no marrow or blood vessel system, bone has a spongy central portion of marrow from which extend tiny blood vessels.&lt;ref name="CCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone is also made of both mineral and carbon-based materials; the mineral-based are [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], and [[fluoride]]; the carbon-based is the [[protein]] ossein.&lt;ref name="MHS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Bone comes from many different animals, including mammals, birds, and fish, and can come in many shapes and sizes. It can be used in its natural form, can be polished with sand and other abrasives to create a smooth and glossy surface, or can be treated with a burning process which leaves it a blue-black to whitish gray color.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt; 

Bones have been used to create numerous objects throughout history, from tools such as hammers and fishhooks to weapons such spear, arrow, and harpoon points to pendants, hairpins, gaming pieces, musical instruments and ceremonial objects.&lt;ref name="CMNH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthropology: Bone, Antler, and Tooth Artifacts|url=http://www.carnegiemnh.org/science/default.aspx?id=16600|website=Carnegie Museum of Natural History|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antler===
Antler, a modified form of bone, grows out of the skull bones of certain species of animals and is shed once a year.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt; It consists of a thick layer of compact bone, an inner section of spongy bone, and internal blood vessels that are less and more irregular than the ones present in bone. It is also denser and heavier.&lt;ref name="CCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antler also differs from bone in its external appearance. Skeletal bone is usually smooth except for areas of attachment, while the surface of larger antlers generally has raised bumps and protrusions. 

Similar to bone, antler can be used in its natural form, can be polished with abrasives for a glossy surface, and can be treated with a burned process for a charred finish and color.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt; Antler has been used for numerous objects throughout history including tools such as hammer batons, pressure flakers, and conical arrow points.&lt;ref name="OSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bone Tools|url=http://archaeology.uiowa.edu/bone-tools-0|website=The Office of the State Archaeologist|publisher=The University of Iowa|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horn===
Horn is the outer covering of a bony outgrowth on an animal's skull. It consists of a mass of very hard, hair-like filaments cemented together around a spongy internal core.&lt;ref name="CCI" /&gt; This layering effect continues to grow over time, resulting in a cone-within-cone structure. Unlike antlers, horns are permanent and not seasonally shed. Another distinguishing factor from bone and antler is the fine parallel lines that are present in the surface of the horn. Horn comes in a great variety of sizes and colors, including white,  green, red, brown, and black.&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Horn|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Horn|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Horn can be used in its natural state, boiled, cut, molded to other shapes, or used in flat sheets.&lt;ref name="CCI" /&gt; It has been used for a variety of objects including ceremonial decorations, utensils such as spoons and containers, gaming pieces, and combs.&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt;

==Processing==

In general, the same preparation process can be applied to bone, horn, and antler for conversion into usable materials for tools or ornamentation.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;

* Detaching, or separating the bone, antler, or horn from the muscles and connective tissue of the animal, is the first step.
* Cleaning, the second step, involves removing the blood, marrow and cells from the interior.
* Drying in a slow process to avoid cracking and splitting is the third.
* Working the bone, antler, or horn into the desired shape and finish is the final step. These methods include cutting with stone or metal tools, polishing with abrasives, burning, and/or decorating with pigments such as [[ochre]] or [[charcoal]].

==Types of deterioration==
There are numerous causes for the deterioration of bone, antler, and horn.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;

These causes include:
* Extreme dryness
* Excess heat, which leads to the destruction of the protein portion and loss of moisture, resulting in shrinkage and surface cracking
* Excess moisture, which leads to the swelling of the protein portion and promotes mold growth
* A combination of both excess heat and moisture can lead to the destruction of ossein, resulting in warping and cracking as the materials dry out.
* Pests such as rodents, which may chew and attack these materials, especially bone
* Acids
* Exposure to strong visible and ultraviolet light, which may bleach the natural color of these materials

==Preventative conservation==

===Handling===
Like any museum objects, the handling of bone, antler, and horn should be conducted in a manner conducive to maintaining the health of the object. These items can be handled with bare hands that are clean and dry. However, body oils can stain the surface of these materials, especially because of their matte, porous surface texture, or those that are light in color. Wearing cotton or latex gloves is one way to prevent the transition of these harmful oils.

Items that contain bone, antler, or horn should always be lifted and moved in a manner that is fully supportive and does not place unnecessary stress on weak areas or attachment points; using an acid-free tray is highly recommended.&lt;ref name="MHS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These objects can  be protected further by being wrapped in unbuffered, acid-free tissue paper and/or placed in a sealed [[polyethylene]] bag when being transported.&lt;ref name="CCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Care of Ivory, Bone, Horn, and Antler|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170216|website=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic cleaning===
When objects are in good condition, normal surface dirt and grime is removed safely in a few different ways. One way is by using a soft brush to lightly dust the object, dislodging dust and debris.&lt;ref name="CCI" /&gt; To remove surface dust, a variable speed vacuum, soft lint-free cloths, vinyl eraser crumbs, volcanized rubber sponges, and micro-attachments may be used.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;

If dusting alone is not enough, smooth materials are then cleaned with water and mild soap. A cotton swab is used to apply a soapy solution sparingly. The surface can not remain damp longer than a few seconds and will immediately be dried with a soft tissue or another cotton swab. The same area will be cleaned again in the same manner to remove any soap film. If the surface is cracked or porous, water will not be applied. Bone should never be soaked.&lt;ref name="CCI" /&gt;

===Storage===
Bone, antler, and horn objects are stored in tightly closed display cases or drawers to buffer them from sudden changes in [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] while shielding them from dust and dirt. By storing them in the dark, these light-sensitive materials that are dyed or painted are protected. To prevent bumping and chipping, the storage drawers and shelves are lined with a chemically stable cushioning material such as [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]] sheeting, as opposed to a rubber-based material that can produce unnatural yellowing.&lt;ref name="CCI" /&gt; Items with holes, straps, appendages, etc. are never hung or supported by said attachments. Instead, they are stored with a support at the base of the item, and a support for the natural position of the handle or strap.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;

Proper storage also aids in the regulation of temperature, relative humidity, and safe illumination levels, which can have disastrous effects on these organic materials if they fluctuate. Bone, antler, and horn objects are never stored near radiators, heat pipes, outside windows, or incandescent lights, because these can cause excessive drying and temperature fluctuations.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt; 
* Temperature is kept as constant as possible, no greater than 68 degrees Fahrenheit with no fluctuations of more than +/- 3 degrees a day.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;
* Relative humidity is kept at a level between 30 percent (in the winter) and 55 percent (in the summer) with fluctuations of no more than 15 percent during each season.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;
* Illumination is kept below 150 lux, with the ultraviolet (UV) component restricted to 75. Dyed objects are extremely light-sensitive and being exposed to lux levels more than 50 is damaging. Maintaining low light levels and using lights that emit less radiant heat is an effective way to prevent damage. Shining direct bright light on tightly sealed storage units can reproduce high temperatures and high RH internally, putting the stored objects at risk.&lt;ref name="CCI" /&gt;

===Integrated pest management===
Although bone, antler, and horn are not particularly susceptible to insect damage, they can be damaged by rodent attacks and mold growth. Rodents and other small mammals can gnaw on the surface of these items, causing structural damage. Maintaining good housekeeping, following an IPM program, and holding regular pest control checks will help prevent a rodent infestation.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;

[[Mold]] can infest these organic objects when the relative humidity in storage and display areas exceeds 60 percent for extended periods of time. White or greenish fuzzy growth on the surface of these objects is an indicator of a mold infestation. Good ventilation and air circulation prevents mold as well as properly regulating relative humidity levels.&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;

==Display issues==

Preventive care can protect bone, antler, and horn objects from damaging elements, but objects on display are put at risk and therefore need to be carefully monitored. Maintaining proper temperature and relative humidity is important to protect the health of objects on display. Rotating bone, antler, and horn items on display on a set timeline prevents them from being exposed for extended periods of time. 
* Light damage: extended exposure to harmful light results in surface color being bleached and excessive drying. Consulting a [[conservator-restorer|conservator]] or exhibition light specialist for proper exhibition lighting can help prevent this.&lt;ref name="MHS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* External supports: supports and mounts are fabricated from safe materials. Attaching items to mounts is done with padded wires or flat acyclic plastic clips. Metals in direct contact with these organic objects cause damage; fats that may remain in these organic items react with the metals, forming corrosion. The use of adhesive mounts is avoided.&lt;ref name="MHS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventive conservation==
When issues arise in objects made of bone, antler, or horn that need extensive treatment, a conservator should be consulted. Some treatments include the following.

===Intensive cleaning===
* Removal of surface dirt: when minimal dusting and maintenance are not successful in removing surface dust, a conservator may perform more intensive cleaning, using water and a safe cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Donny|title=Methods of Conserving Archaeological Material from Underwater Sites|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/CRL/conservationmanual/ConservationManual.pdf|publisher=Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Removal of soluble salts: organic materials from a salty environment will invariably absorb soluble salts that will crystallize as the object dries. Salt crystallization will cause surface flaking and may result in irreversible damage. [[Conservators]] will remove the soluble salt to make the object stable by using water with certain levels of chloride and ionization, only if the object is structurally sound. If the object is not structurally sound, an Acryloid B-72/water solution will be used.
* Removal of insoluble salts and stains: to remove insoluble salts and stains, conservators either use a mechanical method with picks and other tools, or a chemical treatment.

===Harmful conservation treatments===
When addressing minor repairs and minimal cleaning of objects containing bone, antler, or horn, there are some methods/products that are avoided.&lt;ref name="MHS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bone, Antler, Ivory, and Teeth|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-bone..._000.pdf|website=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Liquid-base cleaners or detergents used to clean surface dirt and dust can damage the objects.
* Over-the-counter adhesives used to repair cracks and breaks can stain and become brittle over time. It is important to note that cracks and breaks in these organic materials can be indicators and evidence of an object's use and history, and therefore should not be addressed unless the health of the object is in danger. 
* Wax or other protective coating used to make repairs can obscure surface details, cause discoloring of the surface and are often impossible to remove without causing further damage.

Always consult a conservator before progressing with a treatment.

The '''conservation and restoration of photographic plates''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[photographic plates]] in order to preserve their materials and content. It covers the necessary measures that can be taken by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[curators]], [[Collection manager|collections managers]], and other museum professionals to conserve the material unique to photographic plate processes. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of photographic plates, as well as the [[preventive conservation]] and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|interventive conservation]] measures that can be taken to increase their longevity. 

__TOC__

==History==

===Composition===

The term [[photographic plates]] refers to a type of [[photograph]] that consists of an image bound to a [[glass]] support. Glass plates emerged as a common support medium for photographic negatives in the mid-nineteenth century. In general, [[Black and White Photography|black-and-white]] photographic negatives are made up of fine silver particles, (or color dyes for color negatives), which are embedded in a thin layer called a [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Combined with the image substance, these two elements make-up what is called the [[emulsion]]. This emulsion layer sits upon what is called the support, which can be paper, metal, film, or as in the case of photographic plates, [[glass]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of the photographic process, "fixing," is used to wash the silver particles that are not part of the image, which then produces a stable negative image. This negative image can then be used over many years to produce paper positives. Glass plates as a form of support were popular in use between 1851 and the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somerset Photography|title=Glass Negatives|url=http://www.somersetphotography.com/glass_negatives.htm|website=History of Photography|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processes===

[[File:Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady -1 (4984137358).jpg|thumb|Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady]]
* '''Collodion glass plate negative:''' This process was invented by the Englishman [[Frederick Scott Archer]] in 1851. While the first process to take advantage of glass plates was an [[albumen]], it was quite laborious and quickly surpassed by the [[collodion]] glass plate negative in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paris Photo|title=Collodion Glass Plate Negative|url=https://www.parisphoto.com/en/Glossary/Collodion-Glass-Plate-Negative/|website=Paris Photo|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collodion photographic process was a wet place process, which meant that the glass plate itself had to be wet while it was exposed and throughout processing. This required a portable darkroom to be taken wherever a photographer went in order to successfully produce a negative image. During the process, the collodion was the binder which was poured onto the glass plate before being exposed. The glass plate was then [[developed]], [[Fixer (photography)|fixed]], [[Washing (photography)|washed]], and protected with a [[varnish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Gelatin dry plate negative:''' This process was invented by [[Richard Leach Maddox]] in 1871, but it was not commonly used until 1878 when the process became commercially successful. Because of the advances this process made in photography, it soon replaced the [[wet plate process]] in the 1880s. The collodion binder formerly used was replaced by [[gelatin]] which already contained the light-sensitive silver salts. This meant that the emulsion was already present and did not have to be painted on the glass plate right before exposure - which now only took less than one second. Because of this advancement, photographers did not have to carry their portable darkroom, but could develop later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1878 when further improvements were made to the gelatin emulsion, gelatin glass plates began being mass produced by companies such as Wratten &amp; Wainright, Keystone Dry Plate Works, and notably the [[Eastman Dry Plate Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the advanced use and production of photographic glass plates until around 1925 and the development of the modern photography industry.

==Agents of deterioration== 

[[Photographic plates]] face certain challenges to their preservation. In order to protect against deterioration or damage, [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] seek to identify the agents that threaten the various materials that make-up photographic glass plates. The primary agents of deterioration include the following:

===Relative humidity &amp; temperature===

[[Relative humidity]] (RH) and [[temperature]] are two of the most serious threats to photographic plates and can determine their longevity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other cultural collections, an overall high temperature in combination with high humidity can lead to mold growth as well as attract [[pest (organism)|pest]]s. Heat is also a danger to collections because it is an element that accelerates any type of chemical deterioration that occurs, specifically in photographic materials. 

Photographic plates face significant structural and chemical challenges unique to their makeup - Fluctuations in RH can strain the adhesion of the [[gelatin]] to the glass plate as changes can cause the gelatin to expand and contract as well as cause [[emulsion]] to crack or separate along the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on a gelatin dry plate, high humidity can cause [[mold]] to grow on the emulsion and cause the plates to stick together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casella|first1=Luisa|title=Gelatin Dry-plate|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Gelatin_Dry-plate|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the relative humidity can cause deterioration of other elements as well such as the silver, [[varnish]], and glass support. Decreasing the RH will cause deterioration by leading to the flaking of the [[Binder (material)|binder]] and [[dehydration]] of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light===

Photographic plates, along with all photographic materials, are very sensitive to light. Extensive and ongoing exposure to light can cause significant deterioration that is irreversible. [[Sunlight]] is the most damaging type of light, but indoor lighting and any other [[UV light|UV lighting]] all pose a serious threat to photographic plates causing [[fading]] and [[yellowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Light]] is especially threatening to [[Color photography|color photographic materials]] since it accelerates the fading of the color dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon for photographic plates to be hand-painted in order to produce color images. Exposure to light of colored glass slides could deteriorate and lead to discoloration of the [[pigments]].

===Air pollution===

[[Air pollution]] can pose a threat to photographic plates through poor [[air quality]] and [[dirt]] that can damage the materials. This can include [[dust]], gaseous pollution from an urban environment, and dirt particulate. Air pollution can cause fading of photographic materials as well as damage the surface of the image by causing an [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]]. Other sources of air pollution include "photocopying machines, construction materials, paint fumes, cardboard, carpets, and janitorial supplies," as well as other types of outdated or obsolete media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material/chemical===

The glass composition of photographic plates can be a factor of deterioration. Due to poor quality or an [[Inherent_vice_(library_and_archival_science)|inherent vice]], "sick glass" can occur. Environmental conditions are usually linked to the increase or presence of this [[glass corrosion]]. The effect of "sick glass" can be weeping and [[crizzling]] which can be caused by excessive [[alkali]] present and a lack of [[stabilizers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeping involves droplets forming on the glass that appear as small crystals. This type of deterioration is especially threatening for cased photographs because the cover glass could be corroded and damage the photographic image underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McElhone|first1=John P.|title=Cased photographs: Including Daguerreotypes, Ambrotypes (Collodion Positives), and Tintypes|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Cased_Photographs|website=AIC Wiki|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion of the glass plate support can also damage the image layer by causing the lifting of the binder and varnish layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The other chemical components of glass plate negatives can also be threatening agents of deterioration. For instance, the silver image layer could possibly undergo [[Oxidation|oxidative deterioration]] which can lead to fading and discoloration. Additionally, the collodion binder itself is made up of [[cellulose nitrate]] which is known to be a flammable compound. While this is very dangerous as a film support, it is not thought to be as threatening in the binder. Most of these agents of deterioration are the result of poor chemical processing, but they are usually exacerbated by poor environmental and storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avdella, izgorena, 1905.jpg|thumb|Broken glass plate - Avdella, izgorena, 1905]]

===Physical===

Glass plates are rather stable dimensionally, but they are also very fragile and [[brittle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because glass is brittle, it is highly susceptible to [[breakage]], [[Fracture|cracks]], and [[fractures]]. This can be caused by human error including dropping or bumping the glass plate, or it can be caused by failure of storage equipment, housing, shelves, etc. which may lead to an impact to the glass. 

Types of breakage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Impact break - point of impact and surrounding radiating arcs
* Cracks - run perpendicular to applied stress
* Blind cracks - breaks do not carry through the whole shard of glass

Certain types of breakage and stress states affect the image layer and binder in different ways.

==Preventive conservation== 

===Environment===

Environmental controls are a crucial part of the preservation of photographic glass plates. [[Relative humidity]] (RH), [[temperature]], and [[light]] play a large role in keeping the multiple materials in photographic glass plates maintained. The following regulatory measures are taken for their preservation:

* For photographic glass plates, the temperature is kept cool at around 65°F approximately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* RH levels are normally kept between 30-40%. If RH goes below 30%, the image binder of the glass plate will [[dehydrate]]. If RH goes above 40%, the glass will begin [[hydrate|hydrating]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For cased glass plate photographs, such as [[ambrotypes]], RH levels are kept between 40-50% and temperature between 65-68°F. These levels differ because of the case and its risk for [[embrittlement]], [[brass]] mat, and glass deterioration. 
* Fluctuations, also called “cycling,” in RH and temperature are sought to be avoided. Environmental fluctuations can contribute to [[mold growth]], chemical deterioration including discoloration and [[yellowing]], as well as deterioration of the emulsion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photolea.html#Structure|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Photographic glass plates, especially [[Negative (photography)|negatives]], are preserved in dark enclosures due to their risk of deterioration when exposed to light, particularly [[UV light|UV]] and [[sunlight]]. If displayed, spot-lighting, which is uneven heating to the photographic plate, is avoided. Light levels are kept below 50 [[lux]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling===

Photographic glass plates are handled carefully to avoid physical or chemical deterioration and damage – the following aids in their preservation through proper handling: 

* To prevent fingerprints, non-vinyl plastic gloves are worn when handling – either [[Latex]] or [[Nitrile]]. [[Cotton]] gloves are not recommended by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] due to the possibility of glass easily slipping from the cotton material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When handling, a glass plate is not held by one edge or corner, rather it is held by two opposite edges and always with two hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When laying the glass plate on a flat surface, it is always placed with the [[emulsion]] side up. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glass plates are never stacked or have any pressure placed upon them.

===Storage=== 

Storage and housing of photographic glass plates is an important part of their preservation. [[Museums]] and other [[cultural institutions]] take the following measures to ensure their glass plates are properly housed: 

* Photographic glass plates are housed in four-flap enclosures, emulsion side up. These four-flap buffered enclosures prevent a glass plate from being pulled in and out and further deteriorating the image through flaking and [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasions]]. Rather, the four-flap enclosure allows the glass plate to be accessed by unfolding the flaps without having to pull the plate across any surface or material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The photographic glass plates are stored vertically on the long side of the plate in [[acid]]- and [[lignin]]-free storage boxes. The glass plates are not packed too tightly and are sought not to rub against each other. Each one is usually separated individually with stiffeners made of acid-free folder stock or acid-free cardboard in order to support the plates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photographic glass plates stored in a partially filled box will have spacers, most likely [[acid-free]] [[Corrugated fiberboard|corrugated]] [[paperboard]], inserted in order to prevent significant bumping or moving. 
* Glass plates that are larger than 10” x 12” are stored in legal size boxes that are partially filled to prevent a too heavy weight. The extra space in the box is filled with board or spacers to avoid shifting and jostling. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Storage boxes consisting of photographic glass plates are stored on a lower shelf, specifically below four feet. This helps to prevent someone from lifting them down from above his or her head. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each storage box of photographic glass plates is labeled with words such as “Heavy,” “Handle with Care,” “Caution: Contains Glass Negatives,” so that everyone knows to be extra careful when lifting the box off a shelf. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Storage of broken photographic plates====
 
Broken or cracked glass plates are stored in a special manner, separate from other photographic plates and in the following ways:

* Broken glass plates are not stacked but stored flat.
* Photographic glass plates that are cracked or have binder damage are stored on sink-mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with minor flaking are still housed in the four-flap enclosure that is labeled appropriately describing the damage. Glass plates with extensive flaking are stored on sink-mats horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Broken glass plate shards are often “sandwiched” in between two pieces of buffered board and then placed inside the four-flap enclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[American Institute for Conservation|AIC]] advises that form-fit support should be created for broken glass shards by cutting out two pieces of 4-ply [[mat board]] that fit to each shard. Then, these pieces are glued to each side of the buffered board with either [[wheat starch paste]] or 3M #415 double-stick tape. By placing each shard in between the form-fit support, this will help to prevent further damage. These broken shards are then placed in individual four-flap enclosures and stored flat with appropriate labeling that warns of their broken condition. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another method of storing broken shards is to place them on sink-mats. If this method is used, each piece is separated with paperboard spacers to prevent the pieces from touching. These paperboard spacers are sometimes attached with [[adhesives]] to the mat so that physical damage does not occur to the shards. They are stored horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance/housekeeping===

Maintenance/[[housekeeping]] of photographic plates requires minimal intervention: 

* For their preservation, light cleaning is carried out occasionally by removing dust with a soft brush. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] also keep the surrounding collections area clean of [[dust]], [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, and any other debris that may attract pests. Also, food and drink is not permitted in the storage area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|title=Caring for Your Treasures|url=https://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/photographs#.WsLQ8MPwbIU|website=AIC|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent deterioration from [[air pollutants]], it is helpful for conservators to have the air entering the storage area [[filtered]] and purified, windows closed, [[obsolete]]/outdated media minimized, and enclosures and cabinets used to protect collection objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation treatment==

Broken or cracked glass plates make up a large portion of those in need of [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation treatment]]. There are various actions taken in reassembling and restoring these plates using the following materials and methods: 

'''[[Adhesives]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (There is no one ideal adhesive to be used)
* [[Paraloid B-72]] - A solution of 50-70% B-72 in a solvent with added [[silica]] is used to reassemble glass plate fragments. It takes 1-2 hours to dry. One issue with this adhesive is that it creates "snowflakes" in between the pieces making an invisible reassembly impossible.
* [[Epoxy resin]] - This adhesive is thought to be very strong and has low shrinkage. An issue with this method is that it yellows over time and is not advisable to be used on glass plates with a collodion binder. This is due to the potential damage to the collodion binder of the reversibility method. 
* [[Cyanoacrylates]] - This adhesive bonds strongly with [[alkaline]] surfaces but is very brittle and only used for temporary repairs.

'''Application:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Wicking]] - This is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] to apply the adhesive to the glass with a wooden or glass applicator. A [[capillary]] tube or bottle is used to put the appropriate amount of adhesive on the glass shard without excess. 

'''Backing material:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Silpat™ sheet - This is made of [[silicone]] and [[fibreglass]]; textured and provides air pockets to prevent damage from capillary application; it does not create trauma for the [[emulsion]] side of the glass. 
* Secondary support is used for glass plates broken into many pieces or over 5 x 7 inches in size - A second piece of glass is used with silicone as a material to be inserted as a barrier layer.

'''Repair methods &amp; techniques:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[PhotoShop |PhotoShop Software]] assembly - Virtually assembling broken glass shards through Photoshop by scanning or photographing all pieces is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]]. This helps to avoid further damage and deterioration of the glass plate photograph. 
* Inclined assembly - This method involves applying an adhesive to the glass shard interfaces and assembling them on an inclined surface covered with [[Mylar]] or Silpat™. The glass shards are reassembled either by direct application, which involves applying the adhesive directly to the shard interface and attaching it to its corresponding piece; or they are assembled through wicking where the adhesive is applied to the shard interface through capillary action. 
* Vertical assembly - This method is used because of the manner in which the glass shards fit back together, which is the most accurate vertically. This also helps to protect the side of the binder layer. When assembling the pieces vertically, pressure sensitive plastic tape or sticky wax is used to hold the pieces together. The adhesive is not applied until all of the pieces are assembled - this helps to recognize any misalignment before they are adhered together. As the last step, the adhesive is applied through wicking. 
* Light-line - This is often used to insure all of the pieces are aligned. A light-line creates a straight line of light that allows a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] to see any misalignment by producing a crooked line. Once the pieces are aligned, the light-line will be straight again.

'''The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Jam Meng|title=The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre|url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf|website=AIC|publisher=The American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The vertical assembly method along with a light-line is used in [http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre] as outlined in the [[case study]]. This study shows how [[conservators]] deal with other conservation issues as well including accretions and residue. 
* For instance, while the plates were considered structurally stable, they may have needed surface cleaning. This was completed by using [[Cotton swab|swab]]s dampened with water/ethanol solutions in order to reduce [[stain]]s or do away with any left tape residue.
* Pressure sensitive labels were removed mechanically. 
* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] used Whatman lens tissues to wipe off any other residue marks.

'''Contemporary society''', according to social and political scientists, is characterised by at least three fundamental directions:
* '''increasing human interconnection''' through a network of relationships that is progressively covering the whole planet;
* '''the pace and depth of the evolution of human ways of life''' determined by technological innovation represent an absolute novelty in human history;
* the scale of '''anthropological and ecological transformation''' due to the interaction between [[evolutionary factor]]s (social, cultural, economic, and technological) has no historical precedent.

These presentations are the result of a number of fundamental changes that are irreversibly transforming our daily lives, our way of thinking and perceiving the world and our way of living together. Among these fundamental changes are: improvements in life conditions, life expectancy, literacy and gender equality; changes in domestic and international political institutions; and the breakdown of natural equilibria.

==Improvement of life conditions==
The UN estimates that, at the beginning of the 20th century, about 60% of the world population lived in conditions of extreme poverty. In 1981, 40% of the world population lived extreme poverty. In 2001, the percentage had been halved to 20%.
Several developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa, still suffer from social and economic backwardness, but life conditions have significantly improved in most regions of the world, in particular in Asia. 
The overall improvement in life conditions and the role of technologies now available have contributed to increase [[gross domestic product]] per capita by one and a half times in less than half a century (1960–2005), with peaks of over eight times in Eastern Asia. Only in a few countries, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, growth of per capita income has been very slow.

==Life expectancy==
In 1960, the average [[life expectancy]] of the world population was 50 years. Forty-five years later, in 2004, life expectancy had improved by over 30% to 67 years. Improvements in health care and the reduction in child mortality have led to a jump forward in middle-income countries, where life expectancy is now over 70 years. In high-income countries life expectancy is now over 80 years, extending well beyond the traditional length of working life, causing social and economic problems. It has led to people having an extra 4 hours of free-time during working days.&lt;ref&gt;television{{clarify|date=July 2016|reason="television" is ambiguous; be more specific.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literacy and gender equality==
The ability to read and write is next to universal: in 2004, 80% of adult men and 73% of adult women had basic literacy skills. Of great social importance is the rapid growth of female school enrolment and the increasing presence of women in the labour market. These deep changes constitute a primary driver of economic growth in developing countries.
Female literacy has great consequences in terms of fertility. When female school enrollment and employment rates increase, fertility rates decline rapidly and tend to stabilise around the natural rate of reproduction of 2.1 children per women (see E. Todd, "After the Empire"). Several demographers believe that, as a consequence, world population will stabilise over the next few decades, at a level compatible with the resources of the planet [reference].

==Spread of communication technologies==
The world population has a number of "passive" (broadcasting) communication technologies (radio, television) that cover the whole globe. Moreover, a large portion of the population uses "active" communication technologies (telephone, internet). Internet connections are expanding rapidly: in 2004 there were 140 Internet users every 1000 inhabitants (according to data from the "International Communication Union"). The spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) is remodelling the material fundamentals of society. The sociologist [[Manuel Castells|Castells]] believes that these technologies have started a revolution of the productive structures of society and of daily life.

The new communication technologies represent a critical instrument to obtain consensus and as a result they are transforming the organisational models of the State and of politics. The power system becomes less visible but more pervasive in the way it can influence choices and ways of thinking [[Manuel Castells|M. Castells]], "Galassia Internet", Feltrinelli, 2002).

==Economic growth and evolution of political institutions==
The economic success of authoritarian regimes, mainly in Asia, suggests that (at least in the short term) economic growth is independent from the democratisation of political institutions. However, economic development favours the development of democratic institutions&amp;mdash;but only if economic growth leads to substantial changes in cultural and social structures. ([[Ronald Inglehart|R. Inglehart]], "La società postmoderna").
The "[[World Values Survey]]", which captures political values in 43 countries, shows that no country with a per capita income below the poverty line has democratic or free institutions. Almost the totality of nations with high per capita income are classified as democratic.

==Globalization==
Over the last fifty years, world gross domestic product has increased by about five times, while trade has increased tenfold over the same period. These data suggests that the intensity of the commercial exchange between countries has developed faster than the overall economy. However, globalisation has gone beyond the exchange of physical commodities and it is progressively modelling also the lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals and societies. The Swiss think-tank KOF has developed a number of globalisation indicators that show the increasing development of global individual, social and commercial networks.

==Social tension and opposition to change==
New international flows have diminished the role of traditional political institutions&amp;mdash;sometimes with negative consequences for social stability. In many societies, stability (or slow evolution) has been substituted by unstoppable and irreversible transformations.
As a result, individuals and communities perceive a high degree of insecurity&amp;mdash;insecurity that touches every aspect of their lives. Growing masses of people feel threatened by the changes that affect their material (work, income, house), psychological (personal relationships), and cultural life (with the need to continuously update knowledge and professional skills).

The social improvement of the masses—resulting from increasing literacy and income, universal means of communication and a new social role of women—has eroded the traditional role of the elites and have weakened the traditional regulatory role of the state.
As the speed of social and cultural evolution sweeps away old life habits, religious beliefs, ancestral moral convictions and radicated political opinions, the anxiety towards a future that is mutating and unknown causes a cultural opposition that is at the root of fundamentalism. Opposition against new life conditions is justified also by increasing economic inequality: "the gap between the wealth of the North and that of the South of the world has increased by a multiple of five since the beginning of the 20th century" ([[:fr:Daniel Cohen (économiste)|Daniel Cohen]] {{fr icon}}, "Trois leçons sur la société postindustrielle").

==Breakdown of natural equilibria==
When demographic growth is multiplied by the growth of per capita income and consumption, one can have a measure of the global impact on environmental sustainability. Demographic and economic development is endangering our current forms of civilization and social co-living and our future ability to inhabit our planet.
Alternative scenarios developed by international organizations suggest the possibility of a serious breakdown of natural equilibrium unless political, scientific and economic tools are directed to a correction towards an acceptable equilibrium between humankind and with nature.

:''See [[Historically informed performance]] for a more detailed explanation of this topic.''

The general discussion of how to perform music from ancient or earlier times did not become an important subject of interest until the 19th century, when Europeans began looking to ancient culture generally, and musicians began to discover the musical riches from earlier centuries. The idea of performing early music more "authentically", with a sense of incorporating performance practice, was more completely established in the 20th century, creating a modern '''early music revival''' that continues today.

==Study and performance of ancient music before the 19th century==
Musicians working before 1800 were already beginning to study ancient music. They did not seek to perform the music according to its original performance practices, which constitutes a primary difference between pre-1800 interest in ancient music and modern interest in early music.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In England, [[Johann Pepusch]] developed an "[[Academy of Ancient Music#Original organisation|Academy of Ancient Music]]" in the 1720s to study music by [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Thomas Morley]], and other composers at least a century old.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell (1988), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In Vienna, Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]] presented house concerts of ancient music in the late 1700s, where [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] developed his love of music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].&lt;ref&gt;Haskell (1988), p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 18th century, [[Samuel Wesley]] was promoting the music of Bach.&lt;ref name=Haskell&gt;Haskell (1988), pp.&amp;nbsp;14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
In 1808, Wesley began performing Bach's organ music in a series of London concerts.&lt;ref name=Haskell/&gt;

[[Felix Mendelssohn]] is often credited as an important figure in reviving music from the past. He conducted a famous performance of [[J.S. Bach|Bach's]] ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' on 11 March 1829. The concert is cited as one of the most significant events in the early music revival, although the performance used contemporary instruments and the work was condensed, leaving out a significant amount of Bach's music.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell (1988), Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]], performed annually since it was composed in 1741, even with updated orchestrations by Mozart and others, is a work that shows a rare continuous line of performance that gradually defied early performance practice, only to be embraced by it in more recent years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Early 20th century==
In the early 20th century, musical historians in the emerging field of [[musicology]] began to look at [[Renaissance music]] more completely and carefully, preparing performing editions of many works.  The choirs at the cathedral churches in England were quick to revive these pieces, establishing a new standard and tradition in performing Renaissance choral music.  Other important milestones in the early music revival included the 1933 founding of the [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] by [[Paul Sacher]]—together with distinguished musicians including the pioneering specialist in early vocal music [[Max Meili]], who contributed to the extensive L'Anthologie Sonore series of early music recordings and recorded Renaissance [[lute songs]] for [[HMV]]—and the 1937 presentation and recording of some of [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi’s]] Madrigals by [[Nadia Boulanger]] in France.  [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] is widely considered the key figure in the early music revival in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell (1988), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Dolmetsch's 1915 book ''The Interpretation of the Music of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries'' was a milestone in the development of authentic performances of early music.

==Late 20th century==
By the 1950s the early music revival was fully underway, and was a fully established phenomenon by the end of the 1970s. It was centered primarily in [[London]] and Basel (at the [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]]), although there was much activity in other [[Europe]]an and American cities, especially [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], and [[San Francisco]] (centered around its [[Philharmonia Baroque]]). It had far-reaching and important effects for the way that people listen to [[European classical music|classical music]] and the way it is taught, performed, sponsored and sold. Few people involved in the classical music industry today would not acknowledge the breadth and depth of the impact that this movement has had. As much as any other force in the period, the [[protagonist]]s of the early music revival were opponents of cultural values that, in the late 1950s, seemed virtually unquestionable. The revival of interest in music from earlier periods was more widely felt than in the pedagogy and performance practice of European art music; it also influenced the performance practices and research of popular music and the music of oral traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The early music revival changed the listening habits of classical music audiences by introducing them to a range of music of which they were largely unaware. In the long term, the performance methods and values of the early music revivalist, particularly what became known as a quest for '[[authentic performance|authenticity]]' had a permanent effect not only on early music performance, but also on the performance of music from later periods.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Most interest was centered on the [[Medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|renaissance]] periods, and to a certain extent, the first part of the [[Baroque music|baroque]] period. However, it could be misleading to think of this revival simply in chronological terms, because early music performers soon extended their interests to later periods.  The focus was not simply on repertoire, but on the ways in which the music is conceived, the process by which it is learned, and the manners in which it is performed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

At this time established pioneers of early music such as the English [[counter-tenor]] [[Alfred Deller]] were joined by a new wave of specialist groups such as [[Musica Reservata]] and the [[Early Music Consort]]. The music they played, and the way it was performed, appeared new in comparison to the sounds that most people were used to from classical music; it seemed fresh and exotic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

But the revival could not have been complete without the reconstruction of instruments of the Renaissance and Baroque periods. People like Otto Steinkopf (one of the most knowledgeable and talented Berlin instrument makers and performers) started the meticulous reproduction of woodwinds: crumhorns, cornamuses, rauschpfeifes, shawms, flutes and early types of clarinets and oboes. Other manufacturers like the [http://www.renwks.com Renaissance Workshop Company] (formerly J. Woods and Sons Ltd.) played an important role in the development of early music in the 20th and 21st centuries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==21st century==
There continues to be a great flourishing of ensembles, training programs, concert series, and recordings devoted to ancient music in the 21st century.  In Europe a proliferation of [[early music festivals]] and specialist departments of music conservatories, have made early music an established part of mainstream musical activity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In the United States, gatherings such as the [[Boston Early Music Festival]] and organizations such as Early Music America, the [[Renaissance and Baroque Society of Pittsburgh]] and the [[San Francisco]] Early Music Society continue to promote the study and performance of ancient music. Several college music departments, such as the [[Peabody Institute]], [[Indiana University]], [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]], the [[University of North Texas]], and [[Boston University]], have strong early music degree programs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Recordings of all eras of early music and works of many lesser-known composers are now available. While some major recording labels have reduced funding for classical music recordings, a large number of independent classical labels, such as Harmonia Mundi and Hyperion, continue to produce early music recordings. The majority of recorded music available is found for purchase (or download) on the internet.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16775">'''Earth systems engineering and management''' (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage complex [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s. It entails a wide range of subject areas including [[anthropology]], [[engineering]], [[environmental science]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]]. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion" &lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"&gt;Gorman, Michael. (2004). ''Syllabus Spring Semester 2004''. Retrieved October 29, 2005 from http://repo-nt.tcc.virginia.edu/classes/ESEM/syllabus.html.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM is a newly emerging area of study that has taken root at the University of Virginia, Cornell and other universities throughout the United States. Founders of Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management are [[Braden Allenby]] and Michael Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael Gorman is currently a professor at the University of Virginia. He is with the School of Engineering and Applied Science in the department of Science, Technology and Society.  He teaches STS 300, Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management, STS 401, Western Technology and Culture and STS 402, The Engineer in Society. Dr. Gorman's research interests include experimental simulations of scientific reasoning, described in his book Simulating Science (Indiana UP, 1992) and case studies of ethics, invention and discovery, which are described in his book Transforming Nature (Kluwer, 1998). He is the faculty advisor for a graduate program,  Societal and Ethical Dimensions of Systems Engineering. (Excerpted from http://lisa.sts.virginia.edu/stshome/tiki-index.php?page=Michael+Gorman)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the UK, the [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceser Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research] (CESER) at Newcastle University has a large ESEM programme, led by [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Professor Richard Dawson].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Richard Dawson] is Professor of Earth Systems Engineering at Newcastle University and Director of the Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research.  His work has focused on developing adaptation solutions to ensure of structure and cities are resilient and sustainable in the face of intensifying global change.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction to ESEM==
For centuries now, mankind has been utilizing the earth and its natural resources to advance civilization and develop technology.  "As a principle {{sic}} result of Industrial Revolutions and associated changes in human demographics, technology systems, cultures, and economic systems have been the evolution of an Earth in which the dynamics of major natural systems are increasingly dominated by human activity".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt;

In many ways, ESEM views the earth as a human artifact. "In order to maintain continued stability of both natural and human systems, we need to develop the ability to rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion- an Earth Systems Engineering and Management (ESEM) capability".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt; 

Over the past five years, the concept of Earth Systems Engineering and Management has been developed by a few individuals. One of particular note is [[Braden Allenby]].  Allenby holds that the foundation upon which ESEM is built is the notion that “the Earth, as it now exists, is a product of human design”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"&gt;* Allenby, B. R. (2005). Reconstructing earth : Technology and environment in the age of humans. Washington, DC: Island Press. From https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip059/2005006241.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there are no longer any natural systems left in the world, “there are no places left on Earth that don’t fall under humanity’s shadow”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2000"&gt;Allenby, B. R. (2000, Winter). Earth systems engineering and management. IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 0278-0079(Winter) 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; “So the question is not, as some might wish, whether we should begin ESEM, because we have been doing it for a long time, albeit unintentionally.

The issue is whether we will assume the ethical responsibility to do ESEM rationally and responsibly”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; Unlike the traditional engineering and management process “which assume a high degree of knowledge and certainty about the systems behavior and a defined endpoint to the process,” ESEM “will be in constant dialog with [the systems], as they – and we and our cultures – change and coevolve together into the future”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; ESEM is a new concept, however there are a number of fields “such as [[industrial ecology]], [[adaptive management]], and [[systems engineering]] that can be relied on to enable rapid progress in developing” ESEM as a discipline.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt;

The premise of ESEM is that science and technology can provide successful and lasting solutions to human-created problems such as environmental pollution and climate-change.  This assumption has recently been challenged in ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM, as all technological control and manipulation, causes unintended and inherently unavoidable negative consequences. Furthermore, due to the limitations of reductionist science, it is inherently impossible to predict all negative impacts of ESEM. Consequently, ESEM can be considered a high-risk technological fix, which attempts to address symptoms of the planetary environmental crisis rather than root causes, which are dysfunctional human behavior such as [[human overpopulation]] and [[overconsumption]].

==ESEM: Topics==
=== Adaptive management ===
[[Adaptive management]] is a key aspect of ESEM.  Adaptive management is a way of approaching environmental management.  It assumes that there is a great deal of uncertainty in environmental systems and holds that there is never a final solution to an earth systems problem.  Therefore, once action has been taken, the Earth Systems Engineer will need to be in constant dialogue with the system, watching for changes and how the system evolves. This way of monitoring and managing ecosystems accepts nature's inherent uncertainty and embraces it by never concluding to one certain cure to a problem.

===Earth Systems Engineering===
Earth [[Systems engineering]] is essentially the use of systems analysis methods in the examination of environmental problems.  When analyzing complex environmental systems, there are numerous data sets, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and variables.  It is therefore appropriate to approach such problems with a systems analysis method.  Essentially there are “six major phases of a properly-conducted system study”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"&gt;* Gibson, J. E. (1991). How to do A systems analysis and systems analyst decalog. In W. T. Scherer (Ed.), (Fall 2003 ed.) (pp. 29-238). Department of Systems and Information Engineering: U of Virginia. Retrieved October 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The six phases are as follows:
#Determine Goals of System
#Establish Criteria for Ranking Alternative Candidates
#Develop Alternatives Solutions
#Rank Alternative Candidates
#Iterate
#Action

Part of the systems analysis process includes determining the goals of the system.  The key components of goal development include the development of a Descriptive Scenario, a Normative Scenario and Transitive Scenario.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Essentially, the Descriptive Scenario “describe[s] the situation as it is [and] tell[s] how it got to be that way” (Gibson, 1991).  Another important part of the Descriptive Scenario is how it “point[s] out the good features and the unacceptable elements of the status quo”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Next, the Normative Scenario shows the final outcome or the way the system should operate under ideal conditions once action has been taken.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt;  For the Earth Systems approach, the “Normative Scenario” will involve the most complicated analysis.  The Normative Scenario will deal with stakeholders, creating a common trading zone or location for the free exchange of ideas to come up with a solution of where a system may be restored to or just how exactly a system should be modified.  Finally the Transitive scenario comes up with the actual process of changing a system from a Descriptive state to a Normative state.  Often, there is not one final solution, as noted in [[adaptive management]].  Typically an iterative process ensues as variables and inputs change and the system coevolves with the analysis.

===Environmental science===
{{main|Environmental science}}
When examining complex ecologic systems there is an inherent need for the Earth Systems Engineer to have a strong understanding of how natural processes function.  A training in Environmental Science will be crucial to fully understand the possible unintended and undesired effects of a proposed earth systems design.  Such fundamental topics such as the carbon cycle or the [[water cycle]] are pivotal processes that need to be understood.

===Ethics &amp; Sustainability===
At the heart of ESEM is the social, ethical and moral responsibility of the Earth Systems Engineer to stakeholders and to the natural system being engineered, to come up with an objective Transitive and Normative scenario.  “ESEM is the cultural and ethical context itself”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; The Earth Systems Engineer will be expected to explore the ethical implications of proposed solutions.

“The perspective of environmental sustainability requires that we ask ourselves how each interaction with the natural environment will affect, and be judged by, our children in the future” ”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"&gt;Newton, L. H. (2003). Ethics and sustainability : Sustainable development and the moral life. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; “There is an increasing awareness that the process of development, left to itself, can cause irreversible damage to the environment, and that the resultant net addition to wealth and human welfare may very well be negative, if not catastrophic”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt;  With this notion in mind, there is now a new goal of sustainable environment-friendly development.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt; [[Sustainable development]] is an important part to developing appropriate ESEM solutions to complex environmental problems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{main|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the notion that major manufacturing and industrial processes need to shift from open loop systems to closed loop systems. This is essentially the recycling of waste to make new products.  This reduces refuse and increases the effectiveness of resources.  ESEM looks to minimize the impact of industrial processes on the environment, therefore the notion of recycling of industrial products is important to ESEM.

==Case Study: Florida Everglades==
The [[Florida Everglades]] system is a prime example of a complex ecological system that underwent an ESEM analysis.

;Background
The Florida Everglades is located in southern Florida.  The ecosystem is essentially a subtropical fresh water marsh composed of a variety of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Everglades, 2004"&gt;“Everglades.” Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 10 April 2004. {{cite web |url=http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214102114/http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |archivedate=2005-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note is the [[saw grass]] and ridge slough formations that make the Everglades unique.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"&gt;(Davis, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the past century mankind has had a rising presence in this region.  Currently, all of the eastern shore of Florida is developed and the population has increased to over 6 million residents.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; This increased presence over the years has resulted in the channeling and redirecting of water from its traditional path through the Everglades and into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  With this there have been a variety of deleterious effects upon the Florida Everglades.

;Descriptive Scenario
By 1993, the Everglades had been affected by numerous human developments.  The water flow and quality had been affected by the construction of canals and levees, to the series of elevated highways running through the Everglades to the expansive Everglades Agricultural Area that had contaminated the Everglades with high amounts of nitrogen.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  The result of this reduced flow of water was dramatic. There was a 90 - 95% reduction in wading bird populations, declining fish populations and salt water intrusion into the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"/&gt; If the Florida Everglades were to remain a US landmark, action needed to be taken.

;Normative Scenario
It was in 1993 that the Army Corps of Engineers analyzed the system.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They determined that an ideal situation would be to "get the water right".&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; In doing so there would be a better flow through the Everglades and a reduced number of canals and levees sending water to tide.

;Transitive Scenario
It was from the development of the Normative Scenario, that the Army Corps of Engineers developed CERP, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  In the plan they created a time line of projects to be completed, the estimated cost and the ultimate results of improving the ecosystem by having native flora and fauna prosper.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They also outline the human benefits of the project.  Not only will the solution be sustainable, as future generations will be able to enjoy the Everglades, but the correction of the water flow and through the creation of storage facilities will reduce the occurrence of droughts and water shortages in southern Florida.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;

'''euromuse.net''' is an exhibition web portal, that, being a project of certain [[Europe]]an [[museum]]s, informs about the exhibitions of that museums, that mostly are based on cultural history and the history of arts of Europe.

== Content ==
The portal collects information about exhibitions, institution and collections of European museums on its website. In February 2014 information about 540 museums from 28 countries were collected.

An '''exemplum''' (Latin for "example", pl. '''exempla''',  ''exempli gratia'' = "for example", abbr.: ''e.g.'') is a moral [[anecdote]], brief or extended, real or fictitious, used to illustrate a point. The word is also used to express an action performed by another and used as an example or model.

==Exemplary literature==

This [[genre]] sprang from the above, in classical, medieval and Renaissance literature, consisting of lives of famous figures, and using these (by emphasizing good or bad character traits) to make a moral point.

Collections of Exempla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicolas |last=Louis |title=L’exemplum en pratiques : production, diffusion et usages des recueils d’exempla latins aux XIIIe-XVe siècles |volume=2 |publisher=Namur-Paris |year=2013 |hdl=2078.2/133816 |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00860685/file/Nicolas_LOUIS_-_thA_se_-_enquete_annexe.pdf |format=PDF |pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped [[Middle Ages|medieval]] preachers to adorn their [[sermon]]s, to emphasize moral conclusions or illustrate a point of doctrine. The subject matter could be taken from [[fable]]s, [[Folklore|folktale]]s, [[legend]]s, real history, or natural history. [[Jacques de Vitry]]'s book of exempla, c. 1200, [[Nicholas Bozon]]'s ''Les contes moralisés'' (after 1320), and [[Odo of Cheriton]]'s ''Parabolae'' (after 1225) were famous medieval collections aimed particularly at preachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PscUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |chapter=Introduction |page=5-6 |title=The Dialogues of Creatures Moralysed: A Critical Edition |editor-first=Gregory C. |editor-last=Kratzmann |editor2-first=Elizabeth |editor2-last=Gee |publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill]] Archive |date=1 January 1988 |isbn=9789004085152}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale]]'' became a vivid satire on this genre. There were also notable lay writers of moral tales, such as the 13th century [[Der Stricker]] and the 14th century [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena]] ([[Tales of Count Lucanor]]).
Examples dealing with historical figures include:

*[[Suetonius]]'s ''De vita Caesarum'' or ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''
*[[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]''
*[[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Petrarch]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''
*[[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' and ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium|On the Fates of Illustrious Men]]''
*[[Christine de Pizan]]'s ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]''.
*''[[Mirror for Magistrates]]'' by various Tudor authors

==Three examples of exempla==

''The Norton Anthology of Western Literature'' includes three exempla (singular, ''exemplum''), stories that illustrate a general principle or underscore a moral lesson: "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man" and "The King's Tailor's Apprentice" (both from ''The Scholar's Guide'') and "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck." 

==="The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man"===

In "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man," told by the father, the three traveling companions of the tale's title are on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. Near their destination, their provisions are nearly depleted, and the two city dwellers attempt to cheat the country man by telling him that whoever of them dreams the most extraordinary dream shall get the last of their bread.

As the city dwellers sleep, the country man, alert to their intended deception, eats the half-baked bread before retiring.

The city dwellers relate their made-up dreams. One says he was taken to [[heaven]] and led before God by angels. The other says that angels escorted him to [[hell]]. 

The country man says he dreamed the same things that his companions dreamed and, believing them to be forever lost, one to heaven and the other to hell, ate the bread.

The son tells his father the moral of the story: "As it says in the [[proverb]], ‘He who wanted all, lost all.’" He says that the two city dwellers got their just comeuppance. The story says that he wishes they’d been whipped, as the antagonist in another story he has heard, was beaten for his chicanery. His comment is a transition to the next tale, causing the father to ask his son to tell him this story. Thus, the roles of the father and his son are reversed, as the father, who was the storyteller, becomes the listener, and the son, who was his father's audience, becomes the narrator.

==="The King And His Wife"===

The son's story recounts the story of a king's tailor's assistant, a youth by the name of Nedui.

One day while he is away, his master gives the other apprentices bread and [[honey]], but does not save any for Nedui, telling them that Nedui "would not eat honey even if he were here." Upon learning that he has been left out, Nedui avenges himself upon his master by telling the [[eunuch]] whom the king has set over the apprentices as their supervisor that the tailor is subject to seizures of madness, during which he becomes violent and dangerous. In fact, Nedui claims, he has killed those who have happened to be near him when he is in the grip of such a fit. To protect himself, Nedui says, he binds and beats the tailor when such a fit comes over him. He also tells the eunuch what to look for: "When you see him looking all around and feeling the floor with his hands and getting up from his seat and picking up the chair on which he is seated, then you will know that he is mad, and if you do not protect yourself and your servants, he will beat you on the head with a [[Club (weapon)|club]]."

The next day, Nedui hides the tailor's shears, and, when the master, hunting for them,  behaves as Nedui mentioned to the eunuch, the eunuch orders his servants to bind the tailor and beats him himself with a club. His servants also beat him until he is unconscious and "half dead."

When he regains consciousness, the tailor asks the eunuch what [[crime]] he has committed to have deserved such a beating, and the eunuch tells him what Nedui told him about the tailor's seizures. "Friend, when have you ever seen me crazy?" the master asks his apprentice, to which question he receives, from Nedui, the rejoinder: "When have you ever seen me refuse to eat honey?"

The father tells the son the [[moral]] of the story: "The tailor deserved his punishment because if he had kept the precept of Moses, to love his brother as himself, this would not have happened to him."

By having the listener tell the narrator the moral of the story, the storyteller shows that the narrative has successfully served its purpose as an exemplum, as the listener, hearing the story, shows that he is able to ascertain the moral that the tale is intended to express.

==="The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck"===

The third exemplum, "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck," is a prose, rather than a poetic, narrative. Like a mini-sermon, it preaches against wrong conduct—in this case, sacrilegious behavior. This tale has an identifiable author, Robert Mannyng, who set down the story in the early fourteenth century. ''The Norton Anthology'''s version is translated from [[Middle English]] by Lee Patterson.

To bolster his listener's belief that "most of" his tale is "the [[gospel]] truth," the narrator names the culprits and their victims and cites [[Pope Leo IX|Pope Leo]] as one who knows (and wrote a version of) the narrative and points out that the story is "known in the court at Rome" and has appeared widely in many chronicles, including those "beyond the sea." However, after the telling of the tale, the storyteller admits that some doubt its veracity.

The story starts by identifying several activities that are not allowed in [[Church (building)|church]] or in the [[churchyard]]: "carols, [[wrestling]], or summer games." In addition, "interludes or singing, beating the [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]] [a small drum], or piping. . . . while the [[priest]] is conducting [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]" are "forbidden" and sacrilegious, and "good priests" will not tolerate them.

It is also improper to dance in church, as the story that the narrator is about to tell demonstrates.

When "twelve fools" in Colbeck (or, as the editors’ note explains, "[[Kolbigk]], in [[Saxony]], an area in eastern Germany, just north of the present-day Czech border) decided, one [[Christmas Eve]], to make "a [[Carol (music)|carol]]--madly, as a kind of challenge," and persisted in singing and dancing in the churchyard while the priest was trying to conduct Mass, despite his entreaties to them to stop, the priest calls upon God to [[curse]] them.

The singers’ carol contains three lines, the last of which appears to become the basis of their curse, as they are unable to leave the churchyard or to quit singing or dancing for a year after God curses them for their sacrilegious behavior:

:By the leafy wood rode Bovoline,
:With him he led the fair Mersewine.
:Why are we waiting? Why don’t we go?

As a result of the curse, the dancers cannot stop singing and dancing; neither can they let go of one another's hands.

The priest, too late, sends his son, Ayone, to rescue his daughter, Ave, who is one of the "twelve fools" involved in the dancing. However, due to the curse, when Ayone takes his sister's arm to separate her from the other carolers, it detaches from her body. Miraculously, her wound does not bleed, nor does she die from it.

Ayone takes the arm to his father. The priest tries, three times unsuccessfully, to bury the limb, but the grave casts it back, so the priest displays it inside the church. Everyone, including the [[emperor]], comes to see the cursed dancers, who, despite no rest, food, drink, or sleep, dance non-stop, night and day, regardless of the temperature or the weather. Several times, the emperor orders a covering to be built to protect the dancers from storms, but it is reduced to rubble overnight each time it is built or rebuilt.

After the year has ended, the curse is lifted, and the dancers fall down upon the ground, as if dead.  Three days later, they arise—except for Ave, who has died. Soon after, the priest also dies. The emperor installs the container in the church as a receptacle for the dead girl's arm, and it becomes a holy [[relic]] commemorating the [[miracle]] of the curse.

The other dancers cannot get together again, ever, and must skip, instead of walking, wherever they go. Living mementoes of God's curse against sacrilegious behavior, they bear permanent physical changes to their clothing and their bodies: "Their clothes didn’t rot nor their nails grow; their hair didn’t lengthen nor their [[complexion]] change. Nor did they ever have relief..."

Although some believe and others doubt the authenticity of the tale he's told, the narrator says he recounted the story so that his listeners, taking heed, may be "afraid to carol in a church or churchyard, especially against the priest's will," as "jangling is a form of [[sacrilege]]."

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' (FSP) is a theory describing the information structure of the sentence and language communication in general. It has been developed in the tradition of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague School]] of Functional and Structural Linguistics together with its sister theory, Topic-Focus Articulation.

The key concepts of FSP were laid down by [[Jan Firbas]] in the mid-1950s on the basis of the linguistic work of [[Vilém Mathesius]], especially his idea of functional syntax in linguistic characterology of language.

==Terminology==
The term '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' was created by Jan Firbas as a more convenient English equivalent of Mathesius’ Czech term [[:cz:aktuální členění větné|aktuální členění větné]]:

{{quote|“It is not without interest to note that Mathesius, who knew [[Henri Weil|Weil]]’s work, coined the felicitous term ‘aktuální členění větné. … As English ‘actual’ is not an exact equivalent of Czech ‘aktuální’, another term had to be found for English. I accepted Professor [[Josef Vachek]]’s suggestion and started using the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP; Firbas 1957). The term is based on Mathesius’ term ‘Satzperspektive’. Vachek’s suggestion has added the qualification ‘functional’. This is the way the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP) has found its way into the literature.”|Firbas, 1994, p. 4}}

Within Czech linguistics the Czech calque of the English term Functional Sentence Perspective '''funkční větná perspektiva''' is nowadays used to refer to the approach stemming from the writings of Jan Firbas and his followers, while the original Mathesius’ Czech term '''aktuální členění větné''' tends to be associated with the group of linguists developing the Topic-Focus Articulation, i.e. [[Petr Sgall]], [[Eva Hajičová]], [[Jarmila Panevová]] and their disciples, despite the fact that both terms are still sometimes used interchangeably in some Czech contributions to the topic of information structure of language. (Cf.  Karlík - Nekula - Pleskalová (2002))

'''Gabriel Sionita''' ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: Jibrā'īl aṣ-Ṣahyūnī; 1577, at [[Ehden]] in [[Lebanon]] – 1648, in Paris) was a learned [[Maronite]], famous for his role in the publication of the 1645 Parisian [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] of the Bible.

==Life==

Gabriel Sionita was born Jibrayil al-Sahyuni Al Karami in [[Mount Lebanon]], in the [[Maronite]] village of [[Ehden]], to an old family of village notables and clerics, known today as the Karam family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=al-Khuri|first1=Ighnatius Tannus|title=Jibrayil al-Sahyuni (1577-1648)|journal=al-Mashriq|date=February 1, 1940|issue=2|pages=253–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maronite Patriarch al-Rizzi or Sergius Risius (1581-1597) sent Sionita and nine other Maronite chidlren to Rome at the age of seven to study in the new Maronite College. In Rome, he learnt Latin and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] on top of his native [[Arabic]], and acquired a slight knowledge of Hebrew. He studied theology, but only went into the priesthood later, in Paris, aged 45.

[[Savary de Breves]] was French ambassador to Turkey and was interested in Oriental studies. When recalled from Rome, he took two Maronites with him to Paris, to assist in the publication of the polyglot under the auspices of [[de Thou]], the royal librarian, and [[Cardinal Duperron]]. The two Maronites were Gabriel Sionita and [[John Hesronita]], Gabriel being the more prominent of the two. They received an annual stipend of 600 livres, and Gabriel was appointed to the chair of Semitic languages at [[Sorbonne]].

Both de Thou and Duperron died within four years, and serious financial difficulties arose. In 1619, the [[assembly of French clergy]] at [[Blois]] granted 8,000 livres to support the undertaking; but through some malversation of funds, this money was never actually paid; at least, such is the accusation brought by Gabriel in his preface to the ''Syriac Psalter'', which he published. The Maronites seem to have become involved in pecuniary embarrassments, which led to feuds with the leaders of the undertaking. In 1619, however, by royal diploma, Gabriel's stipend had been raised to 1,200 livres. The following year he received the a doctorate, and two years later, the priesthood.

In 1626, as Gabriel held no classes owing to the lack of students, his stipend was curtailed. After some time, however, he was paid on the original offer; and in 1629, his salary was increased to 2,000 livres. In 1630, he recommenced work on the polyglot. He did not apply himself fully to the work, and was even accused of carelessness in the work. He again found himself in difficulties.

In the quarrel which ensued, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] supported the editor, [[Guy Michel Le Jay]], against the Maronites. As it was feared that Gabriel might leave the country, the cardinal had him imprisoned in [[Vincennes]] (1640). He was released after three months, when he had signed an undertaking and given sureties that he would prepare the texts for the polyglot. He completed his great task some time before his death, at the age of 71.

==Works==
Gabriel's work in the polyglot included revising and correcting almost all of the Syriac and Arabic texts. He translated the Arabic and Syriac texts into Latin, with the exceptions of the [[Book of Ruth]]. But he only made a revision and not a fresh translation of the Gospels into Latin, nor did he translate from Syriac into Latin the [[Sapiential Books]] or the Apocalypse. Together with John Hesronita and [[Victor Sciala]], he published a Latin translation of the (Arabic) Psalter in 1614. In 1616, he published a document on Arabic grammar, of which one division (Liber I) appeared, containing the rules for reading.

In 1619, his ''Geographia Nubiensis'' (meaning a translation of the Maronite editions of the same) of [[Edrisi]]'s geography, with a small treatise as an appendix, "De nonnullis Orient. urb. nec non indig. relig. ac. moribus". In 1634, he was issued a ''Poema enigmaticum'' in praise of Divine wisdom by an ancient Syrian philosopher.

1630 saw the publication of his ''Testamentum et pactiones inter Mohammedem et Christianae fidei cultores'', an edition of the medieval Arabic document, the [[Achtiname of Muhammad|''Achtiname'' of Muhammad]], with Latin translation.

Finally, three small pamphlets appeared between 1640 and 1642, one in Latin and two in French, containing his defence in the actions of Le Jay and [[Antoine Vitré|Vitre]].

'''Gender and Judaism''' is a radical, emerging subfield at the intersection of [[gender studies]] and [[Jewish studies]]. Gender studies centers on interdisciplinary research on the phenomenon of gender. It focuses on cultural representations of gender and people's lived experience. Jewish studies is a field that looks at Jews and Judaism, through such disciplines as history, anthropology, literary studies, linguistics, and sociology.

==History==
Jewish law, or [[halacha]], recognises gender ambiguity, and has done throughout Jewish history &lt;ref&gt;"More than Just Male and Female: The Six Genders in Ancient Jewish Thought." Freidson, Sarah. Sefaria, 10 June 2016. [https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/37225]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, unlike the modern concept of gender fluidity, this ambiguity is defined according to physical presentation (or lack thereof) and primary and secondary sexual characteristics. The concept of a [[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]] being a person of ambiguous gender and/or sex is dealt with, as is the concept of the [[androgynos]], being a person characterised with elements of both genders. These concepts have precedent dating back to the beginning of Jewish thought.

Gender and Judaism has drawn scholarly interest due to the rapid growth of its intersecting fields during the late 20th century, fueled as well by popular and academic attention to [[Jewish feminism]]. As universities established [[women's studies]] programs, they have linked to Jewish studies as well. For instance, in 1997, [[Brandeis University]] established the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute, which aims to "develop fresh ways of thinking about Jews and gender worldwide by producing and promoting scholarly research and artistic projects."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/hirjw/about/about.html -Brandeis Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, controversies over the role of women in Jewish denominations and the [[Gender separation in Judaism|gender separation in orthodox judaism]] has drawn attention to [[gender roles]], as constructed and regulated by religious institutions. For this reason, besides the academic attention, the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Jewish movements turn to gender and Judaism to reinforce their own mission and identity. Notably, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] has established the Gottesman Chair in Gender and Judaism and operates Kolot — the Center for Jewish Women's and Gender Studies ",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolot.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the first such center established at a rabbinical seminary (1996).

With the U.S.-based [[Association of Jewish Studies]], a women's caucus works "to advance the study of gender within the Association for Jewish Studies and within the wider academic community." AJS holds at  least one panel on gender every annual meeting, provide funding for presentations on gender and Judaism and published a collection of syllabi pertaining to gender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajsnet.org/ajswomen's_caucus.htm AJS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
* Zachar (זָכָר): This term is derived from the word for memory and refers to the belief that the man carried the name and identity of the family. It is usually translated as "male" in English.
* Nekevah (נְקֵבָה): This term is derived from the word for a crevice and probably refers to a vaginal opening. It is usually translated as "female" in English.
* [[Androgynos]] (אנדרוגינוס): A person who has both "male" and "female" physical sexual characteristics. 149 references in [[Mishna]] and [[Talmud]] (1st – 8th centuries CE); 350 in classical [[midrash]] and Jewish law codes (2nd – 16th centuries CE).
* [[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]] (טומטום): A person whose sexual characteristics are indeterminate or obscured. 181 references in Mishna and Talmud; 335 in classical midrash and Jewish law codes.
* Ay’lonit (איילונית): A female who does not develop at puberty and is infertile. 80 references in Mishna and Talmud; 40 in classical midrash and Jewish law codes.
* Saris (סָרִיס): A male who does not develop at puberty and/or subsequently has their sexual organs removed. A saris can be “naturally” a saris (saris hamah), or become one through human intervention (saris adam). 156 references in mishna and Talmud; 379 in classical midrash and Jewish law codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transtorah.org/PDFs/Classical_Jewish_Terms_for_Gender_Diversity.pdf |title=Terms for Gender Diversity in Classical Jewish Texts |publisher=Transtorah.org |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Gender and Jewish studies intersect primarily through research on Jewish women and the [[role of women in Judaism]] and Jewish culture.

Nonetheless, gender and Jewish studies also investigate the gender phenomena pertaining to men and masculinity. In addition, the subfield encompasses research on [[Homosexuality and Judaism|homosexuality]] and [[queer theory]] as these pertain to Jews and Judaism.

In historical terms, gender and Jewish studies span a broad range, from Biblical exegesis, research on [[rabbinic literature]], [[Medieval Jewish]] culture, the importance of gender in Jewish responses to modernity, and gender [[identity politics]] in the contemporary period.

There is a growing subfield in the study of gender and Judaism, which sees the binaries of male and female as crucial constructs in Jewish thought.&lt;ref&gt;Kosman, Miriam, ''Circle, Arrow, Spiral, Exploring Gender in Judaism,'' Menucha Publishers, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Steven F. Friedell, “The ‘Different Voice’ in Jewish Law: Some Parallels to a Feminist Jurisprudence,” Indiana Law Journal, October 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob,   ''''Androgynous Judaism: Masculine and Feminine in the Dual Torah,'''' Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
While the male/female dialectic first makes its appearance in the story of creation, the Talmud insists that the idea of male and female extends way beyond sex roles: "Everything that God created, He created as male and female...."(Baba Batra 74b)  

This dialectic takes on even greater theological significance in light of the Biblical book, Song of Songs, which has been traditionally interpreted as a metaphor for the relationship between God and the Nation of Israel, where the Nation of Israel is cast as feminine towards God, who is represented in the story by the male lover. 
 
Other examples of topics in which the male/female dynamic is used metaphorically include: the relationship between Shabbat and the days of the week&lt;ref&gt;Kosman, Miriam, Men are From Weekday, Women are from Shabbat, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, the relationship between the Oral and Written Law, the relationship between This World and the Next, the interplay between the legal and extra-legal aspects of Talmud (Halacha and Aggada)&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob,  How the Rabbis Liberated Women, University of South Florida, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt;, and the Jewish calendar, which makes use of both the sun (traditionally symbolic of the male force) and the moon (traditionally symbolic of the female force)&lt;ref&gt;Heshelis, Devorah, ''The Moon's Lost Light'', Targum Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Gender polarity is robustly maintained in both the Bible and in the Oral Law, (Deuteronomy, 22:5, even forbids cross-dressing)  and upholding this polarity is seen as critical in achieving synthesis between the masculine and feminine.
  
This exploration of gender-constructs in primary sources reveals surprising valuation of the feminine prototype in Kabbala-based sources which invites inquiry into the social, ethical, ecological, moral and philosophical ramifications of a feminine perspective within Jewish thought.&lt;ref&gt;Rinder Sarah, "A New, Sophisticated, Haredi View on Gender" The Forward, November, 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghent University''' ({{lang-nl|Universiteit Gent}}, abbreviated as '''UGent''') is a [[Public university|public]] research [[university]] located in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. It was established in 1817 by [[King William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. After the [[Belgian revolution]] of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer the university. In 1930, it became the first [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking university in Belgium, whereas [[French language|French]] had previously been the standard academic language. In 1991, the university was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from ''State University of Ghent'' ({{lang-nl|Rijksuniversiteit Gent}}, abbreviated as ''RUG'') to its current designation.

In contrast to the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1835–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] or the [[Free University of Brussels]], UGent considers itself a ''pluralist'' university in a special sense, i.e. not connected to any particular religion or political ideology. Its motto '''Inter Utrumque''' ('In Between Both Extremes'), on the coat of arms, suggests the acquisition of wisdom and science comes only in an atmosphere of peace, when the institution is fully supported by the monarchy and fatherland.

Ghent University is one of the biggest [[Flanders|Flemish]] universities, consisting of 41,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The University also supports the [[Ghent University Library|University Library]] and the [[Ghent University Hospital|University Hospital]], which is one of the largest hospitals in Belgium. It is one of the greatest beneficiaries of funding from the [[Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)]]. Ghent University consistently rates among the top universities not only in Belgium but also throughout the world.

== History ==

=== Foundation, in the 19th century ===
The university in Ghent was opened on October 9, 1817, with JC van Rotterdam serving as the first [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. In the first year, it had 190 students and 16 professors. The original four faculties consisted of Humanities (Letters), Law, Medicine and Science, and the language of instruction was [[Latin]]. The university was founded by [[King William I of the Netherlands|King William I]] as part of a policy to stem the intellectual and academic lag in the southern part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], later to become Belgium.

After peaking at a student population of 414, the number of students declined quickly following the [[Belgian Revolution]]. At this time, the Faculties of Humanities and Science were broken from the university, but they were restored five years later, in 1835. 
Ghent University played a big role in the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Friedrich [[August Kekulé]] (7 September 1829 – 13 July 1896) unraveled the structure of benzene at Ghent and [[Adolf von Baeyer]] (Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer), a student of [[August Kekulé]], made seminal contributions to organic chemistry.

In 1882, Sidonie Verhelst became the first female student at the university.

French became the language of instruction, taking the place of Latin, after the 1830 Revolution. In 1903, the Flemish politician [[Lodewijk De Raet]] led a successful campaign to begin instruction in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and the first courses were begun in 1906.

=== Developments since the 20th century ===
During [[World War I]], the occupying German administration conducted ''[[Flamenpolitik]]'' and turned Ghent University into the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. A Flemish Institute (''Vlaemsche Hoogeschool''), commonly known as [[Von Bissing University]], was founded in 1916 but was disestablished after the war and French language was fully reinstated. In 1923, Cabinet Minister [[Pierre Nolf]] put forward a motion to definitively establish the university as a Dutch-speaking university, and this was realized in 1930. [[August Vermeylen]] served as the first rector of a Dutch-language university in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,880570,00.html A Language Come Back], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', April 28, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the German administration of the university attempted to create a German orientation, removing faculty members and installing loyal activists. However, the university became the focal point for many resistance members as the war progressed.
[[File:Ghent_University_1910_-_Studentenvereniging_Société_Académique_d'Histoire.jpg|thumb|Ghent University 1910 - Studentenvereniging Société Académique d'Histoire]]
After the war, the university became a much larger institution, following government policy of democratizing higher education in Flanders during the 1950s and 1960s. By 1953, there were more than 3,000 students, and by 1969 more than 11,500. The number of faculties increased to eleven, starting with Applied Sciences in 1957. It was followed by Economics and Veterinary Medicine in 1968, Psychology and Pedagogy, as well as Bioengineering, in 1969, and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The faculty of Politics and Social Sciences is the most recent addition, in 1992.

In the 1960s to 1980s, there were several [[student activism|student demonstrations]] at Ghent University, notably around the [[Blandijn]] site, which houses the Faculty of Arts &amp; Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The university officially changed its name from ''Rijksuniversiteit Gent'' (RUG) to ''Universiteit Gent'' (UGent) in 1991 following an increased grant of autonomy by the government of the [[Flemish Community]].

In 2017, Rik Van de Walle succeeded Anne De Paepe as rector.

'''''God: The Failed Hypothesis''''' is a 2007 [[New York Times bestseller]] by scientist [[Victor J. Stenger]] who argues that there is no evidence for the existence of a [[deity]] and that [[God]]'s existence, while not impossible, is improbable.

David Ludden of ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine wrote that "Stenger lays out the evidence from [[cosmology]], [[astrophysics]], [[condensed matter physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[plasma physics]], [[particle physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]] showing that the universe appears exactly as it should if there is no creator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-04-04.html | title=Conspicuous by His Absence | publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |date= April 4, 2007| first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludden concluded "All freethinkers should have both volumes [''[[The God Delusion]]'' and ''God: The Failed Hypothesis''], side by side, on their bookshelves."

Damien Broderick wrote in ''[[The Australian]]'', "Stenger offers an answer to that deep question in his two new books, arguing a materialist, God-free account of the cosmos, equally antagonistic to superstition, the paranormal and religions archetypal and newfangled alike. He refuses to accept the polite accommodation urged by agnostic [[Stephen Jay Gould]] that science and religion can never be in conflict as they are [[Non-overlapping magisteria|non-overlapping 'magisteria']]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/god-the-failed-hypothesis-the-comprehensible-cosmos/story-e6frg8no-1111113107222 | title=God: The Failed Hypothesis / The Comprehensible Cosmos | publisher=[[The Australian]]|date= March 10, 2007 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Stenger says that, when [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] said religion was outside the reach of science, he was reducing religion to moral philosophy. In contrast, Stenger believes that religion often makes claims that are very much within the abilities of science to investigate. In that vein, he says that science practices [[methodological naturalism]], although it does not rule out the supernatural (i.e. [[metaphysical naturalism]] or [[physicalism]]), science does restrict itself to testing that which can actually be tested - namely effects in the natural world (be their cause natural or supernatural).&lt;ref name=StengerPOI&gt;[http://www.pointofinquiry.org/victor_stenger_god_the_failed_hypothesis Point of Inquiry Podcast, "God: The Failed Hypothesis" interview with Vic Stenger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stenger believes we have more than enough [[evidence of absence]] of the [[Judeo-Christian]] God. He adds that many arguments for God that were once compelling are now weak or irrelevant in light of modern scientific understanding. Stenger does not think we should be dogmatic about disbelief in God, but says the evidence is overwhelmingly against the belief. He is also critical of [[Fine tuning]] arguments, and says they misunderstand the more reasonable [[weak anthropic principle]].&lt;ref name="StengerPOI"/&gt;

'''Growth management''', in the United States, is a set of techniques used by the government to ensure that as the population grows that there are services available to meet their demands.  These are not necessarily only government services.  Other demands such as the protection of natural spaces, sufficient and affordable housing, delivery of utilities, preservation of buildings and places of historical value, and sufficient places for the conduct of business are also considered.

One technique is the imposition of [[impact fee]]s.  Impact fees are imposed to charge the owners of newly developed properties for the "impact" the new development will have on the community.  Fees can be used for such things as transportation improvements, new parks, and expansion of schools.  Impact fees are not used to maintain existing facilities, but instead, are used to create new facilities in proportion to the number of new developments in the area.

Another technique is the application of [[zoning]] to reduce the cost of service delivery.  Zoning can be used to reduce the area affected by urbanization, allowing the same number of people to live and work in a smaller area, allowing governmental services to be delivered more efficiently.  For example, fire protection and emergency medical response services are less expensive to provide in compact areas than in areas where the population is more spread out.  This results in lower expenditures for the same [[level of service]], which saves taxpayer dollars.  The efficiencies gained can also result in benefits to the private sector.  For example, grocery stores and [[pizza delivery]] businesses can serve only a limited area.  If more customers are located within their service delivery area, the cost of delivering their services is decreased.

Preventing suburban densities from affecting a large area also has the effect of providing open spaces so that people who wish to live in a rural setting can do so without [[urbanization]] threatening their lifestyle.

The application of growth management techniques is often governed by the development of a [[comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]].  The plan can be used to measure the impact that new growth will have on the community and define the method by which that impact is mitigated.

Pioneers in United States growth management were Oregon, which established [[Urban Growth Boundary|Urban Growth Boundaries]] in the 1970s and Florida which passed the Growth Management Act in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/florida-lawmakers-wipe-out-30-years-of-growth-management-law/1168328 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608160141/http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/florida-lawmakers-wipe-out-30-years-of-growth-management-law/1168328 |archive-date=2015-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helminthology''' is the study of [[parasitic worm]]s (helminths), while [[helminthiasis]] describes the medical condition of being infected with helminths. Helminthology studies the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of helminths and their effects on their [[host (biology)|host]]s.

'''Hydrology''' (from Greek: [[wikt:ὕδωρ|ὕδωρ]], "hýdōr" meaning "water"; and [[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]], "lógos" meaning "study") is the scientific study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water on Earth and other planets, including the [[water cycle]], [[water resources]] and environmental watershed sustainability. A practitioner of hydrology is a '''hydrologist''', working within the fields of [[earth science|earth]] or [[environmental science]], [[physical geography]], [[geology]] or [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]].&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web

Hydrology subdivides into surface water hydrology, groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology), and marine hydrology. Domains of hydrology include [[hydrometeorology]], [[surface-water hydrology|surface hydrology]], [[hydrogeology]],  [[drainage basin|drainage-basin]] management and [[water quality]], where water plays the central role.

[[Oceanography]] and [[meteorology]] are not included because water is only one of many important aspects within those fields.

Hydrological research can inform environmental engineering, [[environmental policy|policy]] and [[environmental planning|planning]].

== History ==
{{no footnotes|section|date=April 2012}}
Hydrology has been a subject of investigation and engineering for millennia. For example, about 4000 BC the Nile was dammed to improve agricultural productivity of previously barren lands. [[Mesopotamia]]n towns were protected from flooding with high earthen walls. [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueducts]] were built by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans]], while the [[history of China]] shows they built irrigation and flood control works. The ancient [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] used hydrology to build complex irrigation works in [[Sri Lanka]], also known for invention of the Valve Pit which allowed construction of large reservoirs, [[anicut]]s and canals which still function.

[[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius]], in the first century BC, described a philosophical theory of the hydrologic cycle, in which precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the Earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} With adoption of a more scientific approach, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Bernard Palissy]] independently reached an accurate representation of the hydrologic cycle. It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified.

Pioneers of the modern science of hydrology include [[Pierre Perrault (scientist)|Pierre Perrault]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Edmund Halley]]. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area, Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the Seine. Marriotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain discharge, again in the Seine. Halley showed that the evaporation from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing into the sea.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Advances in the 18th century included the Bernoulli [[piezometer]] and [[Bernoulli's equation]], by [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and the [[Pitot tube]], by [[Henri Pitot]]. The 19th century saw development in groundwater hydrology, including [[Darcy's law]], the Dupuit-Thiem well formula, and Hagen-[[Poiseuille]]'s capillary flow equation.

Rational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century, while governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs. Of particular importance were Leroy Sherman's [[unit hydrograph]], the infiltration theory of [[Robert E. Horton]], and C.V. Theis's aquifer test/equation describing well hydraulics.

Since the 1950s, hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis than in the past, facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of hydrological processes and by the advent of computers and especially [[geographic information systems]] (GIS). (See also [[GIS and hydrology]])

== Themes ==
{{Main|Water cycle}}
The central theme of hydrology is that water circulates throughout the [[Earth]] through different pathways and at different rates. The most vivid image of this is in the evaporation of water from the ocean, which forms clouds. These clouds drift over the land and produce rain. The rainwater flows into lakes, rivers, or aquifers. The water in lakes, rivers, and aquifers then either evaporates back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean, completing a cycle. Water changes its state of being several times throughout this cycle.

The areas of research within hydrology concern the movement of water between its various states, or within a given state, or simply quantifying the amounts in these states in a given region. Parts of hydrology concern developing methods for directly measuring these flows or amounts of water, while others concern modelling these processes either for scientific knowledge or for making prediction in practical applications.

=== Groundwater ===
[[File:Building a map of groundwater countours.gif|thumb|250px|right|Building a map of groundwater contours]]
Ground water is water beneath Earth's surface, often pumped for drinking water.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt; Groundwater hydrology ([[hydrogeology]]) considers quantifying groundwater flow and solute transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graf|first1=T.|last2=Simmons|first2=C. T.|title=Variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport in fractured rock: Applicability of the Tang et al. [1981] analytical solution|journal=Water Resources Research|date=February 2009|volume=45|issue=2|page=W02425|doi=10.1029/2008WR007278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems in describing the saturated zone include the characterization of aquifers in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure and, by inference, groundwater depth (see: [[aquifer test]]). Measurements here can be made using a [[piezometer]]. Aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic conductivity, storativity and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical methods&lt;ref name=Vereecken /&gt; for characterising aquifers. There are also problems in characterising the vadose zone (unsaturated zone).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;

=== Infiltration ===
{{Main|Infiltration (hydrology)}}
Infiltration is the process by which water enters the soil. Some of the water is absorbed, and the rest [[Percolation|percolates]] down to the [[water table]]. The infiltration capacity, the maximum rate at which the soil can absorb water, depends on several factors. The layer that is already saturated provides a resistance that is proportional to its thickness, while that plus the depth of water above the soil provides the driving force ([[hydraulic head]]). Dry soil can allow rapid infiltration by [[capillary action]]; this force diminishes as the soil becomes wet. [[Compaction (geology)|Compaction]] reduces the porosity and the pore sizes. Surface cover increases capacity by retarding runoff, reducing compaction and other processes. Higher temperatures reduce [[viscosity]], increasing infiltration.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddy|first1=P. Jaya Rami|title=A textbook of hydrology|date=2007|publisher=Laxmi Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170080992|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250–275}}

=== Soil moisture ===
[[Soil moisture]] can be measured in various ways; by [[capacitance probe]], [[time domain reflectometer]] or [[Tensiometer (soil science)|Tensiometer]]. Other methods include solute sampling and geophysical methods.

=== Surface water flow ===
Hydrology considers quantifying surface water flow and solute transport, although the treatment of flows in large rivers is sometimes considered as a distinct topic of hydraulics or hydrodynamics. Surface water flow can include flow both in recognizable river channels and otherwise. Methods for measuring flow once water has reached a river include the [[stream gauge]] (see: [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]), and tracer techniques. Other topics include chemical transport as part of surface water, sediment transport and erosion.

One of the important areas of hydrology is the interchange between rivers and aquifers. Groundwater/surface water interactions in streams and aquifers can be complex and the direction of net water flux (into surface water or into the aquifer) may vary spatially along a stream channel and over time at any particular location, depending on the relationship between stream stage and groundwater levels.

=== Precipitation and evaporation ===
In some considerations, hydrology is thought of as starting at the land-atmosphere boundary{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} and so it is important to have adequate knowledge of both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation can be measured in various ways: [[disdrometer]] for precipitation characteristics at a fine time scale; [[radar]] for cloud properties, rain rate estimation, hail and snow detection; [[rain gauge]] for routine accurate measurements of rain and snowfall; [[satellite]] for rainy area identification, rain rate estimation, land-cover/land-use, and soil moisture, for example.

[[Evaporation]] is an important part of the water cycle. It is partly affected by humidity, which can be measured by a [[sling psychrometer]]. It is also affected by the presence of snow, hail and ice and can relate to dew, mist and fog. Hydrology considers evaporation of various forms: from water surfaces; as transpiration
from plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems. A direct measurement of evaporation can be obtained using Simon's [[evaporation pan]].

Detailed studies of evaporation involve boundary layer considerations as well as momentum, heat flux and energy budgets.

=== Remote sensing ===
[[Remote sensing]] of hydrologic processes can provide information on locations where ''in situ'' sensors may be unavailable or sparse. It also enables observations over large spatial extents. Many of the variables constituting the terrestrial water balance, for example [[surface water]] storage, [[soil moisture]], [[precipitation]], [[evapotranspiration]], and [[snow]] and [[ice]], are measurable using remote sensing at various spatial-temporal resolutions and accuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=Q.|last2=Gao|first2=H.|last3=Lu|first3=H.|last4=Lettenmaier|first4=D. P.|title=Remote sensing: hydrology|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|date=6 October 2009|volume=33|issue=4|pages=490–509|doi=10.1177/0309133309346650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of remote sensing include land-based sensors, airborne sensors and [[Earth observation satellite|satellite sensors]] which can capture [[Passive microwave sensor|microwave]], [[near-infrared|thermal and near-infrared]] data or use [[lidar]], for example.

=== Water quality ===
{{Main|Water quality}}

In hydrology, studies of water quality concern organic and inorganic compounds, and both dissolved and sediment material. In addition, water quality is affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with organic material and various chemical transformations that may take place. Measurements of water quality may involve either in-situ methods, in which analyses take place on-site, often automatically, and laboratory-based analyses and may include [[Bacteriological water analysis|microbiological analysis]].

=== Integrating measurement and modelling ===
* Budget analyses
* Parameter estimation
* Scaling in time and space
* [[Data assimilation]]
* Quality control of data – see for example [[Double mass analysis]]

=== Prediction ===
Observations of hydrologic processes are used to make [[predictions]] of the future behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is "Prediction in Ungauged Basins" (PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist.

=== Statistical hydrology ===
By analyzing the statistical properties of hydrologic records, such as rainfall or river flow, hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena. When making assessments of how often relatively rare events will occur, analyses are made in terms of the [[return period]] of such events. Other quantities of interest include the average flow in a river, in a year or by season.

These estimates are important for [[engineers]] and economists so that proper [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]] can be performed to influence investment decisions in future infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water supply systems. Statistical information is utilized to formulate operating rules for large dams forming part of systems which include agricultural, industrial and [[residential]] demands.

=== Modeling ===
{{main|Hydrological modelling}}
Hydrological models are simplified, conceptual representations of a part of the hydrologic cycle. They are primarily used for hydrological prediction and for understanding hydrological processes, within the general field of [[scientific modeling]]. Two major types of hydrological models can be distinguished:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* Models based on data. These models are [[Black box (systems)|black box]] systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance rainfall) to the model output (for instance [[Surface runoff|runoff]]). Commonly used techniques are [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[transfer function]]s, and [[system identification]]. The simplest of these models may be linear models, but it is common to deploy non-linear components to represent some general aspects of a catchment's response without going deeply into the real physical processes involved. An example of such an aspect is the well-known behavior that a catchment will respond much more quickly and strongly when it is already wet than when it is dry..
* Models based on process descriptions. These models try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of [[surface runoff]], [[subsurface flow]], [[evapotranspiration]], and [[open channel flow|channel flow]], but they can be far more complicated. These models are known as deterministic hydrology models. Deterministic hydrology models can be subdivided into single-event models and continuous simulation models.

Recent research in hydrological modeling tries to have a more global approach to the understanding of the [[behavioral modeling in hydrology|behavior of hydrologic systems]] to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Hydrologic transport model}}
Water movement is a significant means by which other material, such as soil, gravel, boulders or pollutants, are transported from place to place. Initial input to receiving waters may arise from a [[point source (pollution)|point source]] discharge or a [[line source]] or [[Area source (pollution)|area source]], such as [[surface runoff]]. Since the 1960s rather complex [[mathematical model]]s have been developed, facilitated by the availability of high speed computers. The most common pollutant classes analyzed are [[nutrient]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[total dissolved solids]] and [[sediment]].

'''Joan M. Gero''' (26 May 1944 – 14 July 2016) was an American archaeologist and pioneer of [[feminist archaeology]]. Her research focused on gender and power issues in prehistory, particularly in the Andean regions of Argentina and Peru.&lt;ref name="WAC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Claire|title=Joan M.

== Biography ==
Gero was born in New York City on 26 May 1944. She graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with a BA in English Literature in 1968, before receiving an M.Ed from [[Boston College]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Geller|first=Pamela|title=Gero, Joan|date=2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-0465-2_1290|work=Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology|pages=3036–3038|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0465-2_1290|isbn=9781441904263|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next two years were spent teaching socioeconomically disadvantaged groups with the [[Teacher Corps]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1972 Gero studied archaeology during a summer course in Oxford, excavating at an Iron Age site in Wiltshire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1974 Gero began graduate studies at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], with Martin Wobst,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; gaining a Phd in Anthropology in 1983.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gero taught at the [[University of South Carolina]] from 1983 to 1997.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

With [[Margaret Conkey]] she co-edited the groundbreaking 1991 volume ''Engendering Archaeology: Women and Prehistory'', reprinted six times, which stemmed from a 1988 conference “Women and Production in Prehistory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gero|first1=Joan|title=Engendering Archaeology|date=1991|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0631175016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Gero  has held visiting professorships at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], the [[National University of Catamarca|Universidad Nacional de Catamarca]], the [[Umeå University|University of Umeå]], [[Uppsala University|University of Uppsala]], and the Universidad Nacional del Centro de Buenos Aires, Olavarría, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://worldarch.org/blog/joan-m-gero-1944-2016/|title=Joan M.

'''Men's studies in the Caribbean''' is an emerging interdisciplinary field that has its roots in family studies programs of the 1950s and 60s, and in feminine studies programs of the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref name=Barrow&gt;Barrow, Christine. (1998). "Caribbean Gender Ideologies: Introduction and Overview". In Christine Barrow (Ed.), Caribbean Portraits: essays on Gender Ideologies and Identities, pp.xi-xxxviii. Kingston, Jamaica: Ian Randle Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Caribbean]], [[gender studies]] have concentrated primarily on "retrieving Caribbean women from historical 'invisibility'",&lt;ref name=Downes&gt;Downes, Aviston, D. (2004). "Boys of the Empire: Elite Education and the Construction of Hegemonic Masculinity in Barbados, 1875-1920". In Rhoda Reddock (Ed.), Interrogating Caribbean Masculinities: Theoretical and Empirical Analyses, pp.105-136. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press&lt;/ref&gt; but [[men's studies]] is also becoming increasingly popular.

== History ==
In 1991 Barry Chevannes formed Fathers Incorporated, a group catering largely to working-class Jamaican men. The group aimed to counter negative stereotypes of men in the region and to install a sense of responsibility in men towards their children and society. Since 1997, Fathers Incorporated has presented an annual "Model Father" award to recognize fathers who "love, nurture, and provide for their families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fathers Incorporated - Jamaica | work=The Communication Initiative Network| url =http://www.comminit.com/en/node/118995| accessdate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre for Gender and Development Studies, established by the University of the West Indies (UWI) in 1993, contributes to the scholarship on Caribbean masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fathers Incorporated - Jamaica | work=The Communication Initiative Network| url =http://gender.uwichill.edu.bb/| accessdate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses on men's studies have been introduced on all three campuses of the university.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt; Scholarship on Caribbean masculinity began with a focus on male marginalization within both the education system and the family.

== Male marginalization within the family ==
The Caribbean family has been the subject of continuing scholarly attention since the 1930s, likely due to the seemingly matrifocal family structure.&lt;ref name=Morrissey&gt;Morrissey, Marietta. (1998). "Explaining the Caribbean Family: Gender Ideologies and Gender Relations". In Christine Barrow (Ed.), Caribbean Portraits: essays on Gender Ideologies and Identities, pp.78-90. Kingston, Jamaica: Ian Randle Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  On average, the woman-headed family would earn less than a male-headed family.  Marietta Morrissey noted that male migration was often a factor in these women-headed families and that it was not unusual for men to be absent for years.  These men would send back money whenever possible to support their families.&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;  Although men did not always reside with their families, they did maintain influence, causing Morrissey to comment that, “male authority embodied in the patriarchal family is often an ideal in so-called matrifocal societies.”&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;  Caribbean societies are not strictly matrifocal because families move in and out of matrifocality. They try to establish nuclear families, sometimes successfully, but may return to a matrifocal structure if the attempt ends in failure.&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;  Age can be a factor in whether or not a nuclear family structure is established because older men are often in better positions to support women and children.&lt;ref name=Morrissey/&gt;

Despite claims of objectivity from anthropologists in the 1950s, early Caribbean anthropology showed marked ethnocentrism in labeling non-nuclear family structures "incomplete". It also failed to recognize visiting unions, regardless of the duration of a couple’s relationship or the presence of children in the union.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt;

According to the male marginalization theory, men are peripheral to the family.  The familial roles of men are perceived as being limited to providing economic support and occasional discipline,&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt; yet men are commonly seen to be inadequate even in these limited roles. Although the stereotype of the breadwinner is particularly prevalent in Caribbean masculinity, little employment is available to men and they must migrate elsewhere to provide for their families.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt;   Christine Barrow challenges the idea of male marginalization in the family and suggested that Caribbean men show strong bonds to their mothers.  Males commonly lived with, and assumed responsibility for, their mothers well into adulthood, a task they saw as natural reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt; In addition, they often took responsibility for their siblings, and more rarely for their nieces and nephews.

== Male academic underachievement ==
Mark Figueroa wrote that the "decline of male, relative to female, academic performance in the Caribbean… has captured the attention of professionals."&lt;ref name=Figueroa&gt;Figueroa, Mark. (2004). "Male Privileging and Male "Academic Underperformance" in Jamaica". In Rhonda Reddock (Ed.), Interrogating Caribbean Masculinities: Theoretical and Empirical Analyses, pp.137-166. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the common entrance examination, the first level of testing, Jamaican females achieve a higher number of places than males.  This includes discriminatory practices employed in some Caribbean territories, which favor male students to redress the balance.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;  The imbalance in academic performance continues at the university level.  By the end of 1992, 70% of graduates from the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies were female, and Odette Parry's sample of Jamaican schools revealed that there is less than one male teacher for every four female ones.&lt;ref name=Barrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parry&gt;Parry, Odette. (2004). "Masculinities, Myths and Educational Underachievement: Jamaica, Barbados, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines". In Rhonda Reddock (Ed.), Interrogating Caribbean Masculinities: Theoretical and Empirical Analyses, pp.167-184. Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the theory of male marginalization, introduced by Miller, is popularly held, it has been suggested that male academic underperformance is rooted in male privileging and gender socialization.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt; At home, boys are “expected to misbehave while girls are expected to conform to a rigid code.  If a boy misbehaves it is essentially expected, but if a girl does so it is a serious matter.”&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;&lt;!--   Males inherently have more freedom in society and as a result may not have the same success in the academic system because they have not developed essential skills as females, who are required to adhere to a code of behaviour.  These skills include the ability to sit still and listen, and the ability to follow what others say rather than one’s own aims.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;
 --&gt;
Research has also indicated that male academic under-performance is misleading and that it is actually a matter of differential gender performance. Within Caribbean academia, traditional patterns of study exist.  Boys have identified English and reading as "too girlish" for males,&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt; and Parry's study indicated that even female teachers perceived English and grammar as being women's subjects.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt; Female dominance can be explained in certificate programs because "their male counterparts do not need further qualifications to get ahead."&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;

Jamaica's recent statistics on education have indicated that females now outperform males at all levels and in a wide range of disciplines, including some formerly dominated by males.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;  Women have been the majority among Jamaican students since 1974-75 across all three campuses of UWI. In 1974 women made up nearly 80% of students in the arts and education disciplines but less than 40% of students in law, medicine, and natural sciences.&lt;ref name=Figueroa/&gt;

Research has also indicated an anti-academic male sex/gender identity.  Parry wrote that “according to teachers, males are sexually rejected by their female peers”.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;

The '''George C. Marshall Space Flight Center''' ('''MSFC'''), located in Huntsville, Alabama, is the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s civilian [[rocket]]ry and [[spacecraft propulsion]] research center.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/msfcfactsheet11032016.pdf |title=Marshall Space Flight Center Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 3, 2016 |website=NASAfacts |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[NASA]] center, MSFC's first mission was developing the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn launch vehicles]] for the [[Apollo program|Apollo Moon program]]. Marshall has been the agency's lead center for [[Space Shuttle]] propulsion and its [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]]; payloads and related crew training; [[International Space Station]] (ISS) design and assembly; and computers, networks, and information management. Located on the [[Redstone Arsenal]] near [[Huntsville, Alabama]], MSFC is named in honor of [[General of the Army (United States)|Army General]] [[George Marshall]].

The center also contains the '''Huntsville Operations Support Center''' ('''HOSC'''), a facility that supports ISS launch, payload and experiment activities at the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. The HOSC also monitors rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] when a Marshall Center payload is on board.

==History==
After the end of the war with Germany in May 1945, a program was initiated to bring to the United States a number of scientists and engineers who had been at the center of Germany's advanced military technologies. The largest and best-known activity was called [[Operation Paperclip]]. In August 1945, 127 missile specialists led by [[Wernher von Braun]] signed work contracts with the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army's Ordnance Corps]]. Most of them had worked on the [[V-2]] missile development under von Braun at [[Peenemünde]]. 
Von Braun and the other Germans were sent to [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], joining the Army's newly formed Research and Development Division Sub-office (Rocket).

For the next five years, von Braun and the German scientists and engineers were primarily engaged in adapting and improving the V-2 missile for U.S. applications; testing was conducted at nearby [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico]]. Von Braun had long had a great interest in rocketry for space science and exploration. Toward this, he was allowed to use a [[WAC Corporal]] rocket as a second stage for a V-2; the combination, called Bumper, reached a record-breaking {{convert|250|mi|km}} altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Fidenbach, Peter L.; [http://nmsua.edu/tiopete/files/2008/12/wspgcoldbook.pdf "A Brief History of White Sands Proving Ground"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028154222/http://nmsua.edu/tiopete/files/2008/12/wspgcoldbook.pdf|date=2014-10-28}}, N.M. State Univ.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the production and storage of ordnance shells was conducted by three arsenals nearby to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. After the war, these were closed, and the three areas were combined to form [[Redstone Arsenal]]. In October 1948, the Chief of Ordnance designated Redstone Arsenal as the center of research and development activities in free-flight rockets and related items, and the following June, the Ordnance Rocket Center was opened. A year later, the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] approved the transfer of the rocket research and development activities from [[Fort Bliss]] to the new center at Redstone Arsenal. Beginning in April 1950, about 1,000 persons were involved in the transfer, including von Braun's group. At this time, R&amp;D responsibility for guided missiles was added, and studies began on a medium-range guided missile that eventually became the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] rocket.

Over the next decade, the missile development on Redstone Arsenal greatly expanded. Many small free-flight and guided rockets were developed, and work on the Redstone rocket got underway. Although this rocket was primarily intended for military purposes, von Braun kept space firmly in his mind, and published a widely read article on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Wernher von Braun; [[Man Will Conquer Space Soon!|"Crossing the Last Frontier"]], ''Collier's Magazine'', March 22, 1952, pp. 24–29, 72, 74&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1952, the Germans who had initially worked under individual contracts were converted to civil service employees, and in 1954-55, most became U.S. citizens. Von Braun was appointed Chief of the Guided Missile Development Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/welcome.html "Redstone Arsenal Complex Chronology, Part II: Nerve Center of Army Missilery, 1950-62 - Section B: The ABMA/AOMC Era, 1956-62"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716183621/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/welcome.html |date=2006-07-16 }}. Redstone Arsenal Historical Information. United States Army&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1954, von Braun proposed using the Redstone as the main booster of a multi-stage rocket for launching artificial satellites. A year later, a study for [[Project Orbiter]] was completed, detailing plans and schedules for a series of scientific satellites. The Army's official role in the U.S. space satellite program was delayed, however, after higher authorities elected to use the [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard rocket]] then being developed by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL).

In February 1956, the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) was established; von Braun was the director of the Development Operations Division. One of the primary programs was a {{convert|1500|mi|km|adj=on}}, single-stage missile that was started the previous year; intended for both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, this was designated the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]]. Guidance component testing for this Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) began in March 1956 on a modified Redstone missile dubbed Jupiter A while re-entry vehicle testing began in September 1956 on a Redstone with spin-stabilized upper stages named Jupiter-C. The first Jupiter IRBM flight took place from Cape Canaveral in March 1957 with the first successful flight to full range on 31 May.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Gibson, ''Nuclear Weapons of the United States, An Illustrated History'', p. 167, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., Atglen, PA, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Jupiter was eventually taken over by the U.S. Air Force. The ABMA developed [[Jupiter-C]] was composed of a Redstone rocket first stage and two upper stages for RV tests or three upper stages for Explorer satellite launches. ABMA had originally planned the 20 September 1956 flight as a satellite launch but, by direct intervention of Eisenhower, was limited to the use of 2 upper stages for an RV test flight traveling {{convert|3350|mi|km}} and attaining an altitude of {{convert|682|mi|km}}. While the Jupiter C capability was such that it could have placed the fourth stage in orbit, that mission had been assigned to the NRL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/expinfo.html "Data Sheet - Explorer-1 and Jupiter-C"], Dept. of Astronautics, National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Wolfe and W. J. Truscott, ''Juno Final Report Volume 1, Juno 1: Re-entry Test Vehicles and Explorer Satellites'', JPL, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Later Jupiter-C flights would be used to launch satellites.

The Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first man-made earth satellite, on October 4, 1957. This was followed on November 3 with the second satellite, [[Sputnik 2]]. The United States attempted a satellite launch on December 6, using the NRL's Vanguard rocket, but it barely struggled off the ground, then fell back and exploded. On January 31, 1958, after finally receiving permission to proceed, von Braun and the ABMA space development team used a Jupiter C in a [[Juno I]] configuration (addition of a fourth stage) to successfully place [[Explorer 1]], the first American satellite, into orbit around the earth.

Effective at the end of March 1958, the U.S. Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC), was established at Redstone Arsenal. This encompassed the ABMA and its newly operational space programs. In August, AOMC and [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA, a Department of Defense organization) jointly initiated a program managed by ABMA to develop a large space booster of approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust using a cluster of available rocket engines. In early 1959, this vehicle was designated [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]].

On April 2, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] recommended to Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities, and on July 29, the President signed the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], creating the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). The nucleus for forming NASA was the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), with its 7,500 employees and [[Ames Research Center]] (ARC), [[Langley Research Center]] (LaRC), and [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]] (later LRC, then Glenn RC) becoming the initial operations of NASA.

Despite the existence of an official space agency, the Army continued with certain far-reaching space programs. In June 1959, a secret study on [[Project Horizon]] was completed by ABMA, detailing plans for using the Saturn booster in establishing a manned Army outpost on the Moon. Project Horizon, however, was rejected, and the Saturn program was transferred to NASA.

[[File:army nasa transfer 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremony of transfer from Army to NASA July 1, 1960]]
The U.S. manned satellite space program, using the Redstone as a booster, was officially named [[Project Mercury]] on November 26, 1958. With a future goal of manned flight, monkeys Able and Baker were the first living creatures recovered from outer space on May 28, 1959. They had been carried in the [[nose cone]] on a Jupiter missile to an altitude of {{convert|300|mi|km}} and a distance of {{convert|1500|mi|km}}, successfully withstanding 38 times the normal pull of gravity. Their survival during speeds over 10,000 miles per hour was America's first biological step toward putting a man into space.

On October 21, 1959, President Eisenhower approved the transfer of all Army space-related activities to NASA. This was accomplished effective July 1, 1960, when 4,670 civilian employees, about $100 million worth of buildings and equipment, and {{convert|1,840|acre|km2}} of land transferred from AOMC/ABMA to NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. MSFC officially opened at Redstone Arsenal on this same date, then was dedicated on September 8 by President Eisenhower in person. The Center was named in honor of [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]], Army [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff]] during World War II, [[United States Secretary of State]], and [[Nobel Prize]] winner for his world-renowned [[Marshall Plan]].

==Capabilities and projects==
From its initiation, MSFC has been NASA's lead center for the development of rocket propulsion systems and technologies. During the 1960s, the activities were largely devoted to the [[Apollo Program]] – man's first visit to the Moon. In this, the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn Family]] of launch vehicles were designed and tested at MSFC. Following the highly successful [[Moon landing]], including initial scientific exploration, MSFC had a major role in Post-Apollo activities; this included [[Skylab]], the United States' first space station. With a permanent space station as an objective, the [[Space Shuttle]] was developed as a reusable transportation vehicle, and with it came [[Spacelab]] and other experimental activities making use of the Shuttle’ cargo bay. These and other projects are described in a later section. But first, MSFC's present capabilities and projects are addressed.

===Present and future – 2000s onward===
Marshall Space Flight Center has capabilities and projects supporting NASA's mission in three key areas: lifting from Earth (Space Vehicles), living and working in space (International Space Station), and understanding our world and beyond (Advanced Scientific Research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/missions/index.html|title=Marshall Missions|first=Jennifer|last=Harbaugh|date=3 March 2015|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space vehicles====
MSFC is NASA's designated developer and integrator of launch systems. The state-of-the-art Propulsion Research Laboratory serves as a leading national resource for advanced space propulsion research. Marshall has the engineering capabilities to take space vehicles from initial concept to sustained service. For manufacturing, the world's largest-known welding machine of its type was installed at MSFC in 2008; it is capable of building major, defect-free components for manned-rated space vehicles.

In early March 2011, NASA Headquarters announced that MSFC will lead the efforts on a new heavy-lift rocket that, like the Saturn V of the lunar exploration program of the late 1960s, will carry large, [[Human-rating certification|man-rated]]  payloads beyond low-Earth orbit. The Center will have the program office for what is being called the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://marshallstar.msfc.nasa.gov/3-3-11.pdf "SLS program office at Marshall"], ''Marshall Star'', March 3, 2011, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Constellation Program=====
Before it was cancelled by President [[Barack Obama]] in early 2010, the [[Constellation Program]] had been a major activity in NASA since 2004. In this program, MSFC was responsible for propulsion on the heavy-lift vehicles. These vehicles were designated [[Ares I]] and [[Ares V]], and would replace the aging [[Space Shuttle]] fleet as well as transport humans to the Moon, Mars, and other deep-space destinations.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, John F.; [http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf "Constellation Program Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710060512/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf |date=2007-07-10 }}", NASA Constellation Program Office, October 2006; .&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, the MSFC Exploration Launch Projects Office began work on the Ares projects. On October 28, 2009, an Ares I-X test rocket lifted off from the newly modified [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) for a two-minute powered flight; then continued for four additional minutes traveling {{convert|150|mi|km}} down range.

=====Space Shuttle=====
MSFC had responsibility for the Space Shuttle's propulsion engines. On February 1, 2003, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] occurred, with the orbiter disintegrating during reentry and resulting in the death of its seven crew members. Flights of the other Shuttles were put on hold for 29 months. Based on a seven-month investigation, including a ground search that recovered debris from about 38 percent of the Orbiter, together with telemetry data and launch films, indicated that the failure was caused by a piece of insulation that broke off the [[external tank]] during launch and damaged the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection]] on the Orbiter's left wing.

MSFC was responsible for the external tank, but few or no changes to the tank were made; rather, NASA decided that it was inevitable that some insulation might be lost during launch and thus required that an inspection of the orbiter's critical elements be made prior to reentry on future flights.

NASA retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, leaving America dependent upon the Russian  [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|''Soyuz'']] spacecraft for manned space missions.

=====Orbital Space Plane=====
The initial plans for the Space Station envisaged a small, low-cost [[Crew Return Vehicle]] (CRV) that would provide emergency evacuation capability. The 1986 Challenger disaster led planners to consider a more capable spacecraft. The [[Orbital Space Plane]] (OSP) development got underway in 2001, with an early version expected to enter service by 2010. With the initiation of the Constellation program in 2004, the knowledge gained on the OSP was transferred to Johnson Space Center (JSC) for use in the development of the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]]. No operational OSP was ever built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/ospfacts.html "Beginning a New Era of Space Flight: The Orbital Space Plane"] MSFC Fact Sheet, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====International Space Station====
The [[International Space Station]] is a partnership of the United States, Russian, European, Japanese, and Canadian Space Agencies. The station has continuously had human occupants since November 2, 2000. Orbiting 16 times daily at an average altitude of about {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}}, it passes over some 90 percent of the world's surface. It weighs over {{convert|800,000|lb|kg}}, and a crew of six conducts research and prepares the way for future explorations.

NASA began the plan to build a space station in 1984. The station was named ''Freedom'' in 1988, and changed to the International Space Station (ISS) in 1992. The ISS is composed in modules, and the assembly in orbit started with the delivery of Russian module [[Zarya (spacecraft)|''Zarya'']] in November 1998. This was followed in December by the first U.S. module, ''Unity'' also called Node 1, built by Boeing in facilities at MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/docs/ISS_overview.pdf|title=Boeing: International Space Station|author=|date=|website=www.boeing.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 21st century started, Space Shuttle flights carried up supplies and additional small equipment, including a portion of the solar power array. The two-module embryonic ISS remained unmanned until the next module, [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'']], the U.S. Laboratory, arrived on February 7, 2001; this module was also built by Boeing at MSFC. The three-module station allowed a minimum crew of two astronauts or cosmonauts to be on the ISS permanently. In July, [[Quest Joint Airlock|''Quest'']] air-lock was added to ''Unity'', providing the capability for [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).

Since 1998, 18 major U.S. components on the ISS have been assembled in space. In October 2007, [[Harmony (ISS module)|''Harmony'']] or Node 2, was attached to ''Destiny''; also managed by MSFC, this gave connection hubs for European and Japanese modules as well as additional living space, allowing the ISS crew to increase to six. The 18th and final major U.S. and Boeing-built element, the Starboard 6 Truss Segment, was delivered to the ISS in February 2009. With this, the full set of solar arrays could be activated, increasing the power available for science projects to 30&amp;nbsp;kW. That marked the completion of the U.S. "core" of the station.

On 5 March 2010, Boeing turned over to NASA the U.S. on-orbit segment of the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2010-03-05-Boeing-Transfers-US-Portions-of-International-Space-Station-to-NASA|title=Boeing Transfers US Portions of International Space Station to NASA|last=|first=|date=5 March 2010|website=Boeing|publisher=Boeing|access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is planned that the International Space Station will be operated at least through the end of 2020. With the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011, future manned missions to the ISS will depend upon the Russian ''Soyuz'' spacecraft for the immediate future.

====Advanced scientific research====
MSFC is involved in some of the most advanced space research of our time. Scientist/Astronaut researchers aboard the [[International Space Station]] are engaged in hundreds of advanced experiments, most of which could not be conducted except for the zero-gravity environment. The deep-space images from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] are made possible in part by the people and facilities at Marshall. The Center was not only responsible for the design, development, and construction of these telescopes, but it is also now home to the only facility in the world for testing large telescope mirrors in a space-simulated environment. Preliminary work has started on a Hubble successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST); this will be the largest primary mirror ever assembled in space. In the future, the facility will likely be used for another successor, the [[Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope]] (AT-LAST).

The [[National Space Science and Technology Center]] (NSSTC) is a joint research venture between NASA and the seven research universities of the State of Alabama. The primary purpose of NSSTC is to foster collaboration in research between government, academia, and industry. It consists of seven research centers: Advanced Optics, Biotechnology, Global Hydeology &amp; Climate, Information Technology, Material Science, Propulsion, and Space Science. Each center is managed by either MSFC, the host NASA facility, or the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]], the host university.

=====Deep-space astronomy=====
The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was launched in April 1990, but gave flawed images. It had been designed at MSFC, but used a primary mirror that had [[spherical aberration]] due to incorrect grinding and polishing by the contractor. The defect was found when the telescope was in orbit. The design was such that repairs were possible, and three maintenance missions were flown in Shuttles during the 1990s. Another servicing mission (STS-109) was flown on March 1, 2002. Each mission resulted in considerable improvements, with the images receiving worldwide attention from astronomers as well as the public.

Based on the success of earlier maintenance missions, NASA decided to have a fifth service mission to Hubble; this was STS-125 flown on May 11, 2009. The maintenance and addition of equipment resulted in Hubble performance considerably better than planned at its origin. It is now expected that the Hubble will remain operational until its successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST), is available in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/about.html|title=About Webb/NASA|author=|date=|website=www.jwst.nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts125/main/overview.html|title=NASA - STS-125: The Final Visit|first=Jerry Wright :|last=JSC|date=|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further information|#Hubble Space Telescope}}

The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], originating at MSFC, was launched on July 3, 1999, and is operated by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]]. With an [[angular resolution]] of 0.5 [[arcsecond]] (2.4 µrad), it has a thousand times better resolution than the first orbiting X-ray telescopes. Its highly [[eliptical]] orbit allows continuous observations up to 85 percent of its 65-hour [[orbital period]]. With its ability to make X-ray images of star clusters, supernova remnants, galactic eruptions, and collisions between clusters of galaxies - in its first decade of operation it has transformed astronomer's view of the high-energy universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/ten/|title=Chandra :: About Chandra :: The Extraordinary Universe with Chandra|author=|date=|website=chandra.harvard.edu|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], initially called the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), is an international, multi-agency space observatory used to study the cosmos. It was launched June 11, 2008, has a design life of 5 years and a goal of 10 years. The primary instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT) that is sensitive in the photon energy range of 8 to greater than 300 GeV. It can view about 20% of the sky at any given moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/spacecraft/index.html "Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope"], NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

The LAT is complemented by the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) which can detect burst of X-rays and gamma rays in the 8-keV to 3-MeV energy range, overlapping with the LAT. The GBM is a collaborative effort between the U.S. [[National Space Science and Technology Center]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] in Germany. MSFC manages the GBM, and Charles A. Meegan of MSFC is the Principal Investigator. Many new discoveries have been made in the initial period of operation. For example, on May 10, 2009, a burst was detected that, by its propagation characteristics, is believed to negate some approaches to a new theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/first_year.html NASA - Fermi Telescope Caps First Year With Glimpse of Space-Time]. Nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), with [[Gerald J. Fishman]] of MSFC serving as Principal Investigator, is an ongoing examination of the many years of data from gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, and other transient gamma-ray phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gamma-Ray Astronomy Team Home Page; {{cite web |url=http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108070046/http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[Shaw Prize]], often called "Asia's Nobel Prize," was shared by Fishman and Italian astronomer [[Enrico Costa (physicist)|Enrico Costa]] for their gamma-ray research.&lt;ref&gt;Roop, Lee; "Gamma rays lead to glory," ''The Huntsville Times'', June 16, 2011, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Research in the ISS=====
For 10 years, MSFC has supported activities in the U.S. Laboratory (''Destiny'') and elsewhere on the International Space Station through the [[Payload Operations and Integration Center|Payload Operations Center]] (POC). The research activities include experiments on topics ranging from human physiology to physical science. Operating around the clock, scientists, engineers, and flight controllers in the POC link Earth-bound researchers throughout the world with their experiments and astronauts aboard the ISS. {{As of|2011|03}}, this has included the coordination of more than 1,100 experiments conducted by 41 space-station crew members involved in over 6,000 hours of science research.

=====Solar system research=====
Teams at Marshall manage NASA's programs for exploring the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and other bodies throughout our solar system. These have included [[Gravity Probe B]], an experiment to test two predictions of Einstein's general theory of relativity, and [[Hinode|Solar-B]], an international mission to study the solar magnetic field and origins of the solar wind, a phenomenon that affects radio transmission on the Earth. The MSFC Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program Office manages projects and directs studies on lunar robotic activities across NASA.

=====Climate and weather research=====
MSFC also develops systems for monitoring the Earth's climate and weather patterns. At the Global Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC), researchers combine data from Earth systems with satellite data to monitor biodiversity conservation and climate change, providing information that improves agriculture, urban planning, and water-resource management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/ GHCC / Earth Science Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224052901/http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2011-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Microsatellites=====
On November 19, 2010, MSFC entered the new field of microsatellites with the successful launch of  [[FASTSAT]]  (Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology Satellite). Part of a joint DoD/NASA payload, it was launched by a [[Minotaur IV]] rocket from the [[Kodiak Launch Complex]] on [[Kodiak Island]], Alaska. FASTSAT is a platform carrying multiple small payloads to low-Earth orbit, creating opportunities to conduct low-cost scientific and technology research on an autonomous satellite in space. FASTSAT, weighing just under {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, serves as a full scientific laboratory containing all the resources needed to carry out scientific and technology research operations. It was developed at the MSFC in partnership with the Von Braun Center for Science &amp; Innovation and Dynetics, Inc., both of Huntsville, Alabama. Mark Boudreaux is the project manager for MSFC.

There are six experiments on the FASTSAT bus, including [[NanoSail-D2]], which is itself a nanosatellite – the first satellite launched from another satellite. It was deployed satisfactorily on January 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/fastsat/ "FASTSAT Latest News and Update"] MSFC Data&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spinoffs====
In addition to supporting NASA's key missions, the spinoffs from these activities at MSFC have contributed broadly to technologies that improve the Nation and the World. In the last decade alone, Marshall generated more than 60 technologies featured as NASA spinoffs. MSFC research has benefited firefighters, farmers, plumbers, healthcare providers, soldiers, teachers, pilots, divers, welders, architects, photographers, city planners, disaster relief workers, criminal investigators, and even video-gamers and golfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ "Value for NASA, Benefits for the Nation]" Office of the Chief Technologist, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s – the Shuttle era===
The [[Space Shuttle]] is likely the most complex spacecraft ever built. Although MSFC was not responsible for developing the centerpiece – the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) – it was responsible for all of the rocket propulsion elements: the OV's three main engines, the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] (ET), and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid-Rocket Boosters]] (SRBs). MSFC was also responsible for [[Spacelab]], the research facility carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on certain flights. From the start of the program in 1972, the management and development of Space Shuttle propulsion was a major activity at MSFC. [[Alex McCool|Alex A. McCool, Jr.]] was manager of MSFC's Space Shuttle Projects Office.

====Shuttle propulsion====
Throughout 1980, engineers at MSFC participated in tests related to plans to launch the first Space Shuttle. During these early tests and prior to each later Shuttle launch, personnel in the Huntsville Operations Support Center monitored consoles to evaluate and help solve any problems at the Florida launch that might involve Shuttle propulsion

On April 12, 1981, [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] made the first orbital test flight of a full Space Shuttle with two astronauts. This was designated [[STS-1]] (Space Transportation System-1), and verified the combined performance of the entire system. This was followed by [[STS-2]] on November 12, also using ''Columbia'', primarily to demonstrate safe re-launch of a Shuttle. During 1982, two more test flights ([[STS-3]] &amp; [[STS-4]]) were made. [[STS-5]], launched November 11, was the first operational mission; carrying four astronauts, two commercial satellite were deployed. In all three of these flights, on-board experiments were carried and conducted on pallets in the Shuttle's cargo bay.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of space shuttle missions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] was launched on mission [[STS-51-L]] on January 28, 1986. (The sequential numbering changed after 1983, but otherwise this would have been STS-25). One-minute, 13-seconds into flight, the entire ''Challenger'' was [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|enveloped in a fireball and broke into several large segments, killing the seven astronauts]]. Subsequent analysis of the high-speed tracking films and telemetry signals indicated that a leak occurred in a joint on one of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters (SRBs)]], the escaping flame impinged on the surface of the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank (ET)]]; there followed a complex series of very rapid structural failures, and in milliseconds the hydrogen and oxygen streaming from the ruptured tank exploded.

The basic cause of the disaster was determined to be an [[O-ring]] failure in the right SRB; cold weather was a contributing factor. The redesign effort, directed by MSFC, involved an extensive test program to verify that the SRBs were safe. There were no Space Shuttle missions in the remainder of 1986 or in 1987. Flights resumed in September 1988, with sequential numbering starting with [[STS-26]].

====Shuttle missions and payloads====
As a reusable space-launch vehicle, the space shuttles carried a wide variety of payloads – from scientific research equipment to highly classified military satellites. The flights were assigned a Space Transportation System (STS) number, in general sequenced by the planned launch date. The Wikipedia [[list of space shuttle missions]] shows all flights, their missions, and other information.

The first orbital flight (STS-1) by Shuttle ''Columbia'' on April 12, 1981, did not have a payload, but all flights that followed generally had multiple payloads. Through 1989, there were 32 flights; this includes the one on January 28, 1986, when ''Challenger'' was lost, and the delay until September 29, 1988, when flights resumed. During the 1990s, there were 58 flights, giving a total of 95 successful flights through 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/missions.html Space Shuttle Launch Archive]. Science.ksc.nasa.gov (2003-02-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]] planetary spacecraft, MSFC managed the adaptation of the [[Inertial Upper Stage]]. This solid-rocket was used in May 1989 to propel the spacecraft from Orbiter ''Atlantis'' on a 15-month loop around the Sun and eventually into orbit around Venus for four years of radar surface-mapping.

Many Shuttle flights carried equipment for performing on-board research. Such equipment was accommodated in two forms: on pallets or other arrangements in the Shuttle's cargo bay (most often in addition to hardware for the primary mission), or within a reusable laboratory called Skylab. All such experimental payloads were under the general responsibility of MSFC.

=====Pallet experiments=====
Pallet experiments covered a very wide spread of types and complexity, but many of them were in fluid physics, materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, and commercial space processing. For some missions, an aluminum bridge fitting across the cargo bay was used. This could carry 12 standard canisters holding isolated experiments, particularly those under the [[Getaway Special]] (GAS) program. GAS flights were made available at low cost to colleges and universities, American industries, individuals, foreign governments, and others.

On some flights, a variety of pallet experiments constituted the full payload; examples of these include the following:

*[[STS-35|Astronomy Laboratory-1]] (ASTRO-1) was developed by Goddard Space Flight Center and flown on STS-35 in December 1990. The $150-million payload included an X-ray telescope and three ultraviolet (UV) telescopes. The displays to be used by the on-board scientist-astronaut to aim the UV telescopes failed. An astronomer in the MSFC Payload Control Center then did the telescope pointing.
*[[STS-45|Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science]] (ATLAS 1) was carried on STS-45 launched in March 1992. This had l2 instruments from the U.S., France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Japan. Experiments were conducted in atmospheric chemistry, solar radiation, space plasma physics, and ultraviolet astronomy.

=====Spacelab=====
In addition to the pallet experiments, many other experiments were flown and performed using [[Spacelab]]. This was a reusable laboratory consisting of multiple components, including a pressurized module, an unpressurized carrier, and other related hardware. Under a program managed by MSFC, ten Europeans nations jointly designed, built, and financed the first Spacelab through the European Space Research Organisation ([[ESRO]]. In addition, Japan funded a Spacelab for STS-47, a dedicated mission.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Douglas R.; [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19880009991 "Spacelab: An international success story"] NASA, Jan. 1, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a 15-year period, Spacelab components flew on 22 shuttle missions, the last in April 1998. Examples of Spacelab missions follow:

*[[STS-9|Spacelab 1]] was flown on STS-9, launched November 28, 1983. A Shuttle ''Columbia'' flight, this was the first with six astronauts, including two Payload Specialists from the ESRO. There were 73 experiments carried out in astronomy and physics, atmospheric physics, Earth observations, life sciences, materials sciences, and space plasma physics
*[[STS-50|U.S. Microgravity Laboratory 1]] (USML-1) was launched in June 1992 on STS-50, the first [[Extended Duration Orbiter]]. During 14 days, 31 microgravity experiments were completed in round-the-clock operations. [[STS-73|USML-2]] was launched in October 1995 on STS-73 with an MSFC scientist, [[Frederick W. Leslie]], as an on-board Payload Specialist.

In early 1990, MSFC's new Spacelab Mission Operations Control Center took over the responsibility for controlling all Spacelab missions. This replaced the Payload Operations Control Center formerly situated at the JSC from which previous Spacelab missions were operated.&lt;ref&gt;"Spacelab Mission Operations Control Facility," MSFC Fact Sheet, May 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other major programs====
The advent of the Space Shuttle made possible several major space programs in which MSFC had significant responsibilities. These were the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. The latter three are part of NASA's series of  [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]; this series also includes the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], but this was not launched by a Space Shuttle and MSFC had no significant role in its development.

=====International Space Station=====
A manned space station had long been in the plans of visionaries. Wernhar von Braun, in his widely read ''Collier's Magazine'' 1953 article, envisioned this to be a huge wheel, rotating to produce gravity-like forces on the occupants.&lt;ref&gt;''Opt.Cet.''; Wernher von Braun; "Crossing the Last Frontier,"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Project Horizon]], prepared by the U.S. Army in 1959, a space station would be built by assembling spent booster rockets. Following this same basic concept, in 1973 MSFC used a modified stage of Saturn V to put into orbit [[Skylab]], but this was preceded by the Soviet Union's ''[[Salyut]]'' in 1971, then followed by their ''[[Mir]]'' in 1986. Even during Skylab, MSFC began plans for a much more complete space station. President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced plans to build [[Space Station Freedom]] in 1984. Luther B. Powell was MSFC's space station program manager.

By the late 1990s, planning for four different stations were underway: the American ''Freedom'', the Soviet/Russian ''[[Mir-2]]'', the European ''Columbus'', and the Japanese ''[[Japanese Experimental Module|Kibō]]''. In June 1992, with the [[Cold War]] over, American President [[George H. W. Bush]] and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] agreed to cooperate on space exploration. Then in September 1993, American Vice-President [[Al Gore, Jr.]], and Russian Prime Minister [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] announced plans for a new space station. In November, plans for ''Freedom'', ''Mir-2'', and the European and Japanese modules were incorporated into a single [[International Space Station]]. Boeing began as NASA's prime contractor for U.S. hardware in January 1995.

The ISS is composed of a number of modules, sharing primary power from large arrays of solar power cells. The first module, ''[[Zarya]]'' from Russia, was delivered to orbit by a [[Proton rocket]] on November 20, 1998. On December 4, the first American component,  [[Unity (ISS module)|''Unity'']], a connecting module, was carried up by Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' on flight STS-88; it was then joined with ''Zarya'' to form an embrionic ISS.  ''Unity'' was built by Boeing in MSFC facilities. Additional building supplies were carried to the ISS in May 1999, aboard STS-96.

The ISS continued to be assembled throughout the next decade, and has been continuously occupied since February 7, 2001. In March 2010, Boeing completed its contract and officially turned over to NASA the U.S. on-orbit segment of the ISS.

=====Hubble Space Telescope=====
Shortly after NASA was formed, the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] was launched, and was followed by the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory]] (OAO) that carried out ultraviolet observations of stars between 1968 and 1972. These showed the value of space-based astronomy, and led to the planning of the Large Space Telescope (LST) that would be launched and maintained from the forthcoming space shuttle. Budget limitations almost killed the LST, but the astronomy community – especially [[Lyman Spitzer]] – and the National Science Foundation pressed for a major program in this area. Congress finally funded LST in 1978, with an intended launch date of 1983.

MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GFC) was to control the scientific instrument and the ground-control center. As the Project Scientist, MSFC brought on board C. Robert O’Dell, then chairman of the Astronomy Department at the [[University of Chicago]]. Several different people, at various times, served as the project manager. The telescope assembly was designed as a [[Cassegrain reflector]] with hyperbolic mirror polished to be [[diffraction limited]]; the primary mirror had a diameter of {{convert|2.4|m|in|abbr=on}}. The mirrors were developed by the optics firm, Perkin-Elmer. MSFC did not have a facility to check the ‘end-to-end’ performance of the mirror assembly, so the telescope could not be totally checked until launched and placed in service.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Robert; ''The Universe in a Mirror: The Saga of the Hubble Space Telescope and Visionaries Who Built It''; Princeton Univ. Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The LST was named the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 1983, the original launch date. There were many problems, delays, and cost increases in the program, and the ''Challenger'' disaster delayed the availability of the launch vehicle. Finally, on April 24, 1990, on Mission STS-31, Shuttle ''Discovery'' launched the Hubble telescope successfully into its planned orbit. Almost immediately it was realized that the optical performance was not as expected; analysis of the flawed images showed that the primary mirror had been ground to the wrong shape, resulting in [[spherical aberration]].

Fortunately, the Hubble telescope had been designed to allow in-space maintenance, and in December 1993, mission STS-61 carried astronauts to the Hubble to make corrections and change some components. A second repair mission, STS-82, was made in February 1997, and a third, STS-103, in December 1999. For these repair missions, the astronauts practiced the work in MSFC's Neutral Buoyancy Facility, simulating the weightless environment of space.

Through the 1990s, the Hubble did provide astronomy images that had never before been seen. During the next decade, two additional repair missions were made (March 2002 and in May 2009), eventually bringing the telescope to even better that its initially intended performance.

=====Chandra X-Ray Observatory=====
Even before HEAO-2 (the [[Einstein Observatory]]) was launched in 1978, MSFC began preliminary studies for a larger X-ray telescope. To support this effort, in 1976 an X-Ray Test Facility, the only one of its size, was constructed at Marshall for verification testing and calibration of X-ray mirrors, telescope systems, and instruments. With the success of HEAO-2, MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of what was then known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). The [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) partners with MSFC, providing the science and operational management.

Work on the AXAF continued through the 1980s. A major review was held in 1992, resulting in many changes; four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. The planned circular orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one-third of the way to the Moon at its farthest point; this eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair using the Space Shuttle, but it placed the spacecraft above the Earth's radiation belts for most of its orbit.

AXAF was renamed [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] in 1998. It was launched July 23, 1999, by the Shuttle ''Columbia'' (STS-93). An [[Inertial Upper Stage]] booster adapted by MSFC was used to transport ''Chandra'' to its high orbit Weighing about {{convert|22,700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, this was the heaviest payload ever launched by a Shuttle. Operationally managed by the SAO, ‘’Chandra’’ has been returning excellent data since being activated. It initially had an expected life of five years, but this has now been extended to 15 years or longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html "Chandra: Exploring the Invisible Universe"] MSFC&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Compton Gamma Ray Observatory=====
The ''Compton'' Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) is another of NASA's Great Observatories; it was launched April 5, 1991, on Shuttle flight STS-37. At {{convert|37,000|lb|kg}}, it was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time. CGRO was 14 years in development by NASA; TRW was the builder. Gamma radiation (rays) is the highest energy-level of electromagnetic radiation, having energies above 100 [[electronvolt|keV]] and thus frequencies above 10 [[hertz|exahertz]] (10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Hz). This is produced by [[atom|sub-atomic]] particle interactions, including those in certain astrophysical processes. The continuous flow of cosmic rays bombarding space objects, such as the Moon, generate this radiation Gamma rays also result in bursts from nuclear reactions. The CGRO was designed to image continuous radiation and to detect bursts.

MSFC was responsible for the Burst and Transient Source Experiment, (BATSE). This triggered on sudden changes in gamma count-rates lasting 0.1 to 100 s; it was also capable of detecting less impulsive sources by measuring their modulation using the Earth [[occultation]] technique. In nine years of operation, BATSE triggered about 8000 events, of which some 2700 were strong bursts that were analyzed to have come from distant galaxies.

Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, the CGRO was not designed for on-orbit repair and refurbishment. Thus, after one of its gyroscopes failed, NASA decided that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down on its own at random. On June 4, 2000, it was intentionally de-orbited, with the debris that did not burn up falling harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. At MSFC, [[Gerald J. Fishman]] is the principal investigator of a project to continue examination of data from BATSE and other gamma-ray projects. The 2011 [[Shaw Prize]] was shared by Fishman and Italian [[Enrico Costa (physicist)|Enrico Costa]] for their gamma-ray research.

===1960s and 1970s – the initial decades===
[[File:MSFC rocket park.jpg|thumb|Rockets developed at MSFC and ABMA before it are on display at MSFC.]]
Shortly before activating its new Field Center in July 1960, NASA described the MSFC as the only self-contained organization in the nation that was capable of conducting the development of a space vehicle from the conception of the idea, through production of hardware, testing, and launching operations.

Initially, engineers from Huntsville traveled to Florida to conduct launch activities at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. The first NASA launch facility there ([[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]]) was designed and operated by MSFC, then in on July 1, 1962, the overall site achieving equal status with other NASA centers and was named the Launch Operations Center, later renamed the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC).

Another major NASA facility, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) located near [[Houston, Texas]], was officially opened in September 1963. Designated the primary center for U.S. space missions and systems involving astronauts, it coordinates and monitors crewed missions through the Mission Control Center. MSC was renamed the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in February 1973. Through the years, there have been a number of ‘turf’ battles between MSFC and MSC/JSC concerning mission responsibilities.

When the Marshall Space Flight Center began official operations in July 1960, Wernher von Braun was the Director and Eberhard Rees was his Deputy for Research and Development. The administrative activities in MSFC were led by persons with backgrounds in traditional U.S. Government functions, but all of the technical heads were individuals who had assisted von Braun in his success at ABMA. The initial technical activities and leaders at MSFC were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;From a NASA-MSFC Organization Chart dated May 25, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Director – [[Wernher von Braun]]
* Deputy Director for R&amp;D – [[Eberhard Rees|Eberhard F. M. Rees]]

* Quality Division – [[Dieter Grau|Dieter E. Grau]]
* Research Projects Division – [[Ernst Stuhlinger]]
* Structures &amp; Mechanics Division – [[William A. Mrazek]]
* Test Division – Karl L. Heimburg
{{div col end}}

With the exception of Koelle, all of the technical leaders had come to the United States under [[Operation Paperclip]] after working together at [[Peenemünde]]. Von Braun knew well the capabilities of these individuals and had great confidence in them. This confidence was shown to be appropriate; in the following decade of developing hardware and technical operations that established new levels of complexity, there was never a single failure of their designs during manned flight.

The initial projects at MSFC were primarily continuations of work initiated earlier at ABMA. Of immediate importance was the final preparation of a Redstone rocket that, under [[Project Mercury]] would lift a [[space capsule]] carrying the first American into space. Originally scheduled to take place in October 1960, this was postponed several time and on May 5, 1961, [[astronaut]] [[Alan Shepard]] made America's first [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]. The delays led to a circumstance similar to that of the first satellite; on April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] had become the first person to orbit the Earth.

By 1965, MSFC had about 7,500 government employees. In addition, most of the prime contractors for launch vehicles and related major items (including [[North American Aviation]], [[Chrysler]], [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft]], [[Rocketdyne]], and [[IBM]]) collectively had approximately a similar number of employees working in MSFC facilities.

Several support contracting firms were also involved in the programs; the largest of these was Brown Engineering Company (BECO, later [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Brown Engineering]]), the first high-technology firm in Huntsville and by this time having some 3,500 employees. In the Saturn-Apollo activities, BECO/TBE provided about 20-million [[man-hour]]s of support. Milton K. Cummings was the BECO president, Joseph C. Moquin the executive vice president, William A. Girdini led the engineering design and test work, and Raymond C. Watson, Jr., directed the research and advanced systems activities. [[Cummings Research Park]], the second largest park of this type in the Nation, was named for Cummings in 1973.

====Saturn launch vehicles====
On May 25, 1961, just 20 days after Shepard's flight, President [[John F. Kennedy]] committed the Nation to "achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Kennedy; "Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs." Delivered in person before a joint session of Congress, May 25, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In what would be called the [[Apollo Program]], the primary mission of MSFC was developing the heavy-lift rockets – the Saturn family. This required the development and equalization of three new liquid-fueled rocket engines, the  [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]], the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]], and the [[H-1 (rocket engine)]]; in addition, an existing engine, the [[RL10]], was improved for use on Saturns. Leland F. Belew managed the Engine Development Office.&lt;ref&gt;Bilstein, Roger E.; [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm "Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles]" NASA History Series;&lt;/ref&gt;
The F-1 engine was, and still is the most powerful single-nozzle liquid-fueled rocket engine ever used in service; each produced 1.5-million-pounds thrust. Originally started by the U.S. Air Force, responsibility for the development was taken over by ABMA in 1959, and the first test firings at MSFC were in December 1963.

=====Saturn I=====
The original vehicle, designated [[Saturn I]], consisted of two propulsion stages and an instrument unit; it was first tested in flight on October 27, 1961. The first stage (S-I) had a cluster of eight H-1 engines, giving approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust total. The four outboard engines were [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled]] to allow vehicle steering. The second stage (SIV) had six gimbaled LR10A-3 engines, producing a combined 90-thousand-pounds thrust. Ten Saturn Is were used in flight-testing of Apollo [[boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] units. Five of the test flights also carried important auxiliary scientific experiments.

=====Saturn IB=====
The [[Saturn IB]] (alternatively known as the Uprated Saturn I) also had two propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IB) also had eight H-1 engines with four gimballed, but the stage had eight fixed fins of equal size fitted to the sides to provide aerodynamic stability. The second stage (S-IVB) had a single J-2 engine that gave a more powerful 230-thousand-pounds thrust. The J-2 was gimbaled and could also be restarted during flight. The vehicle was first flight-tested on February 26, 1966. Fourteen Saturn 1Bs (or partial vehicles) were built, with five used in unmanned testing and five others used in manned missions, the last on July 15, 1975.

=====Saturn V=====
The [[Saturn V]] was the pinnacle of developments at MSFC. This was an [[expendable launch system|expendable]], [[Human-rating certification|man-rated]] heavy-lift vehicle that was the most vital element in the Apollo Program. Designed under the direction of [[Arthur Rudolph]], the Saturn V holds the record as the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever brought to operational status from a combined height, weight, and payload standpoint.

The Saturn V consisted of three propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IC), had five F-1 engines, giving a combined total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust. These engines were arranged in a cross pattern, with the center engine fixed and the outer four gimballed. The second stage (S-II), had five J-2 engines with the same arrangement as the F-1s and giving a total of 1.0-million-pounds thrust. The third stage (S-IVB) had a single gimballed J-2 engine with 200-thousand-pounds thrust. As previously noted, the J-2 engine could be restarted in flight. The basic configuration for this heavy-lift vehicle was selected in early 1963, and the name Saturn V was applied at that time (configurations that might have led to Saturn II, III, and IV were discarded).

The [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo Spacecraft]] was atop the launch vehicle, and was composed of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) inside the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter, with the [[Launch Escape System]] at the very top. The Apollo Spacecraft and its components were developed by other NASA centers, but were flight-tested on Saturn I and IB vehicles from MSFC.

While the three propulsion stages were the "muscle" of the Saturn V, the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] (IU) was the "brains." The IU was on a 260-inch (6.6-m) diameter, 36-inch (91-cm) high, ring that was held between the third propulsion stage and the LM. It contained the basic guidance system components – a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics – as well as radar, telemetry, and other units. Basically the same IU configuration was used on the Saturn I and IB. With IBM as the prime contractor, the IU was the only full Saturn component manufactured in Huntsville.

The first Saturn V test flight was made on November 9, 1967. On July 16, 1969, as its crowning achievement in the Apollo space program, a Saturn V vehicle lifted the Apollo 11 spacecraft and three astronauts on their journey to the Moon. Other Apollo launches continued through December 6, 1972. The last Saturn V flight was on May 14, 1973, in the Skylab Program (described later). A total of 15 Saturn Vs were built; 13 functioned flawlessly, and the other two (intended as backup) remain unused.

=====Fabrication and test facilities=====
Wernher von Braun believed that the personnel designing the space vehicles should have direct, hands-on participation in the building and testing of the hardware. For this, MSFC had facilities comparable with the best to be found in private industries. Included were precision machine shops, giant metal-forming and welding machines, and all types of inspection equipment. For every type of Saturn vehicle, one or more prototypes were fabricated in MSFC shops. Large, special-purpose computers were used in the checkout procedures.

Static test towers had been constructed at ABMA for the Redstone and Jupiter rockets. In 1961, the Jupiter stand was modified to test Saturn 1 and 1B stages. A number of other test stands followed, the largest being the [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]] completed in 1964. At {{convert|475|ft|m}} in height, the entire Saturn V could be accommodated. Also completed in 1964, the S1C Static Test Stand was for live firing of the five F-1 engines of the first stage. Delivering a total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust, the tests produced earthquake-like rumbles throughout the Huntsville area and could be heard as far as {{convert|100|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Pamphlet, "Propulsion Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center" 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Saturn activities progressed, external facilities were needed. In 1961, The Michoud Rocket Factory near New Orleans, Louisiana, was selected as the Saturn production site. A {{convert|13,500|acre|km2}} isolated area in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] was selected to conduct Saturn tests. Known as the Mississippi Test Facility (later renamed the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]]), this was primarily to test the vehicles built at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility|rocket factory]].

====Space Shuttle====
[[File:Space Shuttle Pathfinder OV-098 original configuration.jpg|thumb|A crane hoists [[Space Shuttle Pathfinder]] into the Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand at MSFC to test the procedures in preparation for the dynamic test of [[Space Shuttle Enterprise]].]]
On January 5, 1972, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] announced plans to develop the [[Space Shuttle]], a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) containing the crew and payload, two [[Solid Rocket Booster]]s (SRBs), and the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines. MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET. The Center also received responsibility for [[Spacelab]], a versatile laboratory that would be carried on some flights within the Shuttle's cargo bay. Other assignments included the adaptation of the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] Booster, a two-stage rocket that would lift Shuttle payloads into higher orbits or interplanetary voyages.

The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975. Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC. The first ''Enterprise'' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA – an extensively modified [[Boeing 747]]), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October. In March 1978, the ''Enterprise'' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC. Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]] where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch. The second space shuttle, ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', was completed and placed at the KSC for checking and launch preparation. On April 12, 1981, the ''Columbia'' made the first orbital test flight.

====Scientific and engineering research====
From the start, MSFC has had strong research projects in science and engineering. Two of the early activities, Highwater and Pegasus, were performed on a non-interference basis while testing the Saturn I vehicle.

=====Highwater and Pegasus=====
In [[Project Highwater]], the dummy second stage was filled with {{convert|23,000|USgal|m3}} of water as ballast, and, after burnout of the first stage, explosive charges released the water into the upper atmosphere. The project answered questions about the diffusion of liquid propellants in the event that a rocket was destroyed at high altitude. Highwater experiments were carried out in April and November,1962.

Under the [[Pegasus satellite program|Pegasus Satellite Program]], the second stage was instrumented to study the frequency and penetration depth of [[micrometeoroid]]s. Two large panels were folded into the empty stage and, when in orbit, unfolded to present 2,300-square-feet (210-m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of instrumented surface. Three Pegasus satellites were launched during 1965, and stayed in orbit from 3 to 13 years.

=====Lunar exploration=====
[[File:Lunar Roving Vehicle Mobility Test Article Dress Test.jpg|thumb|MSFC tested candidates for the Lunar Roving Vehicle on this test track.]]
The overall Apollo Program was the largest scientific and engineering research activity in history. The actual landing on the Moon led to investigations that could have only been conducted on location. There were six Apollo missions that landed on the Moon: [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 14|14]], [[Apollo 15|15]], [[Apollo 16|16]], and [[Apollo 17|17]]. [[Apollo 13]] had been intended as a landing, but only circled the Moon and returned to Earth after an oxygen tank ruptured and crippled power in the CSM.

Except for Apollo 11, all of the missions carried an [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP), composed of equipment for seven scientific experiments plus a central control station (they were controlled from the Earth) with a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG). Scientists from MSFC were among the co-investigators.

The [[Lunar rover (Apollo)|Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV), popularly known as the "Moon Buggy," was developed by MSFC to provide transportation for exploring a limited amount of the Moon's surface. Not intended in the original planning, by 1969 it became clear that an LRV would be needed to maximize the scientific returns. An LRV was carried on the last three missions, allowing an area similar in size of Manhattan Island to be explored. Outbound they carried an ALSEP to be set up; on the return trip, they carried more than 200 pounds of lunar rock and soil samples. Saverio E. "Sonny" Morea was the LRV project manager at MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;Morea, Saverio E; [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/lunar/LRV_Historical_Perspective.pdf "The Lunar Roving Vehicle – Historical Perspective"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Skylab and ATM=====
[[File:Serpentuator.jpg|thumb|MSFC engineers tested this articulated arm developed, but not used, for Skylab at a MSFC flat floor facility.]]
Even before the first Apollo landing, plans were being made by NASA for an [[Apollo Applications Program]] (AAP). This involved science-based manned space missions using surplus Apollo equipment. The lack of interest by Congress, and subsequent lack of funding, cut out most of the proposed activities – such as [[Manned Venus Flyby]] – but an orbital workshop remained of interest. Under [[Project Horizon]] in the late 1950s, use of spent missile stages for building a manned orbital space station had been proposed, and this general concept was picked up under AAP.

In December 1965, MSFC was authorized to have the Orbital Workshop as a formal project. At a meeting at MSFC on August 19, 1966, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George E. Mueller]], NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, pinned down the final concept for the major elements. MSFC was assigned responsibility for the development of the orbiting space station hardware as well as overall systems engineering and integration.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force was pursuing the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL), a small space station with a two-man crew, primarily intended for photo reconnaissance. For five years, MOL competed with a NASA station for funding but was finally dropped.
[[File:Neutral Buoyancy Space Simulator.jpg|thumb|MSFC used the Neutral Buoyancy Facility to test Skylab procedures. Here, engineers are testing procedures for repairing Skylab.]]
For testing and mission simulation, a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}}-diameter water-filled tank, the [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator|Neutral Buoyancy Facility]], was opened at MSFC in March 1968. Engineers and astronauts used this underwater facility to simulate the [[weightlessness]] (or zero-g) environment of space. This was particularly used in training astronauts in activities in zero-g work, especially [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks]].

The Orbital Workshop was designed using the hull of a Saturn V third stage, being fully refitted on the ground. It was renamed [[Skylab]] in February 1970. Two were built – one for flight and the other for testing and mission simulation in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility. Leland F Belew served for eight years as the overall Skylab program director.

Another AAP project that survived was a solar observatory, originally intended to be a deployable attachment to the Apollo spacecraft. Called the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] (ATM), the project was assigned to MSFC in 1966. As the Orbital Workshop matured into the Skylab, the ATM was added as an appendage, but the two activities were kept as independent development projects. Rein Ise was the ATM project manager at MSFC. The ATM included eight major instruments for observations of the Sun at wavelengths from extreme [[ultraviolet]] to [[infrared]]. The data was mainly collected on special photographic film; during the Skylab missions, the film had to be changed out by astronauts in [[spacewalk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ise, Rein, and Eugene H. Cagle; "The Apollo Telescope Mount on Skylab," ''Acta Astronautica'', vol. 1, no. 11–12 (Nov–Dec) 1974, pp 1315–1329&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 1973, the 77-ton (70,000-kg) Skylab was launched into a 235-nautical-mile (435-km) orbit by a Saturn V vehicle (the last to be flown) with Skylab replacing the upper stage. Saturn IB vehicles with their CSMs were used to ferry three-man crews to where they docked with the Skylab. Severe damage was sustained during Skylab launch and deployment, resulting in the loss of the station's micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels. This loss was partially corrected by the first crew, launched May 25; they stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed with the launch dates of July 28 and November 16, with mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. Skylab, including the ATM, logged about 2,000 hours on some 300 scientific and medical experiments. The last Skylab crew returned to the Earth on February 8, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Belew, Leland. F. (editor); [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-400/contents.htm "Skylab, Our First Space Station"] NASA publication SP-400, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Apollo–Soyuz=====
The last Saturn IB flight was launched on July 15, 1975, carrying a three-man crew on a six-day mission to dock with a Soviet [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft.. Called the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), the primary purpose was to provide engineering experience for future joint space flights, but both spacecraft also had scientific experiments. This was the last manned U.S. space mission until April 1981.

=====HEAO=====
The [[HEAO Program|High Energy Astronomy Observatory]] (HEAO) Program involved three missions of large spacecraft in [[low earth orbit|low-Earth orbit]] Each spacecraft was about {{convert|18|ft|m}} in length, weighed between {{convert|6000|and|7000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and carried some {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} of experiments for [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] and [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]] astronomy and [[Cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]] investigations. The project provided revolutionary insights into celestial objects by studying their high-energy radiation from space. Scientists from across the Nation served as [[principal investigator]]s.

The HEAO spacecraft was conceived by MSFC in the late 1960s, but, with the Apollo Program, funding did not become available for some time. Using [[Atlas-Centaur]] launch vehicles, highly successful missions were started in August 1977 (HEAO 1), November 1978 (HEAO 2, also called the Einstein Observatory), and September 1979 (HEAO 3). Fred A. Speer was the HEAO project manager for MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Wallace H.; [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-466/sp466.htm "The Star Splitters: The High Energy Astronomy Observatories"] NASA, SP-466, 1984;&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other research=====
Other MSFC-managed space science projects in the 1970s included the [[LAGEOS|Laser Geodynamics Satellite]] (LAGEOS) and [[Gravity Probe A]]. In LAGEOS, laser beams from 35 ground stations are reflected by 422 prismatic mirrors on the satellite to track movements in the Earth's crust. The measurement accuracy is a few centimeters and it tracks the movement of [[tectonic plates]] with comparable accuracy. Conceived and built at MSFC, the LAGEOS was launched by a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] rocket in May 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1976-039A-01 "Laser Tracking Reflector"], NASA Tech Data&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity Probe A, also called the Redshift Experiment, used an extremely precise [[hydrogen maser]] clock to confirm part of Einstein's [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The probe was launched in June 1976, by a [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]] rocket, and remained in space for near two hours, as intended.&lt;ref&gt;Vessot, R.F.C. et al. (1980). "Test of Relativistic Gravitation with a Space-Borne Hydrogen Maser" ''. Rev. Ltrs.'', vol. 45, no 26 (1980), pp. 2081–2084&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Planck Institute for Brain Research at Night of Science 2018 (1).jpg|thumb|New building of the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Brain Research''' is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Brain Research in Berlin 1914, moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad in 1962 and more recently in a new building in Frankfurt-Riedberg. It is one of 83 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

== Research ==
Research at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research focuses on the operation of networks of neurons in the brain. The institute hosts three scientific departments (with directors [[Moritz Helmstaedter]] of the Helmstaedter Department, [[Gilles Laurent]] of the Laurent Department, and [[Erin Schuman]] of the Schuman Department), the [[Wolf Singer|Singer]] Emeritus Group, two Max Planck Research Groups, namely [[Johannes Letzkus]]' Neocortical Circuits Group and [[Tatjana Tchumatchenko]]'s Theory of Neural Dynamics Group, as well as several additional research units. The common research goal of the Institute is a mechanistic understanding of neurons and synapses, of the structural and functional circuits which they form, of the computational rules which describe their operations, and ultimately, of their roles in driving perception and behavior. The experimental focus is on all scales required to achieve this understanding - from networks of molecules in dendritic compartments to networks of interacting brain areas. This includes interdisciplinary analyses at the molecular, cellular, multi-cellular, network and behavioral levels, often combined with theoretical approaches.

== History ==
The "Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung" (KWI for Brain Research) was founded in [[Berlin]] in 1914, making it one of the oldest institutes of the "Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science", itself founded in 1911. It was based on the Neurologische Zentralstation (Neurological Center), a private research institute established by [[Oskar Vogt]] in 1898 and run together with his wife [[Cécile Vogt-Mugnier]], also an accomplished brain researcher.

From 1901 to 1910, Vogt's coworker at this institute was [[Korbinian Brodmann]], who in 1909 established the cytoarchitectonic classification of cortical areas still in use today (e.g., his area 17 is the primary visual cortex). Oskar Vogt's own scientific achievements also were in the field of cortical cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics.

In the 1920s Oskar Vogt became interested in the potential morphological correlates of mental abilities, and hence in the neuroanatomical study of 'elite brains'. When [[Lenin]] died of a brain hemorrhage in 1924, his brain was preserved in formaldehyde, where it remained for two years. In 1926, Vogt was recruited by the Soviet government to help establish Lenin's genius via histological investigation of his brain. He was given some space in Moscow to carry out this work and two years later, a spacious and representative brick building that had been confiscated from an American business. In it, he helped establish and then headed the Moscow Brain Institute. Between 1926 and 1930, Vogt travelled to Moscow several times to supervise the work on Lenin's brain by the Russian collaborators who had been trained at Vogt's KWI for Brain Research in Berlin.

In 1927, Vogt gave a preliminary report on his findings in Moscow, concluding from his histological observations that Lenin must have been an athlete in associative thinking ("Assoziationsathlet") - a conclusion deemed farfetched by some of his neurologist colleagues and adversaries. Lenin's brain was, for a time, on display in the Lenin Mausoleum and now rests at Moscow's Brain Institute.

World War I delayed the plans for a new building to house the KWI for Brain Research. The KWI's first proper building in Berlin-Buch was only inaugurated in 1931 under the directorship of Oskar Vogt. It was the world's largest and most modern brain research institute of its time, including Departments of Neurophysiology (Tönnies and Kornmüller), Neurochemistry (Marthe Vogt and Veit), Genetics (Timoféeff-Ressovsky), a Research Clinic (Soeken, Zwirner), and the Neuroanatomical Departments of Oskar and his wife Cécile Vogt. Based on critical remarks Vogt had made about national socialism, a protective attitude towards Jewish coworkers at the institute, and rumors that he was a communist (spirited by his Moscow contacts), Vogt was pressed to early retirement by 1937. The Vogts moved to Neustadt in the Black Forest and established another private brain research institute, funded in part by the family of steel baron Krupp (who had already funded Vogt´s first private institute in Berlin) and by Vogt´s own funds.
In 1937, Hugo Spatz, a pupil of Franz Nissl, became Vogt's successor as director of the KWI for Brain Research and head of the Neuroanatomy Department. During his tenure, the Departments of Neuropathology (Hallervorden) and of Tumor Research (Tönnis) were added. One focus of both Spatz’s and Hallervorden’s histological research were pathologies of the extrapyramidal/motor system. In a previous collaboration they had described an extrapyramidal disease that was later named Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome. 

Between 1940 and 1945, Hallervorden and Spatz became involved in the atrocities of the [[Nazi party|Nazi regime]] by studying the brains of euthanasia victims. For many years, brain sections from these studies remained archived in the institute (which by then had become the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt am Main) together with research material from other periods. When this was recognized, all sections dating from the period 1933-1945 were given a burial at a Munich cemetery by the Max Planck Society in 1990. A memorial stone was erected in honor of the victims of these atrocities. Use of the eponym Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is strongly discouraged due to Hallervorden and Spatz's involvement with the Nazi party and was replaced by the more descriptive terminology [[pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration]].

After 1945, the different departments of the KWI for Brain Research were relocated to Dillenburg, Giessen, Köln, Marburg and Göttingen. In 1948 the Max Planck Society was founded to succeed the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, and the institute became the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research. Hallervorden retired as director in 1955, Spatz in 1959. In 1962, a new building was erected in Frankfurt-Niederrad to house the Departments of Neurobiology (Hassler, Director 1959-1982) and Neuropathology (Krücke, Director 1956-1979), as well as the Research Groups "Evolution of the Primate Brain" (Stephan) and "Neurochemistry" (Werner). Rolf Hassler, a pupil of Oskar Vogt and coworker of the famous Freiburg neurologist Richard Jung, studied subcortical brain areas, thalamo-cortical systems, basal ganglia and the limbic system. Wilhelm Krücke, a pupil of Hallervorden, was a renowned specialist on peripheral neuropathies. He was the reason for the institute's relocation to Frankfurt, as he was simultaneously head of the 'Edinger Institute', the Neuropathology Department of Frankfurt University's Medical School. In 1982, the KWI for Brain Research's Department of General Neurology, which had been relocated to Köln, became the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research in that city, independent of the MPI for Brain Research. The other relocated departments of the KWI were closed with the retirement of their directors.

In 1981, the MPIH was restructured towards non-clinical, basic neuroscience through the establishment of the Departments of Neuroanatomy (Wässle, Director 1981-2008) and Neurophysiology (Singer, Director 1982-2011), followed by the Department of Neurochemistry (Betz, Director 1991-2009). Heinz Wässle conducted functional and structural studies of the mammalian retina, Heinrich Betz analyzed the molecular components of synapses, and Wolf Singer studied higher cognitive functions with a focus on the visual system.

In the first decade of the new millennium, the MPG defined the analysis of neural networks as a central research topic for the institute. In 2008 Erin Schuman and Gilles Laurent were appointed as directors of the departments "Synaptic Plasticity" and "Neural Systems", respectively. The new departments took up work in the summer of 2009 and were initially located in interim facilities on the Science Campus "Riedberg" of the Frankfurt University. The construction of a new building for the institute on this campus was recently finalized, next to the MPI of Biophysics. The new institute building currently houses the three departments of the institute (those of Erin Schuman, Gilles Laurent and Moritz Helmstaedter), several Research Groups at the institute (Tatjana Tchumatchenko and Johannes Letzkus recently joined as Max Planck Group Leaders in 2013), several core facilities, and the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics of Peter Mombaerts.

{{As of|2016}}, Moritz Helmstaedter is the [[Managing Director]] of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marx|first=Vivien|date=May 2015|title=Erin Margaret Schman|url=http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n5/full/nmeth.3374.html|department=The Author File|journal=[[Nat.

'''Mountain research''' or ''[[Mountain research#Denomination|montology]]'', traditionally also known as ''orology''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orology Merriam Webster&lt;/ref&gt; (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oros'' ὄρος for 'mountain' and ''logos'' λόγος), is a field of research that regionally concentrates on the [[Earth's surface]]'s part covered by [[mountain]] [[landscape]]s.

==Mountain areas==
Different approaches have been developed to define ''mountainous'' areas. While some use an altitudinal difference of 300 [[meter|m]] inside an area to define that zone as mountainous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1553/eco.mont-5-1s3 | volume=5 | title=Editorial | journal=eco.mont (Journal on Protected Mountain Areas Research) | pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; others consider differences from 1000 m or more,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.293.aspx.pdf Mountain Systems. UNEP&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the areas' [[latitude]]. Additionally, some include steepness to define mountain regions, hence excluding [[high plateau]]s (e.g. the Andean [[Altiplano]] or the [[Tibetan Plateau]]), zones often seen to be mountainous. A more pragmatic but useful definition has been proposed by the Italian Statistics Office [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|ISTAT]], which classifies municipalities as mountainous

* if at least 80% of their territory is situated above ≥ 600 m [[above sea level]], and/or 
* if they have an altitudinal difference of 600 m (or more) within their administrative boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/147760 Precisazione sulla classificazione dei comuni montani&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] has produced a map&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&amp;layers=0a5d90defc33466cbc3eb85a6564b6d6 UNEP-WCNC (2011): Mountains of the World – 2000.

Data&lt;/ref&gt; of mountain areas worldwide using a combination of criteria, including regions with

* elevations from 1000 to 1500 m and slope [[≥]] 5[[°]] or local elevation range &gt; 300 m;
* elevations from 1500 to 2500 m and slope ≥ 2°;
* elevations of 2500 m or more.

In a broader sense, mountain research is considered any research ''in'' mountain regions: for instance disciplinary studies on Himalayan [[Plant (botanical)|plants]], Andean [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], Alpine [[City|cities]], or Carpathian [[Ethnic group|people]]. It is comparable to research that concentrates on the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] (polar research) or [[coast]]s (coastal research).

===Narrower definition===
In a narrower sense, mountain research focuses ''on'' mountain regions, their description and the explanation of the [[Integrated geography|human-environment interaction]] in ([[Positive science|positive]]) and the [[sustainable development]] of ([[normative]]) these areas. So-defined mountain research is situated at the nexus of [[natural science]]s, [[social science]]s and [[humanities]]. Drawing on [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s work in the [[Andes|Andean realm]], [[Geography|mountain geography]] and [[Landscape ecology|ecology]] are considered core areas of study; nevertheless important contributions are coming from [[anthropology]], [[geology]], [[economics]], [[history]] or [[spatial planning]]. In sum, a narrowly defined mountain research applies an interdisciplinary and integrative regional approach. [[Olav Slaymaker|Slaymaker]] summarizes:

{{Quotation|The science of montology [...] starts with recognition of the importance of verticality, a distinctive feature of mountain regions, which imposes vertical control of the production system; marginality, which results from low agricultural potential; centrality of mechanisms of power and violence; population growth and expansion; and religion and myth, expressed in mountains as sacred places. Montology emphasises restoration ecology to include re-vegetation, rehabilitation, reclamation and recovery of the lost landscape form and function [...]. Landscape ecological effects are arranged along altitudinal belts and form the basis for a more comprehensive understanding of critical habitats for conservation and development. This approach has an underlying assumption of climax communities each fitting into a narrow altitudinal band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slaymaker | first1 = O | year = 2007 | title = The potential contribution of geomorphology to tropical mountain development: The case of the MANRECUR project | url = | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 87 | issue = 1–2| pages = 90–100 | doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.06.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Denomination==
Mountain research or ''orology''—not to be confused with [[orography]]—, is sometimes denominated ''montology''. This term stems from Carl Troll's ''mountain geoecology''—geoecology being Troll's English translation of the German ''[[Landscape ecology|Landschaftsökologie]]''—and appeared at a meeting in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neustadtl | first1 = SJ | year = 1977 | title = Montology: the Ecology of Mountains | url = | journal = Technology Review | volume = 79 | issue = 8| pages = 64–66 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, scholars such as Jack D. Ives, Bruno Messerli and Robert E. Rhoades have claimed the development of montology as interdisciplinary mountain research. The term montology was included in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oed.com/public/update0212/december-2002-update&lt;/ref&gt; It defines montology as:

{{Quotation|The study of mountains; specifically the interdisciplinary study of the physical, chemical, geological, and biological aspects of mountain regions; (also) the study of the lifestyles and economic concerns of people living in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/montology&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the one hand, the term ''montology'' received criticism due to the mix of [[Latin language|Latin]] (''mōns'', [[Plural|pl.]] ''montēs'') and [[Greek language|Greek]] (''logos''). On the other hand, however, this is also the—well accepted—case in several, already established disciplines such as [[glaciology]] or [[sociology]].

'''''Nature''''' is a British [[multidisciplinary]] [[scientific journal]], first published on 4 November 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huxley | first1 = T.

Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are [[editorial]]s, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying ''supplementary material'' on the journal's website.

There are many fields of [[research]] in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in ''Nature.'' The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/get_published/index.html |title=Getting published in Nature : For authors and referees : Nature |website=nature.com |language=en |access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ''Nature'' (together with ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') received the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanity.&lt;ref name=SciNat&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schroeder |first1=Robert |first2= Gretta E.|last2= Siegel | doi = 10.1353/scp.2006.0006 | year = 2006 | title = A Cooperative Publishing Model for Sustainable Scholarship| journal = Journal of Scholarly Publishing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 86–98 (88)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the [[Royal Society]], which had published many of the great works from [[Isaac Newton]], [[Michael Faraday]] through to early works from [[Charles Darwin]]. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Bar3"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Barton | first1 = R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.&lt;ref name="Bar3"/&gt;

''Nature'', first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede ''Nature'' was ''[[Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation]]'', which, created in 1859, began as a [[natural history]] magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history.&lt;ref name="Bar7"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's name changed from its original title to ''Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science'' and then later to the ''Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Recreative Science'' had attempted to include more physical sciences such as [[astronomy]] and [[archaeology]], the ''Intellectual Observer'' broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; Similar to ''Recreative Science'' was the scientific journal ''[[Popular Science Review]]'', created in 1862,&lt;ref name="Bar13"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled "Scientific Summary" or "Quarterly Retrospect", with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.&lt;ref name="Bar13"/&gt; Two other journals produced in England prior to the development of ''Nature'' were the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' and ''[[Scientific Opinion]]'', established in 1864 and 1868, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; The journal most closely related to ''Nature'' in its editorship and format was ''The Reader'', created in 1864; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to ''Popular Science Review''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt;

These similar journals all ultimately failed. The ''Popular Science Review'' survived longest, lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881; ''Recreative Science'' ceased publication as the ''Student and Intellectual Observer'' in 1871. The ''Quarterly Journal'', after undergoing a number of editorial changes, ceased publication in 1885. ''The Reader'' terminated in 1867, and finally, ''Scientific Opinion'' lasted a mere 2 years, until June 1870.&lt;ref name="Bar7"/&gt;

===Creation ===
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First title page, 4 November 1869]]
Not long after the conclusion of ''The Reader'', a former editor, [[Norman Lockyer]], decided to create a new scientific journal titled ''Nature'',&lt;ref name="B248"&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; taking its name from a line by [[William Wordsworth]]: "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww698.html Poem: "A Volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found"]. Bartleby.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; First owned and published by [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], ''Nature'' was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Janet Browne has proposed that "far more than any other science journal of the period, ''Nature'' was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Many of the early editions of ''Nature'' consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the [[X Club]], a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period.&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Initiated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the group consisted of such important scientists as [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[John Tyndall]], along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as [[common descent]], a theory which, during the latter half of the 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made ''Nature'' a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. [[John Maddox]], editor of ''Nature'' from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; "journalism" Maddox states, "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start."&lt;ref name="Dinner"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1970|title=The 'Nature' Centenary Dinner|jstor=530861|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 25|issue=1|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1970.0002 |pages=9–15(13)|author1=Maddox, John  |author2=Macmillan, Harold  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.&lt;ref name="Dinner"/&gt;
 
====Editors====
[[Norman Lockyer]], the founder of ''Nature'', was a professor at [[Imperial College]]. He was succeeded as editor in 1919 by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]].&lt;ref name="NPG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/02_history.xml&amp;style=xml/02_history.xsl |title=Nature Publishing Group: History |website=nature.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115084545/http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml%2F02_history.xml&amp;style=xml%2F02_history.xsl |archivedate=15 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory helped to establish ''Nature'' in the international scientific community. His obituary by the Royal Society stated: "Gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science, and in the columns of ''Nature'' he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the International Scientific Unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Arman Gregory, 1864–1952|journal= Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume= 8|issue=22|pages=410–417 (413)|year=1953|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1953.0007 |author=Stratton, F. J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 1945 to 1973, editorship of ''Nature'' changed three times, first in 1945 to A. J. V. Gale and [[L. J. F. Brimble]] (who in 1958 became the sole editor), then to [[John Maddox]] in 1965, and finally to [[David 'Dai' Davies|David Davies]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt; In 1980, Maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995. [[Philip Campbell (scientist)|Philip Campbell]] has since become Editor-in-chief of all ''Nature'' publications.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt;

====Expansion and development====
In 1970, ''Nature'' first opened its Washington office; other branches opened in New York in 1985, Tokyo and Munich in 1987, Paris in 1989, San Francisco in 2001, Boston in 2004, and Hong Kong in 2005. In 1971, under [[John Maddox]]'s editorship, the journal split into ''Nature Physical Sciences'' (published on Mondays), ''Nature New Biology'' (published on Wednesdays) and ''Nature'' (published on Fridays). In 1974, Maddox was no longer editor, and the journals were merged into ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;

 |language=en
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, the journal underwent a great deal of expansion, launching over ten new journals. These new journals comprise the Nature Publishing Group, which was created in 1999 and includes ''Nature'', Nature Publishing Group Journals, Stockton Press Specialist Journals and Macmillan Reference (renamed NPG Reference).

In 1996, ''Nature'' created its own website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline2.html|title = Branching out (1970–1999)|date = |accessdate = 2014-11-13|website = nature.com|publisher = Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 Nature Publishing Group began its series of ''Nature Reviews''.&lt;ref name="NPG" /&gt; Some articles and papers are available for free on the Nature website. Others require the purchase of premium access to the site. ''Nature'' claims an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-a-new-ipad-app-for-nature-readers-1.12002 | title=Announcement: A new iPad app for Nature readers | work=Nature | date=12 December 2012 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2008, ''Nature'' endorsed an American presidential candidate for the first time when it supported [[Barack Obama]] during his campaign in [[United States presidential election, 2008|America's 2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/4551149a |title=America's choice |year=2008 |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7217 |page=1149 |bibcode=2008Natur.455Q1149. |pmid=18971969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Angliss |url=http://www.scholarsandrogues.com/2008/10/31/nature-endorses-obama/ |title=Weekly science journal ''Nature'' endorses a presidential candidate: Barack Obama (updated) |website=Scholars &amp; Rogues |date=31 October 2008 |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, an [[Nature Arabic Edition|Arabic edition]] of the magazine was launched in partnership with [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]]. As of the time it was released, it had about 10,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=NatureME&gt;{{cite web |last= Yahia |first= Mohammed |title= Nature Arabic Edition launches |quote= The first issue of ''Nature Arabic Edition'', an Arabic translation of ''Nature'', has been released.

On 2 December 2014, ''Nature'' announced that it would allow its subscribers and a group of selected media outlets to share links allowing free, "read-only" access to content from its journals. These articles are presented using the [[digital rights management]] system [[ReadCube]] (which is funded by the Macmillan subsidiary Digital Science), and does not allow readers to download, copy, print, or otherwise distribute the content. While it does, to an extent, provide free online access to articles, it is not a true [[open access]] scheme due to its restrictions on re-use and distribution.&lt;ref name=wired-naturefreeview&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature journal subscribers can now share article links globally|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|website=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=3 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202182430/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-npgreadonly&gt;{{cite news|title=Science journal ''Nature'' to make archives available online|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/nature-archives-free|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2015, details of a proposed merger with Springer Science+Business Media were announced.&lt;ref&gt;Schuetze, Arno (15 January 2015). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/15/publishing-ma-idUSF9N0TV00F20150115 "Nature magazine publisher to merge with Springer Science"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 it came under the umbrella of Springer Nature, by the merger of [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and [[Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]]'s [[Nature Publishing Group]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], and [[Macmillan Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/press-releases/corporate/springer-nature-created-following-merger-completion/256626 |title=Springer Nature created following merger completion |date=6 May 2015 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication in Nature==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

Being published in ''Nature'' or any ''Nature'' publication is very prestigious. In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]), among the highest of any science journal.

As with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.

According to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:
{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.&lt;ref name=nature1869&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/mission.html |title=Nature's mission statement |accessdate=11 September 2008 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was revised in 2000 to:
{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science. Second, to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world, in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge, culture and daily life.&lt;ref name=nature2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/about/index.html |title=Nature's mission statement |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Landmark papers===
Many of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in modern history have been first published in ''Nature''. The following is a selection of scientific breakthroughs published in ''Nature'', all of which had far-reaching consequences, and the citation for the article in which they were published.

===Controversies===
In 2017, Nature published an editorial entitled "Removing Statues of Historical figures risks whitewashing history: Science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past". The article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of [[J. Marion Sims]], the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American female slaves who were unable to give informed consent, and [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] who oversaw the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].  The editorial as written made the case that removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of "whitewashing history", and stated “Instead of removing painful reminders, perhaps these should be supplemented”. The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Science must acknowledge its past mistakes and crimes |date=4 September 2017 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-acknowledge-its-past-mistakes-and-crimes-1.22557?sf111543858=1&amp;WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist. Nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was "offensive and poorly worded" and published selected letters of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Readers respond to Nature’s Editorial on historical monuments |date=8 September 2017 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/readers-respond-to-nature-s-editorial-on-historical-monuments-1.22584 |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in the [[Unite the Right Rally|Unite the Right rally]] to oppose the removal of [[Robert Edward Lee Sculpture|a statue of Robert E. Lee]], setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman. When Nature posted a link to the editorial on [[Twitter]], the thread quickly exploded with criticisms. In response, several scientists called for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schulson |first=Michael |title=History Lessons for ‘Nature’|date=17 September 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/nature-journal-j-marion-sims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2017, the editorial was updated and edited by Philip Campbell, the editor of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Campbell |first=Philip |title=Statues: An Editorial Response|date= 18 September 2017 |newspaper=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/549334c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Paul Lauterbur]] and [[Peter Mansfield]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for research initially rejected by ''Nature'' and published only after Lauterbur appealed the rejection, ''Nature'' acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled, "Coping with Peer Rejection":
{{quote|[T]here are unarguable ''faux pas'' in our history. These include the rejection of [[Čherenkov radiation|Cherenkov radiation]], [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s [[meson]], work on [[photosynthesis]] by [[Johann Deisenhofer]], [[Robert Huber]] and [[Hartmut Michel]], and the initial rejection (but eventual acceptance) of [[Stephen Hawking]]'s [[Hawking radiation|black-hole radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/full/425645a.html |journal=Nature |date=16 October 2003 |title=Coping with peer rejection |volume=425 |page=645 |doi=10.1038/425645a |pmid=14562060 |issue=6959 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..645.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 2000 to 2001, a series of five fraudulent papers by [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön]] was published in ''Nature''. The papers, about [[semiconductors]], were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud. In 2003, ''Nature'' retracted the papers. The Schön scandal was not limited to ''Nature''; other prominent journals, such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Physical Review]]'', also retracted papers by Schön.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v422/n6927/index.html |journal=Nature |date=6 March 2003 |title=Retractions' realities |volume=422 |issue=6927 |page=1 |doi=10.1038/422001a |pmid=12621394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1988, after nearly a year of guided scrutiny from its editors, ''Nature'' published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing Dr. [[Jacques Benveniste]] and his team's work studying human [[Basophil granulocyte|basophil]] [[degranulation]] in the presence of extremely dilute [[antibody]] serum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vet-servis.ru/downloads/nature333-30-1988.pdf |title=vet-servis.ru |publisher=Vet-servis.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical [[law of mass action]]. The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from [[homeopathic]] medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted ''Nature'' to mandate an extensive, stringent and scientifically questionable experimental [[replication (statistics)|replication]] in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were categorically refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Before publishing one of its most famous discoveries, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s 1953 [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|paper]] on the [[structure of DNA]], ''Nature'' did not send the paper out for peer review. [[John Maddox]], ''Nature''{{'}}s editor, stated: "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by ''Nature'' ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=J. |doi=10.1038/426119b |title=How genius can smooth the road to publication |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6963 |page=119 |year=2003|bibcode=2003Natur.426..119M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier error occurred when [[Enrico Fermi]] submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak [[Fermi's interaction|interaction theory]] of [[beta decay]]. ''Nature'' turned down the paper because it was considered too remote from reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhodes, Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb|publisher= Touchstone|location= New York|date= 1986|isbn= 0-671-44133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi's paper was published by ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fermi |first1=E. |title=Versuch einer Theorie der β-Strahlen.

==Science fiction==
In 1999 ''Nature'' began publishing [[science fiction]] [[short stories]]. The brief "[[vignette (literature)|vignettes]]" are printed in a series called "Futures". The stories appeared in 1999 and 2000, again in 2005 and 2006, and have appeared weekly since July 2007.&lt;ref name="futures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/arts/futures/ | title=Futures | work=Nature | accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister publication ''[[Nature Physics]]'' also printed stories in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesPhysics"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nphys/archive/categ_fut_012008.html |title=Futures Archive |work= [[Nature Physics]] |accessdate= 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Nature'' was awarded the [[European Science Fiction Society]]'s Best Publisher award for the "Futures" series.&lt;ref name="ESFSAward"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esfs.info/esfs-awards-2000.html#2005 |title= The ESFS Awards, Eurocon 2005: Glasgow – Scotland |author= [[European Science Fiction Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred of the ''Nature'' stories between 1999 and 2006 were published as the collection ''Futures from Nature'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesCollection"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.tor-forge.com/futuresfromnature |title= Futures from Nature: 100 Speculative fictions from the pages of the leading science journal |editor= Henry Gee |publisher= [[Tor Books]] |date= 2008 |location= New York City |isbn= 0-7653-1805-9 |quote= With stories from: [[Arthur C.

''Nature'' is edited and published in the United Kingdom by a division of the international [[scientific publishing]] company [[Springer Nature]] that publishes [[academic journal]]s, [[magazine]]s, online databases, and services in science and medicine. ''Nature'' has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[Boston]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Basingstoke]]. Nature Publishing Group also publishes other specialized journals including ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''[[Nature Biotechnology]],'' ''[[Nature Methods]]'', the ''[[Nature Clinical Practice]]'' series of journals, ''[[Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology]]'', ''[[Nature Chemistry]]'', and the ''Nature Reviews'' series of journals.

Since 2005, each issue of ''Nature'' has been accompanied by a ''[[Nature Podcast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/archive.html | work = Nature |title = Archive: Nature Podcast |accessdate = 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring highlights from the issue and interviews with the articles' authors and the journalists covering the research. It is presented by Kerri Smith, and features interviews with scientists on the latest research, as well as news reports from Nature's editors and journalists. The Nature Podcast was founded – and the first 100 episodes were produced and presented – by clinician and virologist [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Chris Smith]] of Cambridge and ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.

In 2007, Nature Publishing Group began publishing ''Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics'', the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics and ''Molecular Therapy'', the American Society of Gene Therapy's official journal, as well as the ''International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) Journal''. Nature Publishing Group launched ''Nature Photonics'' in 2007 and ''Nature Geoscience'' in 2008. ''Nature Chemistry'' published its first issue in April 2009.

Nature Publishing Group actively supports the self-archiving process and in 2002 was one of the first publishers to allow authors to post their contributions on their personal websites, by requesting an exclusive licence to publish, rather than requiring authors to transfer copyright. In December 2007, Nature Publishing Group introduced the Creative Commons attribution-non commercial-share alike unported licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism's genome for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1864.html |title=Interview with Timo Hannay, director of web publishing for Nature Publishing Group |work=Jon Udell's Interviews with Innovators |date=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a collection of articles from ''Nature'' was edited by John S. Partington under the title ''H. G.

'''Organizational culture''' encompasses [[Value (ethics) | values]] and behaviors that "contribute to the unique social and psychological environment of a business. The organisational culture influences the way people interact, the context within which knowledge is created, the resistance they will have towards certain changes, and ultimately the way they share (or the way they do not share)  knowledge.  Organizational culture represents the collective values, beliefs and principles of organizational members and is a product of factors such as history, product, market, technology, strategy, type of employees, [[management style]], and national culture; culture includes the organization's [[goal | vision]], values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, environment, location,  beliefs and habits. 

[[Business executive]] Bernard L. Rosauer (2013) defines organizational culture as an ''[[emergence]]'' – an extremely complex incalculable state that results from the combination of a few ingredients. In "Three Bell Curves: Business Culture Decoded"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ThreeBellCurves.com "Three Bell Curves: Business Culture Decoded"]&lt;/ref&gt; Rosauer outlines the three manageable ingredients which (he claims) guide business culture:

# employee (focus on engagement)
# the work (focus on eliminating waste increasing value) waste
# the customer (focus on likelihood of referral)

Rosauer writes that the Three Bell Curves methodology aims to bring [[leadership]], their employees, the work and the customer together for focus without distraction, leading to an improvement in culture and brand.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He states: "If a methodology isn't memorable, it won't get used. The Three Bell Curves Methodology is simple (to remember) but execution requires strong leadership and diligence. Culture can be guided by managing the ingredients."  Reliance of the research and findings of Sirota Survey Intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirota.com/enthusiastic-employee Sirota Survey Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been gathering employee data worldwide since 1972, the Lean Enterprise Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lean.org Lean Enterprise Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge, MA, and Fred Reichheld/Bain/Satmetrix research relating to NetPromoterScore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.netpromoter.com/know/ NetPromoterScore]&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh?|date=October 2018}}    
 
Ravasi and Schultz (2006) characterise organizational culture as a set of shared assumptions that guide behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ravasi | first1 = D. | last2 = Schultz | first2 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Responding to organizational identity threats: Exploring the role of organizational culture | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 433–458 | doi= 10.5465/amj.2006.21794663}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the pattern of such collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving and, even thinking and feeling. Thus organizational culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other, with clients, and with [[Stakeholder (corporate) | stakeholder]]s. In addition, organizational culture may affect how much employees [[organizational identification | identify with an organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schrodt | first1 = P | year = 2002 | title = The relationship between organizational identification and organizational culture: Employee perceptions of culture and identification in a retail sales organization | url = | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 189–202 | doi= 10.1080/10510970209388584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Schein|Schein]] (1992), Deal and Kennedy (2000), and [[John Kotter|Kotter]] (1992) advanced the idea that organizations often have very differing cultures as well as subcultures.&lt;ref name=schein2009&gt;{{cite book|last= Schein|first= Edgar|authorlink= Edgar Schein|title= Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View|year= 1992|publisher= Jossey-Bass|location= San Francisco, CA|pages= 9}}

Flamholtz and Randle (2011) suggest that one can view organizational culture as "corporate personality"&lt;ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The term of culture in the organizational context was first introduced by [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] in his book ''The Changing Culture of a Factory'', in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/809554483|title=Organization theory : modern, symbolic, and postmodern perspectives|last=Jo.|first=Hatch, Mary|publisher=|others=Cunliffe, Ann L.|year=|isbn=0199640378|edition=  Third|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=161|oclc=809554483}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the published report of "a case study of developments in the social life of one industrial community between April, 1948 and November 1950".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300631|title=The changing culture of a factory.|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1951|publisher=Tavistock Publications|others=Tavistock Institute of Human Relations.|year=|isbn=0415264421|location=[London]|pages=251|oclc=300631}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "case" is a publicly held British company engaged principally in the manufacture, sale, and servicing of metal bearings. The study is concerned with the description, analysis, and development of the [[Organizational behavior|corporate group behaviours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868980134|title=Organisational culture : concept, context, and measurement|last=Elizabeth.|first=Kummerow,|publisher=|others=Kirby, Neil., Ying, Lee Xin.|year=|isbn=9789812837837|location=New Jersey|pages=13|oclc=868980134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Elliott Jaques "the culture of the factory is its customary and traditional way of thinking and doing of things, which is shared to a greater or lesser degree by all its members, and which new members must learn, and at least partially accept, in order to be accepted into service in the firm..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In simple terms, to the extent that people can share common wishes, desires and aspirations, they can commit themselves to work together. It is a matter of being able to care about the same things, and it applies to nations as well as to associations and organizations within nations.

Elaborating on the work in ''The Changing Culture of a Factory'' Dr. Elliott Jaques in his concept of [[requisite organization]] established the list of valued entitlements or organizational values that can gain from people their full commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36162684|title=Requisite organization : a total system for effective managerial organization and managerial leadership for the 21st century|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1998|publisher=Cason Hall|isbn=1886436037|edition=  Rev. 2nd |location=Arlington, VA|oclc=36162684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they make an organizational culture or credo: 
* Fair and just treatment for everyone, including fair pay based upon equitable pay differentials for level of work and merit recognition related to personal effectiveness appraisal.
* Leadership interaction between managers and subordinates, including shared context, personal effectiveness appraisal, feedback and recognition, and coaching.
* Clear articulation of accountability and authority to engender trust and confidence in all working relationships.
* Articulation of long-term organizational vision through direct communication from the top.
* Opportunity for everyone individually or through representatives to participate in policy development.
* Work for everyone at a level consistent with their level of potential capability, values and interests.
* Opportunity for everyone to progress as his or her potential capability matures, within the opportunities available            
The role of managerial leadership at every organizational level is to make these organizational values operationally real.

== Usage ==
''Organizational culture'' refers to [[culture]] in any type of [[organization]] including that of schools, universities, not-for-profit groups, government agencies, or business entities. In business, terms such as '''corporate culture''' and '''company culture''' are often used to refer to a similar concept. The term corporate culture became widely known in the business world in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Arizona"&gt;"Culture is everything," said Lou Gerstner, the CEO who pulled IBM from near ruin in the 1990s.", [http://knowledge.wpcarey.asu.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1989 Culture Clash: When Corporate Culture Fights Strategy, It Can Cost You] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110012303/http://knowledge.wpcarey.asu.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1989 |date=2011-11-10 }}, knowmgmt, [[Arizona State University]], March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="term"&gt;Unlike many expressions that emerge in business jargon, the term spread to newspapers and magazines. Few usage experts object to the term. Over 80 percent of usage experts accept the sentence ''The new management style is a reversal of GE's traditional corporate culture, in which virtually everything the company does is measured in some form and filed away somewhere.''", The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Corporate culture'' was already used by managers, sociologists, and organizational theorists by the beginning of the 80s.&lt;ref name="Linda"&gt;One of the first to point to the importance of culture for organizational analysis and the intersection of [[culture theory]] and [[organization theory]] is [[Linda Smircich]] in her article Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis in 1983. See Linda Smircich, ''Concepts of Culture and Organizational Analysis'', Administrative Science Quarterly, Volume: 28, Issue: 3, Publisher: JSTOR, {{doi|10.2307/2392246}}, 1983, pp. 339–358&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hispanicengineer"&gt;"The term "Corporate Culture" is fast losing the academic ring it once had among U.S. manager.

But corporate managers, untrained in sociology jargon, found it difficult to use the term unselfconsciously." in Phillip Farish, Career Talk: Corporate Culture, Hispanic Engineer, issue 1, year 1, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The related idea of [[organizational climate]] emerged in the 1960s and 70s, and the terms are now somewhat overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin, A. W., &amp; Croft, D. B. (1963). ''The organizational climate of schools''. Chicago: Midwest Administration Center of the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fred C. Lunenburg, Allan C. Ornstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jLvG_ASyG5AC&amp;pg=PA67 Educational Administration: Concepts and Practices]'', Cengage Learning, 2011, pp. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

If organizational culture is seen as something that characterizes an organization, it can be manipulated and altered depending on leadership and members.&lt;ref name="Modaff, D.P. 2011"&gt;Modaff, D.P., DeWine, S., &amp; Butler, J. (2011). Organizational communication: Foundations, challenges, and misunderstandings (2nd Ed.). Boston: Pearson Education. (Chapters 1–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Culture as root metaphor sees the organization as its culture, created through communication and symbols, or competing metaphors. Culture is basic, with personal experience producing a variety of perspectives.&lt;ref name="Modaff, D.P. 2011"/&gt;

The organizational communication perspective on culture views culture in three different ways:
* Traditionalism: views culture through objective things such as stories, rituals, and symbols
* Interpretivism: views culture through a network of shared meanings (organization members sharing subjective meanings)
* Critical-interpretivism: views culture through a network of shared meanings as well as the power struggles created by a similar network of competing meanings

== Strong and weak ==
Flamholtz and Randle state that: "A strong culture is that people clearly understand and can articulate. A weak culture is one that employees have difficulty defining, understanding, or explaining."&lt;ref&gt;Flamholtz and Randle, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
''Strong culture'' is said to exist where staff respond to stimulus because of their alignment to organizational values. In such environments, strong cultures help firms operate like well-oiled machines, engaging in outstanding execution with only minor adjustments to existing procedures as needed.

Conversely, there is ''weak culture'' where there is little alignment with organizational values, and control must be exercised through extensive procedures and bureaucracy.

Research shows{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} that organizations that foster strong cultures have clear values that give employees a reason to embrace the culture. A "strong" culture may be especially beneficial to firms operating in the service sector since members of these organizations are responsible for delivering the service and for evaluations important constituents make about firms.  Organizations may derive the following benefits from developing strong and productive cultures:

* Better aligning the company towards achieving its vision, mission, and goals
* High employee [[motivation]] and [[loyalty]]
* Increased team cohesiveness among the company's various departments and divisions
* Promoting consistency and encouraging coordination and control within the company
* Shaping employee behavior at work, enabling the organization to be more efficient

[[Irving Janis]] defined groupthink as "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;Janis, Irving L. ''Victims of Groupthink''. Boston. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This is a state in which even if group members have different ideas, they do not challenge organizational thinking. As a result, innovative thinking is stifled. Groupthink can lead to lack of creativity and decisions made without critical evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Argote |first1=Linda |title=Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |page=115-146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groupthink can occur, for example, when group members rely heavily on a central charismatic figure in the organization or where there is an "evangelical" belief in the organization's values. Groupthink can also occur in groups characterized by a friendly climate conducive to conflict avoidance.

== Healthy ==
{{quotebox|width=25em| bgcolor=#E1FFBD|align=right|''Culture is the organization's immune system. – Michael Watkins''&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/what-is-organizational-culture|title=What Is Organizational Culture? And Why Should We Care?|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|quote=Culture is the organization's immune system. – Michael Watkins|source=What Is Organizational Culture? And Why Should We Care? – Harvard Business Review}}

Organizations should strive for what is considered a "healthy" organizational culture in order to increase productivity, growth, efficiency and reduce counterproductive behavior and turnover of employees. A variety of characteristics describe a healthy culture, including:

* Acceptance and appreciation for diversity
* Regard for fair treatment of each employee as well as respect for each employee's contribution to the company
* Employee pride and enthusiasm for the organization and the work performed
* Equal opportunity for each employee to realize their full potential within the company
* Strong communication with all employees regarding policies and company issues
* Strong company leaders with a strong sense of direction and purpose
* Ability to compete in industry innovation and customer service, as well as price
* Lower than average turnover rates (perpetuated by a healthy culture)
* Investment in learning, training, and employee knowledge

Additionally, performance oriented cultures have been shown to possess statistically better financial growth.  Such cultures possess high employee involvement, strong internal communications and an acceptance and encouragement of a healthy level of risk-taking in order to achieve innovation. Additionally, organizational cultures that explicitly emphasize factors related to the demands placed on them by industry technology and growth will be better performers in their industries.

According to Kotter and Heskett (1992),&lt;ref name=kotter1992/&gt; organizations with adaptive cultures perform much better than organizations with unadaptive cultures. An adaptive culture translates into organizational success; it is characterized by managers paying close attention to all of their constituencies, especially customers, initiating change when needed, and taking risks. An unadaptive culture can significantly reduce a firm's effectiveness, disabling the firm from pursuing all its competitive/operational options.

Healthy companies are able to deal with employees' concerns about the well-being of the organization internally, before the employees would even feel they needed to raise the issues externally. It is for this reason that [[whistleblowing]], particularly when it results in serious damage to a company's reputation, is considered to be often a sign of a chronically dysfunctional corporate culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Skapinker|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c5059fd2-6881-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title= Lessons from the Deutsche Bank whistleblower Eric Ben-Artzi: A corporate culture must allow employees to dissent, before they take it outside the company|publisher=Financial Times|date=2016-08-24|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another relevant concept is the notion of "cultural functionality".  Specifically, some organizations have "functional" cultures while others have   "dysfunctional" cultures.&lt;ref&gt;lamholtz and Randle, 2011, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; A "functional" culture is a positive culture that contributes to  an organization's performance and success. A "dysfunctional" culture is one that hampers or negatively affects  an organization's performance and success.

== Management of culture ==

There are many different types of communication that contribute in creating an organizational culture:&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Gazi and Zyphur, Michael. (2009). Rituals in organizations: A review and expansion of current theory. Group Organization Management. (34),  1140139.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Metaphors such as comparing an organization to a machine or a family reveal employees' shared meanings of experiences at the organization.
* Stories can provide examples for employees of how to or not to act in certain situations.
* Rites and ceremonies combine stories, metaphors, and symbols into one. Several different kinds of rites affect organizational culture:
** Rites of passage: employees move into new roles
** Rites of degradation: employees have power taken away from them
** Rites of enhancement: public recognition for an employee's accomplishments
** Rites of renewal: improve existing social structures
** Rites of conflict reduction: resolve arguments between certain members or groups
** Rites of integration: reawaken feelings of membership in the organization
* Reflexive comments are explanations, justifications, and criticisms of our own actions. This includes:
** Plans: comments about anticipated actions
** Commentaries: comments about action in the present
** Accounts: comments about an action or event that has already occurred
: Such comments reveal interpretive meanings held by the speaker as well as the social rules they follow.
* Fantasy Themes are common creative interpretations of events that reflect beliefs, values, and goals of the organization. They lead to rhetorical visions, or views of the organization and its environment held by organization members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kreatywna.pl/| title=culture }} wednesday, 16 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bullying culture ==
{{Main|Bullying culture|Workplace bullying}}
Bullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that
they have the support, or at least implicitly the blessing, of senior managers to carry on their abusive
and bullying behaviour. Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as
acceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. That people may be bullied irrespective of their organisational status or rank, including senior managers, indicates the possibility of a negative ripple effect, where bullying may be cascaded downwards as the targeted supervisors might offload their own [[aggression]] on their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the [[boardroom]] may actually threaten the [[productivity]] of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of fear==
{{Main|Culture of fear}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]], i.e. leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Partial or intermittent negative [[reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies "get away with it", a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name="Organisational"/&gt; Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[Workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.&lt;ref name="Salin D 2010"/&gt;

In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[Turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had "got away with it" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

== Tribal culture ==
David Logan and coauthors have proposed in their book [[Tribal Leadership]] that organizational cultures change in stages, based on an analysis of human groups and tribal cultures. They identify five basic stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization |first1=Dave |last1=Logan |first2=John |last2=King |first3=Halee |last3=Fischer-Wright |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2009 |isbn=0061251305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Life sucks'' (a subsystem severed from other functional systems like tribes, gangs and prison—2 percent of population);
#''My life sucks'' (I am stuck in the Dumb Motor Vehicle line and can't believe I have to spend my time in this lost triangle of ineffectiveness—25 percent of population);
#''I'm great'' (and you're not, I am detached from you and will dominate you regardless of your intent—48 percent of population);
#''We are great, but other groups suck'' (citing Zappo's and an attitude of unification around more than individual competence—22 percent of population) and
#''Life is great'' (citing Desmond Tutu's hearing on truth and values as the basis of reconciliation—3 percent of population).
This model of organizational culture provides a map and context for leading an organization through the five stages.

==Personal culture==
: ''Main: [[Personality psychology]], [[Identity (social science)]]''
Organizational culture is taught to the person as culture is taught by his/her parents thus changing and modeling his/her personal culture.&lt;ref name="cindy"&gt;Cindy Gordon, [http://www.camagazine.com/archives/print-edition/2008/january-february/regulars/camagazine5413.aspx Cashing in on corporate culture], CA magazine, January–February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, employees and people applying for a job are advised to match their "personality to a company's culture" and fit to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careerrocketeer.com/2009/07/personality-and-corporate-culture.html Personality and Corporate Culture: Where's a Person to Fit?], Career Rocketeer, July 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers even suggested and have made case studies research on personality changing.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Lejeune, Alain Vas, [http://www.alba.edu.gr/sites/pros/Papers/PROS-073.pdf Comparing the processes of identity change: A multiple-case study approach],&lt;/ref&gt;

==National culture==
Corporate culture is used to control, coordinate, and integrate company subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="nationalculture"&gt;Susan C. Schneider, ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hrm.3930270207/abstract National vs. corporate culture: Implications for human resource management]'', Human Resource Management, Volume 27, Issue 2, Summer 1988, pp. 231–246, {{doi|10.1002/hrm.3930270207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However differences in national cultures exist contributing to differences in the views on management.&lt;ref&gt;Li Dong, Keith Glaister, [https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/asiapa/v24y2007i2p191-205.html National and corporate culture differences in international strategic alliances: Perceptions of Chinese partners (RePEc)], Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 24 (June 2007), pp. 191–205&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between national cultures are deep rooted values of the respective cultures, and these cultural values can shape how people expect companies to be run, and how relationships between leaders and followers should be, resulting in differences between the employer and the employee regarding expectations. (Geert Hofstede, 1991) Perhaps equally foundational; observing the vast differences in national copyright (and taxation, etc.) laws suggests deep rooted differences in cultural attitudes and assumptions about property rights and sometimes about the desired root function, place, or purpose of corporations relative to the population.

===Multiplicity===
: ''See also: [[Biculturalism]]''

Xibao Zhang (2009) carried out an empirical study of culture emergence in the Sino-Western international cross-cultural management (SW-ICCM) context in China. Field data were collected by interviewing Western expatriates and Chinese professionals working in this context, supplemented by non-participant observation and documentary data. The data were then analyzed objectively to formulate theme-based substantive theories and a formal theory.

The major finding of this study is that the human cognition contains three components, or three broad types of "cultural rules of behavior", namely, Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules, each of which has a mutually conditioning relationship with behavior. The three cognitive components are different in terms of the scope and duration of their mutual shaping of behavior. Values are universal and enduring rules of behavior; Expectations, on the other hand, are context-specific behavioral rules; while Ad Hoc Rules are improvised rules of behavior that the human mind devises contingent upon a particular occasion. Furthermore, they need not be consistent, and frequently are not, among themselves. Metaphorically, they can be compared to a multi-carriage train, which allows for the relative lateral movements by individual carriages so as to accommodate bumps and turns in the tracks. In fact, they provide a "shock-absorber mechanism", so to speak, which enables individuals in SW-ICCM contexts to cope with conflicts in cultural practices and values, and to accommodate and adapt themselves to cultural contexts where people from different national cultural backgrounds work together over extended time. It also provides a powerful framework which explains how interactions by individuals in SW-ICCM contexts give rise to emerging hybrid cultural practices characterized by both stability and change.

One major theoretical contribution of this "multi-carriage train" perspective is its allowance for the existence of inconsistencies among the three cognitive components in their mutual conditioning of behavior. This internal inconsistency view is in stark contrast to the traditional internal consistency assumption explicitly or tacitly held by many culture scholars. The other major theoretical contribution, which follows logically from the first one, is to view culture as an overarching entity which is made of a multiplicity of Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules. This notion of one (multiplicity) culture to an organization leads to the classification of culture along its path of emergence into nascent, adolescent, and mature types, each of which is distinct in terms of the pattern of the three cognitive components and behavior.

==Effects==
Research suggests that numerous outcomes have been associated either directly or indirectly with organizational culture.   A healthy and robust organizational culture may provide various benefits, including the following:

* Competitive edge derived from innovation and customer service
* Consistent, efficient employee performance
* Team cohesiveness
* High employee morale
* Strong company alignment towards goal achievement

Although little empirical research exists to support the link between organizational culture and organizational performance, there is little doubt among experts that this relationship exists.  Organizational culture can be a factor in the survival or failure of an organization – although this is difficult to prove given that the necessary longitudinal analyses are hardly feasible.  The sustained superior performance of firms like [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[McDonald's]] may be, at least partly, a reflection of their organizational cultures.

A 2003 [[Harvard Business School]] study reported that culture has a significant effect on an organization's long-term economic performance. The study examined the management practices at 160 organizations over ten years and found that culture can enhance performance or prove detrimental to performance.  Organizations with strong performance-oriented cultures witnessed far better financial growth.  Additionally, a 2002 Corporate Leadership Council study found that cultural traits such as risk taking, internal communications, and flexibility are some of the most important drivers of performance, and may affect individual performance.  Furthermore, innovativeness, productivity through people, and the other cultural factors cited by [[Tom Peters|Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman, Jr.|Waterman]] (1982) also have positive economic consequences.

Denison, Haaland, and Goelzer (2004) found that culture contributes to the success of the organization, but not all dimensions contribute the same.  It was found that the effects of these dimensions differ by global regions, which suggests that organizational culture is affected by national culture.  Additionally, Clarke (2006) found that a safety climate is related to an organization's safety record.

Organizational culture is reflected in the way people perform tasks, set objectives, and administer the necessary resources to achieve objectives.  Culture affects the way individuals make decisions, feel, and act in response to the opportunities and threats affecting the organization.

Adkins and Caldwell (2004) found that job satisfaction was positively associated with the degree to which employees fit into both the overall culture and subculture in which they worked.   A perceived mismatch of the organization's culture and what employees felt the culture should be is related to a number of negative consequences including lower job satisfaction, higher job strain, general stress, and turnover intent.

It has been proposed that organizational culture may affect the level of employee creativity, the strength of employee motivation, and the reporting of unethical behavior, but more research is needed to support these conclusions.

Organizational culture also affects recruitment and retention.  Individuals tend to be attracted to and remain engaged in organizations that they perceive to be compatible.  Additionally, high turnover may be a mediating factor in the relationship between culture and organizational performance.  Deteriorating company performance and an unhealthy work environment are signs of an overdue cultural assessment.

==Change==
When an organization does not possess a healthy culture or requires some kind of organizational culture change, the change process can be daunting. Organizational culture can hinder new change efforts, especially where employees know their expectations and the roles that they are supposed to play in the organization. This is corroborated by Mar (2016:1) who argues that 70% of all change efforts fail because of the culture of an organization's employees. One major reason why such change is difficult is that organizational cultures, and the organizational structures in which they are embedded, often reflect the "imprint" of earlier periods in a persistent way and exhibit remarkable levels of inertia.&lt;ref name=Marquis&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture change may be necessary to reduce employee turnover, influence employee behavior, make improvements to the company, refocus the company objectives and/or rescale the organization, provide better customer service, and/or achieve specific company goals and results. Culture change is affected by a number of elements, including the external environment and industry competitors, change in industry standards, technology changes, the size and nature of the workforce, and the organization's history and management.

There are a number of methodologies specifically dedicated to organizational culture change such as [[Peter Senge]]'s ''Fifth Discipline''. There are also a variety of psychological approaches that have been developed into a system for specific outcomes such as the ''Fifth Discipline's'' "learning organization" or ''Directive Communication's'' "corporate culture evolution." Ideas and strategies, on the other hand, seem to vary according to particular influences that affect culture.

Burman and Evans (2008) argue that it is '[[leadership]]' that affects culture rather than '[[management]]', and describe the difference. When one wants to change an aspect of the culture of an organization one has to keep in consideration that this is a long term project. Corporate culture is something that is very hard to change and employees need time to get used to the new way of organizing. For companies with a very strong and specific culture it will be even harder to change.

Prior to a cultural change initiative, a needs assessment is needed to identify and understand the current organizational culture.  This can be done through employee surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, customer surveys where appropriate, and other internal research, to further identify areas that require change.  The company must then assess and clearly identify the new, desired culture, and then design a change process.

Cummings &amp; Worley (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491 – 492) give the following six guidelines for cultural change, these changes are in line with the [[Kotter's 8-Stage Change Model|eight distinct stages]] mentioned by Kotter (1995, p.&amp;nbsp;2):
# Formulate a clear strategic vision (stage 1, 2, and 3). In order to make a cultural change effective a clear vision of the firm's new strategy, shared values and behaviors is needed. This vision provides the intention and direction for the culture change (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;490).
# Display top-management commitment (stage 4). It is very important to keep in mind that culture change must be managed from the top of the organization, as willingness to change of the senior management is an important indicator (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, page 490). The top of the organization should be very much in favor of the change in order to actually implement the change in the rest of the organization. De Caluwé &amp; Vermaak (2004, p 9) provide a framework with five different ways of thinking about change.
# Model culture change at the highest level (stage 5). In order to show that the management team is in favor of the change, the change has to be notable at first at this level. The behavior of the management needs to symbolize the kinds of values and behaviors that should be realized in the rest of the company. It is important that the management shows the strengths of the current culture as well; it must be made clear that the current organizational culture does not need radical changes, but just a few adjustments. (See for more: Deal &amp; Kennedy, 1982;&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt; Sathe, 1983; Schall; 1983; Weick, 1985; DiTomaso, 1987). This process may also include creating committees, employee task forces, value managers, or similar. Change agents are key in the process and key communicators of the new values.  They should possess courage, flexibility, excellent interpersonal skills, knowledge of the company, and patience. As McCune (May 1999) puts it, these individuals should be catalysts, not dictators.
# The fourth step is to modify the organization to support organizational change.  This includes identifying what current systems, policies, procedures and rules need to be changed in order to align with the new values and desired culture.  This may include a change to accountability systems, compensation, benefits and reward structures, and recruitment and retention programs to better align with the new values and to send a clear message to employees that the old system and culture are in the past.
# Select and socialize newcomers and terminate deviants (stage 7 &amp; 8  of Kotter, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;2). A way to implement a culture is to connect it to organizational membership, people can be selected and terminated in terms of their fit with the new culture (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491). Encouraging employee motivation and loyalty to the company is key and will also result in a healthy culture. The company and change managers should be able to articulate the connections between the desired behavior and how it will affect and improve the company's success, to further encourage buy-in in the change process. Training should be provided to all employees to understand the new processes, expectations and systems.
# Develop ethical and legal sensitivity. Changes in culture can lead to tensions between organizational and individual interests, which can result in ethical and legal problems for practitioners. This is particularly relevant for changes in employee integrity, control, equitable treatment and job security (Cummings &amp; Worley, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;491). It is also beneficial, as part of the change process, to include an evaluation process, conducted periodically to monitor the change progress and identify areas that need further development. This step will also identify obstacles of change and resistant employees, and acknowledge and reward employee improvement, which will encourage continued change and evolvement. It may also be helpful and necessary to incorporate new change managers to refresh the process. Outside consultants may also be useful in facilitating the change process and providing employee training. Change of culture in organizations is very important and inevitable. Cultural innovation&lt;ref&gt;Molly Rose Teuke, [http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/features/p17andrew-143871.html Creating culture of innovation], Oracle Magazine, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is bound to be more difficult than cultural maintenance because it entails introducing something new and substantially different from what prevails in existing cultures. People often resist changes, hence it is the duty of management to convince people that likely gain will outweigh the losses. Besides institutionalization, deification is another process that tends to occur in strongly developed organizational cultures. The organization itself may come to be regarded as precious in itself, as a source of pride, and in some sense unique. The organization's members begin to feel a strong bond with it that transcends material returns, and they begin to identify with it. The organization turns into a sort of clan.

===Mergers and cultural leadership===
One of the biggest obstacles in the way of the merging of two organizations is organizational culture. Each organization has its own unique culture and most often, when brought together, these cultures clash. When mergers fail employees point to issues such as identity, communication problems, human resources problems, ego clashes, and inter-group conflicts, which all fall under the category of "cultural differences".

One way to combat such difficulties is through cultural leadership. Organizational leaders must also be cultural leaders and help facilitate the change from the two old cultures into the one new culture. This is done through cultural innovation followed by cultural maintenance.
* Cultural innovation includes:
** Creating a new culture: recognizing past cultural differences and setting realistic expectations for change
** Changing the culture: weakening and replacing the old cultures
* Cultural maintenance includes:
** Integrating the new culture: reconciling the differences between the old cultures and the new one
** Embodying the new culture: Establishing, affirming, and keeping the new culture

==Corporate subcultures==
Corporate culture is the total sum of the values, customs, traditions, and meanings that make a company unique. Corporate culture is often called "the character of an organization", since it embodies the vision of the company's founders.  The values of a corporate culture influence the ethical standards within a corporation, as well as managerial behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Montana, P., and Charnov, B. (2008) Management (4th ed.), Barrons Educational Series, Hauppauge:NY&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Senior management]] may try to determine a ''corporate culture''. They may wish to impose corporate values and standards of behavior that specifically reflect the objectives of the organization. In addition, there will also be an extant internal culture within the workforce. Work-groups within the organization have their own behavioral quirks and interactions which, to an extent, affect the whole system. Roger Harrison's four-culture typology, and adapted by Charles Handy, suggests that unlike organizational culture, corporate culture can be 'imported'. For example, computer technicians will have expertise, language and behaviors gained independently of the organization, but their presence can influence the culture of the organization as a whole.

==Legal aspects==
Corporate culture can legally be found to be a cause of injuries and a reason for fining companies in the US, e.g., when the [[US Department of Labor]] [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] levied a fine of more than 10.8 million US dollars on Performance Coal Co. following the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] in April 2010. This was the largest fine in the history of this U.S. government agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/msha/MSHA20111734.htm  US Labor Department's MSHA cites corporate culture as root cause of Upper Big Branch Mine disaster], MSHA News Release, [[US Department of Labor]], May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
Criticism of the usage of the term by managers began already in its emergence in the early 80s.&lt;ref name="hispanicengineer"/&gt; Most of the criticism comes from the writers in [[critical management studies]] who for example express skepticism about the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] and [[unitarist]] views about culture that are put forward by [[mainstream]] management writers. They stress the ways in which these cultural assumptions can stifle dissent management and reproduce propaganda and ideology. They suggest that organizations do not have a single culture and [[cultural engineering]] may not reflect the interests of all stakeholders within an organization.

Parker (2000) has suggested that many of the assumptions of those putting forward theories of organizational culture are not new. They reflect a long-standing tension between cultural and structural (or informal and formal) versions of what organizations are. Further, it is reasonable to suggest that complex organizations might have many cultures, and that such sub-cultures might overlap and contradict each other. The neat typologies of cultural forms found in textbooks rarely acknowledge such complexities, or the various economic contradictions that exist in capitalist organizations.

Among the strongest and most widely recognized writers on corporate culture, with a long list of articles on [[leadership]], [[culture]], [[gender]] and their intersection, is [[Linda Smircich]]. As a part of the [[critical management studies]], she criticizes theories that attempt to categorize or 'pigeonhole' organizational culture.&lt;ref name="Linda" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Brewis, "Othering Organization Theory: Marta Calás and Linda Smircich" ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2005.00542.x/abstract abstract]), The Sociological Review, ''Special Issue: Sociological Review Monograph Series: Contemporary Organization Theory'', editors Campbell Jones and Rolland Munro, Volume 53, Issue Supplement s1, pp. 80–94, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She uses the metaphor of a plant root to represent culture, saying that it drives organizations rather than vice versa. Organizations are the product of organizational culture; we are unaware of how it shapes behavior and interaction (also implicit in Schein's (2002) underlying assumptions{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}), and so how can we categorize it and define what it is?

== Research and models==

Several methods have been used to classify organizational culture.  While there is no single "type" of organizational culture and organizational cultures vary widely from one organization to the next, commonalities do exist and some researchers have developed models to describe different indicators of organizational cultures.  Some are described below:

=== Hofstede ===

{{main|Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory}}

[[Hofstede]] (1980) looked for differences between over 160 000 [[IBM]] employees in 50 different countries and three regions of the world, in an attempt to find aspects of culture that might influence business behavior. He suggested things about cultural differences existing in regions and nations, and the importance of international awareness and multiculturalism for their own cultural introspection. Cultural differences reflect differences in thinking and social action, and even in "mental programs", a term Hofstede uses for predictable behavior. Hofstede relates culture to ethnic and regional groups, but also organizations, professional, family, social and subcultural groups, national political systems and legislation, etc.

Hofstede suggests the need for changing "mental programs" with changing behavior first, which will lead to value change. Though certain groups like Jews and Gypsies have maintained their identity through centuries, their values show adaptation to the dominant cultural environment.

&lt;!-- This text is generally correct but may be wrong in this context. One could add Hofstede's definition of organizational culture. --&gt;Hofstede demonstrated that there are national and regional cultural groupings that affect the behavior of organizations and identified four [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|dimensions of culture]] (later five&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"&gt;Hofstede, Geert H. 2001. Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviors, Institutions, and Organizations Across Nations. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;) in his study of national cultures:

* ''Power distance'' (Mauk Mulder, 1977) – Different societies find different solutions regarding social inequality. Although invisible, inside organizations power inequality of the "boss-subordinate relationships" is functional and according to Hofstede reflects the way inequality is addressed in the society. "According to Mulder's Power Distance Reduction theory subordinates will try to reduce the power distance between themselves and their bosses and bosses will try to maintain or enlarge it", but there is also a degree to which a society expects there to be differences in the levels of power. A high score suggests that there is an expectation that some individuals wield larger amounts of power than others. A low score reflects the view that all people should have equal rights.
* ''Uncertainty avoidance'' is the way of coping with uncertainty about the [[future]]. Society copes with it with [[technology]], [[law]] and [[religion]] (though different societies have different ways of addressing it), and according to Hofstede organizations deal with it with technology, law and [[ritual]]s, or in two ways – rational and non-rational, with rituals being the non-rational. Hofstede listed some of the rituals as the memos and reports, some parts of the accounting system, a large part of the planning and control systems, and the nomination of experts.
* ''Individualism vs. collectivism'' – disharmony of interests on personal and collective goals (Parsons and Shils, 1951). Hofstede raises the idea that society's expectations of [[Individualism]]/[[Collectivism]] will be reflected by the employee inside the organization. Collectivist societies will have more emotional dependence on members in their organizations; when in equilibrium an organization is expected to show responsibility to members. Extreme individualism is seen in the [[US]]. In fact, collectivism in the US is seen as "bad". Other cultures and societies than the US will therefore seek to resolve social and organizational problems in ways different from American ways. Hofstede says that a capitalist market economy fosters individualism and [[competition]], and depends on it, but individualism is also related to the development of the [[middle class]]. &lt;small&gt;Some people and cultures might have both high individualism and high collectivism. For example, someone who highly values duty to his or her group does not necessarily give a low priority to personal freedom and self-sufficiency.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''[[Masculinity]] vs. [[femininity]]'' –  reflects whether a certain society is predominantly male or female in terms of cultural values, [[gender role]]s and power relations.
* Long- Versus Short-Term Orientation&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"/&gt; which he describes as "The long-term orientation dimension can be interpreted as dealing with society's search for virtue. Societies with a short-term orientation generally have a strong concern with establishing the absolute Truth. They are normative in their thinking. They exhibit great respect for traditions, a relatively small propensity to save for the future, and a focus on achieving quick results. In societies with a long-term orientation, people believe that truth depends very much on situation, context and time. They show an ability to adapt traditions to changed conditions, a strong propensity to save and invest, thriftiness, and perseverance in achieving results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831002012/http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html |archivedate=2013-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dimensions refer to the effect of national cultures on management, and can be used to adapt policies to local needs.
In a follow up study, another model&lt;ref name="Hofstede, Geert H 2001"/&gt; is suggested for organizational culture.

=== O'Reilly, Chatman, and Caldwell ===

Two common models and their associated measurement tools have been developed by O'Reilly ''et al.'' and [[Daniel R. Denison|Denison]].

O'Reilly, [[Jennifer Chatman|Chatman]] &amp; Caldwell (1991) developed a model based on the belief that cultures can be distinguished by values that are reinforced within organizations.  Their Organizational Cultural Profile (OCP) is a self reporting tool which makes distinctions according eight categories – Innovation, Supportiveness, Stability, Respect for People, Outcome Orientation, Attention to Detail, Team Orientation, and Aggressiveness.  The model is also suited to measure how organizational culture affects organizational performance, as it measures most efficient persons suited to an organization{{Clarify|date=February 2014}} and as such organizations can be termed as having good organizational culture.
Employee values are measured against organizational values to predict employee intentions to stay, and [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]].&lt;ref name="becky"&gt;Becky H. Takeda, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RojvMmfcZfAC&amp;pg=PA2 Investigation of employee tenure as related to relationships of personality and personal values of entrepreneurs and their perceptions of their employees]'', ProQuest, 2007, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through an instrument like Organizational Culture Profile (OCP) to measure employee commitment.&lt;ref name="becky"/&gt;

=== Daniel Denison ===

Daniel Denison's model (1990) asserts that organizational culture can be described by four general dimensions – Mission, Adaptability, Involvement and Consistency.  Each of these general dimensions is further described by the following three sub-dimensions:

* Mission – Strategic Direction and Intent, Goals and Objectives and Vision
* Adaptability – Creating Change, Customer Focus and Organizational Learning
* Involvement – Empowerment, Team Orientation and Capability Development
* Consistency – Core Values, Agreement, Coordination/Integration

Denison's model also allows cultures to be described broadly as externally or internally focused as well as flexible versus stable.  The model has been typically used to diagnose cultural problems in organizations.

=== Deal and Kennedy ===

Deal and Kennedy (1982)&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt; defined organizational culture as ''the way things get done around here''.

Deal and Kennedy created a model of culture that is based on 4 different types of organizations. They each focus on how quickly the organization receives feedback, the way members are rewarded, and the level of risks taken:&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"&gt;[http://changingminds.org/explanations/culture/deal_kennedy_culture.htm Deal and Kennedy's cultural model], ChangingMinds.org&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Work-hard, play-hard culture''': This has rapid feedback/reward and low risk resulting in: Stress coming from quantity of work rather than uncertainty. High-speed action leading to high-speed recreation. Examples: Restaurants, software companies.&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Tough-guy macho culture''': This has rapid feedback/reward and high risk, resulting in the following: Stress coming from high risk and potential loss/gain of reward. Focus on the present rather than the longer-term future. Examples: police, surgeons, sports.&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Process culture''': This has slow feedback/reward and low risk, resulting in the following: Low stress, plodding work, comfort and security. Stress that comes from internal politics and stupidity of the system. Development of bureaucracies and other ways of maintaining the status quo. Focus on security of the past and of the future. Examples: banks, insurance companies.&lt;ref name=dealkennedy/&gt;&lt;ref name="changingminds.org"/&gt;
# '''Bet-the-company culture''': This has slow feedback/reward and high risk, resulting in the following: Stress coming from high risk and delay before knowing if actions have paid off. The long view is taken, but then much work is put into making sure things happen as planned. Examples: aircraft manufacturers, oil companies.

=== Edgar Schein ===

According to [[Edgar Schein|Schein]] (1992),&lt;ref name=schein2009/&gt; culture is the most difficult organizational attribute to change, outlasting organizational products, services, founders and leadership and all other physical attributes of the organization.  His organizational model illuminates culture from the standpoint of the [[observation|observer]], described at three levels: ''artifacts'', ''espoused values'' and ''basic underlying assumptions''.

At the first and most cursory level of Schein's model is organizational attributes that can be seen, felt and heard by the uninitiated observer – collectively known as ''artifacts''. Included are the facilities, offices, furnishings, visible awards and recognition, the way that its members dress, how each person visibly interacts with each other and with organizational outsiders, and even company [[slogan]]s, [[mission statement]]s and other operational [[creed]]s.

Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. [[Daniel R. Denison|Daniel Denison]] (1990) describes artifacts as the tangible aspects of culture shared by members of an organization. Verbal, behavioral and physical artifacts are the surface manifestations of organizational culture.

Rituals, the collective interpersonal behavior and values as demonstrated by that behavior, constitute the fabric of an organization's culture.  The contents of myths, stories, and sagas reveal the history of an organization and influence how people understand what their organization values and believes.  Language, stories, and myths are examples of verbal artifacts and are represented in rituals and ceremonies. Technology and art exhibited by members of an organization are examples of physical artifacts.

The next level deals with the professed culture of an organization's members – the ''values''. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g.  loyalty, customer service). At this level, local and personal values are widely expressed within the organization. Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture. Organizational behavior at this level usually can be studied by interviewing the organization's membership and using questionnaires to gather attitudes about organizational membership.

At the third and deepest level, the organization's [[tacit assumption]]s are found.  These are the elements of culture that are unseen and not cognitively identified in everyday interactions between organizational members. Additionally, these are the elements of culture which are often taboo to discuss inside the organization.  Many of these '[[unspoken rules]]' exist without the conscious knowledge of the membership.  Those with sufficient experience to understand this deepest level of organizational culture usually become acclimatized to its attributes over time, thus reinforcing the invisibility of their existence. Surveys and casual interviews with organizational members cannot draw out these attributes—rather much more in-depth means is required to first identify then understand organizational culture at this level.  Notably, culture at this level is the underlying and driving element often missed by organizational behaviorists.

Using Schein's model, understanding paradoxical organizational behaviors becomes more apparent.  For instance, an organization can profess highly aesthetic and moral standards at the second level of Schein's model while simultaneously displaying curiously opposing behavior at the third and deepest level of culture.  Superficially, organizational rewards can imply one organizational norm but at the deepest level imply something completely different.  This insight offers an understanding of the difficulty that organizational newcomers have in assimilating organizational culture and why it takes time to become acclimatized. It also explains why organizational change agents usually fail to achieve their goals: underlying tacit cultural norms are generally not understood before would-be change agents begin their actions. Merely understanding culture at the deepest level may be insufficient to institute cultural change because the dynamics of interpersonal relationships (often under threatening conditions) are added to the dynamics of organizational culture while attempts are made to institute desired change.

According to Schein (1992),&lt;ref name="schein2009" /&gt; the two main reasons why cultures develop in organizations is due to external adaptation and internal integration.  External adaptation reflects an evolutionary approach to organizational culture and suggests that cultures develop and persist because they help an organization to survive and flourish.  If the culture is valuable, then it holds the potential for generating sustained competitive advantages.  Additionally, internal integration is an important function since social structures are required for organizations to exist.  Organizational practices are learned through socialization at the workplace.  Work environments reinforce culture on a daily basis by encouraging employees to exercise cultural values.
Organizational culture is shaped by multiple factors, including the following:
* External environment
* Industry
* Size and nature of the organization's workforce
* Technologies the organization uses
* The organization's history and ownership

=== Gerry Johnson ===

Gerry Johnson (1988) described a cultural web, identifying a number of elements that can be used to describe or influence organizational culture:

* '''The paradigm''': What the organization is about, what it does, its mission, its values.
* '''Control systems''': The processes in place to monitor what is going on. Role cultures would have vast rule-books. There would be more reliance on individualism in a power culture.
* '''Organizational structures''': Reporting lines, hierarchies, and the way that work flows through the business.
* '''Power structures''': Who makes the decisions, how widely spread is power, and on what is power based?
* '''Symbols''': These include organizational logos and designs, but also extend to symbols of power such as parking spaces and executive washrooms.
* '''Rituals and routines''': Management meetings, board reports and so on may become more habitual than necessary.
* '''Stories and myths''': build up about people and events, and convey a message about what is valued within the organization.

These elements may overlap.  Power structures may depend on control systems, which may exploit the very rituals that generate stories which may not be true.

*

=== Stanley G. Harris ===

''Schemata'' (plural of schema) are knowledge structures a person forms from past experiences, allowing the person to respond to similar events more efficiently in the future by guiding the processing of information.  A person's schemata are created through interaction with others, and thus inherently involve communication.

Stanley G. Harris (1994) argues that five categories of in-organization schemata are necessary for organizational culture:

# '''Self-in-organization schemata''': a person's concept of oneself within the context of the organization, including her/his personality, roles, and behavior.
# '''Person-in-organization schemata''': a person's memories, impressions, and expectations of other individuals within the organization.
# '''Organization schemata''': a subset of person schemata, a person's generalized perspective on others as a whole in the organization.
# '''Object/concept-in-organization schemata''': knowledge an individual has of organization aspects other than of other persons.
# '''Event-in-organization schemata''': a person's knowledge of social events within an organization.

All of these categories together represent a person's knowledge of an organization.
Organizational culture is created when the schematas (schematic structures) of differing individuals across and within an organization come to resemble each other (when any one person's schemata come to resemble another person's schemata because of mutual organizational involvement), primarily done through organizational communication, as individuals directly or indirectly share knowledge and meanings.

=== Charles Handy ===

[[Charles Handy]] (1976),  popularized Roger Harrison (1972) with linking [[organizational structure]] to organizational culture. The described four types of culture are:&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Ruiz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ_uPnC6kTIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Discriminate Or Diversify]'', PositivePsyche.Biz Corp, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Power culture''': concentrates [[power (social and political)|power]] among a small group or a central figure and its control is radiating from its center like a web. Power cultures need only a few rules and little [[bureaucracy]] but swift in decisions can ensue.
# '''Role culture''': authorities are delegated as such within a highly defined structure. These organizations form hierarchical bureaucracies, where power derives from the personal position and rarely from an expert power. Control is made by procedures (which are highly valued), strict roles descriptions and authority definitions. These organizations have consistent systems and are very predictable. This culture is often represented by a "Roman Building" having pillars. These pillars represent the functional departments.
# '''Task culture''': teams are formed to solve particular problems. Power is derived from the team with the expertise to execute against a task. This culture uses a small team approach, where people are highly skilled and specialized in their own area of expertise. Additionally, these cultures often feature the multiple reporting lines seen in a [[matrix management|matrix structure]].
# '''Person culture''': formed where all individuals believe themselves superior to the organization. It can become difficult for such organizations to continue to operate, since the concept of an organization suggests that a group of like-minded individuals pursue organizational goals. However some professional partnerships operate well as person cultures, because each partner brings a particular expertise and clientele to the firm.

=== Kim Cameron and Robert Quinn ===

{{see also|Archetype}}

[[Kim S. Cameron|Kim Cameron]] and Robert Quinn (1999) conducted research on organizational effectiveness and success. Based on the Competing Values Framework, they developed the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument that distinguishes four culture types.

Competing values produce polarities like flexibility vs. stability and internal vs. external focus – these two polarities were found to be most important in defining organizational success. The polarities construct a quadrant with four types of culture:

* [[Clan]] culture (internal focus and flexible) – A friendly workplace where leaders act like father figures.
* [[Adhocracy]] culture (external focus and flexible) – A dynamic workplace with leaders that stimulate innovation.
* Market culture (external focus and controlled) – A competitive workplace with leaders like hard drivers
* [[Hierarchical organization|Hierarchy]] culture (internal focus and controlled) – A structured and formalized workplace where leaders act like coordinators.

Cameron and Quinn designated six characteristics of organizational culture that can be assessed with the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI).

Clan cultures are most strongly associated with positive employee [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and product and [[service quality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, D.L., &amp; Haug, R. (nd).VOrganizational Culture: Diagnosing a Customer Contact Company. Retrieved Dec. 14, 2014.[http://inspirexcellence.com/Articles/OrganizationalCulture_Beyer&amp;Associates.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Market cultures are most strongly related with [[innovation]] and financial effectiveness criteria. The primary belief in market cultures that clear goals and contingent rewards motivate employees to aggressively perform and meet stakeholders' expectations; a core belief in clan cultures is that the organization's trust in and commitment to employees facilitates open communication and employee involvement. These differing results suggest that it is important for executive leaders to consider the match between strategic initiatives and organizational culture when determining how to embed a culture that produces competitive advantage. By assessing the current organizational culture as well as the preferred situation, the gap and direction to change can be made visible as a first step to changing organizational culture.

=== Robert A. Cooke ===

Robert A. Cooke defines culture as the behaviors that members believe are required to fit in and meet expectations within their organization. The Organizational Culture Inventory measures twelve behavioral norms that are grouped into three general types of cultures:

* Constructive cultures, in which members are encouraged to interact with people and approach tasks in ways that help them meet their higher-order satisfaction needs.
* Passive/defensive cultures, in which members believe they must interact with people in ways that will not threaten their own security.
* Aggressive/defensive cultures, in which members are expected to approach tasks in forceful ways to protect their status and security.

==== Constructive cultures ====

In constructive cultures, people are encouraged to be in communication with their co-workers, and work as teams, rather than only as individuals. In positions where people do a complex job, rather than something simple like a mechanical task, this culture is efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=R. A.|title=The Organizational Culture Inventory|year=1987|publisher=Human Synergistics, Inc.|location=Plymouth, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Achievement''': completing a task successfully, typically by effort, courage, or skill (pursue a standard of excellence) (explore alternatives before acting) – Based on the need to attain high-quality results on challenging projects, the belief that outcomes are linked to one's effort rather than chance and the tendency to personally set challenging yet realistic goals. People high in this style think ahead and plan, explore alternatives before acting and learn from their mistakes.
# '''Self-actualizing''': realization or fulfillment of one's talents and potentialities – considered as a drive or need present in everyone (think in unique and independent ways) (do even simple tasks well) – Based on needs for personal growth, self-fulfillment and the realization of one's potential. People with this style demonstrate a strong desire to learn and experience things, creative yet realistic thinking and a balanced concern for people and tasks.
# '''Humanistic-encouraging''': help others to grow and develop (resolve conflicts constructively) – Reflects an interest in the growth and development of people, a high positive regard for them and sensitivity to their needs. People high in this style devote energy to coaching and counselling others, are thoughtful and considerate and provide people with support and encouragement.
# '''Affiliative''': treat people as more valuable than things (cooperate with others) – Reflects an interest in developing and sustaining pleasant relationships. People high in this style share their thoughts and feelings, are friendly and cooperative and make others feel a part of things.

Organizations with constructive cultures encourage members to work to their full potential, resulting in high levels of motivation, satisfaction, teamwork, service quality, and sales growth. Constructive norms are evident in environments where quality is valued over quantity, creativity is valued over conformity, cooperation is believed to lead to better results than competition, and effectiveness is judged at the system level rather than the component level. These types of cultural norms are consistent with (and supportive of) the objectives behind empowerment, [[total quality management]], transformational leadership, continuous improvement, re-engineering, and learning organizations.&lt;ref name=kotter1992/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the Organizational Culture Inventory (OCI) to Measure Kotter and Heskett's Adaptive and Unadaptive Cultures|url=http://www.trainersdirect.com/resources/articles/changemanagement/orgcultureinventory.htm|publisher=Human Synergistics|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructive Styles|url=http://www.human-synergistics.com.au/content/products/circumplex/constructive.asp|publisher=Human-Synergistics|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Passive/defensive cultures ====

Norms that reflect expectations for members to interact with people in ways that will not threaten their own security are in the Passive/Defensive Cluster.

The four Passive/Defensive cultural norms are:

* Approval
* Conventional
* Dependent
* Avoidance

In organizations with Passive/Defensive cultures, members feel pressured to think and behave in ways that are inconsistent with the way they believe they should in order to be effective. People are expected to please others (particularly superiors) and avoid interpersonal conflict. Rules, procedures, and orders are more important than personal beliefs, ideas, and judgment. Passive/Defensive cultures experience a lot of unresolved conflict and turnover, and organizational members report lower levels of motivation and satisfaction.

==== Aggressive/defensive cultures ====

This style is characterized with more emphasis on task than people. Because of the very nature of this style, people tend to focus on their own individual needs at the expense of the success of the group. The aggressive/defensive style is very stressful, and people using this style tend to make decisions based on status as opposed to expertise.&lt;ref name="Aggressive/Defensive Styles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aggressive/Defensive Styles|url=http://www.human-synergistics.com.au/content/products/circumplex/aggressive.asp|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Oppositional''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea that a need for security that takes the form of being very critical and cynical at times.  People who use this style are more likely to question others work; however, asking those tough question often leads to a better product. Nonetheless, those who use this style may be overly-critical toward others, using irrelevant or trivial flaws to put others down.
# '''[[Power (social and political)|Power]]''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea that there is a need for prestige and influence. Those who use this style often equate their own [[self-worth]] with controlling others. Those who use this style have a tendency to dictate others opposing to guiding others' actions.
# '''Competitive''' – This cultural norm is based on the idea of a need to protect one's status. Those who use this style protect their own status by comparing themselves to other individuals and outperforming them.  Those who use this style are seekers of appraisal and recognition from others.
# '''[[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionistic]]''' – This cultural norm is based on the need to attain flawless results. Those who often use this style equate their self-worth with the attainment of extremely high standards. Those who often use this style are always focused on details and place excessive demands on themselves and others.

Organizations with aggressive/defensive cultures encourage or require members to appear competent, controlled, and superior. Members who seek assistance, admit shortcomings, or concede their position are viewed as incompetent or weak. These organizations emphasize finding errors, weeding out "mistakes" and encouraging members to compete against each other rather than competitors. The short-term gains associated with these strategies are often at the expense of long-term growth.&lt;ref name="Aggressive/Defensive Styles"/&gt;

=== Adam Grant ===

[[Adam Grant]], author of the book ''Give and Take'', distinguishes organizational cultures into ''giver'', ''taker'' and ''matcher'' cultures according to their [[norm of reciprocity|norms of reciprocity]]. In a giver culture, employees operate by "helping others, sharing knowledge, offering mentoring, and making connections without expecting anything in return", whereas in a taker culture "the norm is to get as much as possible from others while contributing less in return" and winners are those who take the most and are able to build their power at the expense of others. The majority of organizations are mid-way, with a ''matcher culture'', in which the norm is to match giving with taking, and favours are mostly traded in closed loops.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Grant|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/givers_take_all_the_hidden_dimension_of_corporate_culture|title=Givers take all: The hidden dimension of corporate culture|publisher=McKinsey|date=April 2013|accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Harvard researchers on units of the US intelligence system, a giver culture turned out to be the strongest predictor of group effectiveness.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"/&gt;

As Grant points out, [[Robert H. Frank]] argues that "many organizations are essentially [[winner-take-all market]]s, dominated by zero-sum competitions for rewards and promotions". In particular, when leaders implement [[forced ranking]] systems to reward individual performance, the organisational culture tends to change, with a giver culture giving way to a taker or matcher culture. Also awarding the highest-performing individual within each team encourages a taker culture.&lt;ref name="grant-2013"/&gt;

=== Stephen McGuire ===

Stephen McGuire (2003) defined and validated a model of organizational culture that predicts revenue from new sources.  An Entrepreneurial Organizational Culture (EOC) is a system of shared values, beliefs and norms of members of an organization, including valuing creativity and tolerance of creative people, believing that innovating and seizing market opportunities are appropriate behaviors to deal with problems of survival and prosperity, environmental uncertainty, and competitors' threats, and expecting organizational members to behave accordingly.

===Eric Flamholtz===
Eric Flamholtz (2001; 2011) has identified and validated a model of organizational culture components that drive financial results (Flamholtz and Randle, 2011). The model consist of five identified dimensions of  corporate culture: 1) treatment of customers, 2) treatment of people, 3) performance standards and accountability, 4) innovation and change, and 5) process orientation. These five dimensions have been confirmed by factor analysis (Flamholtz and Narasimhan-Kannan, 2005) in addition, Flamholtz has published empirical research that show the impact of organizational culture on financial performance (Flamholtz, 2001). Flamholtz has also proposed  that organizational (corporate) culture is not just an asset in the economic sense; but is also an "asset" in the conventional accounting sense (Flamholtz 2005). Flamholtz and Randle have also examined the evolution of organizational culture at different stages of organizational growth (Flamholtz and 
Randle, 2014).

== Ethical frameworks and evaluations of corporate culture ==
Four organizational cultures can be classified as apathetic, caring, exacting, and integrative.

* An apathetic culture shows minimal concern for either people or performance. &amp;nbsp;
* A caring culture exhibits high concern for people but minimal concern for performance issues.
* An exacting culture shows little concern for people but a high concern for performance.
* An integrative culture combines a high concern for people and performance.

A cultural audit is an assessment of an organization's values. &lt;!--TO BE EDITED 2/11/17--&gt;

In [[sociology]], '''postmaterialism''' is the transformation of individual values from materialist, physical, and economic to new individual values of autonomy and self-expression.

The term was popularized by the political scientist [[Ronald Inglehart]] in his 1977 book ''The Silent Revolution'', in which he discovered that the formative affluence experienced by the post-war generations was leading some of them to take their material security for granted and instead place greater importance on non-material goals such as self-expression, autonomy, freedom of speech, gender equality and environmentalism. Inglehart argued that with increasing prosperity, such postmaterial values would gradually increase in the publics of advanced industrial societies through the process of intergenerational replacement.

Postmaterialism is a tool in developing an understanding of modern culture. It can be considered in reference of three distinct concepts of [[materialism]]. The first kind of materialism, and the one in reference to which the word postmaterialism is used most often, refers to [[economic materialism|materialism]] as a value-system relating to the desire for fulfillment of material needs (such as security, sustenance and shelter) and an emphasis on material luxuries in a [[consumerism|consumerist]] society. A second referent is the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]] held by many [[socialists]], most notably [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], as well as their philosophic concept of [[dialectical materialism]]. The third definition of materialism concerns the philosophical argument that matter is the only existing reality. The first concept is sociological, the second is both philosophical and sociological, and the third is philosophical.

Depending on which of the three above notions of materialism are being discussed, postmaterialism can be an [[ontology|ontological]] postmaterialism, an existentialistic postmaterialism, an ethical postmaterialism, or a political-sociological postmaterialism, which is also the best known.

==History==
The sociological theory of postmaterialism was developed in the 1970s by [[Ronald Inglehart]]. After extensive survey research, Inglehart postulated that the Western societies under the scope of his survey were undergoing transformation of individual values, switching from materialist values, emphasizing economic and physical security, to a new set of postmaterialist values, which instead emphasized [[autonomy]] and [[Self-expression Values|self-expression]].{{sfn|Inglehart|2008}} Inglehart argued that rising prosperity was gradually liberating the publics of advanced industrial societies from the stress of basic acquisitive or materialistic needs.

Observing that the younger people were much more likely to embrace postmaterialist values, Inglehart speculated that this [[silent revolution]] was not merely a case of a life-cycle change, with people becoming more materialist as they aged, but a genuine example of [[generational replacement]] causing intergenerational value change.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971}}

The theory of intergenerational change is based on two key hypotheses:
* The scarcity hypothesis
* The socialization hypothesis

===The scarcity hypothesis===

Inglehart assumed that individuals pursue various goals in something akin to a hierarchical order. While people may universally aspire to freedom and autonomy, the most pressing material needs like hunger, thirst and physical security have to be satisfied first, since they are immediately linked with survival. According to Inglehart's interpretation of [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of human goals]], while [[scarcity]] prevails, these ''materialistic'' goals will have priority over postmaterialist goals like belonging, esteem, and aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. However, once the satisfaction of the survival needs can be taken for granted, the focus will gradually shift to these "non-material" goods.{{sfn|Inglehart|1977}}

===The socialization hypothesis===

The relationship between material conditions and value priorities is not one of immediate adjustment. A large body of evidence indicates that people's basic values are largely fixed when they reach adulthood, and change relatively little thereafter.{{sfn|Rokeach|1968}} Therefore, [[cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] which often experienced economic scarcity would ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' (all things being equal) place a high value on meeting economic needs (such as valuing economic growth above protecting the environment) and on safety needs (will support more authoritarian styles of leadership, will exhibit strong feelings of national pride, will be strongly in favour of maintaining a large, strong army and will be more willing to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]). On the other hand, cohorts who have experienced sustained high material affluence start to give high priority to values such as [[individual]] improvement, personal [[freedom (political)|freedom]], [[citizen]] input in government decisions, the ideal of a society based on [[humanism]], and maintaining a clean and healthy [[environmentalism|environment]].

Together, these two hypotheses carry the implication that, given long periods of material affluence, a growing part of society will embrace postmaterialist value systems, an implication which has been indeed borne out internationally in the past 30 years of survey data. The postmaterial orientations acquired by each cohort during [[socialization]] have been observed to remain remarkably steady over the time-frame of multiple decades, being a more stable [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]-system in contrast to the more volatile political and [[social attitude]]s.

===Measuring postmaterialism===
There are several ways of empirically measuring the spread of postmaterialism in a society. A common and relatively simple way is by creating an index from survey respondents' patterns of responses to a series of items which were designed to measure personal political priorities.

{{quote|"If you had to choose among the following things, which are the ''two'' that seem the most desirable to you?
* Maintaining order in the nation.
* Giving people more say in important political decisions.
* Fighting rising prices.
* Protecting [[freedom of speech]]."

... On the basis of the choices made among these four items, it is possible to classify our respondents into value priority groups, ranging from a "pure" acquisitive type to a "pure" post-[[bourgeois]] type, with several intermediate categories.{{sfn|Inglehart|1971|pp=994–995}}}}

The theoretical assumptions and the empirical research connected with the concept of postmaterialism have received considerable attention and critical discussion in the human sciences. Amongst others, the [[validity (statistics)|validity]], the stability, and the causation of postmaterialism has been doubted.

The so-called "Inglehart-index" has been included in several [[statistical survey|surveys]] (e.g., [[General Social Survey]], [[World Values Survey]], [[Eurobarometer]], [[ALLBUS]], [[Turning Points of the Life-Course]]). The [[time series]] in ALLBUS ([[German General Social Survey]]) is particularly comprehensive. From 1980 to 1990 the share of "pure post-materialists" increased from 13 to 31 per cent in West Germany. After the economic and social stress caused by [[German reunification]] in 1990 it dropped to 23 per cent in 1992 and stayed on that level afterwards.{{sfnm |1a1=Terwey |1y=2000 |1p=155 |2a1=ZA |2a2=ZUMA |2y=2005}} The ALLBUS [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] from the less affluent population in East Germany show much lower portions of postmaterialists (1991: 15 per cent, 1992: 10 per cent, 1998: 12 per cent). International [[data]] from the 2000 [[World Values Survey]] show the highest percentage of postmaterialists in [[Australia]] (35 per cent) followed by [[Austria]] (30 per cent), [[Canada]] (29 per cent), [[Italy]] (28 per cent), [[Argentina]] (25 per cent), [[United States]] (25 per cent), [[Sweden]] (22 per cent), [[Netherlands]] (22 per cent), [[Puerto Rico]] (22 per cent) etc.{{sfn|Inglehart|Basáñez|Díez-Medrano|Halmann|2004|p=384}} In spite of some questions raised by these and other data, measurements of postmaterialism have ''prima facie'' proven to be statistically important variables in many analyses.{{sfn|Kislev|2017}}

As increasing postmaterialism is based on the abundance of material possessions or resources, it should not be mixed indiscriminately with [[asceticism]] or general denial of consumption. In some way postmaterialism may be described as super-materialism. German data show that there is a tendency towards this orientation among young people, in the economically rather secure public service, and in the managerial middle class.{{sfn|Pappi|Terwey|1982}}

Recently, the issue of a "second generation of postmaterialism" appearing on the scene of worldwide civil society, to a large extent conceived as their "positive ideological embodiment", has been brought up by cultural scientist Roland Benedikter in his seven-volume book series ''Postmaterialismus'' (2001–2005).

'''Menpehtyre Ramesses I''' (or '''Ramses''') was the founding [[pharaoh]] of [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]]. The dates for his short reign are not completely known but the time-line of late [[1290s BC|1292–1290 BC]] is frequently cited&lt;ref name="beckerath"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932193922|title=Chronologie des pharaonischen Ägypten : die Zeitbestimmung der ägyptischen Geschichte von der Vorzeit bis 332 v.

[https://books.google.be/books?id=nfiFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165 165].&lt;/ref&gt; While Ramesses I was the founder of the 19th dynasty, in reality his brief reign marked the transition between the reign of [[Horemheb]] who had stabilized Egypt in the late 18th dynasty and the rule of the powerful pharaohs of this dynasty, in particular his son [[Seti I]] and grandson [[Ramesses II]], who would bring Egypt up to new heights of imperial power.

==Origins==

[[File:Ramses I.jpg|thumb|left|Pharaoh Ramses I making an offering before Osiris, [[Allard Pierson Museum]].]]
Originally called Pa-ra-mes-su, Ramesses I was of non-royal birth, being born into a noble military family from the [[Nile delta]] region, perhaps near the former [[Hyksos]] capital of [[Avaris]]. He was a son of a troop commander called [[Seti (commander)|Seti]]. His uncle Khaemwaset, an army officer, married Tamwadjesy, the matron of the Harem of [[Amun]], who was a relative of Huy, the viceroy of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], an important state post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cruz-Uribe|first=Eugene|date=1978|title=The Father of Ramses I: OI 11456|jstor=544684|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=37|issue=3|pages=237–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the high status of Ramesses' family. Ramesses I found favor with [[Horemheb]], the last pharaoh of the tumultuous [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]], who appointed the former as his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|Vizier]]. Ramesses also served as the [[Priest|High Priest]] of [[Set (deity)|Set]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Montert, ''Everyday Life in Egypt in the Days of Ramesses The Great'', 1974, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=-Hk58E8jVPkC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197 197].&lt;/ref&gt;  &amp;ndash; as such, he would have played an important role in the restoration of the old religion following the [[Amarna]] [[heresy]] of a generation earlier, under [[Akhenaten]].

Horemheb himself had been a nobleman from outside the immediate royal family, who rose through the ranks of the Egyptian army to serve as the royal advisor to Tutankhamun and Ay and, ultimately, Pharaoh. Since Horemheb was childless, he ultimately chose Ramesses to be his heir in the final years of his reign presumably because Ramesses I was both an able administrator and had a son (Seti I) and a grandson (the future [[Ramesses II]]) to succeed him and thus avoid any succession difficulties.

Upon his accession, Ramesses assumed a ''prenomen'', or royal name. When transliterated, the name is ''mn-pḥty-rʿ'', which is usually interpreted as Menpehtyre, meaning "Established by the strength of [[Ra]]". However, he is better known by his ''nomen'', or personal name. This is transliterated as ''rʿ-ms-sw'', and is usually realised as Ramessu or Ramesses, meaning 'Ra bore him'. Already an old man when he was crowned, Ramesses appointed his son, the later pharaoh [[Seti I]], to serve as the Crown Prince and chosen successor. Seti was charged with undertaking several military operations during this time&amp;ndash;in particular, an attempt to recoup some of Egypt's lost possessions in [[Syria]]. Ramesses appears to have taken charge of domestic matters: most memorably, he completed the second [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]] at [[Karnak|Karnak Temple]], begun under Horemheb.

==Death==

[[File:Ramses I Mummy.jpg|thumb|Mummy of Ramesses I]]
Ramesses I enjoyed a very brief reign, as evidenced by the general paucity of contemporary monuments mentioning him: the king had little time to build any major buildings in his reign and was hurriedly buried in a small and hastily finished tomb.&lt;ref name="tyldesley"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932221233|title=Ramesses: Egypt's greatest pharaoh|last=Tyldesley|first=Joyce|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780140280975|oclc=932221233|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] assigns him a reign of 16 months, but this pharaoh certainly ruled Egypt for a minimum of 17 months based on his highest known date which is a Year 2 II Peret day 20 (Louvre C57) stela which ordered the provision of new endowments of food and priests for the [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of [[Ptah]] within the Egyptian fortress of Buhen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/247341737|title=The monuments of Seti I: epigraphic, historical and art historical analysis|last=Brand|first=Peter J|date=2000|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117709|location=Leiden; Boston; Köln|language=English|pages=289, 300 and 311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jürgen von Beckerath observes that Ramesses I died just 5 months later—in June 1290 BC—since his son Seti I succeeded to power on III Shemu day 24.&lt;ref name="beckerath" /&gt; Ramesses I's only known action was to order the provision of endowments for the aforementioned Nubian temple at Buhen and "the construction of a chapel and a temple (which was to be finished by his son) at Abydos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872585819|title=A history of ancient Egypt|last=Grimal|first=Nicolas-Christophe|date=1992|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631174729|location=Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Massachusetts|language=English|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aged Ramesses was buried in the Valley of the Kings. His tomb, discovered by [[Giovanni Belzoni]] in 1817 and designated [[KV16]], is small in size and gives the impression of having been completed with haste. [[Joyce Tyldesley]] states that Ramesses I's tomb consisted of a single corridor and one unfinished room whose
{{blockquote|walls, after a hurried coat of plaster, were painted to show the king with his gods, with Osiris allowed a prominent position. The red granite sarcophagus too was painted rather than carved with inscriptions which, due to their hasty preparation, included a number of unfortunate errors."&lt;ref name="tyldesley" /&gt;}}

[[Seti I]], his son and successor, later built a small chapel with fine reliefs in memory of his deceased father Ramesses I at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. In 1911, [[John Pierpont Morgan]] donated several exquisite reliefs from this chapel to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranke|first=Hermann|date=1939|title=Review of The Temple of Ramesses I at Abydos|jstor=594071|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=59|issue=2|pages=272–274|doi=10.2307/594071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery and repatriation==
[[File:Fragment of a stela showing Amun enthroned. Mut, wearing the double crown, stands behind him. Both are being offered by Ramesses I, now lost. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Fragment of a stela showing Amun enthroned. Mut, wearing the double crown, stands behind him.

A mummy currently believed to be that of Ramesses I was stolen from Egypt and displayed in a private Canadian museum for many years before being repatriated.  The mummy's identity cannot be conclusively determined, but is most likely to be that of Ramesses I based on CT scans, X-rays, skull measurements and radio-carbon dating tests by researchers at Emory University, as well as aesthetic interpretations of family resemblance. Moreover, the mummy's arms were found crossed high across his chest which was a position reserved solely for Egyptian royalty until 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0430_030430_royalmummy.html|title=U.S. Museum to Return Ramses I Mummy to Egypt|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|date=April 30, 2003| access-date=2008-04-13|quote=A 3,000-year-old mummy that many scholars believe is ancient Egypt's King Ramses I is the star attraction of an exhibit at the Michael C. Carlos Museum in [[Atlanta]] that will run from April 26 to September 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mummy had been stolen by the Abu-Rassul family of grave robbers and brought to North America around 1860 by Dr. [[James Douglas (businessman)|James Douglas]]. It was then placed in the [[The Niagara Falls Museum|Niagara Museum and Daredevil Hall of Fame]] in Niagara Falls [[Ontario]], Canada. The mummy remained there, its identity unknown, next to other curiosities and so-called freaks of nature for more than 130 years. When the owner of the museum decided to sell his property, Canadian businessman William Jamieson purchased the contents of the museum and, with the help of Canadian Egyptologist Gayle Gibson, identified their great value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2015/04/20/canadas-favourite-mummy-hunter-returns|title=Canada's favourite mummy hunter returns|website=Niagara Falls Review|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204121542/http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2015/04/20/canadas-favourite-mummy-hunter-returns|archivedate=2017-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Jamieson sold the Egyptian artifacts in the collection, including the various mummies, to the [[Michael C. Carlos Museum]] at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] for US $2 million. The mummy was returned to Egypt on October 24, 2003 with full official honors and is on display at the Luxor Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3215747.stm|title=Egypt's 'Ramses' mummy returned|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=October 26, 2003|accessdate=2008-04-13|quote=An ancient Egyptian mummy thought to be that of Pharaoh Ramses I has returned home after more than 140 years in North American museums.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1956 motion picture ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], depicts Rameses I (portrayed by [[Ian Keith]]) as the pharaoh who orders the elimination of the first-born of every [[Hebrew]] slave family in Egypt, leading to the scenario of future prophet [[Moses]] being sheltered by [[Bithiah]], who in the film is said to be the daughter of Rameses I and sister of [[Seti I]].

In the 2000 animated musical film ''[[Joseph: King of Dreams]]'', by [[DreamWorks Animation]], Ramesses I is depicted as the pharaoh who has his dreams interpreted by [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and who appoints Joseph to the office of Vizier when his foresight and administrative skills prevent Egypt from being ruined by famine.

[[Image:Love in a Tub.png|thumb|Refinement meets burlesque in Restoration comedy. In this scene from [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'', musicians and well-bred ladies surround a man who is wearing a tub because he has lost his trousers.]]

"'''Restoration comedy'''" is English [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710. [[Comedy of manners]] is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy.&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur [https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the [[Puritan]] regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signalled a renaissance of [[English drama]].&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexually explicit language was encouraged by  [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] (1660–1685) personally and by the rakish style of his court. Historian [[George Norman Clark]] argues:

{{quote|The best-known fact about the Restoration drama is that it is immoral. The dramatists did not criticize the accepted morality about gambling, drink, love, and pleasure generally, or try, like the dramatists of our own time, to work out their own view of character and conduct. What they did was, according to their respective inclinations, to mock at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper....The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660-1714'' (1956) p 369.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling plots, by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. This period saw the first professional female playwright, [[Aphra Behn]].

==Theatre companies==

===Original patent companies, 1660–1682===
[[Image:Settle-Morocco.png|thumb|The sumptuously decorated Dorset Gardens playhouse in 1673, with one of the sets for [[Elkannah Settle]]'s ''The Empress of Morocco''. The [[thrust stage|apron stage]] at the front which allowed intimate audience contact is not visible in the picture (the artist is standing on it).]] Charles II was an active and interested patron of the drama. Soon after his restoration, in 1660, he granted exclusive play-staging rights, so-called [[letters patent|Royal patents]], to the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]], led by two middle-aged [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] playwrights, [[Thomas Killigrew]] and [[William Davenant]]. The patentees scrambled for performance rights to the previous generation's [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and Caroline plays, which were the first necessity for economic survival before any new plays existed. Their next priority was to build new, splendid [[patent theatre]]s in [[Drury Lane]] and [[Dorset Gardens]], respectively. Striving to outdo each other in magnificence, Killigrew and Davenant ended up with quite similar theatres, both designed by [[Christopher Wren]], both optimally provided for music and dancing, and both fitted with moveable scenery and elaborate machines for thunder, lightning, and waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatists of the Restoration renounced the tradition of satire, as recently embodied by [[Ben Jonson]], and devoted themselves to the [[comedy of manners]], which uncritically accepted the social code of the upper class.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p194"&gt;Hodgart (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGrCooK63TsC&amp;pg=PA194 pp.194, 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience of the early Restoration period was not exclusively [[noble court|courtly]], as has sometimes been supposed, but it was quite small and could barely support two companies. There was no untapped reserve of occasional playgoers. Ten consecutive performances constituted a smash hit. This closed system forced playwrights to be extremely responsive to popular taste. Fashions in the drama would change almost week by week rather than season by season, as each company responded to the offerings of the other, and new plays were urgently sought. The King's Company and the Duke's Company vied with one another for audience favour, for popular actors, and for new plays, and in this hectic climate the new [[genre]]s of [[heroic drama]], [[she-tragedy|pathetic drama]], and Restoration comedy were born and flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, 17, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Company, 1682–1695===
Both the quantity and quality of the drama suffered when in 1682 the more successful Duke's Company absorbed the struggling King's Company, and the amalgamated ''United Company'' was formed. The production of new plays dropped off sharply in the 1680s, affected by both the monopoly and the political situation (see [[Restoration comedy#Decline of comedy, 1678–90|Decline of comedy]] below). The influence and the incomes of the actors dropped, too.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 38–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 80s, predatory investors ("Adventurers") converged on the United Company, while management was taken over by the lawyer [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]]. Rich attempted to finance a tangle of "farmed" shares and sleeping partners by slashing salaries and, dangerously, by abolishing the traditional perks of senior performers, who were stars with the clout to fight back.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 51–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of the theatres, 1695–1700===
The company owners, wrote the young United Company employee [[Colley Cibber]], "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presum'd they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public were inclined to support."&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Performers like the legendary [[Thomas Betterton]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]], and the rising young comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]] had the audience on their side and, in the confidence of this, they walked out.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 68–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actors gained a Royal "licence to perform", thus bypassing Rich's ownership of both the original Duke's and King's Company patents from 1660, and formed their own cooperative company. This unique venture was set up with detailed rules for avoiding arbitrary managerial authority, regulating the ten actors' shares, the conditions of salaried employees, and the sickness and retirement benefits of both categories. The cooperative had the good luck to open in 1695 with the première of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s famous ''Love For Love'' and the skill to make it a huge box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

London again had two competing companies. Their dash to attract audiences briefly revitalised Restoration drama, but also set it on a fatal downhill slope to the lowest common denominator of public taste. Rich's company notoriously offered [[Bartholomew Fair]]-type attractions – high kickers, jugglers, ropedancers, performing animals – while the co-operating actors, even as they appealed to snobbery by setting themselves up as the only legitimate theatre company in London, were not above retaliating with "prologues recited by boys of five, and epilogues declaimed by ladies on horseback".&lt;ref&gt;Dobrée, xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
===First actresses===
[[File:Nell gwyn peter lely c 1675.jpg|thumb|[[Nell Gwynn]] was one of the first actresses and the mistress of Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy was strongly influenced by the introduction of the first professional actresses. Before [[London theatre closure 1642|the closing of the theatres]], all female roles had been taken by [[boy player]]s, and the predominantly male audiences of the 1660s and 1670s were curious, censorious, and delighted at the novelty of seeing real women engage in risqué repartee and take part in physical seduction scenes. [[Samuel Pepys]] refers many times in his famous diary to visiting the playhouse to watch or re-watch the performance of particular actresses, and to how much he enjoys these experiences.

Daringly suggestive comedy scenes involving women became especially common, although of course Restoration actresses were, just like male actors, expected to do justice to all kinds and moods of plays. (Their role in the development of Restoration tragedy is also important, compare [[She-tragedy]].)

A new speciality introduced almost as early as the actresses was the [[breeches role]], which called for an actress to appear in male clothes (breeches being tight-fitting knee-length pants, the standard male garment of the time), for instance to play a witty heroine who disguises herself as a boy to hide, or to engage in escapades disallowed to girls. A quarter of the plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700 contained breeches roles. Playing these [[cross-dressing]] roles, women behaved with the freedom society allowed to men, and some feminist critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, regard them as subversive of conventional [[gender roles]] and empowering for female members of the audience. Elizabeth Howe has objected that the male disguise, when studied in relation to playtexts, prologues, and epilogues, comes out as "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object" to male patrons, by showing off her body, normally hidden by a skirt, outlined by the male outfit.&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful Restoration actresses included Charles II's mistress [[Nell Gwyn]], the tragedienne [[Elizabeth Barry]] who was famous for her ability to "move the passions" and make whole audiences cry, the 1690s comedian [[Anne Bracegirdle]], and Susanna Mountfort (a.k.a. [[Susanna Verbruggen]]), who had many breeches roles written especially for her in the 1680s and 90s. Letters and memoirs of the period show that both men and women in the audience greatly relished Mountfort's swaggering, roistering impersonations of young women wearing breeches and thereby enjoying the social and sexual freedom of the male [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]].

===First celebrity actors===
[[Image:Thomas Betterton.gif|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Betterton]] played the irresistible Dorimant in [[George Etherege]]'s ''[[Man of Mode]].'' Betterton's acting ability was praised by [[Samuel Pepys]], [[Alexander Pope]], and [[Colley Cibber]].]]
During the Restoration period, both male and female actors on the London stage became for the first time public personalities and [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Documents of the period show audiences being attracted to performances by the talents of particular actors as much as by particular plays, and more than by authors (who seem to have been the least important draw, no performance being advertised by author until 1699). Although the playhouses were built for large audiences—the second Drury Lane theatre from 1674 held 2000 patrons – they were of compact design, and an actor's charisma could be intimately projected from the [[thrust stage]].

With two companies competing for their services from 1660 to 1682, star actors were able to negotiate star deals, comprising company shares and [[Benefit concert|benefit nights]] as well as salaries. This advantageous situation changed when the two companies were amalgamated in 1682, but the way the actors rebelled and took command of a new company in 1695 is in itself an illustration of how far their status and power had developed since 1660.

The greatest fixed stars among Restoration actors were Elizabeth Barry ("Famous Mrs Barry" who "forc 'd Tears from the Eyes of her Auditory") and [[Thomas Betterton]], both of them active in organising the actors' revolt in 1695 and both original patent-holders in the resulting actors' cooperative.

Betterton played every great male part there was from 1660 into the 18th century. After watching ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1661, Samuel Pepys reports in his diary that the young beginner Betterton "did the prince's part beyond imagination." Betterton's expressive performances seem to have attracted playgoers as magnetically as did the novelty of seeing women on the stage. He was soon established as the leading man of the Duke's Company, and played Dorimant, the seminal irresistible [[Rake (character)|Restoration rake]], at the première of [[George Etherege]]'s ''Man of Mode'' (1676). Betterton's position remained unassailable through the 1680s, both as the leading man of the United Company and as its stage manager and ''de facto'' day-to-day leader. He remained loyal to Rich longer than many of his co-workers, but eventually it was he who headed the actors' walkout in 1695, and who became the acting manager of the new company.

==Comedies==
Variety and dizzying fashion changes are typical of Restoration comedy. Even though the "Restoration drama" unit taught to college students is likely to be telescoped in a way that makes the plays all sound contemporary, scholars now have a strong sense of the rapid evolution of English drama over these forty years and of its social and political causes. The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged.

[[File:John Lacy by John Michael Wright 1668-70.png|thumb|upright|[[John Lacy (playwright)|John Lacy]] was the favourite comic of King Charles II.]]
Restoration comedy peaked twice. The genre came to spectacular maturity in the mid-1670s with an extravaganza of [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] comedies. Twenty lean years followed this short golden age, although the achievement of [[Aphra Behn]] in the 1680s is to be noted. In the mid-1690s a brief second Restoration comedy renaissance arose, aimed at a wider audience. The comedies of the golden 1670s and 1690s peak times are extremely different from each other. An attempt is made below to illustrate the generational taste shift by describing ''The Country Wife'' (1675) and ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697) in some detail. These two plays differ from each other in some typical ways, just as a Hollywood movie of the 1950s differs from one of the 1970s. The plays are not, however, offered as being "typical" of their decades. Indeed, there exist no typical comedies of the 1670s or the 1690s; even within these two short peak-times, comedy types kept mutating and multiplying.

===Aristocratic comedy, 1660–1680===
The drama of the 1660s and 1670s was vitalised by the competition between the two patent companies created at the Restoration, as well as by the personal interest of Charles II, and the comic playwrights rose to the demand for new plays. They stole freely from the contemporary French and Spanish stage, from English [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] plays, and even from [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Classics|classical]] comedies, and combined the looted plotlines in adventurous ways. Resulting differences of tone in a single play were appreciated rather than frowned on, as the audience prized "variety" within as well as between plays. Early Restoration audiences had little enthusiasm for structurally simple, well-shaped comedies such as those of [[Molière]]; they demanded bustling, crowded multi-plot action and fast pace. Even a splash of high heroic drama might be thrown in to enrich the comedy mix, as in [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'' (1664), which has one heroic verse "conflict between love and friendship" plot, one urbane wit comedy plot, and one burlesque pantsing plot. (''See illustration, top right''.) Such incongruities contributed to Restoration comedy being held in low esteem in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but today the early Restoration total theatre experience is again valued on the stage, as well as by [[postmodern]] academic critics.

The unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]] reflected the atmosphere at Court, and celebrated with frankness an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. The [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]], real-life Restoration rake, courtier and poet, is flatteringly portrayed in Etherege's ''[[The Man of Mode]]'' (1676) as a riotous, witty, intellectual, and sexually irresistible aristocrat, a template for posterity's idea of the glamorous Restoration rake (actually never a very common character in Restoration comedy). Wycherley's ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' (1676), a variation on the theme of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', was highly regarded for its uncompromising satire and earned Wycherley the appellation "Plain Dealer" Wycherley or "Manly" Wycherley, after the play's main character Manly. The single play that does most to support the charge of [[obscenity]] levelled then and now at Restoration comedy is probably Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'' (1675). [[Image:William Wycherley.png|thumb|[[William Wycherley]], ''[[The Country Wife]]'': "O Lord, I'll have some china too. Good Master Horner, don't think to give other people china, and me none. Come in with me too."]]

====Example. William Wycherley, ''The Country Wife'' (1675)====
''[[The Country Wife]]'' has three interlinked but distinct plots, which each project sharply different moods:

1. Horner's [[impotence]] trick provides the main plot and the play's organising principle. The upper-class town rake Horner mounts a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible, first spreading a false rumour of his own impotence, to be allowed where no complete man may go. The trick is a great success and Horner has sex with many married ladies of virtuous reputation, whose husbands are happy to leave him alone with them. In one famously outrageous scene, the "China scene", sexual intercourse is assumed to take place repeatedly just off stage, where Horner and his mistresses carry on a sustained [[double entendre]] [[dialogue]] purportedly about Horner's china collection. ''The Country Wife'' is driven by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth about Horner's sexual prowess (and thus the truth about the respectable ladies), from which he extricates himself by quick thinking and good luck. Horner never becomes a reformed character, but keeps his secret to the end and is assumed to go on merrily reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.

2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière's ''[[School for Wives]]''. Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married an ignorant young country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swathe through the sophistications of London marriage without even noticing them. She is enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors (such self-referential stage jokes were nourished by the new higher status of actors), and keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's [[pathological jealousy]] always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.

3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a comparatively uplifting love story in which the [[wit]]ty Harcourt wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea from the hands of the Upper-class town snob Sparkish, to whom she was engaged until discovering he loved her only for her money.

===Decline of comedy, 1678–1690===
When the two companies were amalgamated in 1682 and the London stage became a monopoly, both the number and the variety of new plays being written dropped sharply. There was a swing away from comedy to serious political drama, reflecting preoccupations and divisions following on the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]] (1682). The few comedies produced also tended to be political in focus, the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dramatist [[Thomas Shadwell]] sparring with the [[Tory|Tories]] [[John Dryden]] and [[Aphra Behn]]. Behn's unique achievement as an early professional woman writer has been the subject of much recent study.

===Comedy renaissance, 1690–1700===
During the second wave of Restoration comedy in the 1690s, the "softer" comedies of [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh]] reflected mutating cultural perceptions and great social change. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong middle-class element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations after the wedding bells. [[Thomas Southerne]]'s dark ''[[The Wives' Excuse]]'' (1691) is not yet very "soft": it shows a woman miserably married to the [[fop]] Friendall, everybody's friend, whose follies and indiscretions undermine her social worth, since her honour is bound up in his. Mrs Friendall is pursued by a would-be lover, a matter-of-fact rake devoid of all the qualities that made Etherege's Dorimant charming, and she is kept from action and choice by the unattractiveness of all her options. All the humour of this "comedy" is in the subsidiary love-chase and fornication plots, none in the main plot.

In Congreve's ''[[Love for Love]]'' (1695) and ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), the  "wit duels" between lovers typical of 1670s comedy are underplayed. The give-and-take set pieces of couples still testing their attraction for each other have mutated into witty prenuptial debates on the eve of marriage, as in the famous "Proviso" scene in ''The Way of the World'' (1700). Vanbrugh's ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) follows in the footsteps of Southerne's ''Wives' Excuse'', with a lighter touch and more humanly recognisable characters.

====Example. John Vanbrugh, ''The Provoked Wife'' (1697)====
[[Image:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Vanbrugh]], ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'': "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."]]
''The Provoked Wife'' is something of a Restoration [[problem play]] in its attention to the subordinate legal position of married women and the complexities of "divorce" and separation, issues that had been highlighted in the mid-1690s by some notorious cases before the [[House of Lords]] (see Stone).

Sir John Brute in ''The Provoked Wife'' is tired of matrimony. He comes home drunk every night and is continually rude and insulting to his wife. She is meanwhile being tempted to embark upon an affair with the witty and faithful Constant. Divorce is not an option for either of the Brutes at this time, but forms of legal separation have recently come into existence, and would entail a separate maintenance to the wife. Such an arrangement would not allow remarriage. Still, muses Lady Brute, in one of many discussions with her niece Bellinda, "These are good times. A woman may have a gallant and a separate maintenance too."

Bellinda is at the same time being grumpily courted by Constant's friend Heartfree, who is surprised and dismayed to find himself in love with her. The bad example of the Brutes is a constant warning to Heartfree to not marry.

''The Provoked Wife'' is a talk play, with the focus less on love scenes and more on discussions between female friends (Lady Brute and Bellinda) and male friends (Constant and Heartfree). These exchanges are full of jokes, but are also thoughtful and have a dimension of melancholy and frustration.

After a forged-letter complication, the play ends with marriage between Heartfree and Bellinda and stalemate between the Brutes. Constant continues to pay court to Lady Brute, and she continues to shilly-shally.

===End of comedy===
The tolerance for Restoration comedy even in its modified form was running out at the end of the 17th century, as public opinion turned to respectability and seriousness even faster than the playwrights did. Interconnected causes for this shift in taste were [[demographic]] change, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]]'s and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked Congreve and Vanbrugh in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place. At the much-anticipated all-star première in 1700 of ''The Way of the World'', Congreve's first comedy for five years, the audience showed only moderate enthusiasm for that subtle and almost melancholy work. The comedy of sex and wit was about to be replaced by the drama of obvious sentiment and exemplary morality.

==After Restoration comedy==
===Stage history===
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the sexual frankness of Restoration comedy ensured that theatre producers cannibalised it or adapted it with a heavy hand, rather than actually performed it. Today, Restoration comedy is again appreciated on the stage. The classics, Wycherley's ''The Country Wife'' and ''The Plain-Dealer'', Etherege's ''The Man of Mode'', and Congreve's ''Love For Love'' and ''The Way of the World''  have competition not only from Vanbrugh's ''The Relapse'' and ''The Provoked Wife'', but from such dark, unfunny comedies as [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''The Wives Excuse''. Aphra Behn, once considered unstageable, has had a major renaissance, with ''The Rover'' now a repertory favourite.

===Literary criticism===
Distaste for sexual impropriety long kept Restoration comedy not only off the stage but also locked in a critical poison cupboard. Victorian critics like [[William Hazlitt]], although valuing the linguistic energy and "strength" of the [[wiktionary:canon|canonical]] writers Etherege, Wycherley, and Congreve, always found it necessary to temper aesthetic praise with heavy moral condemnation. Aphra Behn received the condemnation without the praise, since outspoken sex comedy was considered particularly offensive coming from a woman author. At the turn of the 20th century, an embattled minority of academic Restoration comedy enthusiasts began to appear, for example the important editor [[Montague Summers]], whose work ensured that the plays of Aphra Behn remained in print.

"Critics remain astonishingly defensive about the masterpieces of this period", wrote Robert D. Hume as late as 1976. It is only over the last few decades that that statement has become untrue, as Restoration comedy has been acknowledged a rewarding subject for high theory analysis and Wycherley's ''[[The Country Wife]]'', long branded the most obscene play in the English language, has become something of an academic favourite. "Minor" comic writers are getting a fair share of attention, especially the post-Aphra Behn generation of women playwrights which appeared just around the turn of the 18th century: [[Delarivier Manley]], [[Mary Pix]], [[Catharine Trotter]], and [[Susannah Centlivre]]. A broad study of the majority of never-reprinted Restoration comedies has been made possible by Internet access (by subscription only) to the first editions at the [[British Library]].

'''Role-taking theory''', or social perspective taking, is the [[Sociology|sociological]] theory that one of the most important factors in facilitating [[social cognition]] in children is the growing ability to understand others’ feelings and perspectives, an ability that emerges as a result of general cognitive growth.&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=D.R.|title=Social and personality development|year=2008|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|location=Belmont, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this process requires that children come to realize that others’ views may differ from their own.&lt;ref name=J1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D.W.|title=Cooperativeness and social perspective taking|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1975|volume=31|pages=241–244|doi=10.1037/h0076285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Role-taking ability involves understanding the [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] (i.e. relating to moods, emotions, and attitudes) aspects of another person's point of view and differs from [[Perspective-taking|perceptual perspective taking]], which is the ability to recognize another person's visual point of view of the environment.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  Furthermore, albeit some mixed evidence on the issue, role taking and perceptual perspective taking seem to be functionally and developmentally independent of each other.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;

[[Robert L. Selman|Robert Selman]] is noted for emphasizing the importance of this theory within the field of cognitive development.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  He argues that a matured role taking ability allows us to better appreciate how our actions will affect others,&lt;ref name=[3]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|title=The relation of role taking to the development of moral judgment in children|journal=Child Development|year=1971b|volume=42|pages=79–91|doi=10.2307/1127066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and if we fail to develop the ability to role take, we will be forced to erroneously judge that others are behaving solely as a result of external factors.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  One of Selman's principal additions to the theory has been an empirically supported developmental theory of role taking ability.

Social cognitive research on children's thoughts about others’ perspectives, feelings, and behaviors has emerged as one of the largest areas of research in the field.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; Role taking theory can provide a theoretical foundation upon which this research can rest and be guided by and has relations and applications to numerous other theories and topics.

==Selman's theory of role-taking development==
[[Robert L. Selman|Selman]] developed his developmental theory of role taking ability based on four sources.&lt;ref name=[4]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|author2=Byrne, D.F. |title=A structural-developmental analysis of levels of role taking in middle childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1974|volume=45|pages=803–806|doi=10.2307/1127850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first is the work of Feffer &lt;ref name=[5]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|title=The cognitive implication of role-taking behavior|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1959|volume=27|pages=152–168|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1959.tb01826.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[6]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|title=Developmental analysis of inter-personal behavior|journal=Psychological Review|year=1971|volume=77|pages=197–214|doi=10.1037/h0029171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Feffer and Gourevitch,&lt;ref name=[7]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|author2=Gourevitch, V. |title=Cognitive aspects of role-taking in children|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1960|volume=28|pages=383–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1960.tb01627.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which related role taking ability to Piaget's theory of social decentering and developed a projective test to assess children's ability to decenter as they mature.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The second is the research of Flavell, which studied children's growing abilities to judge other people's conceptual and perceptual perspectives.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The third is the developmental ideas of differentiation, whereupon one learns to distinguish his/her perspective from the perspectives of others, and integration, the ability to relate one's perspective to the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The final source of influence comes from Selman's own previous research where he assessed children's ability to describe the different perspectives of characters in a story.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

One example of Selman's stories is that of Holly and her father.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Children are told about Holly, an avid 8-year-old tree climber. One day, Holly falls off a tree, but does not hurt herself. Holly's father sees this and makes Holly promise that she will stop climbing trees, and Holly promises. Later, however, Holly and her friends meet Shawn, a boy whose kitten is stuck in a tree. Holly is the only one amongst her friends who can climb trees well enough to save Shawn's kitten, who may fall at any moment, but she remembers the promise she made with her father. Selman then goes on to ask children about the perspectives of Holly and her father, and each stage is associated with typical responses.

===Stages===
'''Level 0: Egocentric Role Taking''' (ages 3–6, roughly)&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

This stage is characterized by two lacking abilities.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The first is the failure to distinguish perspectives (differentiation).&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  More specifically, the child is unable to distinguish between his perspective, including his perspective on why a social action occurred, and that of others. [1] The second ability the child lacks is relating perspectives (integration).&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, children tend to respond that Holly will save the kitten and that the father will not mind Holly's disobedience because he will be happy and he likes kittens. In actuality, the child is displaying his/her inability to separate his/her liking for kittens from the perspectives of Holly and her father.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 1: Subjective role taking''' (ages 6–8, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

Children now recognize that they and others in a situation may have different information available to them, and thus may differ in their views.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In other words, children have matured in differentiation.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The child still significantly lacks integration ability, however: he/she cannot understand that his views are influenced by the views of others, and vice versa, ad infinitum.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In addition, the child believes that the sole reason for differing social perspectives is because of different information, and nothing else.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, when asked if the father would be angry if he found out that Holly climbed the tree again, children might respond, “If he didn’t know why she climbed the tree, he would be angry. But if he knew why she did it, he would realize that she had a good reason,” not recognizing that the father may still be angry, regardless of her wanting to save the kitten, because of his own values, such as his concern for his daughter's safety.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 2: Self-reflective role taking''' (ages 8–10, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

The child's differentiation ability matures at this age enough so that he/she understands that people can also differ in their social perspectives because of their particularly held and differing values and set of purposes.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In turn, the child is able to better put him/herself in the position of another person.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In terms of integration, the child can now understand that others think about his/her point of view too.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  This allows the child to predict how the other person might react to the child's behaviour.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  What is still lacking, however, is for the child to be able to consider another person's point of view and another person's point of view of the child simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, when children are asked if Holly will climb the tree, they will typically respond, “Yes. She knows that her father will understand why she did it.” This indicates the child is considering the father's perspective in light of Holly's perspective; however, when asked if the father would want Holly to climb the tree, children typically respond that he would not. This shows that the child is solely considering the father's point of view and his worry for Holly's safety.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 3: Mutual role taking''' (ages 10–12, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In this stage, the child can now differentiate his/her own perspective from the viewpoint likely for the average member of the group.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In addition, the child can take the view of a detached third-person and view a situation from that perspective.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In terms of integration, the child can now simultaneously consider his/her view of others and others’ view of the child, and the consequences of this feedback loop of perspectives in terms of behaviour and cognition.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In describing the result of the Holly dilemma, the child may take the perceptive of a detached third party, responding that “Holly wanted to get the kitten because she likes kittens, but she knew that she wasn’t supposed to climb trees. Holly’s father knew that Holly had been told not to climb trees, but he couldn’t have known about [the kitten].” &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 4: Societal role taking''' (ages 12–15+, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

The adolescent now considers others’ perspectives with reference to the social environment and culture the other person comes from, assuming that the other person will believe and act in accord to their society's norms and values.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

When asked if Holly deserves to be punished for her transgression, adolescents typically respond that Holly should not as her father should understand that we need to humanely treat animals.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

==Evidence for Selman's Stages==
Three studies have been conducted to assess Selman's theory, and all three have shown support for his developmental outline of role taking ability progression. Selman conducted the first study of his own theory using 60 middle-class children from ages 4 to 6.&lt;ref name=[8]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|title=Taking another's perspective: Role-taking development in early childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1971a|volume=42|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1971.tb03765.x|pages=1721–1734}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this experiment, the children were asked to predict and explain their predictions about another child's behaviour in a certain situation. The child participants were given situational information not available to the child they were making behavioural and cognitive predictions about. Results implied a stage progression of role taking ability as a function of age, as theorized by Selman.&lt;ref name=[8] /&gt;

In a second assessment of the theory, Selman and Byrne interviewed 40 children, ages 4, 6, 8, and 10, on two socio-moral dilemmas.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  Children were required to discuss the perspectives of different characters in each dilemma, and results again showed that role taking ability progressed through stages as a function of age.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

The third study assessing Selman's theory was a 5-year longitudinal study of 41 male children on their role taking ability.&lt;ref name=[9]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurucharri|first=C.|author2=Selman, R.L. |title=The development of interpersonal understanding during childhood, preadolescence, and adolescence: A longitudinal follow-up study|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=924–927|doi=10.2307/1129129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results showed that 40 of the 41 children interviewed followed the stages as outlined by Selman and none skipped over a stage.&lt;ref name=[9] /&gt;

==Relation to other topics==

===[[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]]===
[[Jean Piaget]] stressed the importance of play in children, especially play that involves role taking.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  He believed that role taking play in children&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; promotes a more mature social understanding by teaching children to take on the roles of others, allowing them to understand that different people can have differing perspectives.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In addition, Piaget argued that good solutions to interpersonal conflicts involve compromise which arises out of our ability to consider the points of view of others.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;
Two of Piaget's fundamental concepts have primarily influenced role taking theory. The first is [[egocentrism]], the mode of thinking that characterizes preoperational thinking, which is the child's failure to consider the world from other points of view.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The second is decentration, the mode of thinking that characterizes operational thinking, which is the child's growing ability to perceive the world with more than one perspective in mind.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In Piagetian theory, these concepts were used to describe solely cognitive development, but they have been applied in role taking theory to the social domain.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

====Evidence for a relation between Piaget's theory and role-taking ability====

Evidence that Piaget's cognitive theories can be applied to the interpersonal aspects of role taking theory comes from two sources. The first is empirical evidence that children's ability to role take is correlated to their IQ and performance on Piagetian tests.&lt;ref name=[10]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pellegrini|first=D.S.|title=Social cognition and competence in middle childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1985|volume=56|pages=253–264|doi=10.2307/1130192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, the two theories have been conceptually linked in that Selman's role taking stages correspond to Piaget's cognitive development stages, where preoperational children are at level 1 or 2, concrete operators are at level 3 or 4, and formal operators are at level 4 or 5 of Selman's stages.&lt;ref name=[11]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keating|first=D.|author2=Clark, L.V. |title=Development of physical and social reasoning in adolescence|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1980|volume=16|pages=23–30|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.16.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given this relation, Feffer &lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt; and Feffer and Gourevitch &lt;ref name=[7] /&gt;  have argued that social role taking is an extension of decentering in the social sphere. Selman has argued this same point, also noting that the growth of role taking ability is brought on by the child's decreased egocentrism as he/she ages.&lt;ref name=[8] /&gt;

===[[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]===
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] argued that higher moral development requires role taking ability.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;  For instance, Kohlberg's conventional level of morality (between ages 9 and 13, roughly), involves moral stereotyping, empathy-based morality, alertness to and behaviour guided by predicted evaluations by others, and identifying with authority, all of which require role taking.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;

====Evidence for a relation between Kohlberg's stages of moral development and role-taking ability====

Selman tested 60 children, ages 8 to 10, on Kohlberg's moral-judgment measure and two role taking tasks.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;  He found that the development of role taking, within this age range, related to the progression into Kohlberg's conventional moral stage. A retest a year later confirmed Kohlberg's argument, and in general, it was shown that higher moral development at the conventional stage requires children's achieved ability at this age to reciprocally deal with their own and others’ perspectives.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;
Mason and Gibbs found that moral judgment development, as measured by Kohlberg's theory, consistently related to role taking opportunities experienced after childhood in adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name=[12] /&gt;  This finding supported Kohlberg's view that moral progress beyond his third stage necessitates contact with other perspectives, namely those of entire cultures or political groups, which individuals are likely to encounter as they become adolescents and adults and thus meet many different people in school and the workplace.&lt;ref name=[12]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=M.G.|author2=Gibbs, J.C. |title=Social perspective taking and moral judgment among college students|journal=Journal of Adolescent Research|year=1993|volume=8|pages=109–123|doi=10.1177/074355489381008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation between Kohlberg’s stages, Piaget’s theory, and Selman’s theory===
Kohlberg and Piaget both emphasized that role taking ability facilitates moral development.&lt;ref name=[12] /&gt;  Kohlberg argued that cognitive and role taking development are required but not sufficient for moral development.&lt;ref name=[13]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=L.J.|title=Cognitive and Perspective-taking Prerequisites for Moral development|journal=Child Development|year=1980|volume=51|pages=131–139|doi=10.2307/1129599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, he maintained that Piaget's cognitive developmental stages underlie Selman's role taking stages, which are subsequently fundamental to his own moral developmental stages.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; This predicts that cognition develops first, followed by the corresponding role taking stage, and finally the corresponding moral stage, and never the other way around.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

Conceptually, the three processes have been tied together by Walker.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; His reasoning is that cognitive development involves the progressive understanding of the environment as it is. Role taking is a step upon this, which is the recognition that people each have their own subjective interpretation of the environment, including how they think about and behave towards other people. Moral development, the final step, is the grasping of how people should think and behave towards one another.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

Evidence in support of this view comes first from three reviews which showed moderate correlations between Selman's role taking theory, Piaget's cognitive developmental stages, and Kohlberg's moral developmental stages.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; More evidence comes from Walker and Richards's finding that moral development to Kohlberg's stage 4 occurred only for those who already had early basic formal operations according to Piaget's developmental theory, and not for those in an earlier stage.&lt;ref name=[14]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=L.J.|author2=Richards, B.S. |title=Stimulating transitions in moral reasoning as a function of stage of cognitive development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1979|volume=15|pages=95–103|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.2.95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Paolitto's attempts to stimulate moral development worked only for subjects who already attained the corresponding role taking stage.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Previous research has also shown that short role taking treatments, such as exposing subjects to the role taking reasoning of subjects in one stage higher, can lead to moral development.&lt;ref name=[14] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[15]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keasey|first=C.B.|title=Experimentally induced changes in moral opinions and reasoning|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=26|pages=30–38|doi=10.1037/h0034210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[16]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tracy|first=J.J.|author2=Cross, H.J. |title=Antecedents of shift in moral judgment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=26|pages=238–244|doi=10.1037/h0034432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more general demonstrations of this argument, Faust and Arbuthnot and other researchers have shown that moral development is most probable for subjects with higher cognitive development.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[17]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faust|first=D.|author2=Arbuthnot, J. |title=Relationship between moral and Piagetian reasoning and the effectiveness of moral education|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1978|volume=14|pages=435–436|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.4.435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a direct investigation of Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument, Walker tested the hypothesis that only children who had attained both beginning formal operations and role taking stage 3 could progress to Kohlberg's moral stage 3.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; 146 grade 4-7 children participated in this study, and the results strongly supported the hypothesis, given that only children who had the beginning formal substage of cognitive development and role taking stage 3 progressed to moral stage 3.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Further support came from the study's demonstration that a short role playing treatment stimulated progress in moral reasoning in a 6-week follow-up retest.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Krebs and Gilmore also directly tested Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument of moral development in 51 children, ages 5–14, for the first three stages of cognitive, role taking, and moral development.&lt;ref name=[18]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=D.|author2=Gillmore, J. |title=The relationship among the first stages of cognitive development, role-taking abilities, and moral development|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=877–886|doi=10.2307/1129124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results generally supported Kohlberg's view, but not as strongly, given that it was only demonstrated that cognitive development is a prerequisite for role taking development, and not for moral development.&lt;ref name=[18] /&gt; Based on these results, researchers have suggested that moral education programs underlain by Kohlberg's theory must first ensure that the prerequisite cognitive and role taking abilities have developed.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

===[[Prosocial behavior]]===
Role taking ability and prosocial behaviours and feelings have been argued to be related.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Evidence for this claim has been found from many sources. Underwood and Moore have found that perceptual, affective, and cognitive perspective taking are positively correlated with prosocial behaviour.&lt;ref name=[19]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Underwood|first=B.|author2=Moore, B. |title=Perspective-taking and altruism|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1982|volume=91|pages=143–173|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.91.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children trained to improve their role taking ability subsequently become more generous, more cooperative, and more apprehensive to the needs of others in comparison to children who received no role taking training.&lt;ref name=[20]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chalmers|first=J.B.|author2=Townsend, M.A. |title=The effects of training in social perspective taking on socially maladjusted girls|journal=Child Development|year=1990|volume=61|pages=178–190|doi=10.2307/1131057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[21]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iannotti|first=R.J.|title=Effect of role-taking experiences on roletaking, empathy, altruism, and aggression|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1978|volume=14|pages=119–124|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has also shown that people who are good at role taking have greater ability to sympathize with others.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[22]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S |title=Brazilian adolescents’ prosocial moral judgment and behavior: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the picture is clear: prosocial behaviour is related to role taking ability development and social deviance is linked to egocentrism.&lt;ref name=[23]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chandler|first=M.J.|title=Egocentrism and anti-social behavior: The assessment and training of social perspective-taking skills|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1973|volume=9|pages=326–332|doi=10.1037/h0034974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To study one reason for the link between role taking ability and prosociality,  grade 2 children found to be either high or low in role taking were instructed to teach two kindergartners on an arts and crafts task. 16 measures of prosocial behaviour were scored, and high and low role takers diverged on 8 of the measures, including several helping measures, providing options, and social problem solving. Analysis of the results showed that low role takers helped less than high role takers not because of a lack of wanting to help, but because of their poorer ability in interpreting social cues indicating the need for help.&lt;ref name=[24]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=L.M.|author2=Forman, E.A. |author3=Brion-Meisels, S. |title=Role taking as a predictor of prosocial behavior in cross-age tutors|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=1320–1329|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1982.tb04171.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, low role takers tended to only be able to recognize problems when they were made plainly obvious.&lt;ref name=[24] /&gt;

Role taking has also been related to [[empathy]]. Batson had participants listen to an interview of a woman going through hardship.&lt;ref name=[25]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C.D.|author2=Early, S. |author3=Salvarani, G. |title=Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1997|volume=23|pages=751–758|doi=10.1177/0146167297237008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then instructed participants to imagine how she feels, or, to imagine how they would feel in her situation, and found that both conditions produced feelings of empathy. Schoenrade has found the same result, where imagining how a person in distress feels or how one would feel in that person's situation produces feelings of empathy.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;

Finally, many theorists, including Mead, [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[Solomon Asch|Asch]], Heider, Deutsch, Madsen, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] have theorized a relationship between cooperation and role taking ability.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  In one study, children's predisposition to cooperate was shown to strongly correlate with their affective role taking ability.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  Other researchers have also shown an indirect relationship between cooperation and role taking capacity.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;&lt;ref name=[26]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=H.H.|author2=Stahelski, A. J. |title=Social interaction basis of cooperators' and competitors' beliefs about others|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1970|volume=16|pages=66–91|doi=10.1037/h0029849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Social skills|Social functioning]]===
A child's ability to function in social relationships has been found to depend partially on his/her role-taking ability. For instance, researchers found that children poor in role-taking ability had greater difficulty in forming and sustaining [[Social relation|social relationships]], as well as receiving lower peer nominations.&lt;ref name=[27]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|author2=Jacquette, D. |author3=Lavin, D. R. |title=Interpersonal awareness in children: Toward an integration of developmental and clinical child psychology|journal=[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]|year=1977|volume=47|pages=264–274|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1977.tb00981.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis found that role taking ability was positively correlated with social understanding.&lt;ref name=[28]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=M.H.|title=Measuring individual differences in empathy: Evidence for a multidimensional approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1983|volume=44|pages=113–126|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, progress in role-taking ability has shown to be beneficial for one's personal and interpersonal life.&lt;ref name=[20] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[29]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muus|first=R.E.|title=Social cognition: Robert Selman's theory of role taking|journal=Adolescence|year=1982|volume=17|pages=499–525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better functioning in the interpersonal domain is particularly shown in the relation between role-taking ability and social problem solving ability. Role playing has been shown to improve male teenagers’ handling of social problem tasks.&lt;ref name=[30]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=D.T.|author2=Serafica, F. C. |author3=Barenboim, C. |title=Effect of perspective taking training on interpersonal problem solving|journal=Child Development|year=1980|volume=51|pages=140–155|doi=10.2307/1129600}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gehlbach found a similar supporting result, demonstrating that adolescents with better role taking abilities had superior ability in conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=[31]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehlbach|first=H.|title=Social perspective taking: A facilitating aptitude for conflict resolution, historical empathy, and social studies achievement|journal=Theory and Research in Social Education|year=2004|volume=32|pages=39–55|doi=10.1080/00933104.2004.10473242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other researchers have also found that role taking ability development positively affects interpersonal problem solving skills.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[29] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[32]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendelsohn|first=M.|author2=Straker, G.|title=Social perspective-taking and use of discounting in children’s perceptions of other’s helping behavior|journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology|year=1999|volume=160|pages=69–83|doi=10.1080/00221329909595381}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, role taking can promote better social functioning in the interpersonal domain through smoothening social interactions by improving behavioural mimicking ability.&lt;ref name=[33]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galinsky|first=A.D.|author2=Ku, G. |author3=Wang, C. S. |title=Perspective-taking and self-other overall: Fostering social bonds and facilitating social coordination|journal=Group Process &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2005|volume=8|pages=109–124|doi=10.1177/1368430205051060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training children on role taking ability can improve interpersonal functioning as well. In one study, preschoolers were made to role play interpersonal conflicts using puppets.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Their task at the end was to discuss alternative solutions to the problems and how each solution would affect each character.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Over the 10 weeks that the preschoolers participated in this role playing, their solutions became less [[Aggression|aggressive]] and their classroom [[Adjustment (psychology)|adjustment]] became better.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Moreover, the use of role reversal in interpersonal problem situations has been found to stimulate cooperation, help participants better understand each other and each other's arguments and position, elicit new interpretations of the situation, change attitudes about the problem, and improve perceptions about the other person's efforts at solving the issue, willingness to compromise and cooperate, and trustworthiness.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  As a result of this research, it has been suggested that one way to improve cooperative skills is to improve affective role taking abilities.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt; 
 
Role taking can also work to decrease [[prejudice]] and [[Stereotype|stereotyping]].&lt;ref name=[34]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C.D. |author2=Polycarpou, M.

==Applications==

===[[ADHD|ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)]]===
Children with ADHD struggle in their social environments, but the social-cognitive reasons for this are unknown.&lt;ref name=[40]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marton|first=I.|author2=Wiener, J. |author3=Rogers, M. |author4=Moore, C. |author5=Tannock, R. |title=Empathy and social perspective taking in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|year=2009|volume=37|pages=107–118|doi=10.1007/s10802-008-9262-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have indicated a difference between children with and without ADHD on their role taking ability, wherein children with ADHD have lower role taking ability, lower role taking use, and slower role taking development than children without ADHD.&lt;ref name=[40] /&gt;  Given these results, it has been suggested that children with ADHD be trained on role taking to improve their social skills, including their often comorbid oppositional and conduct problems.&lt;ref name=[40] /&gt;

===[[Juvenile delinquency|Delinquency]] and [[Social skills|social-skills training]]===
The relationship between childhood and adolescent [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] and role taking is considerable. Burack found that maltreated children and adolescents with behavioural problems exhibited [[egocentrism]] at higher levels than non-maltreated children and adolescents who had progressed faster and more expectedly in their role taking development.&lt;ref name=[41]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burack|first=J.A.|author2=Flanagan, T. |author3=Peled, T. |author4=Sutton, H. M. |author5=Zygmuntowicz, C. |author6=Manly, J. T. |title=Social perspective taking skills in maltreated children and adolescents|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|pages=207–217|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.2.207 |pmid=16569161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chandler found that chronically delinquent boys exhibited lower role taking abilities so much so that their role taking ability was comparable to the role taking ability scores of non-delinquent children nearly half their age.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;  In turn, one-third of the delinquent boys in this study were assigned to a treatment program designed to improve role taking skills.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;  Post-treatment measures demonstrated that the program successfully induced role taking ability progress in this group, and an 18-month follow-up assessment found a nearly 50% decrease in delinquent behaviours following these progresses in role taking skills.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;  The same has been found for delinquent girls. Chalmers and Townsend trained delinquent girls, ages 10–16, on role taking skills over 15 sessions, following which the girls demonstrated improved understanding of interpersonal situations and problems, greater empathy, more acceptance of individual differences, and exhibited more prosociality in the classroom.&lt;ref name=[20] /&gt;  The overall picture, then, is that role taking training can help delinquent youth and youth with conduct disorders &lt;ref name=[21] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[42]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=C.E.|title=The effects of sociodramatic play on problem solving behavior among culturally disadvantaged preschool children|journal=Child Development|year=1974|volume=45|pages=920–927|doi=10.2307/1128077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[43]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grizenko|first=N.|author2=Zappitelli, M. |author3=Langevin, J.

===[[Autism]]===
Several researchers have argued that the deficits in the social lives, [[communication]] ability, and [[imagination]] of autistic children are a result of their deficiencies in role taking.&lt;ref name=[47]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=E. |author2=Tarbox, J. |author3=O'Hora, D. |author4=Noone1, S. |author5=Bergstrom, R. |title=Teaching children with autism a basic component skill of perspective-taking|journal=Behavioural Interventions|year=2011|volume=26|pages=50–66|doi=10.1002/bin.320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that autistic children's inability to role take prevents them from developing a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=[48]&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Mechanical, behavioural and intentional understanding of picture stories in autistic children | journal = [[British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 113&amp;ndash;125 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-835X.1986.tb01003.x | date = June 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1986.tb01003.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/1986_BC_etal_PictureStoriesInASChildren.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, role taking has been described as the theory of mind in action.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Failing to role take and failing to develop a theory of mind may lead autistic children to use only their own understanding of a situation to predict others’ behaviour, resulting in deficits in social understanding.&lt;ref name=[48] /&gt;

In support, two studies found shortcomings in role-taking ability in autistic children in comparison to controls.&lt;ref name=[48] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[49]&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found that lower ability in role taking related significantly with the lower [[Social competence|social competency]] in autistic children.&lt;ref name=[50]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oswald|first=D.P.|author2=Oilendick, T.H. |title=Role taking and social competence in autism and mental retardation|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=1989|volume=19|pages=119–127|doi=10.1007/bf02212723}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the autistic children in the study could not focus concurrently on different cognitions required for successful role taking and proficient social interaction.&lt;ref name=[50] /&gt; More specifically, Dawson and Fernald found that conceptual role-taking related most to the social deficits and severity of autism experienced by autistic children, while affective role taking was related only to the severity of autism.&lt;ref name=[51]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawson|first=G.|author2=Fernald, M. |title=Perspective-taking ability and its relationship to the social behavior of autistic children|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=1987|volume=17|pages=487–499|doi=10.1007/bf01486965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The main criticism of Selman's role-taking theory is that it focuses too much on the effect of [[cognitive development]] on role-taking ability and [[social cognition]], thereby overlooking the non-cognitive factors that affect children's abilities in these domains.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  For instance, social experiences, such as disagreements between close friends, have been found to foster role taking skills and social cognitive growth.&lt;ref name=[52]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=J.|author2=Aboud, F.E. |title=The resolution of social conflict among friends|journal=Child Development|year=1985|volume=56|pages=1009–1017|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00173.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, parental influence amongst sibling conflicts matters, as mothers who act as mediators to help solve sibling disagreements have been found to promote role taking skills and social cognitive maturation.&lt;ref name=[53]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=J.|author2=Ross, H. |title=Training parents to mediate sibling disputes affects children’s negotiations and conflict understanding|journal=Child Development|year=2007|volume=78|pages=790–805|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01033.x|pmid=17517005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Royan Institute''' is an [[Iran]]ian clinical, research and educational institute dedicated to biomedical, translational and clinical researches, stem cell research and infertility treatment. It is a public non-profitable organization affiliated to Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research.&lt;ref name="Miremadi 2013"/&gt; It was established in 1991 by the late Dr. Saeid Kazemi Ashtiani&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial - Royan Institute|url=http://www.royaninstitute.org/cmsen/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=106&amp;phpMyAdmin=d320eb7f7212d3b0351b3507d45b4afc|website=www.royaninstitute.org|accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miremadi 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miremadi|first1=Tahereh|editor1-last=Soofi|editor1-first=Abdol S.|editor2-last=Ghazinoory|editor2-first=Sepehr|title=Science and innovations in Iran : development, progress, and challenges|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=9781137030092|pages=139-158|chapter=Chapter 7: Biotechnology in Iran: A study of the structure and functions of the technology innovation system}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a research institute for Reproductive Biomedicine and infertility treatments. In 1998 this institute was approved by Ministry of Health as Cell Based Research Center with over 46 scientific members and 186 lab technicians.

==Research institutes==
Royan consists of three research institutes, each focused on different fields of research:
* Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology (RI-SCBT)[http://royanstemcell.ir/]
* Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine (RI-RB)
* Royan Institute for Animal Biotechnology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotechnology - Royan Institute|url=http://www.royaninstitute.org/cmsen/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=235|website=www.royaninstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RI-AB)

The institute has had close collaborations with other leading Iranian research centers as [[Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics]] (IBB), [[International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology|NRCGEB]], and the [[Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center]] at Shariati Hospital in Tehran.

Royan publishes the '''Cell Journal''' with an [[impact factor]] of 1.636 (2016).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/g56803_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology ===
Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology (RI-SCBT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stem Cell Biology and Technology - Royan Institute|url=http://www.royaninstitute.org/cmsen/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=438|website=www.royaninstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; first, as the "Department of Stem Cells" was established in 2002 to advance researches on biology and technology of embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, germ line stem cells, adult stem cells, cancer stem cells, and cord blood stem cells.

The Institute is providing a comprehensive and coordinated "bench to bedside" approach to regenerative medicine, including a greater understanding of fundamental biology of stem cells, developmental biology, tissue engineering programs, the development of translational research of stem cell therapeutics, and administration of new cell therapies approaches that can restore tissue function to patients.

The RI-SCBT consists of three departments and one center including Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Department of Biological Engineering, Department of Regenerative Medicine, and Cell Therapy Center.

Iran has some of the most liberal laws on stem cell research in the world. The institute founded a Department of Stem Cells in 2002 to establish human [[embryonic stem cell]] lines and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC), and to study differentiation into different kinds of cells including [[Cardiac muscle|cardiomyocyte]]s, [[beta cell]]s, and [[neuron|neural cell]]s. Researchers claimed a live birth of a cloned sheep in 2006, inviting foreign observers to verify the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aneesh Raman CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/11/16/raman.iranstemcell/index.html |title=Iran in the forefront when it comes to stem cell research - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine ===
Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine (RI-RB), founded in 1991, consists of six departments and one clinic actively working on different aspects of infertility and the development of new methods for infertility treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproductive Biomedicine - Royan Institute|url=http://www.royaninstitute.org/cmsen/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=41|website=www.royaninstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It aims to improve the population’s health through infertility treatments and to research different aspects of infertility and its treatment in order to increase the success rate alongside improving embryo health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">The '''School of Letters''' was a summer institute and degree-granting (M.A. and Ph.D. minor) program at [[Indiana University| Indiana University, Bloomington]]. The School moved from [[Kenyon College]] in 1951 following the withdrawal of funding of the '''School of English''' by the Rockefeller Foundation. I.U. President Herman B. Wells obtained funding from the University and located the School under the administration of Dean John W. Ashton of the College of Arts and Sciences. The School opened under the direction of Prof. Richard B. Hudson and then transitioned to Prof. Newton P. 'Stalky' Stallknecht until his retirement and the School's dissolution in 1972.

==Founding of the School of Letters==
When Indiana University moved the School from Kenyon to Bloomington they maintained [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Lionel Trilling]], Philip Rahv, Austin Warren, and [[Allen Tate]] as senior fellows, all well-known literary scholars. The Kenyon School of English was founded by three senior fellows, John Crowe Ransom, [[F. O. Matthiessen]] and Lionel Trilling and was held during a summer session at Kenyon College from 1948 until 1950. The first session of the School of Letters in Bloomington ran from June 21 to August 1, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Arden Fitz, “School of Letters Opens at I. U.” Indiana Daily Student, 6/22/1951&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:School-of-Letters-Logo.jpg|thumb|right|School of Letters logo from the 1972 (final year of the School) brochure.]]

==School of Letters Mission Statement==
{{quote|The educational policy of the School turns on the belief that the usual college and university courses in English have not discharged their responsibility for the art which is in their keeping…They expend very nearly their entire energy upon disciplines which are philological, historical, biographical, and ideological…able students are not being trained, and perhaps not even being encouraged, to form literary judgments.

In 1954, this statement needs from correction, in part perhaps because of the School’s success; in part, too, because the School was symptom as well as cause. Departments of English have increasingly recognized, and officially provided for, the critical study of literature. More students are drawn to it, and they meet with increasing tolerance and even encouragement.

Insistence upon high standards is not to be understood as commitment to some particular doctrine of criticism. As defined by its aims and exemplified in its history, the School represents various modes of contemporary theory and practice. It hopes for that free and responsible diversity, on the part of students and teachers, from which may develop a rich and inclusive synthesis.
&lt;ref&gt;''School of Letters Brochure''(1954) Indiana University School of Letters Director's records, Collection C36, Office of University Archives and Records Management, Indiana University, Bloomington.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The School's Impact on the Field==

Students at the '''School of Letters''' included James M. Cox '51 (later would become a faculty member at Indiana University and the School), Martha Banta '62, [[Bruce Jackson (scholar)|Bruce Jackson]] '62, Paul Lauter '55, and [[Geoffrey Hartman|Geoffrey H. Hartman]] '51. The School existed during a period of major change within the field of literary studies from the dominance of [[New Criticism]] until the rise of [[post-structuralism]]. During each session of the School high profile academics, poets, and critics were brought to Bloomington to teach seminars and deliver weekly forum lectures. These instructors included [[Northrop Frye]], [[William Empson]], [[John Berryman]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Leslie Fiedler]], and [[R. P. Blackmur]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, James E.

A '''science slam''' is a scientific talk where scientists present their own [[scientific research]] work in a given time frame - usually 10 minutes - in front of a non-expert audience. The focus lies on teaching current science to a diverse audience in an entertaining way. The presentation is judged by the audience.&lt;ref name="Science in the Pub"&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/wis/fut/bko/en6483164.htm Article on "Science in the Pub"]&lt;/ref&gt; A science slam is a form of [[science communication]].

{{Desalination}}
A '''seawater greenhouse''' is a [[greenhouse]] structure that enables the growth of crops in [[arid]] regions, using  [[seawater]] and [[solar energy]]. The technique involves pumping seawater (or allowing it to gravitate if below sea level) to an arid location and then subjecting it to two processes: first, it is used to humidify and cool the air, and second, it is evaporated by solar heating and [[distilled]] to produce [[fresh water]]. Finally, the remaining humidified air is expelled from the greenhouse and used to improve growing conditions for outdoor plants. The technology was introduced by British inventor Charlie Paton in the early 1990s and is being developed by his [[UK]] company Seawater Greenhouse Ltd. The more concentrated salt water may either be further evaporated for the production of salt and other elements, or discharged back to the sea. The seawater greenhouse is a response to the global [[water crisis]] and [[peak water]].

== History ==
The seawater greenhouse concept was first researched and developed in 1991 by Charlie Paton's company Light Works Ltd, now Seawater Greenhouse Ltd. The first pilot project commenced in 1992 with the search for a test site that was eventually found on the [[Canary Island]] of [[Tenerife]]. A prototype seawater greenhouse was assembled in the UK and constructed on the site in Tenerife. The results from this pilot project validated the concept and demonstrated the potential for other arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/0/wI6rFXzIVY0|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original pilot design evolved into a lower cost solution using a lighter steel structure, similar to a multi-span polytunnel. This structure was designed to be cost effective and suitable for local sourcing. The design was first tested and validated through a second seawater greenhouse that was constructed on [[Al-Aryam Island]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229315021_The_seawater_greenhouse_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates_Thermal_modelling_and_evaluation_of_design_options|title = The Seawater Greenhouse in the United Arab Emirates: thermal modelling and evaluation of design options|journal = Desalination|volume = 173|pages=103-111|date = 2005|publisher = Elsevier|accessdate = 2015-11-03|author1=P.

These projects have enabled the validation of a thermodynamic simulation model which, given appropriate meteorological data, accurately predict and quantify how the seawater greenhouse
will perform in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=TechAwards&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/1/6NyDruLA3tY|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Seawater Greenhouse built a new commercial installation in [[Australia]]. The enterprise is now independently operating with an evolved set of technologies as [http://www.sundropfarms.com Sundrop Farms Pty Ltd]
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/2/yY53De4kQ-Y|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/5/gzeBca4kJs0|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process==
A seawater greenhouse uses the sun, the sea and the atmosphere to produce fresh water and
cool air. The process recreates the natural [[Water cycle|hydrological cycle]] within a controlled environment. The front wall of the building is a seawater evaporator. It consists of a [[honeycomb lattice]] and faces the prevailing wind. Fans control air movement. Seawater trickles down over the lattice, cooling and humidifying the air passing through into the planting area.
Sunlight is filtered through a specially constructed roof. The roof traps [[infrared]] heat, while allowing visible light through to promote photosynthesis. This creates optimum growing conditions – cool and humid with high light intensity. Seawater that has been heated in the roof passes through a second evaporator creating hot, saturated air which then flows through a condenser.
The condenser is cooled by incoming seawater. The temperature difference causes fresh water to condense out of the air stream. The volume of fresh water is determined by air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and the airflow rate. These conditions can be modeled with appropriate meteorological data, enabling the design and process to be optimized for any suitable location.

|}
 
A seawater greenhouse evaporates much more water than it condenses back into freshwater. This humid air is `lost´ due to high rates of ventilation to keep the crops cool and supplied with CO2. The higher humidity exhaust air provides some benefit to the cultivation of more hardy crops downwind of the greenhouse.

This phenomenon could enable the cultivation of biofuel crops in the area surrounding the seawater greenhouse.

== Applicability ==
The technique is applicable to sites in arid regions near the sea. The distance and elevation from the sea must be evaluated considering the energy required to pump water to the site.  There are numerous suitable locations on the coasts; others are below sea level, such as the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Qattara Depression]], where hydro schemes have been proposed to exploit the hydraulic pressure to generate power, e.g., [[Red Sea-Dead Sea canal|Red Sea–Dead Sea Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0a.htm|title=Managing water for peace in the Middle East|website=archive.unu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/pipe-headloss-power-calculator-calculate-how-much-energy-to-pump-seawater-to-the-middle-of-the-sahara-or-gobi-desert-for-desalination-in-the-seawater-greenhouse-answer-not-a-lot.html|title=Pipe Headloss &amp; Power calculator - calculate how much energy to pump seawater to the middle of the Sahara or Gobi Desert for desalination in the SeaWater Greenhouse - answer not a lot. - Claverton Group|website=www.claverton-energy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sundrop Farms, Australia==
The seawater greenhouse technology was adopted and subsequently modified by [[Sundrop Farms]] in [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/australia.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204050057/http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/australia.html |archive-date=2014-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Sundrop Farms uses a more robust desalination technique in favour of the water vapour technique employed by Seawater Greenhouse, thus allowing them to construct larger scale facilities.  This has been a success, allowing Sundrop Farms to grow crops such as tomatoes in arid climates with only the use of salt water and sunlight, which they use to produce heat, water, and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundropfarms.com/news/|title=Sundrop Farms - News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expansion of 20 hectares was [[Project commissioning|commissioned]] in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ing.dk/galleri/fotos-danske-solanlaeg-laver-17000-tons-australske-tomater-187362#0 |title=FOTOS: Danske solanlæg laver 17.000 tons australske tomater |work=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=7 October 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundropfarms.com/facilities/|title=Facilities - Sundrop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strap-on dildo''' (also '''strap-on''', '''genitalia''' or '''dildo heart''') is a [[dildo]] designed to be worn, usually with a [[safety harness|harness]], during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morin |first=Jack |title=Anal Pleasure &amp; Health: A Guide for Men and Women |edition=3rd |year=1998 |publisher=Down There Press |location=San Francisco, Califonina |isbn=0-940208-20-2 |page=151 |chapter=What is Anal Intercourse |quote=Ever since the invention of the strap-on dildo, anyone can enjoy intercourse as the inserter, the receiver, or both.

A strap-on dildo can be used for a wide variety of sexual activities, including [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[gay sex]], [[oral sex]], or solo or [[Mutual masturbation|mutual]] [[masturbation]]. [[Sexual lubricant]] can be used to ease insertion, and strap-on dildos can be used by people of any [[gender]] or [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

==History==
[[Image:Édouard-Henri Avril (27).jpg|thumb|300 px|Late 19th-century painting by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] showing the use of a strap-on dildo by lesbians.]]
Due to the often taboo nature of strap-on activities, information on their history is difficult to find.
 
Many artifacts from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] have been found that appear to be dildos, including a double "baton" with a hole in the middle, theorized to be for a strap to hold it to a wearer. 

Female-female dildo usage in ancient [[China]] has been documented, but it is not clear if this was double-dildos, strap-on dildos, or just a simple dildo being used by one woman on another. 

In ancient [[Greece]], dildos were made of stone or padded leather, and some evidence shows aforementioned leather was used to make a harness as well, with [[olive oil]] used for anal penetration. 

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]''(2nd century CE) includes mention of dildos ([[darshildo]] in [[Hindi]]) made from a wide variety of materials, and used by hand, with ties (straps), or in a harness. 

A double-penetration dildo was found in ancient [[France]], but its use is lost to time. 

A 19th-century Chinese painting shows a woman using a dildo strapped to her shoe, showing that creative use of strap-ons was already well under way. 

An 1899 report by [[Michael Haberlandt|Haberlandt]] documented current and historical use of double-ended dildos in [[Zanzibar]], and is one of the few historical documents of this kind. 

It is likely the history of the strap-on parallels the history of the dildo, and given the age of many discoveries, is a rather long history.

==Harnesses==
===Harness types===
The first part of a strap-on setup is the harness, which connects the dildo to the wearer's body, usually in a position similar to that of a male's genitals. A good harness should be sturdy yet comfortable, and is often designed to provide stimulation for the wearer. Many types of harnesses are available, with different features and drawbacks. Some dildos do not need a harness or are built onto one; for these, please see the sections on [[#Dildo types|dildo types]] and [[#Dildo attachment methods|dildo attachment methods]].

====Two-strap====
[[Image:2-strap harness with pink dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A two-strap harness]]
A 2-strap harness, in its most basic form, is similar to a [[g-string]]. One strap goes around the wearer's waist, like a belt, while the other goes between the wearer's legs and connects to the other strap in the middle at the lower back. While these are simple, many people find them uncomfortable because the strap rubs against the anus and other areas, and they sometimes do not hold the dildo very firmly, causing it to sag, flop, twist, or squeak.

====Three-strap====
&lt;!-- [[File:4-strap harness with orange dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A three-strap harness]] --&gt;
Three-strap harnesses have one strap around the wearer's waist, but instead of one strap between the legs, they have two straps, one around each thigh, rejoining the first strap near the front. This design leaves the genitals and anus uncovered, and attaches the dildo more firmly, giving the wearer more control. Not all people find this design comfortable, and sometimes they are difficult to fit properly, and tend to slip.

====Corsets and other clothing items====
Strap-on harnesses built into various clothing items are available, most often as a [[corset]] or other item of [[lingerie]]. Some are designed to be worn underneath normal clothing for quick use (if done with the dildo in place, either to give the appearance of a penis or to be able to quickly initiate intercourse, this is sometimes called ''[[Packing (phallus)|packing]]''), while others take advantage of the additional strength and sturdiness an item of clothing can provide over a few straps, or just to integrate the strap-on into an erotic outfit.

====Body locations====
Harnesses are not limited to the crotch, and indeed many types are available for other body parts. A popular one is a thigh harness, which attaches a dildo to the wearer's thigh (or other part of the legs or arms, though this is much less common), allowing for many unique positions, as penetration is no longer limited to what could be done with a penis. Another unusual design attaches a dildo to the chin of the wearer, allowing vaginal penetration while performing [[Anal–oral sex|anilingus]] or vice versa. Also, an additional design is a [[Head bondage|gag-style harness]], in which a gag is inserted into the wearer's mouth and a dildo protrudes at the other end.

====Upon objects====
[[Image:ez-rider ball with purple dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|Inflatable ball with Vac-u-lock plug and attached dildo]]
Harnesses are available to attach dildos to just about any household object, allowing for many creative uses. A dildo could be attached to a chair, bed, or any other item of furniture, and penetrate someone during other activities, with or without a partner. Another item, while not technically a harness, but worth mentioning, is an inflatable ball, usually 9 to 18&amp;nbsp;inches (250 to 500&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter, made of sturdy rubber designed to support the weight of one or two people, with an attachment for a dildo on it. This allows many unique positions, such as double penetration for a woman by lying face down on the ball for vaginal penetration while her partner penetrates her anally doggy style, which is much more effective than a solid object due to the "bounce" of the ball. These inflatable balls are also quite popular for solo use.

===Harness materials===
Harnesses are available in many different materials, and the choice of which to use depends greatly on individual preference.

====Synthetic====
[[Image:Nylon and foam harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|O-ring harness, made with foam and nylon]]
Nylon webbing and soft foam-like synthetic leather are common, relatively affordable, and very durable.  Synthetic harnesses are relatively easy to clean and require relatively little maintenance.  Some, such as the ''Spare Parts'' harness,  are machine-washable.

====Leather====
Leather is comfortable and adjusts to the wearer's body, but still is strong. Leather is harder to clean and requires more work to maintain than other materials.

====Cloth====
Cloth is used mostly for clothing harnesses such as corsets and other lingerie, although is occasionally used by extremely inexpensive harnesses.

====Plastic====
[[Image:clear harness with purple dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|Clear plastic harness]]
Some harnesses are made with soft plastic, such as flexible [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]. These are often available in colors besides traditional black, and may be completely transparent (not possible with other materials). They may be less comfortable than other materials, and may be difficult to make fit well, however they are very easy to clean and fairly robust.

====Latex, rubber, PVC====
[[Latex]] harnesses usually cover the entire area, rather than just using straps. They tend to be medium-priced, and have a limited lifespan, especially if used with oil-based lubricants. Latex can require much care, such as special cleaners or shiners to keep it from turning dry and dusty. Latex harnesses may or may not have the dildo(s) molded as part of the harness, and in either case, they tend to be floppy due to the flexibility of the latex. Similar harnesses are also available made of rubber or [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], and are similar to latex harnesses, although PVC tends to be much less flexible and elastic.

==Dildos==

===Dildo types===
The most noticeable feature of any strap-on setup is the [[dildo]] used. A wide variety of dildos are available, and while the choices may be limited by the type of harness in use, generally one can choose from several common types. This section discusses the shape and features of the penetrating end of the dildo, not of the entire dildo or how it's attached, which can be found in the section on [[#Dildo attachment methods|dildo attachment methods]] for the double dildo and strapless dildo.

====Standard====
[[Image:realistic dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A standard dildo with crotchless Vac-u-lock harness]]
The standard dildo has a non-tapered or slightly tapered shaft, and often has an enlarged head, similar to a penis. The shaft may be slightly curved, but if it is strongly curved, it is often classified as a g-spot/prostate dildo as well. This type is by far the most popular, both for vaginal and anal use, although some beginners prefer a probe-type dildo. Depending on the type of harness the dildo is meant for, it may have molded testicles as part of the base, which many people say gives more pleasure and helps keep the dildo from "bottoming out." Standard dildos are the most common by a large margin, and are available in virtually any length and width, material, texture, etc.

====Probe====
[[Image:probe dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A combination probe and g-spot dildo with a Vac-u-lock harness]]
A probe dildo is often highly tapered, and many resemble a cone in overall shape, or may have a narrow diameter its entire length, although ones resembling an elongated [[butt plug]] are also common, their defining feature being a bulb in the middle which tapers down again towards the harness before flaring wider. These dildos are often advertised as being for beginners, especially newcomers to [[pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], who may find a narrow, tapered dildo easier to start with if they have never had [[anal sex|anal penetration]] before. Many people find that once they are familiar with the activity, the probe dildos are inadequate and unsatisfying, and purchase a standard dildo to use with their harness. Due to this, many kits include both a probe dildo and a standard dildo, so it is not necessary to purchase another.

====G-spot and prostate====
Dildos designed for [[g-spot]] or [[prostate]] stimulation often have a sharp upwards curve at the head, or gradual but still strong curvature the entire length. When used in many sexual positions, the curve causes strong pressure against the g-spot in women or the prostate in men. Some men report that strong prostate stimulation is important for an [[Orgasm#Anal and nipple stimulation in males and females|anal orgasm]], while others report it as a distraction rather than a help. When using one of these dildos for the first time, care should be taken at first to make sure it's comfortable for the receiver, as the strong bend can be difficult to insert or control. For many positions, such as [[doggy style]], the curved tip should point downwards, as otherwise it points in the wrong direction for either g-spot or prostate stimulation.

====Textured====
[[Image:Double dildo simple end 01.jpg|thumb|right|End of textured double dildo]]
For added stimulation, many dildos for harness use are manufactured with bulbs along their length, or having ripples, bumps, or other shapes on the surface to increase the stimulation given to the receiver. A bulbous dildo causes repeated expansion of the vaginal opening when used for vaginal penetration or of the anus when used for anal penetration, and causes a unique pulsating effect and additional stimulation. Ripples along the length of the dildo increase friction and cause a washboard effect, which some people find increases their pleasure, while others find tend to cause numbness. Individual bumps or a water droplet texture on the shaft also causes extra stimulation, and often avoids the washboard effect of evenly spaced ripples. Some dildos modeled to be realistic penises contain very heavy [[vein]] textures on the surface, causing a similar effect.

==== Vibrating and rotating====
[[Image:Stephswift dildo closeup 01.jpg|thumb|right|Multi-function dildo with rotating beads and vibrating egg]]
Some dildos, especially recent ones, may have rotating beads along the shaft, a wiggling shaft, vibrating ticklers or other clitoral stimulation devices, or other features to give more pleasure to the user. While their effectiveness is a matter of opinion, they are becoming increasingly popular. An inexpensive design is basically a standard [[rabbit vibrator]] designed for harness use (often exactly the same toy with a slightly different base), while more expensive dildos are designed from the ground-up for harness use and are usually superior. Rotating beads provide extra stimulation of the [[vulva]] and vaginal opening when used for vaginal penetration or stimulation of the [[anus]] when used for anal penetration, while the various clitoral stimulation devices are generally intended only for vaginal intercourse. These dildos are often bulky or heavy, and like all other vibrators need a power source (usually batteries in a pack that clips onto the harness or slips into a pocket on it), but can provide additional stimulation for those who desire it.

====Double penetration====
[[Double penetration dildo]]s are generally two dildos molded onto a common base, designed for simultaneous vaginal and anal penetration or simultaneous vaginal and vaginal penetration, not to be confused with a man using a strap-on along with his penis for double penetration, which is discussed below. A typical double-penetration dildo has a longer, thicker main shaft for vaginal penetration, and a shorter, thinner, often more curved shaft for anal penetration. Although rare, dildos with the anal shaft being equally as large as the vaginal shaft are available for women who find a larger anal dildo more satisfying. These dildos tend to greatly limit the possible positions they are used in, as the angle has to be right for both vaginal and anal penetration when thrusting, however they can provide a unique experience for couples to try.

====Specialty functions====
[[Image:inflatable enema nozzle in harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|Inflatable enema nozzle]]
Many specialty dildos are available, such as ones that expand when an attached inflator bulb is squeezed, simulate [[ejaculation]] by releasing warm water on demand when a reservoir is compressed, or function as [[enema]] nozzles, allowing an enema to be given while using the strap-on for anal intercourse. Inflatable dildos generally expand in girth when inflated (they usually come with a simple hand-squeeze inflator bulb), allowing the dildo to keep expanding during intercourse as the receiver slowly stretches, giving a unique completely filled feeling which is hard to obtain using normal dildos. Ejaculating dildos contain a squeeze bulb or other reservoir, which when filled with hot water beforehand, allows the wearer to "come" into the receiver at the proper moment. Enema nozzle dildos contain tubing connections, and when used for anal penetration (most often with silicone [[sexual lubricant|lube]], as water-soluble lube would quickly break down when combined with an enema) allow the receiver to receive an enema during intercourse. Some [[BDSM]] mistresses specialize in offering this service. A relatively new product in this field is dildos with electrodes for [[erotic electrostimulation]], further increasing the range of sensations the receiver can experience.

====Penis extensions====
Hollow dildos are often sold as penis extensions to increase size (length and/or girth), but the most common use is for men with [[erectile dysfunction]]. The penis is inserted into the hollow inside of the dildo, then the harness is put on, allowing the man to penetrate his partner with the dildo, the thrusting of which is transferred to his penis.

==== Foreskin ====
Dildos with retractable [[Foreskin|foreskins]] or [[uncircumcised]] dildos are to try to give a natural feel. They can often have fake veins in order to enhance this feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bettystoybox.com/collections/uncut-dildos|title=35 Amazing Uncut / Uncircumcised Dildos (with retracting Foreskin)|last=Box|first=Betty's Toy|website=Betty's Toy Box|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/product.cfm?p=37303|title=Lovehoney|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lovehoney.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dildo attachment methods===
The principal feature of any strap-on setup is the attachment—the dildo used to penetrate the other partner. While there's a huge array of different dildos available, most are attached to the harness in one of several ways. All methods have tradeoffs, and many couples will have different harnesses depending on which type of dildo they want to use.

====Ring and wide base====
[[Image:O-ring harness with pink dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|O-ring harness with wide-base dildo]]
The most common means of holding the dildo to the harness is to have an opening or ring in the harness through which a wide-based dildo is inserted. Inexpensive harnesses tend to just have a round hole in the fabric or [[leather]], while more expensive ones will use a steel or rubber ring. The advantage of this method is that dildos which fit are widely available and inexpensive, and even many dildos not meant for harness use will work in one of these harnesses, such as most dildos with testicles. The major disadvantage is the dildo is often held loosely (especially on cheap harnesses) and tends to flop downwards, and the dildo often can rotate in the harness, making it difficult or impossible to use [[g-spot]] or other shaped dildos.

====Vacuum seal====
[[Image:Vac-u-lock plug 01.jpg|thumb|right|Vac-u-lock plug and powder lubricant]]
Used primarily by [[Doc Johnson]], Vac-u-lock dildos have a rippled hollow in their base, which fits onto a matching plug on the harness or other toy. Powdered lubricant is used on the plug to facilitate removal.  The advantage of this design is the dildo is firmly attached and can not easily rotate, and does not tend to flop downwards or slip like ring harnesses, as well as there being a wide variety of other devices the dildos can be attached to, such as handles and inflatable balls. The disadvantage is the relatively low availability and high cost of compatible attachments. A number of brands have non-compatible clones of the vac-u-lock system, but dildos and accessories for them are virtually unavailable.

====Strapless====
A recent design is a strapless strap-on, designed to be held in a [[vagina]] or [[anus]] with an [[oval (geometry)|egg]]-shaped bulb and thus not to require the use of a harness. This differs from a [[double dildo]] where both ends are phallic and a harness is required. The [[Feeldoe]] is a strapless dildo which was patented by [[Melissa Mia Kain]] in 1997. Advantages of this design are that it can be used spontaneously, that it provides deep internal thrusting to both partners, and that the lack of harness makes it more comfortable. Disadvantages are that the eggs do not prevent rotation or droop, leading to a reduced amount of control unless a harness is employed anyway; a requirement for strong muscles; and the practice needed to become familiar with its use. Many strapless strap ons can also be used with a harness when partners want to increase control. Not all harnesses are suitable for strapless strap ons. It is highly recommended that you use a strap on with very adjustable O-ring or a two-hole harness.&lt;ref name="Strapless"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestdildo.net/a-strap-on-for-a-feeldoe/ |title=A Strap-on For a Feeldoe |accessdate=2010-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705193553/http://bestdildo.net/a-strap-on-for-a-feeldoe/ |archivedate=2015-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double penetration====
[[Image:Double dildo overview 01.jpg|thumb|right|Double dildo with digital controls]]
A [[double dildo]] can be used with or without a harness, although most provide no means of using them with a harness. A double dildo, as its name implies, is a dildo in which both ends are designed for insertion, and often is 18 inches (450&amp;nbsp;mm) or more long. While special ones meant for use with a harness do exist, a normal double dildo is straight, is rarely at a comfortable angle for intercourse, and jabs into the [[cervix]] of a woman using one. However, double dildos can be used for a variety of creative positions for which a harness would be awkward, such as both partners in [[doggy style]] positions or sitting facing each other.

====One-piece latex====
Some harnesses and dildos are made of a single piece of molded latex, with the dildo permanently built into the front. These are often inexpensive, shoddy products, although higher quality ones are available. The advantages are simple use and an appearance some people find erotic, but this is often outweighed by the inability to use a different dildo, the often weak, floppy nature of the dildo, the inability to adjust to a given person for a comfortable fit, and their relatively short lifespan.

====Molded straps====
[[Image:Orange 1-strap dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|Inexpensive dildo with molded snaps]]
Some very cheap "strap-on dildos" have straps or attachments for straps directly molded into the material of the dildo. This design is very flimsy, and is only used on the cheapest products. They are essentially useless for the traditional purpose of a strap-on dildo (one partner penetrating another using a dildo in a position similar to a penis), but can be strapped around chairs and other objects for a variety of other activities.

==Methods of stimulation for the wearer==
Pleasure for the wearer of the strap-on generally comes from pressure against the genitals, particularly the clitoris, during use and from psychological arousal. Many designs of strap-on have various features to increase the stimulation of the wearer.

Some harnesses intentionally leave the genital area and anus open (either intentionally with an opening in the material or by the design simply not having any straps that would cover it), which allows any toy to be used for the stimulation of the wearer, or even for the wearer to be penetrated while wearing the strap-on. This can often be useful when the partners wish to switch roles during their play, as the strap-on can be put on before hand without interfering or needing to be taken off for play to continue. This type of harness is ill-suited for using toys, however, as the harness would not touch the toys, both preventing them from falling out while thrusting and not providing movement to them from the harness.

===External stimulation===

====Built-in features====
[[Image:Stephswift egg closeup 01.jpg|thumb|right|Jelly-coated vibrating egg]]
Some harnesses and dildos provide raised bumps or other features designed to rub against the clitoris of the wearer, either attached to the inside of the harness, or on the back of the base of the dildo. Harnesses that work with such dildos have to have an open back, where the base of the dildo presses directly against the user's body. As high-quality harnesses usually have padding or other means of attaching the dildo to the harness than a simple opening, these features are usually only seen on low-quality, inexpensive dildos. They provide only limited stimulation, and while better than nothing, are usually considered inferior to other types.

====Vibrators====
Another means of providing stimulation to the wearer is a vibrating egg, "clit blaster", vibrating gel pads or whiskers, or other device mounted on the inside of the strapon. These are almost always intended for use by people with vulva, as the external vibrator is rarely positioned well nor provides stimulation for a penis. These devices provide external stimulation to the clitoris, vagina, and other parts of the vulva, but do not provide any penetrative stimulation or anal stimulation.

===Internal stimulation===

====Double-ended attachments====
While a double dildo obviously would provide stimulation to the wearer as well, the standard straight dildo is very poorly suited for harness use. To overcome this, many dildos are available for harness use that have an offset in the middle, with the main attachment and a smaller vaginal attachment for the wearer having a flat vertical section between them. This way, the main attachment is at a good angle and position for thrusting, while its movement is transmitted directly to the vaginal plug and clitoris of the wearer.

=====Double-ended/sided hands and strap free dildos=====
The latest technological achievement is totally new kind of strapless strap on. A special example of these are [[Feeldoe]], Sysil, Super Strapless Silicone Dildo, Share, Nexus Maximus and Transfer, which has an egg shaped bulb designed to be inserted into the vagina or anus of the wearer. Due to the shape of the dildo, thrusting on the main dildo translates to lateral movement of the plug, providing great stimulation to the wearer. Additionally, the shape of the plug allows it to be used without a harness in many instances. It can also allow a man to perform a double penetration (actually doing anal while the dildo penetrate the vagina) while being anal-plugged himself, all with only a single toy.

====Internal plugs====
[[Image:Dual internal plug harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|Strap-on harness with dual internal plugs]]
Many of the "professional" harnesses have one or two plugs (vaginal, anal, or both) on the inside of the harness, to penetrate the wearer. These plugs (may be shaped either like small dildos, the standard butt plug shape, or a combination/hybrid thereof) are usually firmly attached to the harness, and provide stimulation to the wearer as they thrust with the main dildo. Some harnesses may only come with the anal plug while others come with both plugs; most report the latter provides the more pleasure than using one.

While a plug can be used in combination with most any harness, just by inserting the plugs before putting on the harness, all the harness tends to do is push the plugs in, and not move them as to provide stimulation when the wearer thrusts. Depending on the type of harness, different ways are used to properly attach plugs to the harness. A common type consists of an opening or rubber ring with a cloth or leather back, similar to what might be used to hold the main dildo to the front of the harness, but positioned over the anus, vagina, or ones for both. A dildo/plug with a wide base is inserted through the ring, then when the harness is put on, the material pulls tight against it, holding it firm. For vac-u-lock harnesses, one or two additional vac-u-lock plugs are mounted on the inside of the harness, allowing any vac-u-lock attachment to be used. Most vac-u-lock harnesses that have the connectors for internal plugs come with two plug-shaped vac-u-lock attachments, a smaller one for anal use and a larger one for vaginal use. Like other types of harnesses, both plugs may be used at once, and often are separately adjustable on the strap to fit the wearer's body.

==Sexual positions==
{{See also|List of sex positions}}
[[Image:Wiki-pegging.png|thumb|right|A woman pegging a man doggy-style with a 4-strap harness and dildo]]

A number of positions can be performed using a strap-on dildo. These include:

*'''Doggy style''': [[Doggy style]] is popular as it is simple, easy, and allows deep thrusting. The receptive partner kneels down with his or her face against the bed (or other surface), and is penetrated from behind. This position works well for both vaginal and anal penetration, and allows deep, smooth strokes, however it sometimes stimulates the prostate less than other positions during [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]].
*'''Missionary''': The [[missionary position]] is also popular, and allows both partners to cuddle, see each other, kiss, or perform other activities during intercourse. When used for anal penetration, a pillow or other object placed under the buttocks of the receiver will elevate the anus to a comfortable position and angle.
*'''Bent over''': Usually used for [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], the man stands or kneels while leaning forwards, supported by the bed, chair, wall, or other object. Similar to doggy style, he is then penetrated from behind. This position angles the dildo such that it typically strokes firmly across his prostate, and for some men can lead to an anal orgasm much more effectively.

==Common uses==
Even more than the different types of harnesses and dildos, there are different ways to make use of a strap-on setup. Generally ways of using them can be divided into several broad categories, however there are infinite variations.

*'''Pegging''': Is when a woman uses a strap-on dildo to penetrate a man anally.
*'''Sex between women''': Female, same-sex intercourse is one of the more common uses of strapons. Strap-ons are one means for women to enjoy penetration with their sex partner.
*'''Erectile dysfunction''': Men with [[erectile dysfunction]] may use a strap-on to be able to penetrate their partner either by using one with a hollow dildo, or by having their penis beneath the dildo. For example, in one documented case, a [[prostate cancer]] patient with erectile dysfunction due to anti-cancer [[androgen deprivation therapy]] would penetrate his partner with the dildo while she manually stimulated his penis. The report includes a narrative by the patient of his experience where he writes that although he and his partner were initially reluctant, they became highly satisfied, beyond their previous sexual experience as a couple: He found more comfortable without the worry of whether he would be able to keep an erection, and experienced [[multiple orgasms]], felt more diffuse and spreading from his pelvis. His partner reliably achieved orgasm, whereas previously she didn't have orgasms by penetration alone.&lt;ref name="Warkentin 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Restoration of Satisfying Sex for a Castrated Cancer Patient with Complete Impotence: A Case Study |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6830068_Restoration_of_Satisfying_Sex_for_a_Castrated_Cancer_Patient_with_Complete_Impotence_A_Case_Study |last1=Warkentin |first1=Karen |last2=Gray |first2=Ross E. |last3=Wassersug |first3=Richard |year=2006 |journal=J.

*'''Double penetration''': Some women find simultaneous vaginal and anal penetration to be enjoyable, and aside from using a double-penetration dildo discussed previously, can experience this with a male partner using a strap-on. A harness is selected that allows the man's penis to extend under the dildo of the harness, thereby allowing him to insert both his penis and the dildo into his partner. In a face-to-face position (such as the [[missionary position]]) the penis would penetrate the anus and the dildo the vagina; in a position such as doggy style the penis would penetrate the vagina and the dildo the anus.
*'''Masturbation''': Non-traditional harnesses, such as furniture attachments and ride-on balls, can be used for [[masturbation]] by both men and women. A ride-on ball can take the position of another person, in that it can be on bottom for most positions that have the person being penetrated on top, and furniture harnesses can be attached to many objects, an example being a [[bathtub]], to penetrate the user doggy-style before or in a bath.
*'''Transsexual people''': Some [[transsexual]] people use a strap-on to provide the function of a penis, for example an [[transman|FTM]], as he was not originally born with one. This option may appeal to people who have not undergone surgery, for any one of many reasons. Strap-ons may also be used by [[Trans woman|MTF]] transsexuals, who are either genitally post-operative or not using their own phallus.
*'''Premature ejaculation''': In couples where a male partner suffers from [[premature ejaculation]], a strap-on can be used to prolong penetrative sex in order to sexually satisfy the other partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thegrittywoman.com/beginners-guide-purchasing-your-first-strap-on-harness/ Beginners Guide: Purchasing Your First Strap-On Harness | Gritty Woman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/06/02/25185409/savage-love-letter-of-the-day-hes-perfect-but-a-premie Savage Love Letter of the Day: He's Perfect, But a Premie - Slog - The Stranger]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice may feel more personal and satisfying than other types of [[non-penetrative sex]] since [[pelvic thrust]]ing is involved, and the pace is set by the male partner experiencing the premature ejaculation. The strap-on can be in a size similar to the wearer, or the couple can experiment with other sizes or shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.purepleasureshop.com/blogs/ask-amy/15152581-rose-answers-premature-ejaculation-101 Rose Answers: Premature Ejaculation 101 – Pure Pleasure Shop]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Orgasm Denial''': Some couples who practice [[BDSM]] use a strap-on to allow penetrative vaginal sex while denying the male partner the ability to orgasm as a form of [[erotic sexual denial]]. This is distinct from pegging, as the strap-on in this case replaces the penis of the male. In addition to wearing the strap-on, the male may also sometimes wear a [[Chastity belt (BDSM)|chastity belt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tickleberry.co.uk/male-chastity/dildo-harnesses-for-men/ Male Dildo Harness - A guide for Men how to wear a strap-on]&lt;/ref&gt; The strap-on can substitute the penis either as a form of foreplay, or for the complete duration of the intercouse.
*'''Fellatio''': Many people, using a strap-on for any of the above purposes, often like to either suck or have a partner suck a strap-on, performing [[fellatio]] on it. The reasons given vary; possible reasons include power or role reversal. If complemented with erotic stimulation (e.g.: manual stimulation of the penis or the clitoris) and the receiving partner is willing to engage in [[suspension of disbelief]], this can give the illusion to the wearer of the sensation of having an own penis stimulated, similar to the [[rubber hand illusion]]. In the narrative of the prostate cancer patient (see above), he reported receiving oral sex with the dildo and apparently found it satisfying, again after being initially reluctant of the idea.{{r|Warkentin 2006}}

Almost every position associated with sexual intercourse (or not, in the case of simultaneous penetration) can be performed with a strap-on. Indeed, with other harnesses that allow a dildo to be mounted on inanimate objects, endless new positions can be conceived.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5108">'''TIME-ITEM''' is an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of ''Topics'' that describes the content of undergraduate [[medical education]].  TIME is an acronym for "Topics for Indexing Medical Education"; ITEM is an acronym for "Index de thèmes pour l’éducation médicale."  Version 1.0 of the taxonomy has been released and the [[web application]] that allows users to work with it is still under development.  Its developers are seeking more collaborators to expand and validate the taxonomy and to guide future development of the web application.

== History ==

The development of TIME-ITEM began at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 2006.  It was initially developed to act as a content [[Index (publishing)|index]] for a [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum map]] being constructed there.  After its initial presentation at the 2006 conference of the [http://www.came-acem.ca/ Canadian Association for Medical Education],&lt;ref&gt;Willett T &amp; Clarke M. A Map of Medical Concepts: A General-use Database for Applications in Medical Education.  AFMC Resource Group on Medical Informatics Reception.  At the Canadian Association for Medical Education Conference (May 2006) London, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; early collaborators included the [[University of British Columbia]], [[McMaster University]] and [[Queen's University]].

== Features ==

The TIME-ITEM ontology is unique in that it is designed specifically for undergraduate medical education.  As such, it includes fewer strictly biomedical entries than other common medical [[Controlled vocabulary|vocabularies]] (such as [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] or [[SNOMED CT]]) but more entries relating to the medico-social concepts of communication, collaboration, professionalism, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Willett | first1 = TG. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = KC. | last3 = Broudo | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarke | first4 = M. | title = It's about TIME: a general-purpose taxonomy of subjects in medical education | journal = Med Educ | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–8 |date=Apr 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2923.2008.03012.x | pmid = 18298447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics within TIME-ITEM are arranged poly-[[Hierarchy (object-oriented programming)|hierarchically]], meaning any Topic can have more than one [[Tree (data structure)|parent]].  Relationships are established based on the logic that learning about a Topic contributes to the learning of all its parent Topics. 

In addition to housing the ontology of Topics, the TIME-ITEM web application can house multiple [[Curriculum framework|Outcome frameworks]].  All [[Outcome-based education|Outcomes]], whether private Outcomes entered by single institutions or publicly available medical education Outcomes (such as [[CanMeds 2005]]) are hierarchically linked to one or more Topics in the ontology.  In this way, the contribution of each Topic to multiple Outcomes is made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;Willett TG, Marshall KC, Broudo M &amp; Clarke M.  TIME as a generic index for outcome-based medical education.  ''Medical Teacher'' 2008; 29(7):655-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the [[XML]] documents exported from TIME-ITEM (which contain the hierarchy of Outcomes and TIME-ITEM Topics) is being developed alongside the [http://www.medbiq.org MedBiquitous] Competency standards.  

The taxonomy currently exists in English only but translation to Canadian French is in progress.

== Applications ==

TIME-ITEM is intended to be a general-use ontology for medical [[Education Informatics|education informatics]].  It has two primary potential applications:
# Inclusion in [[Curriculum mapping|curriculum maps]].  By mapping learning objects or sessions to TIME-ITEM Topics in a curriculum map, the map becomes searchable for both granular and broad concepts.  If one or more Outcome frameworks are included with the Topic ontology, then the contribution of each curricular element to one or more Outcomes is made explicit.  This also facilitates curriculum [[evaluation]] in terms of one or more outcome frameworks.
# Indexing learning, assessment and portfolio objects.  Metatagging [[learning object]]s or [[assessment objects]] with a controlled vocabulary enhances the organization and retrieval of objects from a [[Disciplinary repository|repository]].  Metatagging [[electronic portfolio]] entries allows one to show how multiple entries "add up" to a demonstration of competence with respect to certain educational outcomes.

The possibility of expanding or modifying TIME-ITEM for use in postgraduate/continuing medical education and in nursing education is currently being explored.

==Overview==
Fulbeck began the project in 2001, traveling the country photographing over 1200 volunteer subjects who self-identified as [[Hapa]] (defined for the project as mixed ethnic heritage with partial roots in Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry)&lt;ref&gt;[http://seaweedproductions.com/the-hapa-project/hapa-about/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=495&amp;nf=1] {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each individual was photographed in a similar minimalist style (directly head-on, unclothed from the shoulders up, and without jewelry, glasses, excess make-up, or purposeful expression).  After being photographed, participants chose their own racial/ethnic terms to describe themselves, then responded to the question "What are you?" in their own handwriting.  The photographs, self-descriptions, and handwritten responses were then combined and displayed as a collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070518155355/http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=480&amp;nf=1] &lt;/ref&gt;

Over 1200 volunteer participants were photographed at dozens of shoots throughout California and Hawaii, as well as Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulbeck |first=Kip |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2297 |title=kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa – an artist’s thoughts |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hapa Project was created to promote awareness and recognition of the millions of multiracial/multiethnic individuals of Asian/Pacific Islander descent in the U.S; to give voice to multiracial people and previously ignored ethnic groups; to dispel myths of exoticism, hybrid vigor and racial homogeneity; to foster positive identity formation and self-image in multiracial children; and to encourage solidarity and empowerment within the multiracial/Hapa community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/fulbeck_hapa_project.asp |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704071724/http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/fulbeck_hapa_project.asp |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fulbeck also notes that a main objective "... was to make the book I wish I owned when I was a kid. I never knew anyone else like me, going through things I went through, not fitting in, always having to choose sides ... Identity is a personal process and I’m adamant that it should be a personal decision, not one made by a community, a government or others." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyotojournal.org/10,000things/184.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031725/http://www.kyotojournal.org/10,000things/184.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of race as identifier==
Fulbeck states that despite its utilization of common racial classifications, The Hapa Project is fundamentally a project about identity rather than a project about race: "It's about identity using race as a starting point." &lt;ref name="fulbeck1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulbeck |first=Kip |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2298 |title=kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa – an artist’s thoughts - part 2 |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that race in itself is not biologically determined, but socially created: "For the record, race is not a scientifically sound assumption. For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We are all African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and [[cultural construct]] ... The U.S. is a country with a long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) and this was all due to the seeming differences we attributed to race. Yes, it is very convenient to categorize people according to race. It is also extremely inaccurate, however." &lt;ref name="fulbeck1"/&gt;

==Conceptual strategies==
[[Image:janm2.jpg|thumb|400px|The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum]]
[[Image:janm1.jpg|thumb|400px|The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum]]
The use of a clinical photographic style combined with the listing of the subject's ethnic heritage alongside their image visually quotes from various pseudo-scientific 18th and 19th century racial studies of [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], and [[Arthur de Gobineau]] [See: Spickard, Paul, ''Almost All Aliens'', Routledge, New York, NY 2007]  However, Fulbeck's decision to have the subjects self-designate their ethnicity and to include their individual handwritten statements counters this methodology, giving ownership and responsibility to the subjects themselves. As historian Paul Spickard writes, "Kip Fulbeck is using the pictures to provoke and encourage his readers.  He is using the old form, but with exactly opposite content." [See: Fulbeck, Kip, Part Asian, 100% Hapa, Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;261]

The project also plays upon and critiques the official photographs each person has taken for their driver's licenses, passports and other forms of identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/press/release/92/ |title=Photographic Exhibition Kip Fulbeck: Part Asian, 100% Hapa Explores Perceptions of Identity, Questions Notions of Race, Ethnicity &amp;#124; Press Releases &amp;#124; Japanese American National Museum |publisher=Janm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further strategy aimed at diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject was to have each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired.  Fulbeck states, "... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they also got to pick their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It was never going to be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again."  One participant was re-photographed 27 times.&lt;ref name="imdiversity1"/&gt;

==Offshoot projects==
Numerous schools and community organizations have created similar projects inspired by Fulbeck's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/emory_omps/sets/72157602156257949/set=72157602156257949&amp;nsid=43037005@N00&amp;lang=en-us |accessdate=September 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/TWC/2006_2007/aahm.html |title=ANNOUNCEMENTS &amp;#124; Brown Center for Students of Color |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbq.edu/news/news1.cfm?ID=375 |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731214017/http://www.dbq.edu/news/news1.cfm?ID=375 |archivedate=July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/nikkeialbum/en/collection/6926/item/7435 |title=The Hapa Collection |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition history==
[[Image:hapaproject1.jpg|thumb|400px|Participatory component of The Hapa Project]]
The Hapa Project publicly premiered in 2006 at the [[Japanese American National Museum]] with a 5-month solo exhibition entitled "kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa."  The work has also exhibited at Space180 Gallery (San Francisco), Mandeville Gallery (New York), [[The Field Museum]], [[University of North Carolina]], [[Oakland University]], [[Northern Arizona University]], [[Santa Clara University]], and [[Woodward Academy]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seaweedproductions.com/bio/curriculum-vitae/ |title=Curriculum Vitae - Kip Fulbeck |publisher=Seaweedproductions.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen images from the series are included in the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]]'s exhibition ''Race: Are We So Different?'' currently touring nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smm.org/travelingexhibits/race/gallery/11/ |title=Science Museum of Minnesota - The Hapa Project |publisher=Smm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the exhibitions include a participatory component where visitors can take part in the project by having their picture taken and writing an individual statement.

==Public attention==
The project has received both national and international news coverage, being featured on [[CNN]], [[MTV]], [[PBS]], [[NPR]], and [[Voice of America]].  Major newspapers covering the project include [[The Los Angeles Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/11/local/me-hapas11 |title=Mixed-Race Asians Find Pride as Hapas - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2006-06-11 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orange County Register]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/life/homepage/article_1158297.php |title=Hapa nation |publisher=Ocregister.com |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyoto Journal.  It has also been featured on dozens of websites exploring race and identity in the U.S.

==Book==
[[Image:Part Asian 100% Hapa Cover.jpg|thumb|''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' (Chronicle Books)]]
A book based on the project entitled ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' was published by [[Chronicle Books]] in 2006.  It features a foreword by musician [[Sean Lennon]] and an afterword by historian Paul Spickard.

The book includes portraits and statements from approximately 10% of the overall project participants.  Fulbeck has discussed the difficulties in selecting these images from the overall pool, as well the problematic of selecting a single image for the book cover.  He also has written about the conscious decision to dispel stereotypes of Hapa people all being conventionally attractive.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;

==Influences==
Fulbeck cites photographer [[Jim Goldberg]] and comic artist [[Lynda Barry]] as specifically influential to the creation of the project.  Lynda Barry also participated in the project and is included in ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa.''  Fulbeck also credits historian Paul Spickard as a major influence, particularly his book ''Mixed Blood: Intermarriage &amp; Ethnic: Intermarriage And Ethnic Identity In Twentieth Century America'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 1991) [See: Fulbeck, Kip, ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'', Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;8, 55, 259].

==Anonymity and celebrity==
Participant names are listed alphabetically in both the photographic exhibition and book (without  index to individual images).  Fulbeck chose participant anonymity both for the safety of the children and as a thematic strategy.  "...I wanted participants to have as blank a slate as possible to work with, to not be burdened by any pre-existing identifiers. It’s interesting with celebrities, because celebrities without their gear – their look or environment or entourage – don’t look like celebrities. They look like people. And that’s what I wanted. I could photograph Cher this way and she’d look like a regular person." &lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;

Celebrities in the project include [[Lynda Barry]], [[Wuv Bernardo]], [[Asia Carrera]], [[Karen David]], [[Amy Hill]], [[Sean Lennon]], Liz Masakayan, [[Greg Pak]], [[Sonny Sandoval]], and [[Sandra Tsing Loh]].

==Emerging patterns==
Two-thirds of the project volunteers were part Japanese-American. An overwhelming majority of participants were female, including some shoots where women outnumbered men 20:1.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=485&amp;nf=1 |accessdate=September 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==
Fulbeck followed ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' with the publication of ''Permanence: Tattoo Portraits by Kip Fulbeck'' in 2008 and ''Mixed: Portraits of Multiracial Kids'' in 2010 (both by [[Chronicle Books]]). Both books also had accompanying solo exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://asianamericanart.blogspot.com/2009/01/permanence-tattoo-portraits-by-kip.html |title=Asian American Art: “Permanence”, Tattoo Portraits By Kip Fulbeck Invisible NYC |publisher=Asianamericanart.blogspot.com |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/exhibits/mixed/ |title=About &amp;#124; MIXED: Portraits of Multiracial Kids by Kip Fulbeck &amp;#124; Japanese American National Museum |publisher=Janm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major speaker on the college circuit, Fulbeck has spoken on The Hapa Project at hundreds of campuses throughout the U.S. He is represented by The Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles.
