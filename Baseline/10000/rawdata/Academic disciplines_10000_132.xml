'''''A Valley Grows Up''''' is a history book for children, written and illustrated by [[Edward Osmond]] and published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1953. It features an imaginary English valley over the course of seven thousand years, from 5000 BCE to 1900. Osmond won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].&lt;ref name=medal1953/&gt; In more than seventy years only a handful of nonfiction books have been so honoured.

==Description==

Ten full-colour double-page paintings and numerous black-and-white drawings combine with a simple, fluent text to tell the story of the changes in a valley's landscape and its gradual settlement from prehistoric to Victorian times. "[A]n uninhabited stretch of forest&amp;nbsp;... [becomes] a hillside, a swamp, a village and eventually the bustling Victorian town of Dungate."&lt;ref name=medal1953/&gt; The same bend in the river, rounding a hill, appears throughout, as on the cover.

==Origins==
Edward Osmond, a well known illustrator, was asked to help students with learning difficulties: "I&amp;nbsp;illustrated on a blackboard my lectures by means of an imaginary village which, together, we created 'from scratch'."&lt;ref name=medal1953/&gt; The educational effectiveness of the concept in seizing the imagination led to the idea for a picture book. The text was always secondary.  [[Marcus Crouch]] describes the resulting book as "an imaginative interpretation of history".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Crouch, ''Treasure Seekers and Borrowers'', [[CILIP|Library Association]], 1962, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">[[File:Hunter Museum Label.jpg|thumb|Every object in galleries has a label where you'll find that object's accession number. ]]
In [[library|libraries]], [[art gallery|art galleries]], [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s, an '''accession number''' is a unique identifier assigned to, and achieving initial control of, each acquisition. Assignment of accession numbers typically occurs at the point of accessioning or cataloging.  The term is something of a misnomer, because the form accession numbers take is often alpha-numeric.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;Witt, B.S., Whittfield, J.C., Stepansky, A.J. (2012) ''Pastperfect software for museum collections: Version 5 users guide.'' Retrieved from http://museumsoftware.com/v5userguide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If an item is removed from the collection, its number is usually not reused for new items.

In libraries, this numbering system is usually in addition to the [[library classification]] number (or alphanumeric code) and to the [[ISBN]] or International Standard Book Number assigned by [[publisher]]s.

Accession numbers are also used in [[botany]], by institutions with living collections like [[arboretum|arboreta]], [[botanic garden]]s, etc., to identify plants or groups of plants that are of the same [[taxon]], are of the same [[Propagule|propagule type]] (or treatment), were received from the same source, were received at the same time.&lt;ref name="Glasnevin"&gt;Jebb, Matthew (1998) ''Cataloguing and Record keeping for Plant Collections'' Retrieved from http://www.botanicgardens.ie/educ/accnosho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbarium|Herbaria]] and other botanic institutions collecting non living material also use accession numbers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

An accession number may include the year acquired, sometimes the full date (as at the [[British Museum]]), and a sequential number separated by a period.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; In addition, departments or art classifications within the collection or museum may reserve sections of numbers. For example, objects identified by the numbers 11.000 through 11.999 may indicate objects obtained by the museum in 1911; the first 300 numbers might be used to indicate American art, while the next fifty (11.301–350) might be used for [[African art]]. In some cases, they also include letters and other punctuation, such as commas, hyphens or slashes.&lt;ref&gt;Reitz, J.M. (2004) ''Dictionary for library and information science.'' Libraries Unlimited. p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt;

In older institutions, simpler numbering systems are sometimes maintained alongside, or incorporated within, newer systems.  Where the objects are unique, institutions normally need to retain the original number in some form as it will have been used in old references that are still of use in scholarship.  In particular, collections of [[manuscripts]] use the prefix "MS", and many well known manuscripts are known by their old MS numbers, often incorporating a prefix for a particular collection within a library.  These collections may be divided by former owners, as with several [[British Library]] [[:Category:British Library collections|"closed" collections]], or by language, as with [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF MS Fr. 2643-6)]], indicating a two volume manuscript in French at the {{lang|fr|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3349">'''AICD (activation-induced cell death)''' is [[programmed cell death]] caused by the interaction of [[Fas receptor]]s (Fas, CD95) and [[Fas ligand]]s (FasL, CD95 ligand).&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;Zhang J, Xu X, Liu Y. (2004), Activation-Induced Cell Death in T Cells and Autoimmunity. Cell Mol Immunol. 1(3):186-92&lt;/ref&gt; AICD is a negative regulator of activated [[T lymphocytes]] that results from repeated stimulation of their [[T-cell receptors]] (TCR) and helps to maintain peripheral [[immune tolerance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kabelitz D, Janssen O. (1997), Antigen-induced death of T-lymphocytes. Front Biosci. 2:d61-77&lt;/ref&gt;  Alteration of the process may lead to [[autoimmune disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

The AICD effector cell is one that expresses FasL, and [[apoptosis]] is induced in the cell expressing the Fas receptor. Both activated T cells and [[B cells]] express Fas and undergo [[clonal deletion]] by the AICD mechanism.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green DR, Droin N, Pinkoski M. (2003), Activation-induced cell death in T cells. Immunol Rev. 193:70-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donjerković D, Scott DW. (2000), Activation-induced cell death in B lymphocytes. Cell Res. 10(3):179-92&lt;/ref&gt; Activated T cells that express both Fas and FasL may be killed by themselves or by each other.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

== Signaling ==
The binding of Fas ligand to Fas receptor triggers [[protein trimer|trimerization]] of Fas, whose cytoplasmic domain is then able to bind the [[death domain]] of the [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor protein]] [[FADD]] (Fas-associated protein with death domain). Procaspase 8 binds to FADD's [[death effector domain]] (DED) and [[proteolysis|proteolytically]] self-activates as [[caspase 8]]. Fas, FADD, and procaspase 8 together form a [[death-inducing signaling complex]] (DISC). Activated caspase 8 is released into the cytosol, where it activates the [[caspase]] cascade that initiates apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Nagata S. (1997), Apoptosis by death factor. Cell. 88(3):355-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

== Regulation of Fas-FasL and AICD ==
FasL is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. (The other option is regulation of the signal emanating from the [[death receptor]] itself, controlling sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis.)&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; [[NFAT]] activated by TCR stimulation activates FasL transcription, possibly indirectly by upregulating [[early growth response proteins]].&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt; T cell activation-induced [[gene transcription|transcription]] of FasL is further regulated by [[c-Myc]]–[[MAX (gene)|MAX]] heterodimers, and can be blocked by c-Myc downregulation.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;  Interferon regulatory factors [[IRF1]] and [[IRF2]] also upregulate FasL transcription by directly binding to the FasL [[gene promoter|promoter]].&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt; 

Not much is known about the regulation of Fas and other death receptors. However, overexpression of the protein [[CFLAR]] (caspase and FADD-like apoptosis regulator) inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;Scaffidi C, Schmitz I, Krammer PH, Peter ME. (1999é, The role of c-FLIP in modulation of CD95-induced apoptosis. J Biol Chem 274:1541–1548&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">'''Antilabe''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀντι "mutually" or "corresponding", λαβή, "grip" or "handle") is a [[rhetoric]]al technique in [[verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] or [[closet drama]], in which a single [[Line (poetry)|verse line]] of dialogue is distributed on two or more [[Character (arts)|characters]], voices, or entities. The verse usually maintains its [[Metre (poetry)|metric]] integrity, while the line fragments spoken by the characters may or may not be complete sentences. In the layout of the text the line fragments following the first one are often indented ("[[dropped line]]") to show the unity of the verse line.

{{Quotation|
'''BRUTUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
:Peace then. No words.
'''CLITUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
::::::::I'll rather kill myself.|
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]|[[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']]}}

These are three sentences spoken by two persons. But it is only one single line in [[blank verse]]:

:Peace '''then'''. No '''words'''. I'll '''ra'''ther '''kill''' my'''self'''.

==In Ancient Greek drama==

"The device originated in [[tragedy|classical tragedy]] as a means of heightening dramatic tension."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, David. ''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama''. Volume 1. 1972, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; "It figures in almost all the plays of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. It renders dialogue less stately and more agitated: the technique is well suited to scenes of excitement, in which one speaker is repeatedly capping, countering or following up the ideas of another."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R. B. ''Greek Tragic Style: Form, Language and Interpretation''. Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sophokles’ ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]'', for example, "as ''Kreon'' seizes ''Antigone'' (832), they break into an excited lyrical strophe, full of ''antilabe'' in which ''Oedipus'', ''Kreon'', and the chorus participate."&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, Lowell. ''Theatrical Space and Historical Place in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus''. Maryland, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996,  p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "In ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'' (1502-3), ''antilabe'' occurs as ''Orestes'' tries to induce ''Aegisthys'' to enter the house so that ''Orestes'' can kill him."&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, John E. Jr. ''The Facts on File Companion to Classical Drama''. Facts on File (Library of World Literature) 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; "[Antilabe is] used with particular freedom in late Euripides."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the plays of [[Aeschylus]], with the possible exception of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (line 980), this phenomenon does not occur." &lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca drama==

"Dialogic exchanges using both ''[[stichomythia]]'' and ''antilabe'' are common in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. They occur in all the tragedies except ''Phoenissiae''."&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, A. J. ed. ''Seneca: Medea: Edited with Introduction, Translation, and Commentary''. Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Renaissance drama==

David Eggenberger notes that "[the device] was frequently utilized by [[Renaissance]] dramatists."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme example from Shakespeare is:

[[File:Apparent viscosity.svg|thumb|right|The apparent viscosity of a fluid depends on the shear rate at which it is measured. The apparent viscosity of a dilatant fluid is higher when measured at a higher shear rate (η₄ is higher than η₃), while the apparent viscosity of a Bingham plastic is lower (η₂ is lower than η₁).]]
'''Apparent viscosity''' (sometimes denoted '''η''')&lt;ref name="F-M" /&gt; is the [[shear stress]] applied to a fluid divided by the [[shear rate]] (&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{\tau}{\dot\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;). For a [[Newtonian fluid]], the apparent viscosity is constant, and equal to the Newtonian viscosity of the fluid, but for [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s, the apparent viscosity depends on the shear rate. Apparent viscosity has the [[SI derived unit]] Pa·s ([[Pascal (unit)|Pascal]]-[[second]], but the [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]] is frequently used in practice: (1 mPa·s = 1 cP).

==Application==
A single viscosity measurement at a constant speed in a typical [[viscometer]] is a measurement of the apparent viscosity of a fluid. In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, measurement of apparent viscosity without knowledge of the shear rate is of limited value: the measurement cannot be compared to other measurements if the speed and geometry of the two instruments is not identical. An apparent viscosity that is reported without the shear rate or information about the instrument and settings (e.g. speed and spindle type for a rotational viscometer) is meaningless.

Multiple measurements of apparent viscosity at different, well-defined shear rates, can give useful information about the non-Newtonian behaviour of a fluid, and allow it to be modeled.

== Power-law fluids ==

In many [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s, the shear stress due to viscosity, &lt;math&gt; \tau_{xy} &lt;/math&gt;, can be modeled by

:&lt;math&gt; \tau_{xy} = k \left (\frac{du}{dy}\right ) ^n &lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''k'' is the consistency index
* ''n'' is the [[flow behavior index]]
* ''du/dy'' is the shear rate, with velocity ''u'' and position ''y''

These fluids are called [[power-law fluid]]s.

To ensure that &lt;math&gt; \tau_{xy} &lt;/math&gt; has the same sign as ''du/dy'', this is often written as

:&lt;math&gt; \tau_{yx} = k \left | \frac{du}{dy} \right | ^{n-1} \frac{du}{dy} = \eta \frac{du}{dy} &lt;/math&gt;

where the term

:&lt;math&gt; \eta = k \left | \frac{du}{dy} \right | ^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;

gives the apparent viscosity.&lt;ref name="F-M"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Robert|last2=McDonald|first2=Alan|last3=Pritchard|first3=Philip|title=Fluid Mechanics|edition=8|year=2012|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1-118-02641-0|pages=76–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''application firewall''' is a form of [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] that controls [[input/output|input]], [[Output (computing)|output]], and/or [[System call|access]] from, to, or by an application or service. It operates by monitoring and potentially blocking the input, output, or [[System call|system service calls]] that do not meet the configured policy of the firewall. The application firewall is typically built to control all network traffic on any [[OSI model|OSI layer]] up to the [[OSI model#Layer 7: application layer|application layer]]. It is able to control applications or services specifically, unlike a [[Stateful firewall|stateful network firewall]], which is - without additional software - unable to control network traffic regarding a specific application. There are two primary categories of application firewalls, ''network-based application firewalls'' and ''host-based application firewalls''.

==Network-based application firewalls==
A network-based application layer firewall is a computer networking [[firewall (networking)|firewall]] operating at the [[application layer]] of a [[protocol stack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Weakest Security Link Series|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz34zXV7VB8C&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=application+layer+firewall#v=onepage&amp;q=application%20layer%20firewall&amp;f=false|author=Luis F. Medina|year=2003|page=54|isbn=978-0-595-26494-0|publisher=IUniverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as a proxy-based or reverse-proxy firewall. Application firewalls specific to a particular kind of network traffic may be titled with the service name, such as a [[web application firewall]]. They may be implemented through software running on a host or a stand-alone piece of network hardware. Often, it is a host using various forms of [[proxy server]]s to proxy traffic before passing it on to the client or server. Because it acts on the application layer, it may inspect the contents of traffic, blocking specified content, such as certain websites, viruses, or attempts to exploit known logical flaws in client software.

Modern application firewalls may also [[SSL acceleration|offload encryption from servers]], block application input/output from detected [[intrusion prevention|intrusions]] or [[Mangled packet|malformed communication]], manage or consolidate [[authentication]], or [[Data loss prevention products|block content that violates policies]].

===History===
[[Gene Spafford]] of [[Purdue University]], [[Bill Cheswick]] at [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]], and [[Marcus Ranum]] described a third generation firewall known as an application layer firewall. Marcus Ranum's work, based on the firewall created by Paul Vixie, Brian Reed and Jeff Mogul, spearheaded the creation of the first commercial product. The product was released by DEC, named the DEC SEAL by [[Geoff Mulligan]] - Secure External Access Link. DEC’s first major sale was on June 13, 1991 to a chemical company based on the East Coast of the USA.

Under a broader DARPA contract at TIS, Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, and Peter Churchyard developed the Firewall Toolkit (FWTK), and made it freely available under license on October 1, 1993. The purposes for releasing the freely available, not for commercial use, FWTK were: to demonstrate, via the software, documentation, and methods used, how a company with (at the time) 11 years' experience in formal security methods, and individuals with firewall experience, developed firewall software; to create a common base of very good firewall software for others to build on (so people did not have to continue to "roll their own" from scratch); and to "raise the bar" of firewall software being used. However, FWTK was a basic application proxy requiring the user interactions.

In 1994, Wei Xu extended the FWTK with the Kernel enhancement of IP stateful filter and socket transparent. This was the first transparent firewall, known as the inception of [[Firewall (computing)#Third generation: application layer|the third generation firewall]], beyond a traditional application proxy ([[Firewall (computing)#Second generation: .22stateful.22 filters|the second generation firewall]]), released as the commercial product known as Gauntlet firewall. Gauntlet firewall was rated one of the top application firewalls from 1995 until 1998, the year it was acquired by Network Associates Inc, (NAI). Network Associates continued to claim that Gauntlet was the "worlds most secure firewall" but in May of 2000, security researcher [[Jim Stickley]] discovered a large vulnerability in the firewall, allowing remote access to the operating system and bypassing the security controls. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Hole found in NAI Firewall|url=https://www.securityfocus.com/news/40|author=Kevin Pulsen|date=May 22, 2000|accessdate=2018-08-14|publisher=securityfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Stickley|Stickley]] discovered a second vulnerability a year later, effectively ending Gauntlet firewalls security dominance.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaping hole in NAI's Gauntlet firewall|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/09/05/gaping_hole_in_nais_gauntlet/|author=Kevin Pulsen|date=September 5, 2001|accessdate=2018-08-14|publisher=theregister.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key benefit of application layer filtering is that it can "understand" certain applications and protocols (such as File Transfer Protocol, DNS, or web browsing), and it can detect whether an unwanted protocol is being sneaked through on a non-standard port or whether a protocol is being abused in any harmful way.

==Host-based application firewalls==
A host-based application firewall can monitor any application input, output, and/or system service calls made from, to, or by an application. This is done by examining information passed through system calls instead of or in addition to a network stack. A host-based application firewall can only provide protection to the applications running on the same host.

Application firewalls function by determining whether a process should accept any given connection. Application firewalls accomplish their function by hooking into socket calls to filter the connections between the application layer and the lower layers of the OSI model. Application firewalls that hook into socket calls are also referred to as socket filters. Application firewalls work much like a packet filter but application filters apply filtering rules (allow/block) on a per process basis instead of filtering connections on a per port basis. Generally, prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection. It is rare to find application firewalls not combined or used in conjunction with a packet filter.&lt;ref name="symantec.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/software-firewalls-made-straw-part-1-2|title=Software Firewalls: Made of Straw? Part 1 of 2|website=Symantec.com|publisher=Symantec Connect Community|date=2010-06-29|accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, application firewalls further filter connections by examining the process ID of data packets against a ruleset for the local process involved in the data transmission. The extent of the filtering that occurs is defined by the provided ruleset. Given the variety of software that exists, application firewalls only have more complex rulesets for the standard services, such as sharing services. These per process rulesets have limited efficacy in filtering every possible association that may occur with other processes. Also, these per process ruleset cannot defend against modification of the process via exploitation, such as memory corruption exploits.&lt;ref name="symantec.com"/&gt; Because of these limitations, application firewalls are beginning to be supplanted by a new generation of application firewalls that rely on mandatory access control (MAC), also referred to as [[sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]], to protect vulnerable services. Examples of next generation host-based application firewalls that control system service calls by an application are [[AppArmor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Firewall your applications with AppArmor | url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/58789 | accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the TrustedBSD MAC framework (sandboxing) in Mac OS X.&lt;ref name="TrustedBSD"&gt;{{cite web| title=The TrustedBSD Project | publisher=[[The TrustedBSD Project]] | url=http://www.trustedbsd.org/mac.html | date=2008-11-21 | accessdate=2010-02-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100123225944/http://www.trustedbsd.org/mac.html| archivedate= 23 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Host-based application firewalls may also provide network-based application firewalling.

Sandboxing systems can also control file and process accesses as well as network access. Commercial sandboxing systems are available for both Windows and Unix type OSes.

==Implementations==
There are various application firewalls available, including both free and open source software and commercial products.

===Mac OS X===
Mac OS X, as of Leopard, includes an implementation of the TrustedBSD MAC framework, which is taken from FreeBSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedbsd.org/mac.html|title=Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Framework|publisher=TrustedBSD|accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TrustedBSD MAC framework is used to sandbox some services, such as mDNSresponder, much like AppArmor is used to sandbox services in some Linux distributions. The TrustedBSD MAC framework provides a default layer of firewalling given the default configuration of the sharing services in Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard.

The Application firewall located in the security preferences of Mac OS X starting with Leopard provides the functionality of this type of firewall to a limited degree via the use of code signing apps added to the firewall list. For the most part, this Application firewall only manages network connections by checking to see if incoming connections are directed toward an app in the firewall list and applies the rule (block/allow) specified for those apps.

===Linux===
This is a list of security software packages for Linux, allowing filtering of application to OS communication, possibly on a by-user basis:
* [[Kerio Control]] - a commercial Product
* [[AppArmor]]
* [[ModSecurity]] - also works under Windows, Mac OS X, [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and other versions of [[Unix]]. ModSecurity is designed to work with the web-servers IIS, Apache2 and NGINX.
* [[Systrace]]
* [[Zorp firewall|Zorp]]

===Windows===
* [[WinGate]]

===Network appliances===
These devices are sold as hardware network appliances and in some instances as virtual images that run on basic server hardware.

==Specialized application firewalls==
Specialized application firewalls offer a rich feature-set in protecting and controlling a specific application. Most specialized network appliance application firewalls are for web applications.

===History===
Large-scale web server hacker attacks, such as the 1996 PHF CGI exploit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1996-06.html|publisher=[[CERT Coordination Center]]|title=CERT Advisory CA-1996-06 Vulnerability in NCSA/Apache CGI example code|date=March 20, 1996|accessdate=2010-11-17|author=CERT}}&lt;/ref&gt; lead to the investigation into security models to protect web applications. This was the beginning of what is currently referred to as the web application firewall (WAF) technology family. Early entrants in the market started appearing in 1999, such as [[Perfecto Technologies]]’s [[AppShield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New tool blocks wily e-comm hacker tricks|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/07/ecomm.hack.idg/index.html|author=Ellen Messmer|date=September 7, 1999|accessdate=2010-11-17|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who later changed their name to [[Sanctum (company)|Sanctum]] and in 2004 was acquired by Watchfire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/95035/Q_A_Watchfire_CTO_sees_Sanctum_acquisition_as_a_good_fit|title=Q&amp;A: Watchfire CTO sees Sanctum acquisition as a good fit|date=August 4, 2004|author=Jaikumar Vijayan|publisher=[[Computerworld]]|accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (acquired by IBM in 2007), which focused primarily on the ecommerce market and protected against illegal web page character entries. NetContinuum (acquired by [[Barracuda Networks]] in 2007) approached the issue by providing pre-configured ‘security servers’. Such pioneers faced proprietary rule-set issues, business case obstacles and cost barriers to wide adoption, however, the need for such solutions was taking root.

In 2002, the open source project [[ModSecurity]], run by Thinking Stone and later acquired by Breach Security in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/breach-security-acquires-rival-firewall-modsecurity-998|title=Breach Security acquires rival firewall ModSecurity|author=Jeremy Kirk|publisher=[[InfoWorld]]|date=September 25, 2006|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed with a mission to solve these obstacles and make WAF technology accessible for every company. With the release of the core rule set, a unique{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} open source rule set for protecting Web applications, based on the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] Web Application Security Technical Committee’s (WAS TC) vulnerability work, the market had a stable, well documented and standardized model to follow.

In 2003, the WAS TC’s work was expanded and standardized across the industry through the work of the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP) Top 10 List. This annual ranking is a classification scheme for web security vulnerabilities, a model to provide guidance for initial threat, impact, and a way to describe conditions that can be used by both assessment and protection tools, such as a WAF. This list would go on to become the industry benchmark for many compliance schemes.

In 2004, large traffic management and security vendors, primarily in the network layer space, entered the WAF market through a flurry of mergers and acquisitions. Key among these was the mid-year move by F5 to acquire Magnifire WebSystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F5 buys Magnifire for $29 million|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2004/0601f5buys.html|author=Tim Greene|publisher=[[Network World]]|date=June 1, 2004|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the integration of the latter’s TrafficShield software solution with the former’s Big-IP traffic management system. This same year, F5 acquired AppShield and discontinued the technology. Further consolidation occurred in 2006 with the acquisition of Kavado by Protegrity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protegrity acquires Web apps security vendor Kavado|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/104063/Protegrity_acquires_Web_apps_security_vendor_Kavado|author=Linda Rosencrance|date=August 19, 2005|publisher=[[Computerworld]]|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Citrix Systems’ buying of Teros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citrix Picks Up Teros|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-storage/citrix-picks-up-teros.php|author=James Rogers|date=November 15, 2005|accessdate=2011-12-06|publisher=networkcomputing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until this point, the WAF market was dominated by niche providers who focused on web application layer security. Now the market was firmly directed at integrating WAF products with the large network technologies – load balancing, application servers, network firewalls, etc. – and began a rush of rebranding, renaming and repositioning the WAF. Options were confusing, expensive and still hardly understood by the larger market.

In 2006, the Web Application Security Consortium was formed to help make sense of the now widely divergent WAF market. Dubbed the Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria project (WAFEC), this open community of users, vendors, academia and independent analysts and researchers created a common evaluation criterion for WAF adoption that is still maintained today.

Wide-scale interest in the WAF began in earnest, tied to the 2006 [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI Security Standards Council]] formation and compliance mandate. Major [[payment card]] brands (AMEX, Visa, MasterCard, etc.) formed PCI as a way to regulate security practices across the industry and curtail the rampant [[credit card fraud]] taking place.  In particular, this standard mandated that all web applications must be secure, either through secure development or use of a WAF (requirement 6.6). The OWASP Top 10 forms the backbone of this requirement.

With the increased focus on virtualization and Cloud computing to maximize existing resources, scaling of WAF technology has become the most recent milestone.

By 2010, the WAF market had matured to a market exceeding $200M in size according to Forrester.  In a February 2010 report, Web Application Firewall: 2010 And Beyond, Forrester analyst Chenxi Wang wrote, "Forrester estimates the 2009 market revenue of the WAF+ market to be nearly $200 million, and the market will grow by a solid 20% in 2010. Security and risk managers can expect two WAF trends in 2010: 1) midmarket-friendly WAFs will become available, and 2) larger enterprises will gravitate toward the increasingly prevalent WAF+ solutions."  She also wrote that "[[Imperva]] is the stand alone WAF leader."

====Distributed web application firewalls====
Distributed Web Application Firewall (also called a dWAF) is a member of the web application firewall (WAF) and [[Web Application Security|Web applications security]] family of technologies. Purely software-based, the dWAF architecture is designed as separate components able to physically exist in different areas of the network. This advance in architecture allows the resource consumption of the dWAF to be spread across a network rather than depend on one appliance, while allowing complete freedom to scale as needed. In particular, it allows the addition / subtraction of any number of components independently of each other for better resource management. This approach is ideal for large and distributed virtualized infrastructures such as private, public or hybrid cloud models.

====Cloud-based web application firewalls====
Cloud-based web application firewall is also member of the web application firewall (WAF) and [[web Application Security|web applications security]] family of technologies. This technology is unique due to the fact that it is platform agnostic and does not require any hardware or software changes on the host.  All providers but one require a DNS change, wherein all web traffic is routed through the WAF where it is inspected and threats are thwarted. Cloud-based WAFs are typically centrally orchestrated, which means that threat detection information is shared among all the tenants of the service. This collaboration results in improved detection rates and lower false positives. Like other cloud-based solutions, this technology is elastic, scalable and is typically offered as a pay-as-you grow service. This approach is ideal for cloud-based web applications and small or medium-sized websites that require web application security but are not willing or able to make software or hardware changes to their systems.

{{main|Cucuteni–Trypillia culture}}

The chalcolithic [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]], in Eastern Europe, left behind thousands of [[Human settlement|settlement]] ruins, circa 6000 to 3500 BC, containing a wealth of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] attesting to their [[Archaeological culture|cultural]] and [[Assemblage (archaeology)|technological]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mallory"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth |year=1989 |publisher= Thames and Hudson |location= London |isbn=0-500-05052-X |oclc= 246601873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction techniques==
{{See also|Neolithic architecture}}
The houses of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements were constructed in several general ways:
* Wattle and daub homes.
* Log homes, called ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|площадки}} ''ploshchadki'').
* Semi-underground homes called [[Bordei]].
Some Cucuteni-Trypillia homes were two storeys tall, and evidence shows that the members of this culture sometimes decorated the outsides of their homes with many of the same complex red-ochre swirling designs that are to be found on their pottery. Most houses had thatched roofs and wooden floors covered with clay.
Archaeologists have identified two types of [[Timber framing|house framing]] found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites. One type, somewhat resembling the [[Post and lintel|post and beam]] style, used evenly distributed fork-shaped log pillars that were partially sunk vertically into the ground so that the fork was located at the top and supported the roof beams above. The other type of framing used vertical beams measuring {{cvt|15|–|20|cm|in|disp=x|in diameter (|)}}, or greater, which rested on horizontal ground-sill foundational timbers that were in turn fixed in place on top of the soil.

Most of the walls were built in the [[Wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] style. The construction of these houses first started by erecting the framework of larger timbers in place [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/123.ridicare.casa.stadiul.1.poz.2.jpg (photo 1)], which would take the weight of the structure, and then the space between these timbers would be filled in with a "wattle" made of pliable smaller branches and vines woven together to form a thin twiggy [[Latticework|latticed]] net which was then affixed to the sturdy timbers [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/116.peretele.c.impletitura.orizontala.jpg (photo 2)]. Onto this wattle framework the "daub" would be applied made of mostly dampened clay soil although sometimes mixed with small bits of straw and/or animal dung to help keep its structural integrity ([http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/145.jpg photo 3]). The daub had to be applied with some force against the wattle in order for it to partially push through the twiggy framework, to which it would stick. Sometimes there would only be a single layer of wattle, and at other times two wattle layers would be used; one for the interior and another for the exterior of the wall. Daub was applied on both sides of the wall, inside and out [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/casa.jpg (photo 4)], creating a finished wall that was usually about {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick. Once applied it was smoothed before drying to create an air- and water-tight barrier against the elements [http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/last.jpg (photo 5)]. After the daub was fully dried, it was usually painted with [[Lime plaster|lime]] to prevent infestations of [[Pest (organism)|pests]].(''note: the photographic examples used in this paragraph were taken from the web page "Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house", hosted by The Archaeological Park Cucuteni, see "External Links" at bottom of this article'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recreating a Cucuteni dwelling-house |publisher=The Archaeological Park Cucuteni |url= http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |language=English, Romanian |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628222111/http://arts.iasi.roedu.net/cucuteni/arheo/casa/ine.html |archivedate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the walls were made of [[Log home|horizontally laid timbers]] (similar to log homes) that were then covered with clay daub. Some examples have been found where the horizontal timbers were in turn covered with a wattle-and-daub layer. At other times the horizontal timbers would be covered with a layer of primitively finished lumber. There was no standard practice in building walls there during Neolithic times; sometimes, even in the same house, walls would be constructed with horizontal timbers while others would be covered with finished lumber or wattle-and-daub.

==Bordei dwellings==
{{See also|Bordei}}
Some of the houses found by archeologists were [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] [[earth house]]s, of the style called ''bordei'' in both Romanian ({{lang-ro |italic=yes|bordei}}) and Ukrainian ({{lang-ua|italic=yes|бордей}}). Unlike surface dwellings characterized by walls with right angles and rectangular shapes the bordei houses were characterized by elliptical shapes. These houses would typically have a wooden [[floor]] that was about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} below ground, which would place the roof at just above ground level.&lt;ref name="Sorochin" /&gt; Images of bordei homes may be seen at the Romanian Art Zone page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grigorescu |first=Nicolae |title=Bordei in padure |trans-title=Bordei in the forest |publisher=Art Zone |date=1838–1907 |url=http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |postscript=An online reproduction of an oil painting done by Romanian artist Nicolae Grigorescu (1838—1907) |accessdate=6 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201190925/http://art-zone.ro/picturi/ng/2/Bordei_in_padure_nicolae_grigorescu.html |archivedate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==House interior==
[[File:Cucuteni House Clay Model.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Clay Model of house interior with two fireplaces]]
Most of the Cucuteni-Trypillia houses were arranged by locating the front door opposite from where the [[fireplace]] sat. Large ceramic pottery containers used to store water and grain were placed next to the fireplace. Other ceramic containers, including the more valuable painted pottery, would also be located near the fireplace. Some of the fine painted pottery for which this culture is known would be used for clothing storage but most of it seems to have been used in rituals.&lt;ref name="Monah"&gt;{{Citation |first=Dan |last=Monah |author-link=Dan Monah &lt;!--http://www.arheo.ro/text/colectiv/Pagini_personale/Monah%20Dan.html--&gt; |editor-last=Dumitroaia |editor-first=Gheorghe |contribution = Religie si arta in cultura Cucuteni (Religion and art in Cucuteni culture) |booktitle=Primul muzeu Cucuteni din Romania |title=Muzeul Cucuteni prima pentru Romania |trans-title=The first Cucuteni museum for Romania |series=Bibliotheca memoriae antiquitatis XV |year=2005 |pages=162–173 |place=Piatra-Neamț, Romania |publisher=Editura Foton |language=Romanian |oclc=319165024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of fireplaces found within each house varied from just one (which was the most common) to several, or even none. Each of the fireplaces found in houses that had more than one would have its own specific use such as one for cooking, one for [[Kiln|firing ceramics]], etc. Most Cucuteni-Trypillia fireplaces were a type of open [[fire pit]] and were usually constructed on the floor by laying down a bed of clay mixed with broken pottery shards and then covering this with a smooth clay-plastered surface.

It is assumed that furniture was extensively used however, due to the climate of this region, wood does not preserve well here. However some of the many miniature clay figurines found at Cucuteni-Trypillia sites were placed sitting or reclining on different pieces of furniture, some of which resemble sofas, chairs, or even ovens. There is also some evidence of furniture being incorporated into the structure of the walls of houses by using woven branches covered with clay.&lt;ref name="Krichevski"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Кричевский  (Krichevski) | first = Евгений Юрьевич (Evgeniye Yurivich) | title = Трипольские площадки ; по раскопкам последних лет (Triploskiye ploshchadki : po raskopkam poslednič let) |trans-title=Trypillian ploshchadki : on the excavations of recent years | journal = Советская археология (''Sovyetskaya arkheologiya'' Soviet Archeology) | volume = 6 | publisher = институтом археологии АН СССР (Archeological Institute A.N.

'''Arctic [[ecology]]''' is the scientific study of the relationships between [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] factors in the [[arctic]], the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (66 33’). This is a region characterized by stressful conditions as a result of extreme cold, low precipitation, a limited growing season (50–90 days) and virtually no sunlight throughout the winter. The Arctic consists of [[taiga]] (or [[boreal forest]]) and [[tundra]] [[biomes]], which also dominate very high elevations, even in the tropics. Sensitive [[ecosystems]] exist throughout the Arctic region, which are being impacted dramatically by [[global warming]]. The earliest inhabitants of the Arctic were the Neanderthals. Since then, many indigenous populations have inhabited the region, which continues to this day. Since the early 1900s, when Vilhjalmur Stefansson led the first major Canadian Arctic Expedition, the Arctic has been a valued area for ecological research.  In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in Point Barrow, Alaska under the contract of the Office of Naval Research. This launched an interest in exploring the Arctic examining animal cycles, permafrost and the interactions between indigenous peoples and the Arctic ecology. During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes, Fikret and Dyanna Jolly. “Adapting to Climate Change: Social- Ecological Resilience in a Canadian Western Arctic Community.” Conservation Ecology 5 (2001).

==Arctic environment==
To understand Arctic ecology, it is important to consider both the terrestrial and oceanic aspects of the region. A few important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost.

[[Sea ice]] is frozen seawater that moves with oceanic currents; it provides important habitat and a resting place for animals, particularly during the winter months. Over time, small pockets of salty seawater get trapped in the ice, and the salt is squeezed out. This causes the ice to become progressively less salty. Sea ice persists throughout the year, but there is less ice available during summer months.

Large portions of the land are also frozen during the year. [[Permafrost]] is substrate that has been frozen for a minimum of 2 years. There are two types of permafrost: discontinuous and continuous. Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas where the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below freezing ({{convert|0|°C|°F|0|disp=or}}); this forms in sheltered locations. In areas where the mean annual soil surface temperature is below {{convert|-5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, continuous permafrost forms. This is not limited to sheltered areas and ranges from a few inches below the surface to over {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} deep. The top layer is called the [[active layer]]. It thaws in the summer and is critical to plant life.

==Biomes==
Moisture and temperature are major physical drivers of natural ecosystems. The more arid and colder conditions found at higher northern latitudes (and high elevations elsewhere) support [[tundra]] and [[boreal forests]]. The water in this region is generally frozen and [[evaporation]] rates are very low. Species diversity, [[nutrient]] availability, precipitation, and average temperatures increase as you move from the tundra to boreal forests and then to [[deciduous]] [[temperate]] ecosystems, which are found south of these Arctic biomes.

===Tundra===
Tundra is found from 55 ° to 80° N latitude in North America, Eurasia and Greenland. It can be found at lower latitudes at high elevations as well. The average temperature is {{convert|-34|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}; during the summer it is less than {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Average precipitation ranges from {{convert|10|to|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and the permafrost is {{convert|400|-|600|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} thick. Plant species supported by tundra have small leaves, are short (74&amp;nbsp;mm to &lt;5 m), tend to be deciduous, have a high ratio of roots to shoots, and are composed mainly of perennial forbs, dwarf shrubs, grasses, lichens, and mosses.

===Boreal===
In comparison to tundra, [[boreal forest]] has a longer and warmer [[growing season]] and supports larger [[species diversity]], an increase in canopy height, vegetation density, and [[biomass]]. Boreal conditions can be found across northern North America and Eurasia. The boreal forests in the interior of the continents grow on top of permafrost due to very cold winters (see [[drunken trees]]), while much of the boreal forest has patchy permafrost or lack permafrost completely. The short (3–4 month) growing season in boreal forests is sustained by greater levels of rainfall (between {{convert|30|and|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) than the tundra receives; This biome is dominated by closed canopy forests of evergreen conifers, especially spruces, fir, pine and tamarack with some diffuse-porous hardwoods. Shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, and lichens are also important species. Stand-replacing crown fires are very important to this biome, occurring as frequently as every 50–100 years in some parts.

==Adaptations to conditions==

===Humans===
Humans living in the Arctic region generally rely on warm clothing and buildings to protect them from the elements. [[Acclimatization]], or the adjustment to new conditions, appears to be the most common form of adaptation to cold environments. No genetic advantage has been found when different people groups or races are compared. There is no evidence that fat is grown in response to cold, although its presence is advantageous. Amazingly, most people living in the Arctic region live a lifestyle very connected to the environment, spending significant time outside and depending heavily on hunting and fishing.

===Other animals===
Animals that are active in the winter have [[adaptations]] for surviving the intense cold. A common example is the presence of strikingly large feet in proportion to body weight. These act like snowshoes, and can be found on animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and caribou. Many of the animals in the Arctic are larger than their temperate counterparts ([[Bergmann’s rule]]), taking advantage of the smaller ratio of surface area to volume that comes with increasing size. This increases the ability to conserve heat. Layers of fat, plumage, and fur are also very effective [[Thermal insulation|insulators]] to help retain warmth and are common in Arctic animals including polar bears and marine mammals. Some animals also have digestive adaptations to improve their ability to digest woody plants either with or without the aid of microbial organisms. This is highly advantageous during the winter months when most soft vegetation is beneath the [[snow pack]].

Not all Arctic animals directly face the rigors of winter. Many migrate to warmer climates at lower latitudes, while others avoid the difficulties of winter by [[hibernation|hibernating]] until spring. Although these options might seem to be easy solutions to the difficulties of surviving an extreme environment, both are very expensive in terms of energy and risk of predation.

===Plants===
One of the most serious problems that plants face is ice crystal formation in the cells, which results in tissue death. Plants have two ways to resist freezing: avoid it or tolerate it. If a plant has taken the avoidance route, it has several different ways to evade freezing. It can build up insulation, have its stem close to the ground, use the insulation from snow cover, and supercool. When [[supercooling]], water is able to remain in its liquid state down to {{convert|-38|°C|°F|disp=or}} (compared to its usual {{convert|0|°C|°F|disp=or}} freezing point). After water reaches {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, it spontaneously freezes and plant tissue is destroyed. This is called the [[nucleation point]]. The nucleation point can be lowered if dissolved [[solution|solute]]s are present.

If a plant has taken the tolerance route, it has several different ways to tolerate freezing. Some plants allow freezing by allowing [[extracellular]], but not [[intracellular]] freezing. Plants let water freeze in extracellular spaces, which creates a high vapor deficit that pulls water vapor out of the cell. This process dehydrates the cell and allows it to survive temperatures well below {{convert|-38|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}.

Another problem associated with extreme cold is cavitation. Ring-porous wood is susceptible to [[cavitation]] because the large pores that are used for water transport easily freeze. [[Cavitation]] is much less of problem in trees with [[ring-diffuse]] wood. In ring-diffuse wood, there is a reduced risk of cavitation, as transport pores are smaller. The trade-off is that these species are not able to transport water as efficiently.

==History of Arctic ecology==

===Early history===
Many different peoples had inhabited present-day [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] by AD 1000. Most of these people lived by hunting, gathering and fishing and never; [[agriculture]] was never done often in the region. Most of these peoples were [[nomad]]ic and their activity was largely seasonal. Early [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic Culture]] influenced the [[Plano cultures|Plano Culture]] by about 8000 BC. The Plano peoples and other cultural groups stemming from the Archaic Culture were notable for their use of spear-throwing technology, which likely made them able to maintain larger populations and expand their access to different foods. By AD 1000, the indigenous Arctic inhabitants have also developed other tools that improved their [[standard of living]], such as [[fire]], which was set to the woodlands to be used to drive [[deer]] to be hunted.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007.  pgs. 25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English scientist [[William Scoresby]] explored the [[Arctic]] and wrote reports on its [[meteorology]], [[zoology]] and [[geophysics]]. Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic in the early nineteenth century. In June 1831, [[James Clark Ross|Sir James Ross]] and a group of [[Eskimo]]s explored the Booth Peninsula in order to determine the exact location of the [[North Magnetic Pole|Magnetic North Pole]]. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338-1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty-five expeditions to the Arctic island of [[Spitsbergen]] in [[Norway]]. As the Swedes expanded their influence in Spitsbergen, they used the area for economic as well as scientific motives through mining and resource extraction. During this time, the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Great Britain]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], and [[Germany]] also started to become more active in Spitsbergen.&lt;ref&gt;Sörlin, Sverker(2006)'Science, Empire, and Enlightenment: Geographies of Northern Field Science', European Review of History: Revue europeenne d'histoire,13:3,455 — 472&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was established under the contract of the Office of Naval Research in Point Barrow, Alaska for the purpose of investigating the physical and biological phenomena unique to the Arctic. In 1948, Dr. Laurence Irving was appointed as the Scientific Director of the Arctic Research Laboratory and put in charge of coordinating various projects. Scientists performed fieldwork to collect data that linked new observations to prior widely accepted knowledge. Through the processes of soil sampling, surveying and photographing landscapes and distributing salmon tags, scientists demonstrated the significance of historical case studies in the study of environmental science. The ability to compare past and present data allowed scientists to understand the causes and effects of ecological changes. Around this time, geographers from McGill University were developing new methods of studying geography in the North. As laboratory research was beginning to trump field research, McGill geographers implemented use of aviation in research, helping knowledge production to occur in the laboratory instead of in the field. Aviation allowed researchers to remould the way they studied the Northern landscape and  indigenous people. Quick and easy travel using aircraft also promoted an integration of the Northern science with Southern community-based science, while changing the scale of ecology being studied. The ability to photograph, and observe the Arctic from an aircraft, provided researchers with a larger scope that allowed them to see a massive amount of space at one time, while also asserting objectivity. A photograph produces evidence, similar to laboratory data, yet it can be understood, circulated and accepted by the common people due to its aesthetic value.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, the Canadian government began taking initiatives to secure the continent, and to assert territorial authority over northern Canada, including the Arctic, which at the time had a dominant American presence. The Canadian government demonstrated their desire for national dominance and security by requiring permission from other nations to utilize their land for military initiatives. They also supported and implemented civilian initiatives including resource development, wildlife conservation and the social and economic development of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. "A Disciplined Geography Aviation, Science, and the Cold War in Northern Canada, 1945-1960." Technology and Culture 50, no. 2 (2009): 265-290.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950’s, ecologist Charles Elton was drawn to the Arctic to study the existence, causes and effects of cycles in animal populations, while ecologists Frank Banfield and John Kelsal studied the factors, especially human impacts, influencing hunting and game populations on animals such as caribou.&lt;ref&gt;Bocking, Stephen. “Science and Spaces in the Northern Environment.” Environmental History 12 (2007): 867-94. Accessed on February 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s and 1970s brought a decrease in the desire to protect the Arctic as it was seen to lack a significant amount of biodiversity. This allowed for scientists to extend further research in the area. In June 1960, the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) was constructed, headed by General Duncan Hallock and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The two predecessor organizations that made up the CRREL were the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory (ACFEL), and the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE). The goal of the CREEL laboratory was to bring together the ACFEL and SIPRE to expand the size and scientific reputation of these organizations, solve problems in cold regions and explore the basic environmental characteristics of cold regions.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmund. CRREL's First 25 Years 1961-1986. Arctic: Technical Publications Writer- Editor, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, study and management of the Arctic was taken over by consulting firms hired and controlled by the government.

===Indigenous peoples and research===
As research in the Arctic region of northern [[North America]] became more frequent, conflicts between researchers and the indigenous peoples started to occur. Recently, the indigenous communities of the North American Arctic have played a direct role in setting ethical standards for research in the region. Scientists have combined the use of laboratory research and field research in the [[Polar region|Polar Regions]] to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its characteristics. Because of scientific research in the north, living in and traveling to the Arctic has become much safer. However, the indigenous peoples viewed the effects of the research and development in the area differently than the scientists did. Since the 1960s, indigenous peoples have been more politically active and began pursuing the recognition of their rights regarding land-claims and self-government institutions. Indigenous communities voiced their concern that this research could lead to undesirable changes to the region’s landscape and economy. Canadian officials responded to their concerns by addressing the responsibility of scientists to consult with indigenous communities before conducting research. In 1977, the Association of Canadian Universities for Northern Studies (ACUNS) was founded at Churchill, Manitoba to improve scientific activity in the region. ACUNS published a document aimed at promoting cooperation between the northern indigenous people and researchers called ''Ethical Principles for the Conduct of Research in the North (1982)''. The document was published in English, French, and Inuktitut so it could be clearly understood among different groups. Relationships between science and society in the Arctic continue to change and adapt based on the politics of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmo, Fae L. and Amanda Graham. "Research in the North American North: Action and Reaction." Arctic 55.4 (2002): 319-328. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human ecology in the Arctic==
Evidence has been found of early humans in the early Würm-Weichsel period hunting large Arctic mammals in the [[Ice Age]] steppes of northern Europe. However, it is still unclear whether these humans were just temporary migrants or inhabitants of Arctic colonies at the time.

[[File:Inupiat Family from Noatak, Alaska, 1929, Edward S. Curtis (restored).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.|Inuit peoples are among the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic.]]

The earliest inhabitants of the polar regions were the [[Neanderthals]], or ''Homo neanderthalensis'', who are considered to be an intermediate stage between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''. The Neandertalers made advances in the basic production of stone, bone antler and flint tools, which archaeologists call a [[Mousterian|Mousterian industry]]. About 40,000 years ago, the Neandertalers quickly disappeared and were replaced by modern humans, ''Homo sapiens sapiens''. Just a few thousand years after the sudden disappearance of the Neandertalers, modern humans occupied all the land that their predecessors had occupied. Some scientists believe that the Neandertalers were overcome by the incoming modern race, commonly called [[Cro-Magnon]] people, while others believe the race disappeared by integrating itself within the new population.

The [[Aurignacian|Aurignacoid]] (upper Paleolithic tool-making) tradition of the modern people is most associated with a feature called [[blade]]-and-core technology. According to Quaternary scientist C.V. Haynes, Arctic [[Cave painting|cave art]] also dates back to the Aurignacoid phase and climaxes during the end of the [[Pleistocene]], which encompasses subjects such as hunting and spirituality. People stemming from the [[Clovis culture]] populated northern regions of Canada and formed what led to the Northern Archaic and Maritime Archaic traditions at the end of the [[Late Glacial Maximum|Late Glacial]] period. Recently, small flint tools and artifacts from about 5,000 years ago were discovered that belonged to a culture now generally called the [[Arctic Small Tool tradition]]. The ASTt people are believed to be the physical and cultural ancestors of modern arctic [[Inuit]].&lt;ref&gt;*Young, Steven B. To the Arctic: An Introduction to the Far Northern World. New York: Wiley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, as European trade interests among the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay Company expanded into northern Canada, arctic indigenous peoples began to become more involved in the trade process. Increasingly more European goods, including kettles, iron tools, tobacco, alcohol, and guns, were bought and traded by the indigenous peoples within their communities. European imports in exchange for more primitive, native resources and tools made life for the indigenous more efficient and comfortable. Native societies in the early eighteenth century also began to buy guns from European traders, and these guns made hunting easier. They were also occasionally used in native etiquette, medicinal, and religious practices. Because of the natives' increased hunting efficiency, scarcity of resources became an issue in the region, a version of what American human ecologist Garrett Hardin called "the tragedy of the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, Graeme. Canada and Arctic North America: An Environmental History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2007. pgs. 64-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic peoples value spiritual connections with their environment, which leads to a spiritual understanding along with their scientific understanding. Their lifestyles, therefore, reflect not only activity that is economically efficient but also that which is in line with their spiritual beliefs and values. The Alaskan Athabascan people, for example, spiritually value the [[moose]]. State law acknowledges this spiritual belief and allows people to take moose for [[potlatch]]es outside of the usual hunting season. The indigenous peoples of the Arctic drawn from scientific, emotional and spiritual sources of information, which often does not agree with non-indigenous scientific observations.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

==Conservation and environmental issues==
Suspected worldwide anthropogenic climate change has been particularly evident in the Arctic. This is evident by warmer temperatures, melting glaciers, shorter durations of sea ice and changing weather and storm patterns. Scientists are especially concerned about four aspects of the continued projected warming of the Arctic.

First, [[thermohaline circulation]] is a series of underwater oceanic currents fueled by the salinity and temperature of seawater. Melting ice sheets would introduce vast amounts of fresh water into the North Atlantic, causing a change in density which could disrupt the currents. If this circulation slowed or stopped, the climates of northern Europe and North America would be strongly impacted.

Second, the melting of glaciers and sea ice is disrupting the lifestyles of a wide range of species. [[Polar bear]]s live on the sea ice for much of the year and find their food in the surrounding ocean waters. Recent projections suggest that global warming will lead to the disappearance of most summer sea ice within 40 years.

A third practical concern is the melting of permafrost due to climate change. Degradation of this permafrost is leading to major ground surface subsidence and pounding. The ground is literally melting away in many regions of the Arctic. The locations of towns and communities that have been inhabited for centuries are now in jeopardy. A condition known as drunken tree syndrome is being caused by this melting. Ground water and river runoffs are being negatively impacted as well. Although warming conditions might increase {{chem|CO|2}} uptake for photosynthetic organisms in some places, scientists are concerned that melting permafrost will also release large amounts of carbon locked in permafrost. Higher temperatures increase soil decomposition and if soil decomposition becomes higher than net primary production, global atmospheric carbon dioxide will in turn increase. Atmospheric sinks in the water table are also being reduced as the permafrost melts and decreases the height of the water table in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter_C._Oechel|Oechel, Walter]] and George Vourlitis. “The Effects of Climate Charge on Land—Atmosphere Feedbacks in Arctic Tundra Regions.” Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 9 (1994): 324-329. Accessed on February 23, 2014. Doi: 10.1016/0169-5347(94)90152-X.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the impacts of the release of carbon from the permafrost could be amplified by high levels of [[deforestation]] in the Boreal forests in Eurasia and Canada. This biome currently serves as a large [[carbon sink]], [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, over half of the original forest has been or in danger of harvesting, largely for export. Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which facilitates increased warming of the earth.

==Further exploration==
In a [[meta analysis]] of the published work in aquatic ecosystems since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to be still unexplored. In addition, the North Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and Pacific Northwest), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world’s aquatic biodiversity. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in terrestrial ecosystems, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially marine ecosystems where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases (Moustakas &amp; Karakassis 2005). Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Arctic Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world’s aquatic biodiversity.

[[File:Global Climate Model.png|thumb|right|350px|Climate models are systems of [[differential equation]]s based on the basic laws of [[physics]], [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], and [[chemistry]]. To “run” a model, scientists divide the planet into a 3-dimensional grid, apply the basic equations, and evaluate the results. Atmospheric models calculate [[winds]], [[heat transfer]], [[radiation]], [[relative humidity]], and surface [[hydrology]] within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points.]]
'''Climate models''' use [[quantitative method]]s to simulate the interactions of the important drivers of climate, including [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[ocean]]s, [[land surface]] and [[cryosphere|ice]]. They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to projections of future [[climate]].

All climate models take account of incoming [[energy]] from the sun as short wave [[electromagnetic radiation]], chiefly [[Visible spectrum|visible]] and short-wave (near) [[infrared]], as well as outgoing long wave (far) [[infrared]] electromagnetic. Any imbalance results in a [[First law of thermodynamics|change in temperature]].

Models vary in complexity:
* A simple [[radiant heat]] transfer model treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* This can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models) and/or horizontally
* Finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] '''[[global climate model]]s''' solve the full equations for mass and [[energy transfer|energy]] transfer and radiant exchange.
* Box models can treat flows across and within ocean basins. 
* Other types of modelling can be interlinked, such as [[land use]], allowing researchers to predict the interaction between climate and [[ecosystems]].

==Box models==

'''Box models''' are simplified versions of complex systems, reducing them to boxes (or [[reservoir]]s) linked by fluxes. The boxes are assumed to be mixed homogeneously. Within a given box, the concentration of any [[chemical species]] is therefore uniform. However, the abundance of a species within a given box may vary as a function of time due to the input to (or loss from) the box or due to the production, consumption or decay of this species within the box.

Simple box models, i.e. box model with a small number of boxes whose properties (e.g. their volume) do not change with time, are often useful to derive analytical formulas describing the dynamics and steady-state abundance of a species. More complex box models are usually solved using numerical techniques.

Box models are used extensively to model environmental systems or ecosystems and in studies of [[ocean circulation]] and the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name=Sarmiento1984&gt;{{cite journal

== Zero-dimensional models ==

A very simple model of the [[radiative equilibrium]] of the Earth is

:&lt;math&gt;(1-a)S \pi r^2 = 4 \pi r^2 \epsilon \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

where

* the left hand side represents the incoming energy from the Sun
* the right hand side represents the outgoing energy from the Earth, calculated from the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] assuming a model-fictive temperature, ''T'', sometimes called the 'equilibrium temperature of the Earth', that is to be found,

and

* ''S'' is the [[solar constant]] – the incoming solar radiation per unit area—about 1367 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Earth]]'s average [[albedo]], measured to be 0.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goode |first=P. R. |year=2001 |title=Earthshine Observations of the Earth’s Reflectance |journal=Geophys. Res. Lett. |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1671–4 |doi=10.1029/2000GL012580 |bibcode=2001GeoRL..28.1671G|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientists Watch Dark Side of the Moon to Monitor Earth's Climate |url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/prrl/prrl0113.html |work=American Geophysical Union | date=April 17, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''r'' is Earth's radius—approximately 6.371&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;m
* ''[[pi|π]]'' is the mathematical constant (3.141...)
* ''&lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]]—approximately 5.67&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; J·K&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''&lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;'' is the effective [[emissivity]] of earth, about 0.612

The constant ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be factored out, giving

:&lt;math&gt;(1-a)S = 4 \epsilon \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the temperature,
:&lt;math&gt;T = \sqrt[4]{ \frac{(1-a)S}{4 \epsilon \sigma}}&lt;/math&gt;

This yields an apparent effective average earth temperature of {{convert|288|K|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp_docs/lithographs/CERES_litho.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218204711/http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp_docs/lithographs/CERES_litho.pdf |date=February 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the above equation represents the effective ''radiative'' temperature of the Earth (including the clouds and atmosphere). The use of effective emissivity and albedo account for the [[greenhouse effect]].

This very simple model is quite instructive, and the only model that could fit on a page. For example, it easily determines the effect on average earth temperature of changes in solar constant or change of albedo or effective earth emissivity.

The average emissivity of the earth is readily estimated from available data. The emissivities of terrestrial surfaces are all in the range of 0.96 to 0.99&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icess.ucsb.edu/modis/EMIS/html/seawater.html|title=Seawater Samples - Emissivities|work=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/JCLI3720.1 |vauthors=Jin M, Liang S |title=An Improved Land Surface Emissivity Parameter for Land Surface Models Using Global Remote Sensing Observations |journal=J.

Clouds, however, which cover about half of the earth's surface, have an average emissivity of about 0.5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=T.R. Shippert |author2=S.A. Clough |author3=P.D. Brown |author4=W.L. Smith |author5=R.O. Knuteson |author6=S.A.

Gorelik |author2=V. Sterljadkin |author3=E. Kadygrov |author4=A.

This simple model readily determines the effect of changes in solar output or change of earth albedo or effective earth emissivity on average earth temperature. It says nothing, however about what might cause these things to change. Zero-dimensional models do not address the temperature distribution on the earth or the factors that move energy about the earth.

== Radiative-convective models ==

The zero-dimensional model above, using the solar constant and given average earth temperature, determines the effective earth emissivity of long wave radiation emitted to space. This can be refined in the vertical to a one-dimensional radiative-convective model, which considers two processes of energy transport:

* upwelling and downwelling radiative transfer through atmospheric layers that both absorb and emit infrared radiation
* upward transport of heat by convection (especially important in the lower [[troposphere]]).

The radiative-convective models have advantages over the simple model: they can determine the effects of varying [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations on effective emissivity and therefore the surface temperature. But added parameters are needed to determine local emissivity and albedo and address the factors that move energy about the earth.

== Higher-dimension models ==

The zero-dimensional model may be expanded to consider the energy transported horizontally in the atmosphere. This kind of model may well be [[Zonal and meridional|zonally]] averaged. This model has the advantage of allowing a rational dependence of local albedo and emissivity on temperature – the poles can be allowed to be icy and the equator warm – but the lack of true dynamics means that horizontal transports have to be specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shodor.org/master/environmental/general/energy/application.html|title=Energy Balance Models|work=shodor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EMICs (Earth-system models of intermediate complexity) ==
{{Main|Earth systems model of intermediate complexity}}
Depending on the nature of questions asked and the pertinent time scales, there are, on the one extreme,  conceptual, more inductive models, and, on the other extreme, [[general circulation model]]s operating at the highest spatial and temporal resolution currently feasible. Models of intermediate complexity bridge the gap. One example is the Climber-3 model. Its atmosphere is a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of half a day;  the ocean is MOM-3 ([[Modular Ocean Model]]) with a 3.75° × 3.75° grid and 24 vertical levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pik-potsdam.de/emics/|title=emics1|work=pik-potsdam.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GCMs (global climate models or general circulation models) ==
{{Main|General Circulation Model}}

General Circulation Models (GCMs) discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time. Unlike simpler models, GCMs divide the atmosphere and/or oceans into grids of discrete "cells", which represent computational units. Unlike simpler models which make mixing assumptions, processes internal to a cell—such as convection—that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly are parameterised at the cell level, while other functions govern the interface between cells.

Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere and impose [[sea surface temperature]]s as boundary conditions. Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs, e.g. [[HadCM3]], [[EdGCM]], [[GFDL CM2.X]], ARPEGE-Climat)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmgec/site_engl/arpege/arpege_en.html ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215849/http://www.cnrm.meteo.fr/gmgec/site_engl/arpege/arpege_en.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; combine the two models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the [[NOAA]] [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html|title=NOAA 200th Top Tens: Breakthroughs: The First Climate Model|work=noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; AOGCMs represent the pinnacle of complexity in climate models and internalise as many processes as possible. However, they are still under development and uncertainties remain.  They may be coupled to models of other processes, such as the [[carbon cycle]], so as to better model feedback effects. Such integrated multi-system models are sometimes referred to as either "earth system models" or "global climate models."

== Research and development ==

There are three major types of institution where climate models are developed, implemented and used:

* National meteorological services. Most national weather services have a [[climatology]] section.
* Universities. Relevant departments include atmospheric sciences, meteorology, climatology, and geography.
* National and international research laboratories. Examples include the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR, in [[Boulder, Colorado]], USA), the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] (GFDL, in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], USA), the [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]] (in [[Exeter]], UK), the [[Max Planck Institute for Meteorology]] in Hamburg, Germany, or the [[Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement|Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement]] (LSCE), France, to name but a few.

The [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), hosted by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO), coordinates research activities on climate modelling worldwide.

A 2012 [[U.S. National Research Council]] report discussed how the large and diverse U.S. climate modeling enterprise could evolve to become more unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report, ''A National Strategy for Advancing Climate Modeling'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Report/National-Strategy-Advancing-Climate/13430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiencies could be gained by developing a common software infrastructure shared by all U.S. climate researchers, and holding an annual climate modeling forum, the report found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report-in-Brief, ''A National Strategy for Advancing Climate Modeling'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4291-Climate-Modeling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural schema theory''' holds that human beings employ classification to understand members of other cultures, and add new data to previously available categories.&lt;ref&gt;Shahghasemi, E. 2017. Cultural Schema Theory. The International Encyclopedia of Intercultural Communication. 1–9.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118783665.ieicc0019/full&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural schemas for [[social interaction]] are [[cognitive]] structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in a person's cultural environment. Schemas are generalized collections of knowledge of past experiences that are organized into related knowledge groups; they guide our behaviours in familiar situations. Cultural schemas do not differ from other schemas, except that they are shared by certain cultural groups rather than individuals (Garro, 2000). Schemas unique to individuals are created from personal experiences, whereas those shared by individuals are created from various types of common experiences (Garro, 2000). Cultural schema theory proposes that when we interact with members of the same [[culture]] in certain situations many times, or talk about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in our brain (Nishida, 1999).

== History ==
Cultural schema theory may be a relatively new theory, but neither schema nor cultural schema are new concepts.

The idea of schemas existing as ideal types in the mind dates back all the way back to [[Plato]] (see also [[Schema (disambiguation)|Schema]] and [[Schema (psychology)]]) . In the 19th century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] developed the idea that every person's experiences are gathered in memory, forming higher order concepts. In the 1920s [[Jean Piaget]]'s work investigated schemas in infants. In the 1930s [[Frederic Bartlett]] tested memory for schemas. From the 1970s to the 1990s, many researchers obtained loads of evidence showing that people's [[behaviors]] are deeply embedded to what they store in their brains. Through these studies researchers learned that [[human behavior]] relies heavily on past experiences and the [[knowledge]] stored in one's brain.

Research also revealed that schemas operate at many different levels. The experiences which are unique to individuals allow them to acquire personal schemas.  Societal schemas may emerge from a group's collective [[knowledge]] and are represented across the minds in a [[society]], enabling people to think as if they are one mind (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002). However, when one's cultural environment provides experiences to which every member of that culture is exposed, their experiences allow every member to acquire cultural schemas (Nishida, 1999). Cultural schemas are [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] structures which enable individuals to store perceptual and conceptual information about their [[culture]] and interpret cultural experiences and expressions. If people are not equipped with the appropriate cultural schema, they may not be able to make sense of culturally unfamiliar situations (Malcolm &amp; Sharifian, 2002).

== How cultural schemas develop ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

When one interacts with members of the same [[culture]] over and over again, or talks about certain information with them many times, cultural schemas are created and stored in one's brain. Subsequent similar instances cause the cultural schema to become more organized, abstract, and compact. As this occurs, communication becomes much easier. Nishida (1999) simply explains that experience is the force which creates cultural schemas. As people have more experiences their developing cultural schemas become more tightly organized. The information not only becomes more complex, but more useful among members of a culture, alike or different. Beyond the [[cognitive]] activity of cultural schemas is the complex pattern which occurs in the [[brain]].

When humans acquire and retain information from their surrounding environments, [[neural]] circuits are generated. Consequently, information processing experience is stored in the [[long-term memory]]. Memory representation or [[neural]] circuits created in the brain as a result of information processing are assumed to be schemas {{dubious|date=July 2013}}. Thus, schemas provide a foundation in the brain which helps to predict what is to be expected and looked for in certain situations.

Not all schemas are uniformly important. High-level schemas are internalized and emotionally salient; likewise, when a schema is only weakly related to a person's self it becomes emotionally empty and irrelevant (Lipset, 1993).

== Types of cultural schemas for social interactions ==

Cultural schemas for social interactions are cognitive structures that contain knowledge for face-to-face interactions in one's cultural environment. Nishida (1999) points out the eight primary types for generating human behavior for social interactions. These eight schemas are also referred to as Primary Social Interaction (PSI) schemas.

# ''Fact-and-concept schemas:'' These are pieces of general information about facts, such as Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States, and concepts, such as bicycles are vehicles that have two wheels, a seat, and pedals.
# ''Person schemas:'' These are knowledge about different types of people, specifically [[personality traits]]; for example, Barb is shy or Dave is outgoing. Since people have some representation or idea of what being shy or outgoing is, they tend to classify others, such as Barb and Dave, into their dominant personality traits.
# ''Self schemas:'' These contain people's knowledge of how they see themselves and knowledge of how others see them.
# ''Role schemas:'' These are knowledge about social roles that denote expected sets of behaviors of people in particular social positions.
# ''Context schemas:'' These contain information about the situations and appropriate settings of behavioral parameters. Information in context schemas includes predictions about appropriate actions to take in order to achieve goals in the respective context. Information also includes suggestions for reasonable problem-solving strategies. It is important to note that context schemas are triggered before other schemas {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.
# ''Procedure schemas:'' These are knowledge about the appropriate sequence of events in common situations. This includes the specific steps to take and the appropriate behavioral rules for the events. The use of procedure schemas causes people to take certain actions some way.
# ''Strategy schemas:'' These are knowledge about problem-solving strategies.
# ''Emotion schemas:'' These contain information about affect and evaluation stored in long-term [[memory]]. This is accessed when other schemas are activated. [[Emotion]] schemas develop through social interactions throughout a person's life. This schema is relatively new {{clarify|date=July 2013}}. Researchers believed it was an important additive because emotions play important roles in human social interactions.

== Application to cross-cultural adaptation ==
The term cross-cultural adaptation refers to the complex process through which an individual acquires an increasing level of the communication skills of the host culture and of relational development with host nationals. Simply put, cross-cultural adaptation is the transformation of a person's own PSI schemas into those of the host culture and acquisition of new PSI schemas in the host culture s/he is residing in. A number of different people may b e subject to cross-cultural adaptation, including [[immigrants]], [[refugees]], [[business people]], [[diplomats]], [[foreign workers]], and [[students]]. However, this entry specifically applies cultural schema theory to [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s' cross cultural adaptation. Sojourners generally spend a few years in another culture while intending to return to their home country. Business people, diplomats, students, and foreign workers can all be classified as sojourners. In order to better explain sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation, [[axioms]] are used to express causal, correlational, or [[teleological]] relationships. [[Axioms]] also help to explain the basic assumptions of the Cultural Schema Theory (Nishida, 1999).

=== Sojourners' axioms ===
Nishida (1999) describes the following nine axioms:

'''Axiom 1:''' The more often a person repeats a schema-based [[behavior]] in his or her culture, the more likely the cultural schema will be stored in the person's memory.

'''Axiom 2:''' Sojourners' failure to recognize the actions and behaviors that are relevant to meaningful interactions in the host culture are mainly due to their lack of the PSI schemas of the culture.

'''Axiom 3:''' The acquisition of the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation to the culture.

'''Axiom 4:''' The PSI schemas of a person's own culture are interrelated with each other, forming a network of cultural schemas to generate behaviors that are appropriate in the culture. Experience in the host culture causes a change in one's cultural schema. This causes further changes in all other cultural schemas and results in a total change in behavior.

'''Axiom 5:''' The acquisition of information about interrelationships among the PSI schemas of the host culture is a necessary condition for sojourners' cross-cultural adaptation.

'''Axiom 6:''' People use both schema-driven and data-driven processing to perceive new information, depending on the situation and their motivations.

'''Axiom 7:''' If one has well-organized cultural schemas, schematically salient information is more likely to be processed through the schemas, whereas ambiguous information will either direct a search for the relevant data to complete the stimulus more fully, or it will be filled in with default options of the schemas.

'''Axiom 8:''' Sojourners who lack the PSI schemas of the host culture are more likely to employ data-driven processing, which requires effort and attention.

'''Axiom 9:''' In the host culture, sojourners encounter truly novel situations where they experience [[cognitive]] [[uncertainty]] and [[anxiety]] because of the lack of the PSI schemas in the situations.

'''Axiom 10:''' In the host culture, sojourners experience the stages of self-regulation and self-direction. In the stage of self-regulation, they try to resolve ambiguities and to establish integration of information using their native-culture schemas by gradually modifying them. In the stage of self-direction, on the other hand, they actively try to reorganize their native [[culture]] schemas or to generate host culture schemas in order to adapt to the host-culture environment.

=== Real-world example – a sojourner's experience ===
As discussed above, [[:wikt:sojourner|sojourner]]s are people who live in a culture other than their own with the intent of one day returning home. For sojourner Gillian Gibbons' situation, the cultural schema theory is highly applicable. Ms. Gibbons, a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[school teacher]], left [[Liverpool, England]] in August 2007 to teach a group of six- and seven-year-olds at Unity School in [[Khartoum, Sudan]]. Shortly after her arrival, Ms. Gibbons class was due to study the habitat and behavior of bears. Upon her request, a student brought in a [[teddy bear]] to serve as a case study. Students were invited to vote on a name for the bear. After considering the names [[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]] and [[Hassan (name)|Hassan]], 20 of the 23 children voted in favor of the name [[Muhammad]]. What seemed like a harmless children's learning tool took a turn for the worse on November 25, 2007, when Ms. Gibbons was arrested at her home inside the school premises; Sudanese police claimed a number of parents complained to Sudan's [[Ministry of Education (Sudan)|Ministry of Education]] about the bear. Charges against Ms. Gibbons were prepared under article 125 of Sudanese [[criminal law]] which covers insults against faith and religions.  Ms Gibbons' particular crime: insulting Islam's [[Prophet Muhammad]]. In [[Islam]], insulting the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is considered a grave offense.  Ms. Gibbons' was held in a [[Khartoum]] jail facing a maximum penalty of 40 lashes and 6 months in jail. Ms. Gibbons was found guilty of insulting Islam and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation from Sudan after her release. Sudanese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] granted her a pardon after she served nine days in jail due to pressure from the British government. She immediately returned to [[England]] upon her release. While colleagues, friends, and family regarded the whole situation as a misunderstanding, many local Sudanese disagreed. Hundreds of protestors gathered outside of the presidential palace to denounce Ms. Gibbons. Some protestors waved ceremonial swords, some voiced anger at the Sudanese government for not treating her more severely, some distributed leaflets which condemned her as an infidel and accused her of polluting children's mentality by her actions. At the edge of extreme were those who called for her execution (BBC News, 2007; CNN, 2007; New York Times, 2007; TIME, 2007; Times Online, 2007). This highly publicized incident can be explained quite well by the cultural schema theory, particularly by discussing Ms. Gibbons' status as a sojourner in an unfamiliar culture. Axiom number three and axiom number nine apply quite well to Ms. Gibbons. As a sojourner, the acquisition of host [[culture]] PSI schemas would be necessary in order for the sojourner's cross-cultural adaptation to occur. Ms. Gibbons may have lived in Sudan, but she lived inside the walls of Unity School. According to [[BBC News]] (2007), once inside the walls of Unity School one would think s/he was at standing on the grounds of an Oxbridge University. This private school with children of well-to-do parents is much different than the rest of Sudan. Ms. Gibbons did not need to acquire the PSI schemas of the host culture because her native PSI schemas worked equally well inside the walls of Unity School. Had Ms. Gibbons been constantly made aware of the local PSI schemas (naming an animal after the [[Prophet Muhammad]] is unacceptable) she may have adapted and not allowed the children to name the teddy bear Muhammad. Naming a teddy bear was not a novel situation to her as a children's school teacher, but she was not in England. After the bear's naming she certainly encountered a novel situation where she experienced cognitive uncertainty and anxiety because of her lack of the PSI schemas in the situation. Hence the difficulties of cross-cultural adaptation for sojourners like Ms. Gibbons. They do not intend to stay and thus will not adapt/experience the stages of axioms which will best prepare them to appropriately fit in.

== Contrasting theory ==
Cultural Schema Theory is often compared and contrasted with the [[Cultural consensus theory|Cultural Consensus Theory]]. Both theories present distinct perspectives about the nature of individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture.  Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand [[intracultural]] variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a cultural test, with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural information pool (Garro, 2000).

== Further use and development of the theory ==
Simply put, cultural schema theory can be described as cultural-specific world knowledge (Razi, 2002). As mentioned above, the concept of Cultural Schemas is not new, but the theory is.  Future studies must generate theorems and further tests must be conducted in order to better formulate theory itself and the axioms it proposes. Once this is complete the theory can be used in cross-cultural training purposes in order to facilitate individuals' adaptation to their respective host-culture environments (Nishida, 1999). There has been efforts to make this task done. For example, Ehsan Shahghasemi and [[D. Ray Heisey]] (2009) introduce the notion of "cross cultual schemata" as "abstract mental structures that one makes according to his/her past experiences or shared knowledge about the members of other cultures and thus makes them more understandable."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2009v18n1/10%20Ehsan%20Shaghasemi%20&amp;%20D.%20Ray%20Heisey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13845">'''Domain engineering''', also called '''product line engineering''', is the entire process of reusing [[domain knowledge]] in the production of new [[software]] systems. It is a key concept in systematic [[code reuse|software reuse]]. A key idea in systematic software reuse is the [[domain (software engineering)|domain]]. Most organizations work in only a few domains. They repeatedly build similar systems within a given domain with variations to meet different customer needs. Rather than building each new system variant from scratch, significant savings may be achieved by reusing portions of previous systems in the domain to build new ones.

The process of identifying domains, bounding them, and discovering commonalities and variabilities among the systems in the domain is called [[domain analysis]]. This information is captured in models that are used in the domain implementation phase to create artifacts such as reusable components, a [[domain-specific language]], or application generators that can be used to build new systems in the domain.

==Purpose==
Domain engineering is designed to improve the quality of developed software products through reuse of software artifacts.&lt;ref name="Frakes 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Frakes|Kang|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain engineering shows that most developed software systems are not new systems but rather variants of other systems within the same field.&lt;ref name="Frakes 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Frakes|Kang|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, through the use of domain engineering, businesses can maximize profits and reduce time-to-market by using the concepts and implementations from prior software systems and applying them to the target system.&lt;ref name="Frakes 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cza 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in cost is evident even during the implementation phase. One study showed that the use of domain-specific languages allowed code size, in both number of [[method (computer science)|methods]] and number of [[debugging symbol|symbols]], to be reduced by over 50%, and the total number of [[lines of code]] to be reduced by nearly 75%.&lt;ref name="Batory 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Batory|Johnson|MacDonald|von Heeder|2002|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain engineering focuses on capturing knowledge gathered during the [[software engineering]] process. By developing reusable artifacts, components can be reused in new software systems at low cost and high quality.&lt;ref name="Cza 20"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this applies to all [[software development process|phases of the software development cycle]], domain engineering also focuses on the three primary phases: analysis, design, and implementation, paralleling application engineering.&lt;ref name="Cza 21"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces not only a set of [[source code|software implementation]] components relevant to the domain, but also reusable and configurable requirements and designs.&lt;ref name="Harsu 8"&gt;{{harvnb|Harsu|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the growth of data on the Web and the growth of the [[Internet of Things]], a domain engineering approach is becoming relevant to other disciplines as well.&lt;ref name="ReinhartzBerger 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Reinhartz-Berger|Sturm|Clark|Cohen|Bettin|2013|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of deep chains of Web services highlights that the service concept is relative. Web services developed and operated by one organization can be utilized as part of a platform by another organization. As services may be used in different contexts and hence require different configurations, the design of families of services may benefit from a domain engineering approach.

==Phases==
[[File:Domain Engineering vs Application Engineering.svg|Domain engineering as compared to application engineering. The outputs of each phase of domain engineering feed into both subsequent phases of domain engineering as well as corresponding phases in application engineering.|thumb|330px]]
Domain engineering, like application engineering, consists of three primary phases: analysis, design, and implementation. However, where software engineering focuses on a ''single'' system, domain engineering focuses on a ''family'' of systems.&lt;ref name="Cza 21" /&gt; A good domain model serves as a reference to resolve ambiguities later in the process, a repository of knowledge about the domain characteristics and definition, and a specification to developers of products which are part of the domain.&lt;ref name="Falbo 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Falbo|Guizzardi|Duarte|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain analysis===
Domain analysis is used to define the domain, collect information about the domain, and produce a [[domain model]].&lt;ref name="Cza 23"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[feature model]]s (initially conceived as part of the [[feature-oriented domain analysis]] method), domain analysis aims to identify the common points in a domain and the varying points in the domain.&lt;ref name="Cza 38"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of domain analysis, the development of ''configurable'' requirements and architectures, rather than ''static'' configurations which would be produced by a traditional application engineering approach, is possible.&lt;ref name="Kang 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Kang|Lee|Kim|Kim|2004|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain analysis is significantly different from [[requirements engineering]], and as such, traditional approaches to deriving requirements are ineffective for development of configurable requirements as would be present in a domain model. To effectively apply domain engineering, reuse must be considered in the earlier phases of the [[software development life cycle]]. Through the use of selection of features from developed feature models, consideration of reuse of technology is performed very early and can be adequately applied throughout the development process.&lt;ref name="Kang 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Kang|Lee|Kim|Kim|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domain analysis is derived primarily from artifacts produced from past experience in the domain.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt; Existing systems, their artifacts (such as [[design document]]s, [[software requirements specification|requirement documents]] and [[user manual]]s), [[technical standard|standards]], and customers are all potential sources of domain analysis input.&lt;ref name="Cza 23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kang 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Kang|Lee|Kim|Kim|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike requirements engineering, domain analysis does not solely consist of collection and formalization of information; a creative component exists as well. During the domain analysis process, engineers aim to extend knowledge of the domain beyond what is already known and to categorize the domain into similarities and differences to enhance reconfigurability.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt;

Domain analysis primarily produces a [[domain model]], representing the common and varying properties of systems within the domain.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt; The domain model assists with the creation of architectures and components in a configurable manner by acting as a foundation upon which to design these components.&lt;ref name="Frakes 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Frakes|Kang|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An effective domain model not only includes the varying and consistent features in a domain, but also defines the vocabulary used in the domain and defines concepts, ideas and phenomena, within the system.&lt;ref name="Cza 23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cza 84"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feature models decompose concepts into their required and optional features to produce a fully formalized set of configurable requirements.&lt;ref name="Cza 86"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain design===
Domain design takes the domain model produced during the domain analysis phase and aims to produce a generic architecture to which all systems within the domain can conform.&lt;ref name="Cza 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that application engineering uses the [[functional requirement|functional]] and [[non-functional requirement]]s to produce a design, the domain design phase of domain engineering takes the configurable requirements developed during the domain analysis phase and produces a configurable, standardized solution for the family of systems. Domain design aims to produce architectural patterns which solve a problem common across the systems within the domain, despite differing requirement configurations.&lt;ref name="Cza 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the development of patterns during domain design, engineers must also take care to identify the scope of the pattern and the level to which context is relevant to the pattern. Limitation of context is crucial: too much context results in the pattern not being applicable to many systems, and too little context results in the pattern being insufficiently powerful to be useful.&lt;ref name="Buschmann 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Buschmann|Henney|Schmidt|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A useful pattern must be both frequently recurring and of high quality.&lt;ref name="Buschmann 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Buschmann|Henney|Schmidt|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of domain design is to satisfy as many domain requirements as possible while retaining the flexibility offered by the developed feature model. The architecture should be sufficiently flexible to satisfy all of the systems within the domain while rigid enough to provide a solid framework upon which to base the solution.&lt;ref name="Cza 28"&gt;{{harvnb|Czarnecki|Eisenecker|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domain implementation===
Domain implementation is the creation of a process and tools for efficiently generating a customized program in the domain.

==Criticism==
Lately, domain engineering has been criticized for focusing too much on "engineering-for-reuse" or "engineering-with-reuse" of generic software features rather than concentrating on "engineering-for-use" such that an individual's world-view, language, or context is integrated into the design of software.&lt;ref name="Mettler"&gt;{{harvnb|Mettler|2017|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9360">'''Drive by wire''', '''DbW''', '''by-wire''', '''Steer-by-wire''', or '''x-by-wire''' technology in the automotive industry is the use of electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages. This technology replaces the traditional mechanical [[control system]]s with electronic control systems using [[electromechanical]] [[actuators]] and [[human-machine interface]]s such as pedal and steering feel emulators. Components such as the [[steering column]], intermediate shafts, pumps, hoses, belts, coolers and [[vacuum servo]]s and master cylinders are eliminated from the vehicle. This is similar to the [[fly-by-wire]] systems used widely in the aviation industry.

Examples include [[electronic throttle control]] and [[brake-by-wire]].

== Advantages ==

Because the steering wheel can be bypassed as an input device, safety can be improved by providing computer controlled intervention of vehicle controls with systems such as [[electronic stability control]] (ESC), [[Autonomous cruise control system|adaptive cruise control]] and [[Lane departure warning system|Lane Assist Systems]]. Some systems, with appropriate modification, allow for control by laptops or even game controllers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/i-used-a-ps4-controller-to-drive-a-real-car-remotely-and-it-was-awesome|title=I used a PS4 controller to drive a car|publisher=TechRadar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ergonomic]]s can be improved by the amount of force and range of movement required by the driver and by greater flexibility in the location of controls.  This flexibility also significantly expands the number of options for the vehicle's design.

Eliminating mechanical linkages can provide savings in weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-print.pag?docid=CEHR-54YTXP|title=Are You Ready for Drive-by-Wire?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drive-by-wire is a key enabling technology for autonomous vehicle development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://levelfivejobs.com/glossary/drive-by-wire/|title=Drive by Wire definition|publisher=Level Five Jobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Drive by wire systems can be "[[car hacking|hacked]]", and their control faulted or shut off, by either wired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/07/24/hackers-reveal-nasty-new-car-attacks-with-me-behind-the-wheel-video/|title=Hackers Reveal Nasty New Car Attacks--With Me Behind The Wheel (Video)|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or wireless&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/|title=Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway—With Me in It|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; connections.

== Uses in passenger cars ==

=== Throttle by wire ===
{{Main|Electronic throttle control}}
This system helps accomplish vehicle propulsion by means of an electronic throttle without any cables from the accelerator pedal to the throttle valve of the engine. In electric vehicles, this system controls the electric motors by sensing the accelerator pedal input and sending commands to the power inverter modules.

=== Brake by wire ===
{{Main|Brake by wire}}
A pure brake by wire system would eliminate the need for hydraulics completely by using motors to actuate calipers, in comparison to the currently existing technology where the system is designed to provide braking effort by building hydraulic pressure in the brake lines.

=== Shift by wire ===
{{Main|Shift by wire}}
The direction of motion of the vehicle (Forward, Reverse) is set by commanding the actuators inside the transmission through electronic commands based on the current input from the driver (Park, Reverse, Neutral or Drive).

=== Steer by wire ===
[[File:Show case of Uniti steer-by-wire system at the 2016 CeBit.jpg|thumb|European Commissioner [[Günther Oettinger]] trying [http://www.uniti.earth/ Uniti] steer-by-wire system at the 2016 [[CeBIT|CeBit]] Edition.]]&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Show case of Uniti steer-by-wire system at the 2016 CeBit.jpg|thumb|[[Günther Oettinger|Günter Oettinger]], European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, tried [[Uniti (car)|Uniti]] steer-by-wire system at the 2016 [[CeBIT|CeBit]] edition.]] --&gt;
This kind of system will provide steering control to a car with fewer mechanical components/linkages between the steering wheel and the wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saha.suvankar.tripod.com/id5.html|title=Steer By Wire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The control of the wheels' direction will be established through electric motor(s) which are actuated by electronic control units monitoring the steering wheel inputs from the driver. Such a system is illegal in most jurisdictions for passenger or commercial vehicles.

The first production vehicle to implement this was the Infiniti Q50.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/05/al_drivebywire/|title=Take a Look Inside the First Steer-by-Wire Car|first=Matt|last=Jancer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after negative comments they retrofitted the traditional hydraulic steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themotorreport.com.au/59723/2016-infiniti-q50-to-get-old-fashioned-hydraulic-power-steering-report|title=2016 Infiniti Q50 To Get 'Old Fashioned' Hydraulic Power Steering: Report|first=Tony|last=O'Kane|date=2 September 2014|website=themotorreport.com.au|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its implementation in road vehicles is limited by concerns over reliability although it has been demonstrated in several concept vehicles such as ThyssenKrupp Presta Steering's Mercedes-Benz [[Unimog]], General Motors' [[Hy-wire]] and [[General Motors Sequel|Sequel]], Saabs Prometheus and the [[Mazda Ryuga]]. A rear wheel SbW system by Delphi called [[Quadrasteer]] is used on some pickup trucks but has had limited commercial success. 

The [[Automotive industry in Sweden|Swedish]] startup [http://www.uniti.earth/ Uniti] will release the [[Uniti (car)|Uniti]] [[Electric car|all electric car]] in 2019 with an in-house designed steer-by-wire system and will entirely replace the steering wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unitisweden.com|title=Uniti Sweden website|last=|first=|date=|work=Uniti|access-date=2017-06-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was showcased in [[Virtual reality|VR]] at the 2016 [[CeBIT|CeBit]] edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cb-News-Connected-Car-Uniti-Elektroauto-15237519.html|title=Uniti: Winziges umweltfreundliches Elektroauto auf der CeBIT|work=computerbild.de|access-date=2017-06-07|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to be confused with [[Electric Power Steering]]. Electric Power Steering can be considered as a stage of evolution from mechanical steering to steer by wire systems.

=== Park by wire ===
{{Main|Park by wire}}
The [[parking pawl]] in a traditional automatic transmission has a mechanical link to the gear lever and locks the transmission in the park position when the vehicle is set in Park. Not to be confused with the [[parking brake]]. A park  by wire system uses electronic commands to actuate the parking pawl by a motor when the driver puts the vehicle in park.

== Safety critical systems ==
Failures in electronic control units used to implement these drive by wire functionalists can lead to potential hazardous situations where the driver's ability to control the vehicle will depend on the vehicle operating scenario. For example, [[Sudden unintended acceleration|unintended acceleration]], loss of braking, unintended steering, shift in the wrong direction and unintended roll away are some of the known hazards. Implementing drive by wire systems requires extensive testing and validation as is the case when any new technology is introduced.

Recently it has been demonstrated that some of these systems are susceptible to hacking, allowing for external control of the vehicle.  While generally such hack demonstrations like remote activation of the horn or windshield wipers/washers fall into the "annoying or amusing" category, other hacks involving the accelerator, brakes, and transmission have much more serious security and safety implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Checkoway |first1=Stephen |title=Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHfOziIwXic |website=YouTube |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''epidermis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἐπιδερμίς'', meaning "over-skin") is a single layer of cells that covers the [[leaf|leaves]], [[flowers]], [[root]]s and [[Plant stem|stems]] of [[plants]]. It forms a boundary between the plant and the external environment. The epidermis serves several functions: it protects against water loss, regulates [[gas exchange]], secretes metabolic compounds, and (especially in roots) absorbs water and mineral nutrients. The epidermis of most leaves shows [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsoventral anatomy]]: the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions. Woody stems and some other stem structures{{which|date=August 2015}} produce a secondary covering called the [[periderm]] that replaces the epidermis as the protective covering.

==Description==
The epidermis is the outermost cell layer of the primary plant body. In some older works the cells of the leaf epidermis have been regarded as specialised [[parenchyma]] cells,&lt;ref name= "HOPG"&gt;Hill, J. Ben; Overholts, Lee O; Popp, Henry W. Grove Jr., Alvin R. Botany. A textbook for colleges. Publisher: MacGraw-Hill 1960&lt;/ref&gt; but the established modern preference has long been to classify the epidermis as dermal tissue, whereas parenchyma is classified as [[ground tissue]].&lt;ref name="RayEic"&gt;Evert, Ray F; Eichhorn, Susan E. Esau's Plant Anatomy: Meristems, Cells, and Tissues of the Plant Body: Their Structure, Function, and Development. Publisher: Wiley-Liss 2006. {{ISBN|978-0471738435}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epidermis is the main component of the dermal tissue system of leaves (diagrammed below), and also stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and seeds; it is usually [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] (epidermal cells have fewer chloroplasts or lack them completely, except for the guard cells.)

The cells of the epidermis are structurally and functionally variable. Most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick. Some plants like ''[[Ficus elastica]]'' and ''[[Peperomia]]'', which have periclinal cellular division within the protoderm of the leaves, have an epidermis with multiple cell layers. Epidermal cells are tightly linked to each other and provide mechanical strength and protection to the plant. The walls of the epidermal cells of the above ground parts of plants contain [[cutin]], and are covered with a [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]].  The cuticle reduces water loss to the atmosphere, it is sometimes covered with [[epicuticular wax|wax]] in smooth sheets,  granules, plates, tubes or filaments. The wax layers give some plants a whitish or bluish surface color. Surface wax acts as a moisture barrier and protects the plant from intense sunlight and wind.&lt;ref name=Raven1981&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Raven | first1 = Peter H. | last2 = Evert | first2 = Ray F. | last3 = Curtis | first3 = Helena | year = 1981 | title = Biology of plants | pages = 427–28 | isbn = 0-87901-132-7 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, N.Y. | oclc = 222047616
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underside of many leaves have a thinner cuticle than the top side, and leaves of plants from dry climates often have thickened cuticles to conserve water by reducing transpiration.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Leaf Tissue Structure.svg|center|600px|Diagram of fine scale leaf internal anatomy]]
The epidermal tissue includes several differentiated cell types: epidermal cells, guard cells, subsidiary cells, and epidermal hairs (trichomes). The epidermal cells are the most numerous, largest, and least specialized. These are typically more elongated in the leaves of [[monocot]]s than in those of [[dicot]]s.

[[File:Leaf Structure.svg|center|600px|Diagram of moderate scale leaf anatomy]]

[[Trichome]]s or hairs grow out from the epidermis in many species. In root epidermis, epidermal hairs, termed [[root hairs]] are common and are specialized for absorption of water and mineral nutrients.

In plants with [[secondary growth]], the epidermis of roots and stems is usually replaced by a periderm through the action of a [[cork cambium]].

==Guard cells==
[[File:Tomato leaf stomate 1.jpg|240px|thumb|Stoma in a [[tomato]] leaf (microscope image)]]
{{Main|Stoma}}

The leaf and stem epidermis is covered with pores called [[stomata]] (sing., stoma), part of a '''stoma complex''' consisting of a pore surrounded on each side by chloroplast-containing '''guard cells''', and two to four '''subsidiary cells''' that lack chloroplasts. The stomata complex regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf.  Typically, the stomata are more numerous over the abaxial (lower) epidermis of the leaf than the (adaxial) upper epidermis. An exception is floating leaves where most or all stomata are on the upper surface. Vertical leaves, such as those of many [[Poaceae|grasses]], often have roughly equal numbers of stomata on both surfaces. 
The stoma is bounded by two guard cells. The guard cells differ from the epidermal cells in the following aspects:

* The guard cells are bean-shaped in surface view, while the epidermal cells are irregular in shape
* The guard cells contain chloroplasts, so they can manufacture food by photosynthesis (The epidermal cells do not contain chloroplasts)
* Guard Cells are the only epidermal cells that can make sugar. According to one theory, in sunlight the concentration of potassium ions (K+) increases in the guard cells. This, together with the sugars formed, lowers the water potential in the guard cells. As a result, water from other cells enter the guard cells by osmosis so they swell and become turgid. Because the guard cells have a thicker cellulose wall on one side of the cell, i.e. the side around the stomatal pore, the swollen guard cells become curved and pull the stomata open.

At night, the sugar is used up and water leaves the guard cells, so they become flaccid and the stomatal pore closes. In this way, they reduce the amount of water vapour escaping from the leaf.

==Cell differentiation in the epidermis==
{{refimprove|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Leaf epidermis w scale.jpg|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Nicotiana alata]]'' leaf's epidermis, showing [[trichome]]s (hair-like appendages) and [[stoma]]ta (eye-shaped slits, visible at full resolution)|thumb]]

The plant epidermis consists of three main cell types: [[pavement cell]]s, [[guard cell]]s and their subsidiary cells that surround the [[stomata]] and [[trichome]]s, otherwise known as leaf hairs. The epidermis of petals also form a variation of trichomes called [[conical cell]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Trichomes develop at a distinct phase during [[leaf]] development, under the control of two major trichome specification [[gene]]s: ''TTG'' and ''GL1''. The process may be controlled by the [[plant hormone]]s [[gibberellin]]s, and even if not completely controlled, gibberellins certainly have an effect on the development of the leaf hairs. ''GL1'' causes [[endoreplication]], the replication of [[DNA]] without subsequent [[cell division]] as well as cell expansion. ''GL1'' turns on the expression of a second gene for trichome formation, ''GL2'', which controls the final stages of trichome formation causing the cellular outgrowth.

''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' uses the products of [[:wikt:inhibitory|inhibitory]] genes to control the patterning of trichomes, such as ''TTG'' and ''TRY''. The products of these genes will diffuse into the [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] cells, preventing them from forming trichomes and in the case of ''TRY'' promoting the formation of pavement cells.

Expression of the gene ''MIXTA'', or its [[Analog (chemistry)|analogue]] in other species, later in the process of [[cellular differentiation]] will cause the formation of conical cells over trichomes. ''MIXTA'' is a [[transcription factor]].

Stomatal patterning is a much more controlled process, as the stoma effect the plants water retention and [[Plant respiration|respiration]] capabilities. As a consequence of these important functions, differentiation of cells to form stomata is also subject to environmental conditions to a much greater degree than other epidermal cell types.

Stomata are pores in the plant epidermis that are surrounded by two guard cells, which control the opening and closing of the aperture. These guard cells are in turn surrounded by [[subsidiary cell]]s which provide a supporting role for the guard cells.

Stomata begin as stomatal meristemoids.{{clarify|date=December 2016}} The process varies between [[dicot]]s and [[monocot]]s. Spacing is thought to be essentially [[random]] in dicots though [[mutant]]s do show it is under some form of genetic control, but it is more controlled in monocots, where stomata arise from specific [[asymmetric cell division|asymmetric divisions]] of protoderm cells. The smaller of the two cells produced becomes the guard mother cells. Adjacent epidermal cells will also divide asymmetrically to form the subsidiary cells.
 
Because stomata play such an important role in the plants survival, collecting information on their differentiation is difficult by the traditional means of genetic manipulation, as stomatal mutants tend to be unable to survive. Thus the control of the process is not well understood. Some genes have been identified. ''TMM'' is thought to control the timing of stomatal initiation specification and ''FLP'' is thought to be involved in preventing further division of the guard cells once they are formed.

Environmental conditions affect the development of stomata, in particular their [[density]] on the leaf surface. It is thought that plant hormones, such as [[ethylene]] and [[cytokines]], control the stomatal developmental response to the environmental conditions. Accumulation of these hormones appears to cause increased stomatal density such as when the plants are kept in closed environments.

'''''Examining Board v. Flores de Otero''''', 426 U.S. 572 (1976), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that invalidated a state law that excluded [[alien (law)|aliens]] from the practice of [[civil engineering]]. The Court invalidated the law on the basis of [[equal protection]] using a [[strict scrutiny]] standard of review.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Examining Board v. Flores de Otero|volume=426|page=572|pin=|year=1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varat, J.D. et al.  ''Constitutional Law Cases and Materials, Concise Thirteenth Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2009, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior history==
A [[Puerto Rico]] law permits only [[United States citizen]]s to practice privately as civil engineers. Appellees are alien civil engineers residing in Puerto Rico, one of whom (Flores de Otero) was denied a license under this law, and the other of whom (Perez Nogueiro) was granted only a conditional license to work for the Commonwealth.  Each appellee brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant Examining Board and its members in the [[United States District Court]] for the [[District of Puerto Rico]], claiming jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3) and alleging that the statute's citizenship requirement violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

The '''Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4292}}) is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt; Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt; H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Background==
A similar bill was passed by the House during the [[112th United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=lawyersCHP1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalheritagelaw.org/Default.aspx?pageId=1842909|publisher=The Lawyers' Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4292sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act would amend the federal judicial code with respect to denial of a foreign state's immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. or state courts (under the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]]) in cases where rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property (or any property exchanged for it) is: (1) present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on by the foreign state in the United States; or (2) owned by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state, and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would prohibit consideration as a commercial activity (excluded from jurisdictional immunity) any activity in the United States of a foreign state, or of any carrier, associated with a temporary exhibition or display if: (1) the work of art (or other object of cultural significance) is imported into the United States from any foreign country pursuant to an agreement for its temporary exhibition or display between a foreign state that is its owner or custodian and the United States or cultural or educational institutions within it; and (2) the [[President of the United States|President]] has determined, with notice in the [[Federal Register]], that such work is culturally significant and its temporary exhibition or display is in the national interest. (Thus, grants jurisdictional immunity to the foreign state and associated carrier for such works.)&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

The bill would deny application of this prohibition to cases concerning rights in property taken in violation of international law in which: (1) the action is based upon a claim that the work was taken between January 30, 1933, and May 8, 1945, by the government of Germany or any government in Europe occupied, assisted, or allied by the German government; (2) the court determines that the activity associated with the exhibition or display is commercial; and (3) that determination is necessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign state.&lt;ref name="4292sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 2, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4292&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4292|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45296|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on information provided by the [[Administrative Office of the United States Courts]], the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4292 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 4292 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

Under current law, works of art loaned by foreign governments generally are immune to certain decisions made by federal courts and cannot be confiscated if the President, or the President’s designee, determines that display of the works is in the national interest. However, commercial activity in which foreign governments are engaged does not have immunity in federal courts. H.R. 4292 would clarify that importing works of art into the United States for temporary display is not a commercial activity, and thus that such works would be immune from seizure.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

H.R. 4292 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo4292"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on March 25, 2014 by [[Steve Chabot|Rep. Steve Chabot (R, OH-1)]].&lt;ref name=4292allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4292 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4292/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice]].&lt;ref name="4292allactions"/&gt; The bill was scheduled to be voted on under [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=HouseExIRS&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
According to a legislative digest provided by House Republicans, the bill "narrowly amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to make it easier for U.S. cultural and educational institutions to borrow art and other culturally significant objects from foreign countries."&lt;ref name=4292gop&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Digest - H.R. 4292|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4292-the-foreign-cultural-exchange-jurisdictional-immunity-clarification-act/|publisher=House Republican Conference|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the changes made by the bill would not provide any immunity to art or objects that were "taken in violation of international law by [[Nazi Germany]] between January 30, 1933 and [[Victory in Europe Day|May 8, 1945]]."&lt;ref name="4292gop"/&gt;

In an editorial, [[Tess Davis]] of the [[University of Glasgow]] and [[Marc Masurovsky]] of the [[Holocaust Art Restitution Project]], spoke out in opposition to the bill.&lt;ref name=Davis1&gt;{{cite news|title=US bill would allow museums to knowingly exhibit stolen art|url=http://theconversation.com/us-bill-would-allow-museums-to-knowingly-exhibit-stolen-art-25637|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=The Conversation|date=2 May 2014|author=Tess Davis|author2=Marc Masurovsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would "prevent claimants from recovering their rightful property" and enable museums to "knowingly be able to exhibit stolen and looted art and antiquities."&lt;ref name="Davis1"/&gt; Davis and Masurovsky argue that the bill would weaken U.S. law and undermine the American tradition of honoring property rights.

'''Forensic art''' is any [[art]] used in [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or [[legal process|legal proceedings]]. Forensic art is used to assist law enforcement with the visual aspects of a case, often using witness descriptions and video footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forensicfaces.weebly.com/what-is-forensic-art.html|title=What is Forensic Art? - Forensic Faces Institute|website=forensicfaces.weebly.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a highly specialised field that covers a wide range of artistic skills, such as [[Facial composite|composite drawing]], crime scene sketching, [[image modification]] and identification, courtroom drawings, demonstrative evidence, and postmortem and facial approximation aids. It is rare for a forensic artist to specialise in more than one of these skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiai.org/disciplines/art/history.php|title=History of the I.A.I. Forensic Art Discipline|website=www.theiai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a breakdown of different skills and what they involve:
* &lt;u&gt;'''Composite Drawing:'''&lt;/u&gt; the main objective is to help investigators generate leads based on physical descriptions. This is usually drawn by hand; an artist who is trained in interviewing victims and witnesses uses the information provided to draw what is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/article/2004/12/forensic-art-defined-and-explained|title=Forensic Art Defined and Explained|date=2004-12-01|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composite art produces a single, graphic image that is designed to be a likeness or similarity of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Image Modification:&lt;/u&gt;''' this is used to change and enhance a photograph in order to help an investigator and/or trial attorney. Examples of this include age progression/regression (see below),&lt;ref name="p1698608879"&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/1698608879&lt;/ref&gt; and the clarifying of images, such as from CCTV footage, to identify an individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Image Identification:&lt;/u&gt;''' this is the recording a person's distinguishing features for future reference. Investigators can use this tool to identify suspects who attempts to change their appearance to evade capture, as well as in the study of cold cases in which individuals may have changed their appearance since the event.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Crime Scene Sketching:&lt;/u&gt;''' the drawing of a crime scene; in the sketch, an investigator includes measurements and dimensions to aid in displaying the layout of the scene. This helps support the information shown in photographs of the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evidencemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=184|title=Evidence Technology Magazine – Documenting the Crime Scene|last=MAYO|first=KRISTI|website=www.evidencemagazine.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Demonstrative Evidence:&lt;/u&gt;''' any visible, physical evidence used in legal proceedings. These are used to demonstrate aspects of the case, reconstruct an event, and illustrate what happened. There are two categories of demonstrative evidence; court displays and investigative aids.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Postmortem Drawing:&lt;/u&gt;''' when an artist either looks at a deceased person's photograph or their remains to help identify who the person is and what they looked like prior to their death. This helps most in cases where the body is too damaged by an accident or decomposition.&lt;ref name="p1698608879" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Age Progression/Regression&lt;/u&gt;''': useful to determine what a person's appeearance before or after a period of time. This is most commonly used in missing persons cases or during cold cases when investigators need an idea of what an individual looked like years prior to or following the investigation.
* '''&lt;u&gt;Forensic Sculpture&lt;/u&gt;''': this is used to create three-dimensional models, usually using the skull of the victims. Other features are added such as fake eyes and wigs to add realism. This process can also inform the investigators of certain characteristics of the victim - such as age, race, and gender - through a detailed knowledge of the intricacies of skeletal structure and other corresponding features such as dental records. It is later photograph and used like postmortem and composite drawings. However, because forensic sculpture relies heavily on assumptions made by the artist, it is not considered a legally recognised technique for positive identification, and is thus used in an advisory capacity only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Helmer et al. Assessment of the Reliability of Facial Reconstruction|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;'''Collaboration:'''&lt;/u&gt; forensic artists, anthropologists and other professions are used to help determine the age, sex, and race of an identified skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/jan2001/taister.htm|title=Book Review of Forensic Art and Illustration (by Taylor), by Taister (Forensic Science Communications, January 2001)|last=Taister|first=Karen T. Taylor, Taylor, Michael A. Taister,|work=FBI|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many forensic artists do the job as a collateral duty to their "regular" job in law enforcement, such as police officer, crime scene tech, etc. Such forensic artists perform their work while on a fixed salary and are not additionally compensated for artistic duties. There are few full-time forensic artist jobs available. Most full-time artists work in large cities, or in state or federal agencies. "Freelancing" in forensic art is a difficult career path, as ties to law enforcement are a necessary part of the job, and agencies have limited budgets to pay outside contractors.

The skill of '''facial approximation''' is closely associated and related to [[forensic anthropology]] in that an artist specializes in the reconstruction of the remains of a human body. Generally this discipline focuses on the human face for identification purposes. The forensic artist can create a facial approximation in a number of ways to include 2D ([[drawing]]s), 3D ([[sculpture]]s) and other methods using new computer technology. Forensic artists generally can add greater character and make their subjects come back to "life".

== Methods of Manual 3d construction ==
* Anthropometric was a method developed by [[Wilton M. Krogman]] in 1946 .&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=110682508&amp;site=ehost-livepose-methods.html|title=What is Anthropometric Measurement? - Tools, Purpose &amp; Methods – Video &amp; Lesson Transcript |website=study.com|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facial muscles are recorded by a highly trained professional. This job is particularly tedious, which is why most do not use this method.
* Computerized 3d forensic facial reconstruction- manual model clay techniques are used within this method. Computer systems vary, in that some computerized systems used 3D animation software to model the face onto the skull, while other systems use a virtual sculpture system with Haptic feedback&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com" /&gt;
* Haptic Feedback- The ability to feel the surface of the skull during analysis and also provide important skeletal details for facial reconstruction such as muscle attachment strength, position of eye, position of malar tubercle etc.&lt;ref name="ebscohost.com" /&gt;

== Face model creation ==
When creating a face model, the forensic artist looks at whether the person is masculine or feminine, as well as their skin tone, age, wrinkles, freckles, the shadow of the beard, and attractiveness. There are three segments that they examine: 
* Face shape: round, narrow, heart shape, high/low cheeks, high/low chin, double chin, the distance between lips and nose.
* Eyes: round, upwards/downwards, the distance of eyeballs, eye color, thin/thick eyebrows, high/low arch brow, distance between both eyebrows, distance between eyebrows and eyes.
* Hair: the 3D models have not been programmed to be used with hair, therefore, hair cannot be used the same way as facial attributes. A profile and frontal image of a person is used where 5 to 15 different key features of each hairstyle are selected. These different hairstyles features are from a database used by these professionals. The styles are put into the system where the algorithm automatically estimates the structure of the face. The system is also able to depict different shade of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=23414201&amp;site=ehost-live|title=EBSCOhost Login|website=search.ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Becoming a Forensic Artist ==
To qualify for a professional certification for forensic arts - such as the Forensic Art Certification, which is provided through the [https://www.theiai.org/certifications/artist/index.php International Association for Identification] - applicants can focus on one or more of the three available categories of professional designation: composite imaging, facial reconstruction, and image enhancement/age progression,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and must: 
* have at least 80 hours of IAI-approved forensic art training&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have at least 40 hours of related workshops, lectures, and short program training
* have at least 2 years of experience as forensic arts
* provide at least 30 forensic art examples that include age progressions, composites, and reconstructions
* have a portfolio that demonstrates their forensic art techniques (must include at least 10 forensic art images that were prepared for law enforcement investigation cases)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/forensic-artist/|title=Forensic Artist Job Description, Education Requirements, and Salary Expectations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geodiversity''' is the variety of earth materials, forms and processes that constitute and shape the Earth, either the whole or a specific part of it.&lt;ref name=Zwolinski&gt;Zwolinski, Zb. 2004. ''Geodiversity'', in: ''Encyclopedia of Geomorphology'', A.Goudie (ed.), Routledge: pp. 417-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relevant materials include [[mineral]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[sediment]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[soil]]s and [[water]].&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brilha2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brilha |first1=José |date=2014 |title=Inventory and Quantitative Assessment of Geosites and Geodiversity Sites: a Review |url= |journal=Geoheritage |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1007/s12371-014-0139-3 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms may comprise [[fold (geology)|folds]], [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[landform]]s and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Any natural process that continues to act upon, maintain or modify either material or form (for example [[tectonics]], [[sediment transport]], [[pedogenesis]]) represents another aspect of geodiversity. However geodiversity is not normally defined to include the likes of landscaping, concrete or other significant human influence.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, M. 2004. ''Geodiversity: Valuing and Conserving Abiotic Nature''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd {{ISBN|978-0470848951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of [[Geology of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Geology of Tasmania|Tasmania]]) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a [[Geoethics|geoethical]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peppoloni S. and Di Capua G. (2012), "[http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/6099 Geoethics and geological culture: awareness, responsibility and challenges]". Annals of Geophysics, 55, 3, 335-341. doi: 10.4401/ag-6099.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to José Brilha geodiversity may be of scientific value or valued for other aspects. Geodiversity of scientific value can be either geosites or geoheritage elements that are ''[[ex situ]]''. Similarly geodiversity that is of little or no scientific value may be categorized as sites of geodiversity or geodiversity elements that are ''ex situ''.&lt;ref name=Brilha2014/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4921">'''Giovan Antonio Rusconi''' (c. 1500-05; † 1578) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[architect]], [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]], translator and illustrator of [[Vitruvius]].

== Life ==
[[File:Della architettvra (1590) (14769861931).jpg|thumbnail|''Della Architettvra''. Illustration.]]
Apart from being introduced into building and painting young Antonio Rusconi studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Padua]] under [[Giovanni Battista Memmo]] and [[Niccolò Tartaglia]]. Extensively consulting Vitruvius’ [[De architectura|"Ten Books on Architecture"]] while he was constructing a novel type of [[watermill]] Antonio became aware of many grave technical errors within the work’s early Renaissance editions and commentaries. Finally [[Pietro Lauro]], who had rendered [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leon Battista Alberti’s]] “De Architectura” into the vernacular, convinced Rusconi to set out with a translation of his own. The text was finished until 1552 and illustrated with more than three hundred supplementary [[woodcut]]s. Earlier, Rusconi had already provided the illustrations for [[Lodovico Dolce|Lodovico Dolce’s]] version of the [[Metamorphoses|Ovidian “Metamorphoses”]].
Yet, since then countless treatises on architecture and commentaries on [[Vitruvius]] (e.g. by [[Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro|Daniele Barbaro]], [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Gicaomo Vignola]] and [[Andrea Palladio]]) were being published, Rusconi’s Venetian editors, [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]] and [[Tommaso Porcacchi]], saw no benefit in printing another title on the subject.
Together with [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] Rusconi draughted the [[Brescia#Piazza della Loggia|"Palazzo municipale" (Brescia)]] in 1562, they also took part in rebuilding the [[Doge's Palace]] after the fire of 1577 and constructing the [[Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa|Palazzo Grimani]]. Nevertheless throughout his life Rusconi’s main occupation was that of a [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]] for the [[Republic of Venice]]. After having fallen gravely ill in 1575 Giovan Antonio died in 1579.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anna Bedon, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi: illustratore di Vitruvio, artista, ingegnere, architetto'', in: ''Della Architettura di Gio''[van]''Antonio Rusconi'', Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio di Vicenza, Testi e fonti per la storia dell’architettura, Verona, Vicenza 1996, pp. IX–XXI; Louis Cellauro, ''La biblioteca di un architetto del Rinascimento la raccolta di libri di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi'', in: Arte Veneta 58 (2001), pp. 224–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rusconi's "Della Architettura" ==
Rusconi’s “Vitruvius” was only printed after his death in 1590 by the son of his former editor [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]]. Although the latter recognised the value of Giovan Antonio’s [[woodcut|xylographies]] he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange “Vitruvius without Vitruvius“ was published:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bedon 1996, p. XII: „questa strana edizione vitruviana senza Vitruvio, senza traduzione, senza autore.“&lt;/ref&gt; Just about 160 of originally 300 [[woodcut]]s were compiled with extracts from [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo’s]] and [[Cesare Cesariano|Cesariano’s]] translations of [[De architectura|Vitruvius’ treatise]]. For many of Rusconi’s illustrations containing references to textual explanations, it is particularly regrettable that his translation has hence been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Reiser, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi (1515/20–1579)'', in: ''Firmitas et Splendor. Vitruv und die Techniken des Wanddekors'', ed. by Erwin Emmerling, [[:de:Andreas Grüner|Andreas Grüner]] et al., Munich 2014 (Studien aus dem Lehrstuhl für Restaurierung, [[Technische Universität München]], Fakultät für Architektur) {{ISBN|978-3-935643-62-7}}, pp. 269-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physical cosmology]], the '''hadron epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early universe during which the mass of the universe was dominated by [[hadron]]s. It started approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], when the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow the [[quark]]s from the preceding [[quark epoch]] to bind together into hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and anti-matter in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of hadrons. The elimination of anti-hadrons was completed by one second after the Big Bang, when the following [[lepton epoch]] began.

[[Image:Hamilton Air Force aerial view.jpg|thumb|right|380px|The Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project at [[Whiteside marsh|Whiteside Marsh]], on the former [[Hamilton Air Force Base]].]]
The '''Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project''', now known as the '''Hamilton/Bel Marin Keys Wetlands Restoration''' is a [[wetland]]s [[habitat restoration]] project at the former [[Hamilton Army Airfield|Hamilton Air Force Base—Hamilton Army Airfield]] (1930−1988) site and adjacent [[Bel Marin Keys, California|Bel Marin Keys]] shoreline, in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]].  

It is located at [[Whiteside marsh|Whiteside Marsh]] on the northwestern shore of [[San Pablo Bay]], in and adjacent to the city of [[Novato, California|Novato]] in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

==Project==
The restoration project is a joint venture between two public agencies; the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] is the lead federal agency; with the [[California Coastal Conservancy]] as the local sponsoring agency. In addition, the [[San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission]] serves as a collaborating partner. 

The U.S. Congress authorized the Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project in 1999, and the addition of the Bel Marin Keys property to the project in 2007. The combined project site comprises approximately {{convert|2600|acres}}.

Together, these three agencies are working to restore the Whiteside Marsh section of the closed Hamilton Air Force Base—Hamilton Army Airfield site to its former natural [[estuary]] and wetlands condition, and to create valuable [[endangered species]] habitat in the urbanized [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. 

The Hamilton Wetlands Restoration Project ''“represents an unprecedented opportunity to contribute to the restoration of the [[San Francisco Bay]], which has lost over 85% of its natural wetlands since the 1880s.”''

'''Ivor Armstrong Richards''' (26 February 1893 – 7 September 1979), known as '''I. A. Richards''', was an English educator, [[literary critic]], and [[rhetoric]]ian whose work contributed to the foundations of the [[New Criticism]], a [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] movement in [[literary theory]], which emphasized the [[close reading]] of a literary text, especially [[poetry]], in an effort to discover how a work of literature functions as a self-contained, self-referential [[Aesthetics|æsthetic object]].

Richards' [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] contributions to the establishment of the literary methodology of the New Criticism are presented in the books ''[[The Meaning of Meaning|The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism]]'' (1923), by [[C. K. Ogden]] and I. A. Richards, ''Principles of Literary Criticism'' (1926), ''Practical Criticism'' (1929), and ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' (1936).

==Biography==

Richards was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where his intellectual talents were developed by the scholar Charles Hicksonn 'Cabby' Spence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bizzell |first=Patricia |first2=Bruce |last2=Herzberg |title=The Rhetorical Tradition: Reading From Classical Times to the Present |edition=2nd |location=New York, NY |publisher=Bedford/St. Matin's |year=2001 |page=1270 |isbn=0312148399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career without formal training in literature; he studied philosophy (the "moral sciences") at [[Cambridge University]], from which derived his assertions that, in the 20th century, literary study cannot and should not be undertaken as a specialisation, it is in itself, but studied alongside a cognate field, such as [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]].

His early teaching appointments were as adjunct faculty: at Cambridge University, [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]] would not pay a salary for Richards to teach the new, and untested, [[academic field]] of English literature. Instead, like an old-style instructor, he collected weekly tuition directly from the students, as they entered the classroom. In his private life, Richards married [[Dorothy Pilley Richards]] in 1926; they had met on a [[Alpinism|mountain climbing]] holiday in Wales.

In the 1929–30 biennium, as a visiting professor, Richards taught [[Basic English]] and Poetry at [[Tsinghua University]], Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/I-A-Richards Retrieved 6 April 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tai Huai-Ching,  ''On the Study of Words'' (1960).my World Publishing Co. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1936–38, triennium, Richards was the director of the [[Orthological Institute of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/I-A-Richards ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
===Collaborations with C. K. Ogden===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Charles Kay Ogden.jpg|thumb|right|350px| The inventor of [[Basic English]], C.K. Ogden (1889–1957), was the most fruitful collaborator of I. A. Richards.]] --&gt;

The life and intellectual influence of I. A. Richards approximately corresponds to his [[intellectualism|intellectual]] interests; many endeavours were in collaboration with the [[linguist]], philosopher, and writer [[C. K. Ogden|Charles Kay Ogden]] (C.K. Ogden), notably in four books:

I. ''Foundations of Aesthetics'' (1922) presents the principles of ''aesthetic reception'', the bases of the literary theory of “harmony”;  aesthetic understanding derives from the balance of competing psychological impulses. The structure of the ''Foundations of Aesthetics''—a survey of the competing definitions of the term ''æsthetic''—prefigures the multiple-definitions work in the books ''Basic Rules of Reason'' (1933), ''Mencius on the Mind: Experiments in Multiple Definition'' (1932), and  ''Coleridge on Imagination'' (1934)

II. ''[[The Meaning of Meaning|The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism]]'' (1923) presents the triadic theory of [[semiotics]] that depends upon psychological theory, and so anticipates the importance of psychology in the exercise of literary criticism. Semioticians, such as [[Umberto Eco]], acknowledged that the methodology of the triadic theory of semiotics improved upon the methodology of the dyadic theory of semiotics presented by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913).

III. ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930) and IV. the ''Times of India Guide to Basic English'' (1938) developed the [[Basic English]] program in effort to develop an international language, an [[International auxiliary language|interlanguage]] based upon a vocabulary of  850 English words.

Richards' travels, especially in China, effectively situated him as the advocate for an international program, such as Basic English. Moreover, at Harvard University, to his international pedagogy, the instructor I. A. Richards began to integrate the available new media for mass communications, especially [[television]].

===Aesthetics and literary criticism===
====Theory====
[[File:William Empson.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The poet and literary critic William Empson (1906–84), developed the methodology of New Criticism with the practice of [[close reading|closely reading]] of literary works, prose and poetry; his best-known work is ''Seven Types of Ambiguity'' (1930)]]

I. A. Richards' paternity of the [[New Criticism]] is in two books of [[critical theory]], ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'' (1924) and ''Practical Criticism'' (1929). The first book, ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'', discusses the subjects of  [[Substantial form|form]], [[Value (semiotics)|value]], [[rhythm]], coenesthesia (awareness of inhabiting one's body, caused by stimuli from various organs), literary infectiousness, [[allusion|allusiveness]], divergent readings, and [[belief]]. The second book, ''Practical Criticism'' (1929), is an [[empirical study]] of ''inferior response'' to a literary text.

As an instructor of English literature  at Cambridge University, Richards tested the critical-thinking abilities of his pupils; he removed [[author]]ial and contextual information from thirteen poems, one by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] (1807– 82), and assigned the literary interpretations to undergraduate students in order to ascertain the likely impediments to an ''adequate response'' to a literary text. That experiment in [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach — critical reading without contexts — demonstrated the variety and the depth of the possible textual misreadings that might be committed, by university student and layman reader alike.

The critical method derived from that pedagogical approach did not propose a new [[hermeneutics]], a new methodology of interpretation, but questioned the purposes and efficacy of the critical process of literary interpretation, by analysing the self-reported critical interpretations of university students. To that end, effective critical work required a closer [[aesthetic interpretation]] of the literary text as an object; which methodology produced the empirical-study work about the teaching of composition, e.g. “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing ” (1981), by [[Linda Flower]] and John R. Hayes (see: [[Writing process]]).

To substantiate interpretive criticism, Richards provided theories of [[metaphor]], [[value (ethics)|value]], and [[Tone (literature)|tone]], of stock response, incipient action, and pseudo-statement; and of [[ambiguity]]. This last subject, the theory of ''ambiguity'', was developed in ''[[Seven Types of Ambiguity]]'' (1930), by [[William Empson]], a former student of Richards'; moreover, additional to ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'' and ''Practical Criticism'', Empson's book on ambiguity became the third foundational document for the methodology of the [[New Criticism]].

To Richards, literary criticism was [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionistic]], too abstract to be readily grasped and understood, by most readers; and he proposed that literary criticism could be precise in communicating meanings, by way of denotation and connotation. To establish critical precision, Richards examined the [[Working memory|psychological processes]] of writing and of the [[Reading (process)|reading]] of poetry. That in reading poetry and making sense of it “in the degree in which we can order ourselves, we need nothing more”; the reader need not believe the poetry, because the literary importance of poetry is in provoking emotions in the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Glicksberg, Charles I. "I. A. Richards and the Science of Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 46.4 (1938). JSTOR. Web. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27535493&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New rhetoric====
As a rhetorician, I. A. Richards said that the old form of studying [[rhetoric]] (the art of [[discourse]]) was too concerned with the mechanics of formulating [[argument]]s and with conflict; instead, he proposed the New Rhetoric to study of the meaning of the parts of discourse, as “a study of misunderstanding and its remedies” to determine how language works. That [[ambiguity]] is expected, and that meanings (denotation and connotation) are not inherent to words, but are inherent to the perception of the reader, the listener, and the viewer. By their usages, compiled from experience, people decide and determine meaning by “how words are used in a sentence”, in spoken and written language.&lt;ref&gt;Hochmuth, Marie. "I. A Richards and the ‘New Rhetoric’ new royal”, ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 44.1 (1958): 1. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The semantic triangle =====
I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden created the [[semantic triangle]] to deliver improved understanding to how words come to mean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetoric of Western Thought|last=Golden, Berquist, Coleman, Sproule|first=|publisher=Kendall-Hunt|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=265–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semantic triangle has three parts, the symbol or word, the referent, and the thought or reference.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the bottom, right corner is the Referent, the thing, in reality,  Placed at the left corner is the symbol or word. At the top point, the convergence of the literal word and the object in reality; it is our intangible idea about the object. Ultimately,  the english meaning of the words is determined by an individual's unique experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Feedforward===
At the age of 75 years, I. A. Richards was approached by the ''Saturday Review'' to write a piece for their "What I Have Learned" series. Richards surprisingly took this opportunity to expound upon his lesser known concept of "feedforward".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/meanmean.pdf  |title=The Meaning of Meaning of I. A. RIchards,  |chapter=Five  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193836/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/meanmean.pdf  |archivedate=29 October 2013  |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, feedforward is the concept of anticipating the effect of one's words by acting as our own critic. It is thought to work in the opposite direction of feedback, though it works essentially towards the same goal: to clarify unclear concepts. Existing in all forms of communication,&lt;ref name="The Communication Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcbdevito.blogspot.com/2010/11/i-want-to-broaden-communication-blog-to.html |title= The Communication Blog, |section= Feedforward }}&lt;/ref&gt; feedforward acts as a pretest that any writer can use to anticipate the impact of their words on their audience. According to Richards, feedforward allows the writer to then engage with their text to make necessary changes to create a better effect. He believes that communicators who do not use feedforward will seem dogmatic. Richards wrote more in depth about the idea and importance of feedforward in communication in his book ''Speculative Instruments'' and has claimed that feedforward was his most important learned concept.&lt;ref name="The Communication Blog"/&gt;

===Influence===
Richards served as mentor and teacher to other prominent critics, most notably [[William Empson]] and [[F. R. Leavis]], though Leavis was contemporary with Richards, Empson much younger. Other critics primarily influenced by his writings also included [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Allen Tate]]. Later critics who refined the formalist approach to New Criticism by actively rejecting his psychological emphasis included, besides Brooks and Tate, [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[R. P. Blackmur]], and [[Murray Krieger]]. [[R. S. Crane]] of the Chicago school was both indebted to Richards's theory and critical of its psychological assumptions. They all admitted the value of his seminal ideas but sought to salvage what they considered his most useful assumptions from the theoretical excesses they felt he brought to bear in his criticism. Like Empson, Richards proved a difficult model for the New Critics, but his model of [[close reading]] provided the basis for their interpretive methodology.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records that I. A. Richards coined the term '''feedforward''', in 1951, at the 8th annual [[Macy Conferences]] on [[cybernetics]]. In the event, the term extended the intellectual and critical influence of Richards to cybernetics which makes liberal use of the term ''feedforward'', as in [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|Feedforward]]. Moreover, among Richards' students was [[Marshall McLuhan]], who also applied the term and the ideas of feedforward.

His hand brushed Sterling's bald head. Dr. R. told Tim, 'For a long time afterwards I was haunted with bad dreams, dreaming that Sterling was trying to come up and that my hand brushing across his head kept him from being able to.' Dr. R. told Dr. Leonard's grandson that he and Sterling had had a productive afternoon together and he believed if Dr. Leonard had survived, they (together) would have 'revolutionized English teaching.' Tim says Dr. R. seemed more concerned about him (Tim) than the past events and "he reassured me my grandfather was a very important person."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35247">'''Interpersonal emotion regulation''' is the process of changing the emotional experience of one's self or another person through social interaction. It encompasses both '''intrinsic emotion regulation''' (also known as [[emotional self-regulation]]), in which one attempts to alter their own feelings by recruiting social resources, as well as '''extrinsic emotion regulation''', in which one deliberately attempts to alter the trajectory of other people's feelings.

== History of concept ==
The concept of interpersonal emotion regulation stems from earlier research into [[emotional self-regulation]], which is the within-person process whereby people influence and change their own feelings.&lt;ref name="Gross2"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of psychology has traditionally focused on ''intra''personal processes in which a person manages their own emotions individually outside of the social context&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barthel|first=Abigail L.|last2=Hay|first2=Aleena|last3=Doan|first3=Stacey N.|last4=Hofmann|first4=Stefan G.|date=2018-10-18|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: A Review of Social and Developmental Components|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/bec.2018.19|journal=Behaviour Change|pages=1–14|doi=10.1017/bec.2018.19|issn=0813-4839}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, modern theories have expanded the concept of emotion regulation to include ''inter''personal processes, in which emotion is regulated with or through other people. Interpersonal models emphasize that humans are social creatures who rarely experience emotions in isolation, and instead more commonly share, express, and manage their emotions with the help of others.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckes|first=Lane|last2=Coan|first2=James A.|date=2011|title=Social Baseline Theory: The Role of Social Proximity in Emotion and Economy of Action|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=976–988|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|issn=1751-9004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W.

== Concept ==

=== Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves managing one's own emotions through social interaction&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, such as seeking [[social support]] or [[reassurance]] from others. Examples include calling a friend for advice, venting to a partner about a stressful situation, or engaging in conversation as a distraction from distress. In addition to regulating negative emotions, people also seek to amplify positive emotions by sharing good news with others. As with intrapersonal emotion regulation, people typically attempt to use interpersonal emotion regulation improve their affective state by decreasing negative emotions or increase positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Jeanne L.|date=2007|title=Ideal Affect: Cultural Causes and Behavioral Consequences|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|issn=1745-6916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation refers to the deliberate influence of others' [[emotion|feelings]].&lt;ref name="Niven"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2009). A classification of controlled interpersonal affect regulation strategies. Emotion, 9, 498-509.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the many ways how social factors influence an individual's emotions&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, S. G. &amp; Doan, S. N. (2018). "The social foundations of emotion: Developmental, cultural, and clinical dimensions". Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{ISBN|978-1433829277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include trying to cheer up a friend who is upset, trying to make one's partner feel guilty for neglecting oneself, or trying to calm a stressed coworker. These examples illustrate that interpersonal emotion regulation may be used to make others feel better or worse, although making others feel better appears to be far more common.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== In groups ===
Many instances of interpersonal emotion regulation, such as those described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence the feelings of another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence the feelings of a whole group of followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M. (2000). Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence. Human relations, 53, 1027-1055.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence the feelings of a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. A. (1996). Managing the emotions of others. Symbolic Interaction, 19, 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation is used in most of the important social relationships that we have. Within the fields of developmental and clinical [[psychology]], researchers have long-recognized that people try to influence others' emotions (e.g., mothers influence the feelings of their babies,&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. (1994). The effects of mothers' physical and emotional unavailability on emotion regulation. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 59, 208-227.&lt;/ref&gt; therapists try to alleviate the sadness of their clients&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, H. C., Barkham, M., Stiles, W. B., &amp; Goldfried, M. R. (2002). Patterns of client emotion in helpful sessions of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy. Journal of counseling psychology, 49, 376-380.&lt;/ref&gt;). More recently, social and organizational psychologists have also documented the use of interpersonal emotion regulation within romantic and familial relationships&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Macdonald, I., &amp; Holman, D. (2012). You spin me right round: Cross-relationship variability in interpersonal emotion regulation. Frontiers in Psychology, 3, 394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangelisti, A. L., Daly, J. A., &amp; Rudnick, J. R. (1991). Making people feel guilty in conversations: Techniques and correlates. Human Communication Research, 18, 3-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a range of work settings (e.g., hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;Francis, L. E., Monahan, K., &amp; Berger, C. (1999). A laughing matter? The uses of humor in medical interactions. Motivation and Emotion, 23, 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; law firms,&lt;ref&gt;Lively, K. J. (2000). Reciprocal emotion management: Working together to maintain stratification in private law firms. Work and Occupations, 27, 32-63.&lt;/ref&gt; debt collection agencies,&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;Sutton, R. I. (1991). Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors. Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 245-268.&lt;/ref&gt; and prisons&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2007). Changing moods and influencing people: The use and effects of emotional influence behaviours at HMP Grendon. Prison Service Journal, 173, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt;). Interpersonal emotion regulation may even be used towards complete strangers as a way of making social interactions run more smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E., &amp; Eggleston, R. (1994). Managing emotions in public: The case of wheelchair users. Social Psychology Quarterly, 57, 300-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related processes ===

Interpersonal emotion regulation overlaps with [[social support]], which involves giving others emotional, informational, or practical support.&lt;ref&gt;House, J. S., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1985). Measures and concepts of social support. In S. Cohen and S. L. Syme (Eds.), Social support and health (pp. 79-108). Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Models of interpersonal emotion regulation specify social support within the framework of regulatory goals to improve the feelings of one's self (by seeking support) or another person (by providing support). Emotion regulation mechanisms of social support include attentional deployment (e.g. distraction away from negative thoughts and toward the conversation) and cognitive change (e.g. encouragement to "look on the bright side" or change one's negative interpretation of a given situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation also shares links with other processes by which people come to influence others' emotions, such as [[emotional contagion]], in which the emotions of one person are 'caught' by another person as a result of mere contact (e.g., if someone was having a terrible day, they might 'infect' their friends with their bad mood).&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (1993). Emotional contagion. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2, 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the compulsion to tell other people about our emotional experiences (termed the [[social sharing of emotions]]) can also result in other people coming to feel what we feel.&lt;ref&gt;Rimé, B., Finkenauer, C., Luminet, O., Zech, E., &amp; Philippot, P. (1998). Social sharing of emotion: New evidence and new questions. European review of social psychology, 9, 145-189.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these processes and interpersonal emotion regulation regards the [[Automatic and Controlled Processes (ACP)|level of processing]] involved. Interpersonal emotion regulation is a controlled process, whereby a person intentionally tries to change the way others feel. In contrast, emotional contagion is thought to be relatively [[automaticity|automatic]], engaged without conscious awareness, while social sharing is somewhat more conscious but typically lacks the intent to influence others' emotions.

Interpersonal emotion regulation relates to [[emotional labor]], the [[regulation of emotion]] as part of one's job role.&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A. A. (2000). Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labor. Journal of occupational health psychology, 5, 95-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In emotional labor, an employee (usually in a service or care role) is required to manage his or her emotions as part of the job (e.g., 'service with a smile'). Because employees can also be required to manage the emotions of their customers or clients as part of their job (e.g., debt collectors are required to elicit anxiety in relaxed debtors to encourage them to make a payment&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;), interpersonal emotion regulation can be performed as a form of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Cameron, D. (2012). Emotional labor at the unit-level. In A. Grandey, J. Diefendorff, &amp; D. Rupp (Eds.), Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse perspectives on emotion regulation at work. Psychology Press/Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related process is interpersonal influence, which involves trying to change the attitudes and/or behaviors of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Kipnis, D., Schmidt, S. M., &amp; Wilkinson, I. (1980). Intraorganizational influence tactics: Exploration of getting one's way. Journal of Applied Psychology, 65, 440-452.&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference here is that interpersonal emotion regulation is primarily concerned with changing other people's feelings; any changes to attitudes or behaviors are secondary to the impact on emotion.

== Theories ==

=== Social Baseline Theory ===
Drawing from [[evolutionary psychology]], '''social baseline theory''' purports that humans have adapted to function in a social environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J., &amp; Maresh, E. L. (2013). Social baseline theory and the social regulation of emotion. In J. Gross (Ed.), Handbook of emotion regulation (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt; The brain acts under the assumption that proximity to other people is the norm, or baseline condition. As opposed to social isolation, which is associated with stress and poor health, social proximity is associated with attenuated cardiovascular, hormonal, and neural responses to threat, as well as longevity and physical health. The presence of others is theorized to help individuals conserve effort and metabolic resources through the social regulation of emotion. For example, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] is less active during the down-regulation of negative affect while the presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=Naomi I.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Gable|first3=Shelly L.|last4=Hilmert|first4=Clayton J.|last5=Lieberman|first5=Matthew D.|date=2007|title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress responses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|journal=NeuroImage|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|issn=1053-8119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coan|first=James A.|last2=Schaefer|first2=Hillary S.|last3=Davidson|first3=Richard J.|date=2006|title=Lending a Hand|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|journal=Psychological Science|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|issn=0956-7976|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social proximity is hypothesized to confer emotion regulatory benefits through three mechanisms: 1) risk distribution, 2) load sharing, and 3) capitalization. Risk distribution lowers [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] towards threat because risks seem lower as group size increases. Load sharing involves the knowledge that close others can provide help and resources if needed. Finally, capitalization refers to the intensification of positive emotions when they are shared with others.

=== Map of Interpersonal Regulation ===
A prominent model proposed by Jamil Zaki and Craig Williams (2013) conceptualizes different classes of interpersonal emotion regulation along two orthogonal dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W. Craig|date=2013|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0033839|journal=Emotion|volume=13|issue=5|pages=803–810|doi=10.1037/a0033839|issn=1931-1516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, intrinsic ''vs'' extrinsic, refers to the target of regulatory efforts. Intrinsic regulation involves an attempt to change one's own emotions through social contact, while extrinsic regulation involves trying to change the emotions of another person or group of people. The second dimension, response-dependent vs. response-independent, refers to whether or not the regulatory efforts depend upon the behavior of other people. Processes that rely upon how others respond or behave are considered response-dependent, while strategies that do not depend upon others' behavior are classified as response-independent. This model yields four classes of interpersonal emotion regulation:

# Intrinsic response-dependent: An individual tries to change their own affect through interaction with another person, whose feedback impacts the regulatory attempt. [[Safety behaviors (anxiety)|Safety behaviors]] fall into this category. For example, to alleviate anxiety a child might seek comfort from his mother, who responds in a soothing manner. Some forms of [[Social sharing of emotions|social sharing]] can also be considered an intrinsic response-dependent strategy, insofar as the listener's feedback influences the speaker's affect. For instance, sharing good news can intensify one's positive affect, but only if the listener responds enthusiastically.
# Intrinsic response-independent: Processes in this category involve attempts to alter one's own emotional experience through social contact, but the regulatory success does not depend upon how others react or behave. Affect labeling, or putting feelings into words, can dampen the intensity of emotional experience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torre|first=Jared B.|last2=Lieberman|first2=Matthew D.|date=2018-03-20|title=Putting Feelings Into Words: Affect Labeling as Implicit Emotion Regulation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1754073917742706|journal=Emotion Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=116–124|doi=10.1177/1754073917742706|issn=1754-0739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly occurs during communication in social contexts without necessarily relying on the response of others. For instance, describing one's emotions through a conversation may result in a more nuanced understanding of one's feelings that facilitates coping.
# Extrinsic response-dependent: A person acts with the goal of changing another person's emotion, whose feedback plays an important role in indicating the success of the regulatory attempt. Examples include [[prosocial behavior]] and related processes such as [[Empathy|empathic]] responding that endeavor to improve other people's affective state. Feedback from the recipient is needed to signal whether or not they were helped.
# Extrinsic response-independent: This classification includes attempts to change another person's affective experience that to not depend upon that person's feedback. For example, [[Warm-glow giving|warm glow]] giving may result in the achieved extrinsic goal of engaging in prosocial behavior without receiving cues from the recipient as to whether or not they benefitted.

== Strategies ==

There are potentially hundreds of strategies that people can use to influence others' feelings. A series of studies reported by Niven and colleagues generated almost 400 unique strategies that could be differentiated primarily according to whether they are used to improve or to worsen others' feelings.&lt;ref name="Niven" /&gt; Another key distinction is between strategies that engage a person in the specific situation that has caused the emotion (e.g., trying to get the person to see a situation in a different light) and those that divert attention away (e.g., joking with the person).

Research based on Niven and colleagues' classification has indicated that these distinct strategy types have different effects on the well-being of the people who use them and also on the people who they are used towards.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez-Íñigo, D., Poerio, G. L., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2013). The association between controlled interpersonal affect regulation and resource depletion. Applied Psychology: Health and Well-being.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Headley, T. (2012). Does regulating others' feelings influence people's own affective well-being? Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 246-260.&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have different implications for the quality of the relationship between these two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Holman, D., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2012). How to win friendship and trust by influencing people: An investigation of interpersonal affect regulation and the quality of relationships. Human Relations, 65, 777-805.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different way of distinguishing interpersonal emotion regulation strategies is according to the stage of the emotion that they focus on. Inspired by James Gross's process model of emotion,&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers have suggested that there is a difference between strategies that try to change the underlying emotion someone is feeling and strategies that try to change the emotion that the person expresses outwardly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. (2007). Building genuine trust through interpersonal emotion management: A threat regulation model of trust and collaboration across boundaries. Academy of Management Review, 32, 595-621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little, L. M., Kluemper, D., Nelson, D. L., &amp; Ward, A. (2013). More than Happy to Help? Customer‐Focused Emotion Management Strategies. Personnel Psychology, 66, 261-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychopathology ==
Patterns of interpersonal emotion dysregulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of mental health disorders.

=== Anxiety disorders ===
[[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] are perpetuated by avoidance of feared stimuli. [[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]] behaviors can include the presence of "safety people", who reduce the anxious individual's distress while [[Negative Reinforcement|negatively reinforcing]] the avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=Stefan G.|date=2014-05-23|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Model of Mood and Anxiety Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=38|issue=5|pages=483–492|doi=10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|issn=0147-5916}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual with panic disorder may ask her partner to drive her to work, which alleviates her fear of having a panic attack while driving. This pattern may lead to reliance upon others and contribute to continued avoidance (e.g. of driving a car alone). Another interpersonal strategy used in anxiety disorders is reassurance seeking. For example, someone with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] may rely upon a roommate to assure them that the doors have been locked, or an individual with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] may ask a romantic partner for reassurances of love.

=== Depression ===
Individuals with depression experience maladaptive interpersonal interactions, which contribute to their depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammen|first=Constance|date=2018-06-07|title=Stress Generation and Depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors include greater expressed negativity (e.g. criticism, blaming, demanding, and disengagement) toward romantic partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davila|first=Joanne|last2=Bradbury|first2=Thomas N.|last3=Cohan|first3=Catherine L.|last4=Tochluk|first4=Shelly|date=1997|title=Marital functioning and depressive symptoms: Evidence for a stress generation model.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=73|issue=4|pages=849–861|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative feedback seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swann|first=William B.|last2=Wenzlaff|first2=Richard M.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|last4=Pelham|first4=Brett W.|date=1992|title=Allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=101|issue=2|pages=293–306|doi=10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|issn=0021-843X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive reassurance seeking is also a vulnerability factor for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joiner|first=Thomas E.|last2=Metalsky|first2=Gerald I.|date=2001-09|title=Excessive Reassurance Seeking: Delineating a Risk Factor Involved in the Development of Depressive Symptoms|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00369|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=371–378|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00369|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborne|first=David W.

Social interaction that diverts attention away from self-referential negative thinking and promotes cognitive reappraisal may help to alleviate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011-12|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borderline personality disorder ===
According to the [[Biosocial theory|biosocial model]],&lt;ref&gt;Linehan, M. M. (1993). Cognitive-behavioral treatment of borderline personality disorder. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] develop intense emotional expression in part because they have been reinforced throughout development. For instance, a teenager with heightened emotional sensitivity is not taken seriously by her family until she threatens a suicide attempt. If her family responds with attention to extreme emotional expressions, she will learn to continue to express emotions in this way. Venting is another interpersonal emotion regulation strategy that is associated with personality disorder symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vollrath|first=Margarete|last2=Alnæs|first2=Randolf|last3=Torgersen|first3=Svenn|date=1998|title=Coping Styles Predict Change in Personality Disorders*|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fguilfordjournals.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1521%2Fpedi.1998.12.3.198|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=3|pages=198–209|doi=10.1521/pedi.1998.12.3.198|issn=0885-579X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon-Gordon|first=Katherine L.|last2=Haliczer|first2=Lauren A.|last3=Conkey|first3=Lindsey C.|last4=Whalen|first4=Diana J.|date=2018|title=Difficulties in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: Initial Development and Validation of a Self-Report Measure|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=40|issue=3|pages=528–549|doi=10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|issn=0882-2689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===
Certain types of psychotherapy target interpersonal factors to improve well-being. [[Dialectical behavior therapy|Dialectical behavioral therapy]], originally developed for individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]], teaches clients interpersonal effectiveness, which includes a variety of skills for communicating emotions in a clear and socially acceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Thomas R.|last2=Trost|first2=William T.|last3=Salsman|first3=Nicholas|last4=Linehan|first4=Marsha M.|date=2007|title=Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=181–205|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|issn=1548-5943|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assertiveness|Assertiveness training]] is a behavioral intervention that teaches verbal and non-verbal assertiveness skills to inhibit anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Jerome D.|date=1958|title=Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition by Joseph Wolpe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=2|issue=1|pages=123–125|doi=10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|issn=1529-8795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment measures ==

Several questionnaires have been developed to measure people's self-reported use of interpersonal emotion regulation, including the Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS),&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure.

=== Emotion Regulation of Others and Self ===
The Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS) questionnaire &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure. Current Psychology, 30, 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; is a freely available measure that assess strategies used to improve or worsen either one's own or another person's emotions, yielding a two-by-two framework: 1) intrinsic affect-improving, 2) intrinsic affect-worsening, 3) extrinsic affect-improving, and 4) extrinsic affect-worsening. The ''intrinsic'' subscale measures [[emotion self-regulation]] using 10 items. The ''extrinsic'' subscale measures deliberate attempts to improve or worsen others' emotions using 9 items.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erosresearch.org/index.php/resources/tools/&lt;/ref&gt; There is low item endorsement for the affect-worsening dimension, suggesting that people rarely make deliberate attempts to worsen their own or others' emotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, extrinsic affect-worsening is associated with health-related impairments, suggesting detrimental effects of engaging in these strategies likely due to negative social repercussions. Additionally, the affect-improving factor is unrelated to current levels of affect, which may be attributed to the scale's [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] properties or to a discrepancy between current mood state and strategy use (e.g., reporting use of affect-improving strategies more often while in a negative mood state).

=== Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hofmann, S. G., Carpenter, J. K., &amp; Curtiss, J. (2016). Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ): Scale development and psychometric characteristics. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 40, 341-356. doi: 0.1007/s10608-016-9756-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 20-item measure designed to assess how individuals regulate their own emotions through the use of others. The questionnaire was developed through [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews with participants (e.g., "When you are feeling down, in what ways do you look to other people to help you feel better?"), whose responses were [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] tested using exploratory and confirmatory [[factor analysis]] to derive 4 factors containing 5 items each. The 4 factors include Enhancing Positive Affect (seeking social interaction to enhance happiness), Perspective Taking (recruiting others to point out that other people are in a worse situation), Soothing (seeking comfort and sympathy from others), and Social Modeling (observing others for examples of how to cope).

=== Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ)&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=W. Craig|last2=Morelli|first2=Sylvia A.|last3=Ong|first3=Desmond C.|last4=Zaki|first4=Jamil|date=2018|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation: Implications for affiliation, perceived support, relationships, and well-being.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000132|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=115|issue=2|pages=224–254|doi=10.1037/pspi0000132|issn=1939-1315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 16-item measure of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation that assesses individuals' ''tendency'' to recruit social resources in response to emotional events, as well as their perceived [[Self-efficacy|''efficacy'']] of how effective interpersonal strategies are in improving their emotional experiences. Because it is a less common for individuals to deliberately worsen their mood,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliot|first=Andrew J.|last2=Thrash|first2=Todd M.|date=2002|title=Approach-avoidance motivation in personality: Approach and avoidance temperaments and goals.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=82|issue=5|pages=804–818|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; the measure focuses on increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions. High interpersonal emotion regulation tendency and efficacy is related to greater emotional expressivity, empathy, social connectedness, and supportive relationships.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Individuals who score high on efficacy are more likely to benefit from social support.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion ===
The Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion (DIRE)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a self-report measure of maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies that may relate to [[psychopathology]]. Respondents rate how likely they would be to use a variety of strategies in response to three vignettes about stressful hypothetical scenarios (task-oriented, romantic, social). The DIRS consists of four factors, including two intrapersonal (Accept, Avoid) and two interpersonal (Reassurance-seek, Vent) classes of strategies. Reassurance-seeking is related to overall emotion dysregulation, as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] symptoms. Both reassurance-seeking and venting are associated with negative affect, interpersonal problems, stress, and [[borderline personality disorder]] symptoms.

'''Kintech Lab''' is a software company headquartered in Russia. It provides [[Application software|computer simulation software]] in the areas of [[combustion]], [[energy sources]], [[photonics]], [[microelectronics]], [[nanotechnology]]. Also Kintech Lab is the [[R &amp; D]] company performing [[Scientific method|scientific]] research projects in the above-mentioned areas. &lt;br&gt;
Kintech Lab was established in 1998 by a group of scientists lead by Potapkin Boris from [[Kurchatov Institute|RSC Kurchatov Institute]].

==History==

The company was founded in 1998 by a group of scientists lead by Potapkin Boris from Institute of Hydrogen Energy and Plasma Technology at [[Kurchatov Institute|RSC Kurchatov Institute]].

==Mission statement==
Traditional approach to the creation of new materials and technologies which is based on the sequential [[prototype]] creation and introducing modifications after prototype testing requires large time and financial expenses. In the frame of this approach simulation in many cases is used just for description of the obtained experimental data and [[extrapolation]] of these data using particular model [[approximation]]. In this case the understanding of the detailed mechanism on the atomic level is not necessary. This fact does not allow utilizing the great amount of information on the properties of materials and processes which is obtained by the fundamental scientific researches.

Progress in theoretical methods, development of efficient computational [[algorithms]], continuous exponential growth of computer resources and recent advances in massively [[parallel computing]], make it possible to apply the alternative approach. This approach implies an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] [[simulation]] of the materials and processes based on the detailed understanding of structure and mechanism on the atomic level. In the frame of this approach simulation precedes the prototype creation allowing to significantly decreasing of the amount of the experimental tests and hence to decrease the development cost and time and to decrease innovation risks.
This is why the Kintech Lab’s main activity is the development of methods, algorithms and corresponding software for the predictive [[multiscale modeling]] of the properties of materials, processes and devices based on the [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] calculations, [[computer modeling]] and fundamental experimental data.

== Products ==
* [[Chemical WorkBench]] - a software for the development and reduction of kinetic mechanisms
* [[Khimera]] - a software for the first principles-based calculation of microscopic parameters of physico-chemical processes
* MD-kMC - a software for simulating [[atom]]istic processes using [[molecular mechanics]] and kinetic [[Monte-Carlo simulation|Monte-Carlo methods]]

{{History of printing}}
'''Lithography''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]]'', lithos|stone||''[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]'', graphein|to write}})&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lithography |volume=16 |pages=785–789 |first=Frederick Vincent |last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[printing]] originally based on the [[miscibility|immiscibility]] of oil and water.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Peter. (1964) ''The Technique of Lithography''. London: [[B.T. Batsford]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The printing is from a stone ([[lithographic limestone]]) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor [[Alois Senefelder]] as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. (1998) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterpage11"&gt;Carter, Rob, Ben Day, Philip Meggs. Typographic Design: Form and Communication, Third Edition. (2002) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Lithography can be used to print text or [[artwork (graphic arts)|artwork]] onto paper or other suitable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lithography and Lithographers |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher |place=London |year=1915 |editor=Pennel ER |url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level [[lithographic limestone]] plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and [[gum arabic]], ''[[etching]]'' the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an [[offset ink|oil-based ink]] could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank [[paper]] sheet, producing a [[printing|printed page]]. This traditional technique is still used in some [[fine art]] printmaking applications.

In modern lithography, the image is made of a [[polymer]] coating applied to a flexible plastic or metal plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk/digital-photographic.html|title=Digital &amp; Photographic|first=James|last=Hill|website=www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image can be printed directly from the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be [[offset printing|offset]], by transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.

As a printing technology, lithography is different from [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] (gravure), wherein a plate is either [[engraving|engraved]], [[etching|etched]], or [[mezzotint|stippled]] to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and [[woodblock printing]] or [[letterpress]] printing, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with [[offset lithography]], which has become the most common form of printing technology since the 1960s.

The related term "[[photolithography]]" refers to when photographic images are used in lithographic printing, whether these images are printed directly from a stone or from a metal plate, as in offset printing. "Photolithography" is used synonymously with "offset printing".  The technique as well as the term were introduced in Europe in the 1850s. Beginning in the 1960s, photolithography has played an important role in the fabrication and [[mass production]] of [[integrated circuit]]s  in the [[microelectronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, John. editor. ''Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, index, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis (2008). {{ISBN|9780415972352}}. page 865.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansuripur, Masud. ''Classical Optics and Its Applications''. Cambridge University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780521804998}}. page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of lithography==
Lithography uses simple chemical processes to create an image.  For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("[[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("[[hydrophilic]]").  Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]], [[letterpress printing]]).

Lithography was invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1796.  In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of [[limestone]] was used (hence the name "lithography": "lithos" (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone).  After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of [[gum arabic]] in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and was repelled by the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.

===Lithography on limestone===
[[Image:Litography negative stone and positive paper.jpg|thumb|Lithography stone and [[mirror image]] print of a map of Munich]]

Lithography works because of the mutual [[Hydrophobe|repulsion of oil and water]]. The image is drawn on the surface of the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the [[lipid]] content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous [[solution]] of [[gum arabic]], weakly acidified with nitric acid {{chem|HNO|3}} is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of [[calcium nitrate]] salt, {{chem|Ca(NO|3|)|2}}, and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic [[turpentine]], the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hoen &amp; Co.|A. B. Hoen]], Discussion of the Requisite Qualities of Lithographic Limestone, with Report on Tests of the Lithographic Stone of Mitchell County, Iowa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA339&amp;pg=RA1-PA339 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1902], Des Moines, 1903; pages 339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gascoigne|first1=Bamber|title=How to Identify Prints: a complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to ink jet|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=Spain|page=1c}}&lt;/ref&gt; When printing, the stone is kept wet with water. Naturally the water is attracted to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. [[Printing ink]] based on drying oils such as [[linseed oil]] and varnish loaded with [[pigment]] is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the greasy ink but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.

Senefelder had experimented during the early 19th century with multicolor lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by [[Godefroy Engelmann]] (France) in 1837 known as [[chromolithography]].&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge was to keep the images aligned (''[[Printing registration|in register]]''). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.

"Lithography, or printing from soft stone, largely took the place of engraving in the production of English commercial maps after about 1852. It was a quick, cheap process and had been used to print British army maps during the [[Peninsula War]]. Most of the commercial maps of the second half of the 19th century were lithographed and unattractive, though accurate enough."&lt;ref&gt;Lynam, Edward. 1944. British Maps and Map Makers. London: W. Collins. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern lithographic process===
{{main|Offset printing}}
[[Image:Gubernie zachodnie krolestwo polskie 1902.jpg|thumb|A 1902 lithograph map (original size 33×24 cm)]]

High-volume lithography is used presently to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[Offset printing|offset lithography]].

For offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used instead of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]].  A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created by direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device known as a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. Non-image portions of the emulsion have traditionally been removed by a chemical process, though in recent times plates have come available that do not require such processing.

[[Image:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich]]
[[Image:Lithography machine in Bibliotheca Alexandrina.jpg|thumb|right|Lithography machine in [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The plate is affixed to a cylinder on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank portions of the plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area. Hydrophobic ink, which is repelled by the water and only adheres to the emulsion of the image area, is then applied by the inking rollers.

If this image were transferred directly to paper, it would create a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber ''blanket'', which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or ''offset'' to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as ''offset lithography'' or ''[[offset printing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see diagram at [http://www.compassrose.com/static/Offset.jpg compassrose.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many innovations and technical refinements have been made in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of [[Printing press|presses]] with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass on both sides of the sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (''webs'') of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren, instead of the old method (conventional dampening) which is still used on older presses, using rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a "delta effect or vario," which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as "hickies".

The process of lithography printing is illustrated by [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/printing/images/offsetlitho.gif this simplified diagram]. This press is also called an ink pyramid because the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production.

The advent of [[desktop publishing]] made it possible for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital [[imagesetter]]s enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital [[platesetter]] during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as [[computer to plate]] printing.

==Microlithography and nanolithography==
{{Main|Photolithography}}
Microlithography and [[nanolithography]] refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 [[micrometers]] are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 [[nanometers]] are considered nanolithographic. [[Photolithography]] is one of these methods, often applied to [[semiconductor]] manufacturing of [[integrated circuit|microchips]]. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated [[photomask]] or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.

Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example [[electron beam lithography]], are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of [[maskless lithography]], in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a [[resist]]-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.

In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and [[nanolithography|nanolithographic]] technologies exist or are being developed, including [[nanoimprint lithography]], [[interference lithography]], [[X-ray lithography]], [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]], [[magnetolithography]] and [[scanning probe lithography]]. Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.
Surface-charge lithography, in fact [[Plasma desorption mass spectrometry]] can be directly patterned on polar dielectric crystals via pyroelectric effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grilli | first1 = S. | last2 = Vespini | first2 = V. | last3 = Ferraro | first3 = P. | year = 2008 | title = Surface-charge lithography for direct pdms micro-patterning | url = | journal = Langmuir | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 13262–13265 | doi = 10.1021/la803046j | pmid=18986187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithography as an artistic medium==
[[File:Redon smiling-spider.jpg|thumb|left|''Smiling Spider'' by [[Odilon Redon]], 1891]]
During the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on [[printmaking]], mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. [[Godefroy Engelmann]], who moved his press from [[Mulhouse]] to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Géricault]]. After early experiments such as ''Specimens of Polyautography'' (1803),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=''Specimens of Polyautography, Consisting of Impressions taken from Original Drawings, Made on Stone purposely for this Work’' | date=1803|  publisher=Philipp André| location=London|  url=http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21118663020001551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had experimental works by  a number of British artists including [[Benjamin West]], [[Henry Fuseli]],  [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], [[Thomas Barker of Bath]],  [[Thomas Stothard]],   [[Henry Richard Greville]], [[Richard Cooper Jr.|Richard Cooper]],   [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]], and  [[William Henry Pyne]], London also became a center, and some of Géricault's prints were in fact produced there. [[Goya]] in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography—''The Bulls of Bordeaux'' of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of [[Daumier]], published in newspapers. [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] also continued to practice the medium in France, and [[Adolf Menzel]] in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by [[Manet]]. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Degas]] producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]s to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted.

[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self Portrait with Skeleton Arm'' by [[Edvard Munch]]]]
In the 1890s, color lithography gained success in part by the emergence of [[Jules Chéret]], known as the ''father of the modern poster'', whose work went on to inspire a new generation of poster designers and painters, most notably [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and former student of Chéret, [[Georges de Feure]]. By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.

During the 20th century, a group of artists, including [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Chagall]], [[Dufy]], [[Léger]], [[Matisse]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], and [[Picasso]], rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the [[Mourlot Studios]], also known as ''Atelier Mourlot'', a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, [[Fernand Mourlot]], invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on lithographic stones in order to create original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/36544351/PICASSO_LITHOGRAPHER_AND_ACTIVIST|title=Picasso lithographer and activist|last=Orozco|first=Miguel|publisher=Academia.edu|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot History of 20th century lithography by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Braque, Leger at Atelier Mourlot, French Institute Alliance Française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723085822/http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot |date=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mourlot, Fernand. ''Twentieth Century Posters.'' Wellfleet Press: Secaucus, New Jersey, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Wood]], [[George Bellows]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Max Kahn]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Eleanor Coen]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[David Hockney]], [[Susan Dorothea White]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] are a few of the artists who have produced most of their prints in the medium. [[M. C. Escher]] is considered a master of lithography, and many of his prints were created using this process. More than other printmaking techniques, [[printmaker]]s in lithography still largely depend on access to good [[Printer (publishing)|printer]]s, and the development of the medium has been greatly influenced by when and where these have been established.
{{Further|List of printmakers}}
As a special form of lithography, the serilith process is sometimes used. Seriliths are mixed media original prints created in a process in which an artist uses the [[lithograph]] and [[serigraph]] processes. The separations for both processes are hand-drawn by the artist. The serilith technique is used primarily to create fine art limited print editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrysideart.com/serigraphy.htm|title=What is a Serilith?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">A '''minimax theorem''' is a theorem providing conditions that guarantee that the [[max–min inequality]] is also an equality. 
The first theorem in this sense is [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s minimax theorem from 1928, which was considered the starting point of [[game theory]]. 
Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann's original theorem have appeared in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Du|editor1-first=Ding-Zhu|editor2-last=Pardalos|editor2-first=Panos M.|title=Minimax and Applications|date=1995|publisher=Springer US|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781461335573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Felix|last2=Brill|first2=Markus|last3=Suksompong|first3=Warut|year=2016|title=An ordinal minimax theorem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825615001670|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=95|pages=107–112|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2015.12.010|arxiv=1412.4198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zero-sum Games ==
The minimax theorem was first proven and published in 1928 by [[John von Neumann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Von Neumann |first=J. |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]] |volume=100 |year=1928 |issue= |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/BF01448847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is quoted as saying "''As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games … without that theorem … I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved''".&lt;ref name=Casti&gt;{{cite book

|year=1996
|page=19
|isbn=978-0-471-00261-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, von Neumann's minimax theorem states:

Let &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; be [[compact space|compact]] [[Convex set|convex]] sets. If &lt;math&gt;f: X \times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function that is convex-concave, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,y):X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is convex for fixed &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot):Y\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is concave for fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in X}\max_{y\in Y} f(x,y)=\max_{y\in Y}\min_{x\in X}f(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

{{Fats}}
In [[biochemistry]] and nutrition, '''monounsaturated fatty acids '''(abbreviated '''MUFAs''', or more plainly '''monounsaturated fats''') are [[fatty acids]] that have one [[double bond]] in the fatty acid chain with all of the remainder [[carbon]] [[atom]]s being [[single bond|single-bonded]]. By contrast, [[polyunsaturated]] fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one double bond.

==Molecular description==
[[Fatty acid]]s are long-chained [[molecule]]s having an [[alkyl]] group at one end and a [[carboxylic acid]] group at the other end. Fatty acid [[viscosity]] (thickness) and [[melting point|melting temperature]] increases with decreasing number of double bonds; therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids (more double bonds) and a lower melting point than [[saturated fat|saturated]] fatty acids (no double bonds). Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated resulting in a isotopic lattice structure.

Common monounsaturated fatty acids are [[palmitoleic acid]] (16:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7), cis-vaccenic acid (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;7) and [[oleic acid]] (18:1&amp;nbsp;n&amp;minus;9). Palmitoleic acid has 16 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group (and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end). It can be lengthened to the 18-carbon [[cis-vaccenic acid]]. Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group. The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a [[space-filling model]].

Monounsaturated fats protect against cardiovascular disease by providing more [[biological membrane|membrane]] fluidity than saturated fats, but they are more vulnerable to [[lipid peroxidation]] ([[rancidification|rancidity]]). The large scale KANWU study found that increasing monounsaturated fat and decreasing saturated fat intake could improve insulin sensitivity, but only when the overall fat intake of the diet was low.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Vessby B, Uusitupa M, Hermansen K, Riccardi G, Rivellese AA, Tapsell LC, Nälsén C, Berglund L, Louheranta A, Rasmussen BM, Calvert GD, Maffetone A, Pedersen E, Gustafsson IB, Storlien LH | title = Substituting dietary saturated for monounsaturated fat impairs insulin sensitivity in healthy men and women: The KANWU Study | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 312–9 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11317662 | doi = 10.1007/s001250051620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some monounsaturated fatty acids (in the same way as saturated fats) may promote [[insulin resistance]], whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids may be protective against insulin resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lovejoy JC | title = The influence of dietary fat on insulin resistance | journal = Current Diabetes Reports | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 435–40 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12643169 | doi = 10.1007/s11892-002-0098-y }}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies have shown that substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure. More physical activity was associated with a higher-oleic acid diet than one of a [[palmitic acid]] diet. From the study, it is shown that more monounsaturated fats lead to less anger and irritability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kien CL, Bunn JY, Tompkins CL, Dumas JA, Crain KI, Ebenstein DB, Koves TR, Muoio DM | title = Substituting dietary monounsaturated fat for saturated fat is associated with increased daily physical activity and resting energy expenditure and with changes in mood | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 689–97 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23446891 | pmc = 3607650 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.112.051730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of [[oleic acid]] along with other monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with [[breast cancer]] risk. The [[saturation index]] (SI) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme [[delta-9 desaturase]] (Δ9-d).&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Mediterranean diet]] is one heavily influenced by monounsaturated fats. People in Mediterranean countries consume more total fat than Northern European countries, but most of the fat is in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids from fish, vegetables, and certain meats like lamb, while consumption of saturated fat is minimal in comparison.
A 2017 review found evidence that the practice of a Mediterranean diet could lead to a decreased risk of [[cardiovascular diseases]], overall [[cancer]] incidence, [[neurodegenerative diseases]], [[diabetes]], and [[mortality rate|early death]].&lt;ref name=Dinu2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dinu|first1=M|last2=Pagliai|first2=G|last3=Casini|first3=A|last4=Sofi|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=10 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2017.58|pmid=28488692|volume=72|pages=30–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 review showed that the practice of the Mediterranean diet may improve overall health status, such as reduced risk of non-communicable diseases, reduced total [[cost of living|costs of living]], and reduced costs for national [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name="martinez-lacoba2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinez-Lacoba|first1=R|last2=Pardo-Garcia|first2=I|last3=Amo-Saus|first3=E|last4=Escribano-Sotos|first4=F|title=Mediterranean diet and health outcomes: a systematic meta-review.|journal=European Journal of Public Health|date= 2018|doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky113|pmid=29992229|volume=Advance articles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monounsaturated fats are found in animal flesh such as red [[meat]], whole milk products, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], and high fat fruits such as olives and [[avocado]]s.

'''''Nature''''' is a British [[multidisciplinary]] [[scientific journal]], first published on 4 November 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huxley | first1 = T.

Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are [[editorial]]s, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying ''supplementary material'' on the journal's website.

There are many fields of [[research]] in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in ''Nature.'' The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/get_published/index.html |title=Getting published in Nature : For authors and referees : Nature |website=nature.com |language=en |access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ''Nature'' (together with ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'') received the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Communications and Humanity.&lt;ref name=SciNat&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schroeder |first1=Robert |first2= Gretta E.|last2= Siegel | doi = 10.1353/scp.2006.0006 | year = 2006 | title = A Cooperative Publishing Model for Sustainable Scholarship| journal = Journal of Scholarly Publishing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 86–98 (88)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the [[Royal Society]], which had published many of the great works from [[Isaac Newton]], [[Michael Faraday]] through to early works from [[Charles Darwin]]. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Bar3"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Barton | first1 = R. 
| title = Just before Nature: The purposes of science and the purposes of popularization in some english popular science journals of the 1860s

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.&lt;ref name="Bar3"/&gt;

''Nature'', first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede ''Nature'' was ''[[Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation]]'', which, created in 1859, began as a [[natural history]] magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history.&lt;ref name="Bar7"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's name changed from its original title to ''Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science'' and then later to the ''Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Recreative Science'' had attempted to include more physical sciences such as [[astronomy]] and [[archaeology]], the ''Intellectual Observer'' broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; Similar to ''Recreative Science'' was the scientific journal ''[[Popular Science Review]]'', created in 1862,&lt;ref name="Bar13"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled "Scientific Summary" or "Quarterly Retrospect", with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.&lt;ref name="Bar13"/&gt; Two other journals produced in England prior to the development of ''Nature'' were the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' and ''[[Scientific Opinion]]'', established in 1864 and 1868, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; The journal most closely related to ''Nature'' in its editorship and format was ''The Reader'', created in 1864; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to ''Popular Science Review''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt;

These similar journals all ultimately failed. The ''Popular Science Review'' survived longest, lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881; ''Recreative Science'' ceased publication as the ''Student and Intellectual Observer'' in 1871. The ''Quarterly Journal'', after undergoing a number of editorial changes, ceased publication in 1885. ''The Reader'' terminated in 1867, and finally, ''Scientific Opinion'' lasted a mere 2 years, until June 1870.&lt;ref name="Bar7"/&gt;

===Creation ===
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First title page, 4 November 1869]]
Not long after the conclusion of ''The Reader'', a former editor, [[Norman Lockyer]], decided to create a new scientific journal titled ''Nature'',&lt;ref name="B248"&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; taking its name from a line by [[William Wordsworth]]: "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww698.html Poem: "A Volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found"]. Bartleby.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; First owned and published by [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], ''Nature'' was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Janet Browne has proposed that "far more than any other science journal of the period, ''Nature'' was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Many of the early editions of ''Nature'' consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the [[X Club]], a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period.&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Initiated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the group consisted of such important scientists as [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[John Tyndall]], along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as [[common descent]], a theory which, during the latter half of the 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made ''Nature'' a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. [[John Maddox]], editor of ''Nature'' from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; "journalism" Maddox states, "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start."&lt;ref name="Dinner"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1970|title=The 'Nature' Centenary Dinner|jstor=530861|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 25|issue=1|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1970.0002 |pages=9–15(13)|author1=Maddox, John  |author2=Macmillan, Harold  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.&lt;ref name="Dinner"/&gt;
 
====Editors====
[[Norman Lockyer]], the founder of ''Nature'', was a professor at [[Imperial College]]. He was succeeded as editor in 1919 by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]].&lt;ref name="NPG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/02_history.xml&amp;style=xml/02_history.xsl |title=Nature Publishing Group: History |website=nature.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115084545/http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml%2F02_history.xml&amp;style=xml%2F02_history.xsl |archivedate=15 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory helped to establish ''Nature'' in the international scientific community. His obituary by the Royal Society stated: "Gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science, and in the columns of ''Nature'' he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the International Scientific Unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Arman Gregory, 1864–1952|journal= Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume= 8|issue=22|pages=410–417 (413)|year=1953|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1953.0007 |author=Stratton, F. J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 1945 to 1973, editorship of ''Nature'' changed three times, first in 1945 to A. J. V. Gale and [[L. J. F. Brimble]] (who in 1958 became the sole editor), then to [[John Maddox]] in 1965, and finally to [[David 'Dai' Davies|David Davies]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt; In 1980, Maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995. [[Philip Campbell (scientist)|Philip Campbell]] has since become Editor-in-chief of all ''Nature'' publications.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt;

====Expansion and development====
In 1970, ''Nature'' first opened its Washington office; other branches opened in New York in 1985, Tokyo and Munich in 1987, Paris in 1989, San Francisco in 2001, Boston in 2004, and Hong Kong in 2005. In 1971, under [[John Maddox]]'s editorship, the journal split into ''Nature Physical Sciences'' (published on Mondays), ''Nature New Biology'' (published on Wednesdays) and ''Nature'' (published on Fridays). In 1974, Maddox was no longer editor, and the journals were merged into ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, the journal underwent a great deal of expansion, launching over ten new journals. These new journals comprise the Nature Publishing Group, which was created in 1999 and includes ''Nature'', Nature Publishing Group Journals, Stockton Press Specialist Journals and Macmillan Reference (renamed NPG Reference).

In 1996, ''Nature'' created its own website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline2.html|title = Branching out (1970–1999)|date = |accessdate = 2014-11-13|website = nature.com|publisher = Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 Nature Publishing Group began its series of ''Nature Reviews''.&lt;ref name="NPG" /&gt; Some articles and papers are available for free on the Nature website. Others require the purchase of premium access to the site. ''Nature'' claims an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-a-new-ipad-app-for-nature-readers-1.12002 | title=Announcement: A new iPad app for Nature readers | work=Nature | date=12 December 2012 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2008, ''Nature'' endorsed an American presidential candidate for the first time when it supported [[Barack Obama]] during his campaign in [[United States presidential election, 2008|America's 2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/4551149a |title=America's choice |year=2008 |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7217 |page=1149 |bibcode=2008Natur.455Q1149. |pmid=18971969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Angliss |url=http://www.scholarsandrogues.com/2008/10/31/nature-endorses-obama/ |title=Weekly science journal ''Nature'' endorses a presidential candidate: Barack Obama (updated) |website=Scholars &amp; Rogues |date=31 October 2008 |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, an [[Nature Arabic Edition|Arabic edition]] of the magazine was launched in partnership with [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]]. As of the time it was released, it had about 10,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=NatureME&gt;{{cite web |last= Yahia |first= Mohammed |title= Nature Arabic Edition launches |quote= The first issue of ''Nature Arabic Edition'', an Arabic translation of ''Nature'', has been released.

On 2 December 2014, ''Nature'' announced that it would allow its subscribers and a group of selected media outlets to share links allowing free, "read-only" access to content from its journals. These articles are presented using the [[digital rights management]] system [[ReadCube]] (which is funded by the Macmillan subsidiary Digital Science), and does not allow readers to download, copy, print, or otherwise distribute the content. While it does, to an extent, provide free online access to articles, it is not a true [[open access]] scheme due to its restrictions on re-use and distribution.&lt;ref name=wired-naturefreeview&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature journal subscribers can now share article links globally|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|website=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=3 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202182430/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-npgreadonly&gt;{{cite news|title=Science journal ''Nature'' to make archives available online|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/nature-archives-free|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2015, details of a proposed merger with Springer Science+Business Media were announced.&lt;ref&gt;Schuetze, Arno (15 January 2015). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/15/publishing-ma-idUSF9N0TV00F20150115 "Nature magazine publisher to merge with Springer Science"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 it came under the umbrella of Springer Nature, by the merger of [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and [[Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]]'s [[Nature Publishing Group]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], and [[Macmillan Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/press-releases/corporate/springer-nature-created-following-merger-completion/256626 |title=Springer Nature created following merger completion |date=6 May 2015 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication in Nature==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

Being published in ''Nature'' or any ''Nature'' publication is very prestigious. In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]), among the highest of any science journal.

As with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.

According to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:
{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.&lt;ref name=nature1869&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/mission.html |title=Nature's mission statement |accessdate=11 September 2008 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was revised in 2000 to:
{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science. Second, to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world, in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge, culture and daily life.&lt;ref name=nature2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/about/index.html |title=Nature's mission statement |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Controversies===
In 2017, Nature published an editorial entitled "Removing Statues of Historical figures risks whitewashing history: Science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past". The article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of [[J. Marion Sims]], the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American female slaves who were unable to give informed consent, and [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] who oversaw the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].  The editorial as written made the case that removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of "whitewashing history", and stated “Instead of removing painful reminders, perhaps these should be supplemented”. The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Science must acknowledge its past mistakes and crimes |date=4 September 2017 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-acknowledge-its-past-mistakes-and-crimes-1.22557?sf111543858=1&amp;WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist. Nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was "offensive and poorly worded" and published selected letters of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Readers respond to Nature’s Editorial on historical monuments |date=8 September 2017 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/readers-respond-to-nature-s-editorial-on-historical-monuments-1.22584 |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in the [[Unite the Right Rally|Unite the Right rally]] to oppose the removal of [[Robert Edward Lee Sculpture|a statue of Robert E. Lee]], setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman. When Nature posted a link to the editorial on [[Twitter]], the thread quickly exploded with criticisms. In response, several scientists called for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schulson |first=Michael |title=History Lessons for ‘Nature’|date=17 September 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/nature-journal-j-marion-sims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2017, the editorial was updated and edited by Philip Campbell, the editor of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Campbell |first=Philip |title=Statues: An Editorial Response|date= 18 September 2017 |newspaper=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/549334c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Paul Lauterbur]] and [[Peter Mansfield]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for research initially rejected by ''Nature'' and published only after Lauterbur appealed the rejection, ''Nature'' acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled, "Coping with Peer Rejection":
{{quote|[T]here are unarguable ''faux pas'' in our history. These include the rejection of [[Čherenkov radiation|Cherenkov radiation]], [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s [[meson]], work on [[photosynthesis]] by [[Johann Deisenhofer]], [[Robert Huber]] and [[Hartmut Michel]], and the initial rejection (but eventual acceptance) of [[Stephen Hawking]]'s [[Hawking radiation|black-hole radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/full/425645a.html |journal=Nature |date=16 October 2003 |title=Coping with peer rejection |volume=425 |page=645 |doi=10.1038/425645a |pmid=14562060 |issue=6959 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..645.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 2000 to 2001, a series of five fraudulent papers by [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön]] was published in ''Nature''. The papers, about [[semiconductors]], were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud. In 2003, ''Nature'' retracted the papers. The Schön scandal was not limited to ''Nature''; other prominent journals, such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Physical Review]]'', also retracted papers by Schön.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v422/n6927/index.html |journal=Nature |date=6 March 2003 |title=Retractions' realities |volume=422 |issue=6927 |page=1 |doi=10.1038/422001a |pmid=12621394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1988, after nearly a year of guided scrutiny from its editors, ''Nature'' published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing Dr. [[Jacques Benveniste]] and his team's work studying human [[Basophil granulocyte|basophil]] [[degranulation]] in the presence of extremely dilute [[antibody]] serum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vet-servis.ru/downloads/nature333-30-1988.pdf |title=vet-servis.ru |publisher=Vet-servis.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical [[law of mass action]]. The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from [[homeopathic]] medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted ''Nature'' to mandate an extensive, stringent and scientifically questionable experimental [[replication (statistics)|replication]] in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were categorically refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Before publishing one of its most famous discoveries, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s 1953 [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|paper]] on the [[structure of DNA]], ''Nature'' did not send the paper out for peer review. [[John Maddox]], ''Nature''{{'}}s editor, stated: "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by ''Nature'' ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=J. |doi=10.1038/426119b |title=How genius can smooth the road to publication |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6963 |page=119 |year=2003|bibcode=2003Natur.426..119M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier error occurred when [[Enrico Fermi]] submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak [[Fermi's interaction|interaction theory]] of [[beta decay]]. ''Nature'' turned down the paper because it was considered too remote from reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhodes, Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb|publisher= Touchstone|location= New York|date= 1986|isbn= 0-671-44133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi's paper was published by ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fermi |first1=E. |title=Versuch einer Theorie der β-Strahlen.

==Science fiction==
In 1999 ''Nature'' began publishing [[science fiction]] [[short stories]]. The brief "[[vignette (literature)|vignettes]]" are printed in a series called "Futures". The stories appeared in 1999 and 2000, again in 2005 and 2006, and have appeared weekly since July 2007.&lt;ref name="futures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/arts/futures/ | title=Futures | work=Nature | accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister publication ''[[Nature Physics]]'' also printed stories in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesPhysics"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nphys/archive/categ_fut_012008.html |title=Futures Archive |work= [[Nature Physics]] |accessdate= 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Nature'' was awarded the [[European Science Fiction Society]]'s Best Publisher award for the "Futures" series.&lt;ref name="ESFSAward"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esfs.info/esfs-awards-2000.html#2005 |title= The ESFS Awards, Eurocon 2005: Glasgow – Scotland |author= [[European Science Fiction Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred of the ''Nature'' stories between 1999 and 2006 were published as the collection ''Futures from Nature'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesCollection"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.tor-forge.com/futuresfromnature |title= Futures from Nature: 100 Speculative fictions from the pages of the leading science journal |editor= Henry Gee |publisher= [[Tor Books]] |date= 2008 |location= New York City |isbn= 0-7653-1805-9 |quote= With stories from: [[Arthur C.

==Publication ==
[[File:Nature Materials Nov 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Nature Materials]],'' a specialized journal from [[Nature Publishing Group]].]]
The journal has a weekly circulation of around 53,000 and a pass-along rate of 8.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Demographics: Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/advertising/resources/pdf/2010naturemediakit.pdf?prod_code=NATURE&amp;prod=Nature |website=nature.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513233735/http://www.nature.com/advertising/resources/pdf/2010naturemediakit.pdf?prod_code=NATURE&amp;prod=Nature |archivedate=2011-05-13}}, a profile of Nature's readership.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a readership of over 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Selling Your Publication — Circulation vs. Readership |url=http://www.ads-on-line.com/newbasiccourse/products/ |date=2013 |publisher=McInnis &amp; Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nature'' is edited and published in the United Kingdom by a division of the international [[scientific publishing]] company [[Springer Nature]] that publishes [[academic journal]]s, [[magazine]]s, online databases, and services in science and medicine. ''Nature'' has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[Boston]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Basingstoke]]. Nature Publishing Group also publishes other specialized journals including ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''[[Nature Biotechnology]],'' ''[[Nature Methods]]'', the ''[[Nature Clinical Practice]]'' series of journals, ''[[Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology]]'', ''[[Nature Chemistry]]'', and the ''Nature Reviews'' series of journals.

Since 2005, each issue of ''Nature'' has been accompanied by a ''[[Nature Podcast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/archive.html | work = Nature |title = Archive: Nature Podcast |accessdate = 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring highlights from the issue and interviews with the articles' authors and the journalists covering the research. It is presented by Kerri Smith, and features interviews with scientists on the latest research, as well as news reports from Nature's editors and journalists. The Nature Podcast was founded – and the first 100 episodes were produced and presented – by clinician and virologist [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Chris Smith]] of Cambridge and ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.

In 2007, Nature Publishing Group began publishing ''Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics'', the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics and ''Molecular Therapy'', the American Society of Gene Therapy's official journal, as well as the ''International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) Journal''. Nature Publishing Group launched ''Nature Photonics'' in 2007 and ''Nature Geoscience'' in 2008. ''Nature Chemistry'' published its first issue in April 2009.

Nature Publishing Group actively supports the self-archiving process and in 2002 was one of the first publishers to allow authors to post their contributions on their personal websites, by requesting an exclusive licence to publish, rather than requiring authors to transfer copyright. In December 2007, Nature Publishing Group introduced the Creative Commons attribution-non commercial-share alike unported licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism's genome for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1864.html |title=Interview with Timo Hannay, director of web publishing for Nature Publishing Group |work=Jon Udell's Interviews with Innovators |date=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a collection of articles from ''Nature'' was edited by John S. Partington under the title ''H. G. Wells in Nature, 1893–1946: A Reception Reader'' and published by Peter Lang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Partington, John S. |year=2008 |title=H. G.

A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.

Neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from [[biology]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], and [[electronic engineering]] to  design  artificial neural systems, such as [[Machine vision|vision systems]], head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1155/2012/705483| title = Qualitative Functional Decomposition Analysis of Evolved Neuromorphic Flight Controllers| journal = Applied Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing| volume = 2012| pages = 1–21| year = 2012| last1 = Boddhu | first1 = S.

==Examples==
As early as 2006, researchers at [[Georgia Tech]] published a field programmable neural array.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A field programmable neural array|last = Farquhar|first = Ethan|date = May 2006|journal = IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems|pages = 4114–4117|last2 = Hasler|first2 = Paul.|doi = 10.1109/ISCAS.2006.1693534|isbn = 978-0-7803-9389-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chip was the first in a line of increasingly complex arrays of floating gate transistors that allowed programmability of charge on the gates of [[MOSFET]]s to model the channel-ion characteristics of neurons in the brain and was one of the first cases of a silicon programmable array of neurons.

In November 2011, a group of [[MIT]] researchers created a computer chip that mimics the analog, ion-based communication in a synapse between two neurons using 400 transistors and standard [[CMOS]] manufacturing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT creates "brain chip"|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/105067-mit-creates-brain-chip|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuromorphic silicon paper"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neuromorphic silicon neurons and large-scale neural networks: challenges and opportunities|doi=10.3389/fnins.2011.00108|pmid=21991244|pmc=3181466|volume=5|pages=108|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|year=2011|last1=Poon|first1=Chi-Sang|last2=Zhou|first2=Kuan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, [[spintronic]] researchers at [[Purdue University|Purdue]] presented a paper on the design of a neuromorphic chip using [[Spin valve|lateral spin valve]]s and [[memristor]]s. They argue that the architecture works similarly to neurons and can therefore be used to test methods of reproducing the brain's processing. In addition, these chips are significantly more energy-efficient than conventional ones.&lt;ref name="Spin Devices Prop"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|title=Proposal For Neuromorphic Hardware Using Spin Devices|eprint=1206.3227|last1=Sharad|first1=Mrigank|last2=Augustine|first2=Charles|last3=Panagopoulos|first3=Georgios|last4=Roy|first4=Kaushik|class=cond-mat.dis-nn|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at [[HP Labs]] on Mott memristors has shown that while they can be non-[[Volatile memory|volatile]], the volatile behavior exhibited at temperatures significantly below the [[phase transition]] temperature can be exploited to fabricate a [[neuristor]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a biologically-inspired device that mimics behavior found in neurons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat3510| pmid = 23241533| title = A scalable neuristor built with Mott memristors| journal = Nature Materials| volume = 12| issue = 2| pages = 114–7| year = 2012| last1 = Pickett | first1 = M.

The circuit board is composed of 16 custom-designed chips, referred to as NeuroCores. Each NeuroCore's analog circuitry is designed to emulate neural elements for 65536 neurons, maximizing energy efficiency. The emulated neurons are connected using digital circuitry designed to maximize spiking throughput.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/503022a|pmid = 24201264|title = Neuroelectronics: Smart connections|journal = Nature|volume = 503|issue = 7474|pages = 22–4|year = 2013|last1 = Waldrop|first1 = M.

A research project with implications for neuromorphic engineering is the [[Human Brain Project]] that is attempting to simulate a complete human brain in a supercomputer using biological data. It is made up of a group of researchers in neuroscience, medicine, and computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Involved Organizations|url=http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/partners.html|accessdate=22 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302142627/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/partners.html|archivedate=2 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Markram]], the project's co-director, has stated that the project proposes to establish a foundation to explore and understand the brain and its diseases, and to use that knowledge to build new computing technologies. The three primary goals of the project are to better understand how the pieces of the brain fit and work together, to understand how to objectively diagnose and treat brain diseases, and to use the understanding of the human brain to develop neuromorphic computers. That the simulation of a complete human brain will require a supercomputer a thousand times more powerful than today's encourages the current focus on neuromorphic computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Brain Project|url=http://www.humanbrainproject.eu|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; $1.3 billion has been allocated to the project by The [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Human Brain Project and Recruiting More Cyberwarriors|url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/human-brain-project-and-recruiting-more-cyberwarriors|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuromemristive systems==
Neuromemristive systems are a subclass of neuromorphic computing systems that focus on the use of [[memristors]] to implement [[neuroplasticity]].  While neuromorphic engineering focuses on mimicking biological behavior, neuromemristive systems focus on abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kudithipudi, "Towards intelligent computing with neuromemristive circuits and systems," Sandia NICE Workshop, 2014, http://digitalops.sandia.gov/Mediasite/Play/a10cf6ceb55d47608bb8326dd00e46611d&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a neuromemristive system may replace the details of a [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] microcircuit's behavior with an abstract neural network model.&lt;ref&gt;C. Merkel and D. Kudithipudi, "Neuromemristive extreme learning machines for pattern classification," ISVLSI, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist several neuron inspired threshold logic functions&lt;ref name="Maan 1–13"/&gt; implemented with memristors that have applications in high level [[pattern recognition]] applications. Some of the applications reported  recently include [[speech recognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Memristor pattern recogniser: isolated speech word recognition|journal = Electronics Letters|pages = 1370–1372|volume = 51|issue = 17|doi = 10.1049/el.2015.1428|first = A.K.|last = Maan|first2 = A.P.|last2 = James|first3 = S.|last3 = Dimitrijev|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[face recognition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Memristive Threshold Logic Face Recognition|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091401535X|journal = Procedia Computer Science|date = 2014-01-01|pages = 98–103|volume = 41|series = 5th Annual International Conference on Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures, 2014 BICA|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2014.11.090|first = Akshay Kumar|last = Maan|first2 = Dinesh S.|last2 = Kumar|first3 = Alex Pappachen|last3 = James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[object recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Memristive Threshold Logic Circuit Design of Fast Moving Object Detection|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6922587|journal = IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1063-8210|pages = 2337–2341|volume = 23|issue = 10|doi = 10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2359801|first = A.K.|last = Maan|first2 = D.S.|last2 = Kumar|first3 = S.|last3 = Sugathan|first4 = A.P.|last4 = James|arxiv = 1410.1267}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also find applications in replacing conventional digital logic gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Resistive Threshold Logic|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6409487|journal = IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1063-8210|pages = 190–195|volume = 22|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/TVLSI.2012.2232946|first = A.P.|last = James|first2 = L.R.V.J.|last2 = Francis|first3 = D.S.|last3 = Kumar|arxiv = 1308.0090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Threshold Logic Computing: Memristive-CMOS Circuits for Fast Fourier Transform and Vedic Multiplication|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7001253|journal = IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 1063-8210|pages = 2690–2694|volume = 23|issue = 11|doi = 10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2371857|first = A.P.|last = James|first2 = D.S.|last2 = Kumar|first3 = A.|last3 = Ajayan|arxiv = 1411.5255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ideal passive memristive circuits, it is possible to derive a differential equation for evolution of the internal memory of the circuit:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caravelli |first= et al. |arxiv=1608.08651 |title=The complex dynamics of memristive circuits: analytical results and universal slow relaxation |year=2017 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.022140 |pmid= 28297937 |volume=95 |issue= 2 |pages= 022140 |journal=Physical Review E|bibcode=2017PhRvE..95b2140C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \vec W=\alpha \vec W-\frac{1}{\beta} (I+\xi \Omega W)^{-1} \Omega \vec S &lt;/math&gt;

as a function of the properties of the physical memristive network and the external sources.
In the equation above, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the "forgetting" time scale constant, &lt;math&gt; \xi=r-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r=\frac{R_{off}}{R_{on}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of ''off'' and ''on'' values of the limit resistances of the memristors, &lt;math&gt; \vec S &lt;/math&gt; is the vector of the sources of the circuit and &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a projector on the fundamental loops of the circuit. The diagonal matrix and vector &lt;math&gt;W=diag(\vec W)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec W&lt;/math&gt; respectively, are instead the internal value of the memristors, with values between 0 and 1. This equation thus requires adding extra constraints on the memory values in order to be reliable.

'''Pepperwood Preserve''' is a 3,117 acre plot of land owned by the Pepperwood Foundation, located in the [[Mayacamas Mountains]] in the coast ranges of California near the towns of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] and [[Healdsburg]] in [[Sonoma County]]. The preserve includes the headwaters of Mark West Creek, Franz Creek, and Brooks Creek all of which feed into the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]]. The highest point on the preserve is 1,560 feet.

==Management==

The [[California Academy of Science]] sold the preserve in 2005 to Healdsburg residents Herb and Jane Dwight, who sit on the five-member Pepperwood Foundation board of directors and have donated over $20 million for land and facilities at the preserve.  Herb Dwight is the former CEO of Optical Coating Laboratory in Santa Rosa.  The facilities include a $9 million, 9,400 square foot, solar-powered center for environmental research and education.  The preserve has an agreement with [[Santa Rosa Junior College and Sonoma State University]] to use the site for field studies.  Lisa Micheli, with a Ph.D. in geomorphology, was hired as executive director in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Climate==
Pepperwood has a Mediterranean climate that includes cool wet winters (Nov-Apr) and hot dry summers (May-Oct). Streams are intermittent. During the wet winter, standing water can be found in numerous small ponds.

==Geological history==
Pepperwood's geology is complex with exposures of Glen Ellen sediments, Sonoma volcanics and Franciscan metamorphics. There are several areas with serpentine soils.

==Vegetation==
Pepperwood includes redwood and Douglas-fir forests on mesic sites and grassland, woodland, and chaparral on xeric sites. Wetlands are composed of riparian forests, springs, marshes, ponds, and vernal pools.

{{Cosmology}}
'''Physical cosmology''' is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the [[Universe]] and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate.&lt;ref name=GFR_Ellis&gt;For an overview, see {{cite book |chapter=Issues in the Philosophy of Cosmology |author=George FR Ellis |arxiv=astro-ph/0602280 |isbn=978-0-444-51560-5 |publisher=North Holland |title=Philosophy of Physics (Handbook of the Philosophy of Science) 3 volume set |editor=Jeremy Butterfield &amp; John Earman|bibcode = 2006astro.ph..2280E |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cosmology]] as a [[science]] originated with the [[Copernican principle]], which implies that [[astronomical object|celestial bodies]] obey identical [[physical law]]s to those on Earth, and [[Newtonian mechanics]], which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, [[Edwin Hubble]] discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external [[Galaxy|galaxies]] beyond our own [[Milky Way]]; then, work by [[Vesto Slipher]] and others showed that the universe is [[expanding universe|expanding]]. These advances made it possible to speculate about the [[origin of the universe]], and allowed the establishment of the [[Big Bang]] Theory, by [[Georges Lemaître]], as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cosmologystatement.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401081546/http://cosmologystatement.org/|title=An Open Letter to the Scientific Community as published in New Scientist, May 22, 2004|last=|first=|date=2014-04-01|website=cosmologystatement.org|archive-date=1 April 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.

Dramatic advances in observational cosmology since the 1990s, including the [[cosmic microwave background]], distant [[supernovae]] and galaxy [[redshift survey]]s, have led to the development of a [[Lambda-CDM model|standard model of cosmology]]. This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] whose nature is currently not well understood, but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations.&lt;ref name="PDG"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pdg.ge.infn.it/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-cosmological-parameters.pdf | title=2013 Review of Particle Physics | author=Beringer, J. | author2=et al.

Cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of research in theoretical and applied [[physics]]. Areas relevant to cosmology include [[particle physics]] experiments and [[particle physics phenomenology|theory]], theoretical and observational [[astrophysics]], [[general relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[plasma physics]].

Modern cosmology developed along tandem tracks of theory and observation. In 1916, Albert Einstein published his theory of [[general relativity]], which provided a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize Biography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Einstein believed in a [[static universe]], but found that his original formulation of the theory did not permit it.&lt;ref name="Liddle, A. 51"&gt;{{cite book | author = Liddle, A. | title = An Introduction to Modern Cosmology | publisher = Wiley | page=51 | isbn =978-0-470-84835-7 | date = 2003-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because masses distributed throughout the universe gravitationally attract, and move toward each other over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vilenkin | first = Alex | title = Many worlds in one : the search for other universes | publisher = Hill and Wang, A division of Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | date = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-8090-6722-0 | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he realized that his equations permitted the introduction of a constant term which could counteract the attractive force of gravity on the cosmic scale. Einstein published his first paper on relativistic cosmology in 1917, in which he added this ''[[cosmological constant]]'' to his field equations in order to force them to model a static universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Mark |last2=Lambourne |first2=Robert | title = An introduction to galaxies and cosmology | publisher = Open University Cambridge University Press | location = Milton Keynes Cambridge, UK New York | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-54623-2 | page= 228}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Einstein model describes a static universe; space is finite and unbounded (analogous to the surface of a sphere, which has a finite area but no edges). However, this so-called Einstein model is unstable to small perturbations—it will eventually start to [[metric expansion of space|expand]] or contract.&lt;ref name="Liddle, A. 51"/&gt; It was later realized that Einstein's model was just one of a larger set of possibilities, all of which were consistent with general relativity and the cosmological principle. The cosmological solutions of general relativity were found by [[Alexander Friedmann]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Mark |last2=Lambourne |first2=Robert | title = An introduction to galaxies and cosmology | publisher = Open University Cambridge University Press | location = Milton Keynes Cambridge, UK New York | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-54623-2 |page=232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His equations describe the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] universe, which may expand or contract, and whose geometry may be open, flat, or closed.

In the 1910s, [[Vesto Melvin Slipher|Vesto Slipher]] (and later [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]]) interpreted the [[red shift]] of [[nebula|spiral nebulae]] as a [[Doppler shift]] that indicated they were receding from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Slipher | first1=V. M. | title=Further Notes on Spectrographic Observations of Nebulae and Clusters | journal=Publications of the American Astronomical Society| volume=4 | editor1-first=Philip | editor1-last=Fox | editor2-first=Joel | editor2-last=Stebbins | date=1922 | pages=284–286 | bibcode=1922PAAS....4..284S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Seitter | first1=Waltraut C. | last2=Duerbeck | first2=Hilmar W. | title=Carl Wilhelm Wirtz – Pioneer in Cosmic Dimensions  | journal=Harmonizing Cosmic Distance Scales in a Post-Hipparcos Era | series=ASP Conference Series | volume=167 | editor1-first=Daniel | editor1-last=Egret | editor2-first=Andre | editor2-last=Heck | isbn=978-1-886733-88-6 | date=1999 | pages=237–242 | bibcode=1999ASPC..167..237S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult to determine the distance to astronomical objects. One way is to compare the physical size of an object to its [[angular size]], but a physical size must be assumed to do this. Another method is to measure the [[brightness]] of an object and assume an intrinsic [[luminosity]], from which the distance may be determined using the [[inverse square law]]. Due to the difficulty of using these methods, they did not realize that the nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own [[Milky Way]], nor did they speculate about the cosmological implications. In 1927, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] [[Georges Lemaître]] independently derived the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker equations and proposed, on the basis of the recession of spiral nebulae, that the universe began with the "explosion" of a "primeval [[atom]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Lemaître | first1=G. | title=Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques | journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | pages=49–59 | date=1927 | language=French | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L }}&lt;/ref&gt;—which was later called the [[Big Bang]]. In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] provided an observational basis for Lemaître's theory. Hubble showed that the spiral nebulae were galaxies by determining their distances using measurements of the brightness of [[Cepheid variable]] stars. He discovered a relationship between the redshift of a galaxy and its distance. He interpreted this as evidence that the galaxies are receding from Earth in every direction at speeds proportional to their distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Hubble | first1=Edwin  | title=A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=168–173 | date=March 1929 | doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168  | bibcode=1929PNAS...15..168H | pmid=16577160 | pmc=522427}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is now known as [[Hubble's law]], though the numerical factor Hubble found relating recessional velocity and distance was off by a factor of ten, due to not knowing about the types of Cepheid variables.

Given the [[cosmological principle]], Hubble's law suggested that the universe was expanding. Two primary explanations were proposed for the expansion. One was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow. The other explanation was [[Fred Hoyle]]'s [[steady state model]] in which new matter is created as the galaxies move away from each other. In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Hoyle | first1=F. | title=A New Model for the Expanding Universe | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=108 | issue=5 | pages=372–382 | date=1948 | bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..372H | doi=10.1093/mnras/108.5.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aip"&gt;{{citation | title=Big Bang or Steady State? | work=Ideas of Cosmology | publisher=American Institute of Physics | url=https://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/ideas/bigbang.htm | accessdate=2015-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a number of years, support for these theories was evenly divided. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 lent strong support to the Big Bang model,&lt;ref name="aip"/&gt; and since the precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] in the early 1990s, few cosmologists have seriously proposed other theories of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. One consequence of this is that in standard general relativity, the universe began with a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]], as demonstrated by [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Stephen Hawking]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Earman1999&gt;{{citation | contribution=The Penrose-Hawking Singularity Theorems: History and Implications | last1=Earman | first1=John | title=The expanding worlds of general relativity | journal=The Expanding Worlds of General Relativity | pages=235 | editor1-first=Hubert | editor1-last=Goenner | editor2-last=Jürgen | editor3-first=Jim | editor3-last=Ritter | editor4-first=Tilman | editor4-last=Sauer | series=Birk presentations of the fourth conference on the and gravitation | year=1999 | bibcode=1999ewgr.book..235E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy of the cosmos==
The lightest [[chemical elements]], primarily [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], were created during the [[Big Bang]] through the process of [[nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Burles2001/&gt; In a sequence of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] reactions, smaller atomic nuclei are then combined into larger atomic nuclei, ultimately forming stable [[iron group]] elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which have the highest nuclear [[binding energies]].&lt;ref name=B2FH&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Burbidge | first1=E.

Gravitational collapse of matter into [[black hole]]s also powers the most energetic processes, generally seen in the nuclear regions of galaxies, forming ''[[quasar]]s'' and ''[[active galaxies]]''.

Cosmologists cannot explain all cosmic phenomena exactly, such as those related to the [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion of the universe]], using conventional [[Energy forms|forms of energy]]. Instead, cosmologists propose a new form of energy called [[dark energy]] that permeates all space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/300/5627/1914?siteid=sci&amp;ijkey=eJV6VmToFgZIE&amp;keytype=ref Science 20 June 2003:Vol. 300. no. 5627, pp. 1914 - 1918] Throwing Light on Dark Energy, Robert P. Kirshner. Retrieved December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis is that dark energy is just the [[vacuum energy]], a component of empty space that is associated with the [[virtual particle]]s that exist due to the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name=Frieman2008&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe | last1=Frieman | first1=Joshua A. | last2=Turner | first2=Michael S. | last3=Huterer | first3=Dragan | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume=46 | issue=1 | pages=385–432 | year=2008 | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243 | bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F | arxiv=0803.0982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear way to define the total energy in the universe using the most widely accepted theory of gravity, [[general relativity]]. Therefore, it remains controversial whether the total energy is conserved in an expanding universe. For instance, each [[photon]] that travels through intergalactic space loses energy due to the [[redshift]] effect. This energy is not obviously transferred to any other system, so seems to be permanently lost. On the other hand, some cosmologists insist that energy is conserved in some sense; this follows the law of [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book | author = Liddle, A. | title = An Introduction to Modern Cosmology | publisher = Wiley | isbn =978-0-470-84835-7 | date = 2003-05-26 }} This argues cogently "Energy is always, always, always conserved."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermodynamics of the universe]] is a field of study that explores which form of energy dominates the cosmos – [[relativistic particle]]s which are referred to as [[radiation]], or non-relativistic particles referred to as matter. Relativistic particles are particles whose [[rest mass]] is zero or negligible compared to their [[kinetic energy]], and so move at the speed of light or very close to it; non-relativistic particles have much higher rest mass than their energy and so move much slower than the speed of light.

As the universe expands, both matter and radiation in it become diluted. However, the [[energy density|energy densities]] of radiation and matter dilute at different rates. As a particular volume expands, mass energy density is changed only by the increase in volume, but the energy density of radiation is changed both by the increase in volume and by the increase in the [[wavelength]] of the [[photon]]s that make it up. Thus the energy of radiation becomes a smaller part of the universe's total energy than that of matter as it expands. The very early universe is said to have been 'radiation dominated' and radiation controlled the deceleration of expansion. Later, as the average energy per photon becomes roughly 10 [[electronvolt|eV]] and lower, matter dictates the rate of deceleration and the universe is said to be 'matter dominated'. The intermediate case is not treated well [[analytic solution|analytically]]. As the expansion of the universe continues, matter dilutes even further and the [[cosmological constant]] becomes dominant, leading to an acceleration in the universe's expansion.

==History of the universe==
{{see also|Timeline of the Big Bang}}
The history of the universe is a central issue in cosmology. The history of the universe is divided into different periods called epochs, according to the dominant forces and processes in each period. The standard cosmological model is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

===Equations of motion===
{{main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric}}

Within the [[standard cosmological model]], the [[equations of motion]] governing the universe as a whole are derived from [[general relativity]] with a small, positive [[cosmological constant]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The solution is an expanding universe; due to this expansion, the radiation and matter in the universe cool down and become diluted. At first, the expansion is slowed down by [[gravitation]] attracting the [[radiation]] and matter in the universe. However, as these become diluted, the cosmological constant becomes more dominant and the expansion of the universe starts to accelerate rather than decelerate. In our universe this happened billions of years ago.&lt;ref name=Springel2006&gt;{{cite journal | title=The large-scale structure of the Universe | last1=Springel | first1=Volker | last2=Frenk | first2=Carlos S. | last3=White | first3=Simon D.

===Particle physics in cosmology===
{{main|Particle physics in cosmology}}

During the earliest moments of the universe the average [[energy density]] was very high, making knowledge of [[particle physics]] critical to understanding this environment. Hence, [[scattering]] processes and [[particle decay|decay]] of unstable [[elementary particles]] are important for cosmological models of this period.

As a rule of thumb, a scattering or a decay process is cosmologically important in a certain epoch if the time scale describing that process is smaller than, or comparable to, the time scale of the expansion of the universe.{{clarify |date=April 2018 |reason=Isn't the opposite true -- departures from equilibrium occur only when the process takes longer than the time scale? }} The time scale that describes the expansion of the universe is &lt;math&gt;1/H&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Hubble parameter]], which varies with time. The expansion timescale &lt;math&gt;1/H&lt;/math&gt; is roughly equal to the age of the universe at each point in time.

&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the evolution of the universe has passed through three phases. The very early universe, which is still poorly understood, was the split second in which the universe was so hot that [[subatomic particle|particles]] had energies higher than those currently accessible in [[particle accelerator]]s on Earth. Therefore, while the basic features of this epoch have been worked out in the Big Bang theory, the details are largely based on educated guesses.
Following this, in the early universe, the evolution of the universe proceeded according to known [[high energy physics]]. This is when the first protons, electrons and neutrons formed, then nuclei and finally atoms. With the formation of neutral hydrogen, the [[cosmic microwave background]] was emitted. Finally, the epoch of structure formation began, when matter started to aggregate into the first [[star]]s and [[quasar]]s, and ultimately galaxies, [[clusters of galaxies]] and [[supercluster]]s formed. The future of the universe is not yet firmly known, but according to the [[&amp;Lambda;CDM]] model it will continue expanding forever.

==Areas of study==
Below, some of the most active areas of inquiry in cosmology are described, in roughly chronological order. This does not include all of the Big Bang cosmology, which is presented in ''[[Timeline of the Big Bang]].''

===Very early universe===
The early, hot universe appears to be well explained by the Big Bang from roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; seconds onwards, but there are several [[Big Bang#Standard Problems|problems]]. One is that there is no compelling reason, using current particle physics, for the universe to be [[shape of the universe|flat]], homogeneous, and [[isotropic]] ''(see the [[cosmological principle]])''. Moreover, [[grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] of particle physics suggest that there should be [[magnetic monopole]]s in the universe, which have not been found. These problems are resolved by a brief period of [[cosmic inflation]], which drives the universe to [[Flatness (cosmology)|flatness]], smooths out anisotropies and inhomogeneities to the observed level, and exponentially dilutes the monopoles.&lt;ref name=Guth1981&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inflationary universe: A possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems | last1=Guth | first1=Alan H. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=23 | issue=2 | date=January 15, 1981 | pages=347–356 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 | bibcode=1981PhRvD..23..347G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical model behind cosmic inflation is extremely simple, but it has not yet been confirmed by particle physics, and there are difficult problems reconciling inflation and [[quantum field theory]].{{Vague|date=April 2018}} Some cosmologists think that [[string theory]] and [[brane cosmology]] will provide an alternative to inflation.&lt;ref name=Pogosian2003&gt;{{cite journal | title=Observational constraints on cosmic string production during brane inflation | last1=Pogosian | first1=Levon | last2=Tye | first2=S.-H. Henry | last3=Wasserman | first3=Ira | last4=Wyman | first4=Mark | journal=Physical Review D | volume=68 | issue=2 | page=023506 | year=2003 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.68.023506 | bibcode=2003PhRvD..68b3506P | arxiv=hep-th/0304188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major problem in cosmology is what caused the universe to contain far more matter than [[antimatter]]. Cosmologists can observationally deduce that the universe is not split into regions of matter and antimatter. If it were, there would be [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s produced as a result of [[annihilation]], but this is not observed. Therefore, some process in the early universe must have created a small excess of matter over antimatter, and this (currently not understood) process is called ''[[baryogenesis]]''. Three required conditions for baryogenesis were derived by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1967, and requires a violation of the particle physics [[Symmetry#In physics|symmetry]], called [[CP-symmetry]], between matter and antimatter.&lt;ref name=Canetti2012&gt;{{citation | title=Matter and antimatter in the universe | display-authors=1 | first1=Laurent | last1=Canetti | first2=Marco | last2=Drewes | first3=Mikhail | last3=Shaposhnikov | journal=New Journal of Physics | volume=14 | issue=9 | pages=095012 | date=September 2012 | doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 | bibcode=2012NJPh...14i5012C | arxiv=1204.4186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, particle accelerators measure too small a violation of CP-symmetry to account for the baryon asymmetry. Cosmologists and particle physicists look for additional violations of the CP-symmetry in the early universe that might account for the baryon asymmetry.&lt;ref name=Pandolfi2017&gt;{{cite web | title=New source of asymmetry between matter and antimatter | first1=Stefania | last1=Pandolfi | date=January 30, 2017 | publisher=CERN | url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2017/01/new-source-asymmetry-between-matter-and-antimatter | accessdate=2018-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the problems of baryogenesis and cosmic inflation are very closely related to particle physics, and their resolution might come from high energy theory and [[particle accelerator|experiment]], rather than through observations of the universe.{{speculation inline|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- This statement is both speculative and somewhat obvious. It will either be one, the other, or none. Is it needed? --&gt;

===Big Bang Theory===
{{Main|Big bang nucleosynthesis}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis is the theory of the formation of the elements in the early universe. It finished when the universe was about three minutes old and its [[temperature]] dropped below that at which [[nuclear fusion]] could occur. Big Bang nucleosynthesis had a brief period during which it could operate, so only the very lightest elements were produced. Starting from [[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s ([[proton]]s), it principally produced [[deuterium]], [[helium|helium-4]], and [[lithium]]. Other elements were produced in only trace abundances. The basic theory of nucleosynthesis was developed in 1948 by [[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Asher Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]].&lt;ref name=Peebles2014&gt;{{cite journal | title=Discovery of the hot Big Bang: What happened in 1948 | last1=Peebles | first1=Phillip James Edwin | journal=The European Physical Journal H | volume=39 | issue=2 | pages=205–223 | date=April 2014 | doi=10.1140/epjh/e2014-50002-y | bibcode=2014EPJH...39..205P | arxiv=1310.2146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for many years as a probe of physics at the time of the Big Bang, as the theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis connects the abundances of primordial light elements with the features of the early universe.&lt;ref name=Burles2001&gt;{{cite journal | title=Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Predictions for Precision Cosmology | last1=Burles | first1=Scott | last2=Nollett | first2=Kenneth M. | last3=Turner | first3=Michael S. | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=552 | issue=1 | pages=L1–L5 | date=May 2001 | doi=10.1086/320251 | bibcode=2001ApJ...552L...1B | arxiv=astro-ph/0010171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it can be used to test the [[equivalence principle]],&lt;ref name=Boucher2004&gt;{{citation | title=Cosmic microwave background constraints on the strong equivalence principle | last1=Boucher | first1=V. | last2=Gérard | first2=J.-M. | last3=Vandergheynst | first3=P. | last4=Wiaux | first4=Y. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=70 | issue=10 | page=103528 | date=November 2004 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.103528 | bibcode=2004PhRvD..70j3528B | arxiv=astro-ph/0407208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to probe [[dark matter]], and test [[neutrino]] physics.&lt;ref name=Cyburt2016&gt;{{citation | title=Big bang nucleosynthesis: Present status | last1=Cyburt | first1=Richard H. | last2=Fields | first2=Brian D. | last3=Olive | first3=Keith A. | last4=Yeh | first4=Tsung-Han | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | volume=88 | issue=1 | page=015004 | date=January 2016 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.88.015004 | bibcode=2016RvMP...88a5004C | arxiv=1505.01076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cosmologists have proposed that Big Bang nucleosynthesis suggests there is a fourth "sterile" species of neutrino.&lt;ref name=Lucente2018&gt;{{cite arxiv| title=Leptogenesis, dark matter and neutrino masses | last1=Lucente | first1=Michele | last2=Abada | first2=Asmaa | last3=Arcadi | first3=Giorgio | last4=Domcke | first4=Valerie  | eprint=1803.10826 | date=March 2018| class=hep-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cosmic microwave background is radiation left over from [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] after the epoch of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when neutral [[atom]]s first formed. At this point, radiation produced in the Big Bang stopped [[Thomson scattering]] from charged ions. The radiation, first observed in 1965 by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], has a perfect thermal [[black body|black-body]] spectrum. It has a temperature of 2.7 [[kelvin]]s today and is isotropic to one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Formation and evolution of large-scale structure===
{{Main|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Structure formation|Galaxy formation and evolution}}
Understanding the formation and evolution of the largest and earliest structures (i.e., [[quasar]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[galaxy groups and clusters|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s) is one of the largest efforts in cosmology. Cosmologists study a model of '''hierarchical structure formation''' in which structures form from the bottom up, with smaller objects forming first, while the largest objects, such as superclusters, are still assembling.&lt;ref name=Hess2013&gt;{{cite journal | title=Simulating structure formation of the Local Universe | last1=Heß | first1=Steffen | last2=Kitaura | first2=Francisco-Shu | last3=Gottlöber | first3=Stefan | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=435 | issue=3 | pages=2065–2076 | date=November 2013 | doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1428 | bibcode=2013MNRAS.435.2065H | arxiv=1304.6565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to study structure in the universe is to survey the visible galaxies, in order to construct a three-dimensional picture of the galaxies in the universe and measure the matter [[power spectrum]].

Another tool for understanding structure formation is simulations, which cosmologists use to study the gravitational aggregation of matter in the universe, as it clusters into [[Galaxy filament|filaments]], superclusters and [[void (astronomy)|voids]]. Most simulations contain only non-baryonic [[cold dark matter]], which should suffice to understand the universe on the largest scales, as there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible, baryonic matter. More advanced simulations are starting to include baryons and study the formation of individual galaxies. Cosmologists study these simulations to see if they agree with the galaxy surveys, and to understand any discrepancy.&lt;ref name=Kuhlen2012&gt;{{cite journal | title=Numerical simulations of the dark universe: State of the art and the next decade | journal=Physics of the Dark Universe | volume=1 | issue=1–2 | date=November 2012 | pages=50–93 | first1=Michael | last1=Kuhlen | first2=Mark | last2=Vogelsberger | first3=Raul | last3=Angulo | doi=10.1016/j.dark.2012.10.002 | arxiv=1209.5745 | bibcode=2012PDU.....1...50K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, complementary observations to measure the distribution of matter in the distant universe and to probe [[reionization]] include:

These will help cosmologists settle the question of when and how structure formed in the universe.

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
Evidence from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], the [[cosmic microwave background]], structure formation, and [[galaxy rotation curve]]s suggests that about 23% of the mass of the universe consists of non-baryonic dark matter, whereas only 4% consists of visible, [[baryonic matter]]. The gravitational effects of dark matter are well understood, as it behaves like a cold, [[Radioactive decay|non-radiative]] fluid that forms [[galactic halo|haloes]] around galaxies. Dark matter has never been detected in the laboratory, and the particle physics nature of dark matter remains completely unknown. Without observational constraints, there are a number of candidates, such as a stable [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] particle, a [[weakly interacting massive particle]], a [[gravitationally-interacting massive particle]], an [[axion]], and a [[massive compact halo object]]. Alternatives to the dark matter hypothesis include a modification of gravity at small accelerations ([[MOND]]) or an effect from [[brane cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Klasen2015&gt;{{cite journal | title=Indirect and direct search for dark matter | last1=Klasen | first1=M. | last2=Pohl | first2=M. | last3=Sigl | first3=G. | journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics | volume=85 | pages=1–32 | date=November 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.ppnp.2015.07.001 | arxiv=1507.03800 | bibcode=2015PrPNP..85....1K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
If the universe is [[Flatness (cosmology)|flat]], there must be an additional component making up 73% (in addition to the 23% dark matter and 4% baryons) of the energy density of the universe. This is called dark energy. In order not to interfere with Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background, it must not cluster in haloes like baryons and dark matter. There is strong observational evidence for dark energy, as the total energy density of the universe is known through constraints on the flatness of the universe, but the amount of clustering matter is tightly measured, and is much less than this. The case for dark energy was strengthened in 1999, when measurements demonstrated that the expansion of the universe has begun to gradually accelerate.&lt;ref name=Perlmutter1999&gt;{{cite journal | title=Constraining Dark Energy with Type Ia Supernovae and Large-Scale Structure | last1=Perlmutter | first1=Saul | last2=Turner | first2=Michael S. | last3=White | first3=Martin | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=83 | issue=4 | year=1999 | pages=670–673 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.670 | bibcode=1999PhRvL..83..670P | arxiv=astro-ph/9901052 | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from its density and its clustering properties, nothing is known about dark energy. ''[[Quantum field theory]]'' predicts a [[cosmological constant]] (CC) much like dark energy, but 120 [[orders of magnitude]] larger than that observed.&lt;ref name=Adler1995&gt;{{cite journal | title=Vacuum catastrophe: An elementary exposition of the cosmological constant problem | last1=Adler | first1=Ronald J. | last2=Casey | first2=Brendan | last3=Jacob | first3=Ovid C. | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume=63 | issue=7 | pages=620–626 | date=July 1995 | doi=10.1119/1.17850 | bibcode=1995AmJPh..63..620A }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Weinberg]] and a number of string theorists ''(see [[string landscape]])'' have invoked the 'weak [[anthropic principle]]': i.e. the reason that physicists observe a universe with such a small cosmological constant is that no physicists (or any life) could exist in a universe with a larger cosmological constant. Many cosmologists find this an unsatisfying explanation: perhaps because while the weak anthropic principle is self-evident (given that living observers exist, there must be at least one universe with a cosmological constant which allows for life to exist) it does not attempt to explain the context of that universe.&lt;ref name=Siegfried2006&gt;{{cite journal | title=A 'Landscape' Too Far? | first1=Tom | last1=Siegfried | journal=Science | date=August 11, 2006 | volume=313 | issue=5788 | pages=750–753 | doi=10.1126/science.313.5788.750 | pmid=16902104 | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5788/750.full?etoc= | accessdate=2018-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the weak anthropic principle alone does not distinguish between:
* Only one universe will ever exist and there is some underlying principle that constrains the CC to the value we observe.
* Only one universe will ever exist and although there is no underlying principle fixing the CC, we got lucky.
* Lots of universes exist (simultaneously or serially) with a range of CC values, and of course ours is one of the life-supporting ones.

Other possible explanations for dark energy include [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]&lt;ref name=Sahni2002&gt;{{cite journal | title=The cosmological constant problem and quintessence | last1=Sahni | first1=Varun | journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity | volume=19 | issue=13 | pages=3435–3448 | year=2002 | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/19/13/304 | bibcode=2002CQGra..19.3435S | arxiv=astro-ph/0202076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a modification of gravity on the largest scales.&lt;ref name=Nojiri2007&gt;{{cite journal | title=Introduction to Modified Gravity and Gravitational Alternative for Dark Energy | last1=Nojiri | first1=S. | last2=Odintsov | first2=S.

The nature of dark energy is one of the most challenging problems in cosmology.

A better understanding of dark energy is likely to solve the problem of the [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. In the current cosmological epoch, the accelerated expansion due to dark energy is preventing structures larger than [[supercluster]]s from forming. It is not known whether the acceleration will continue indefinitely, perhaps even increasing until a [[big rip]], or whether it will eventually reverse, lead to a [[big freeze]], or follow some other scenario.&lt;ref name=Jambrina2014&gt;{{cite journal | title=Grand rip and grand bang/crunch cosmological singularities | last1=Fernández-Jambrina | first1=L. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=90 | issue=6 | page=064014 | date=September 2014 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.90.064014 | bibcode=2014PhRvD..90f4014F | arxiv=1408.6997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitational waves===
[[Gravitational wave]]s  are ripples in the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]] that propagate as [[wave]]s at the speed of light, generated in certain gravitational interactions that propagate outward from their source. [[Gravitational-wave astronomy]] is an emerging branch of [[observational astronomy]] which aims to use gravitational waves to collect observational data about sources of detectable gravitational waves such as [[binary star]] systems composed of [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s; and events such as [[supernova]]e, and the formation of the [[chronology of the universe|early universe]] shortly after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=Colpi2017&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Gravitational Wave Sources in the Era of Multi-Band Gravitational Wave Astronomy | last1=Colpi | first1=Monica | last2=Sesana | first2=Alberto | title=An Overview of Gravitational Waves: Theory, Sources and Detection | journal=An Overview of Gravitational Waves: Theory | editor1-first=Augar | editor1-last=Gerard | editor2-first=Plagnol | editor2-last=Eric | isbn=9789813141766 | pages=43–140 | year=2017 | doi=10.1142/9789813141766_0002 | bibcode=2017ogw..book...43C | arxiv=1610.05309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13021">'''Random International''' is a London-based art collective and collaborative studio, founded in 2005. The group shot to prominence with its interactive ''[[Rain Room]]'' art installation. Random International creates art installations that investigate notions of human consciousness, perception and instinct. Its work, which includes sculpture, performance and large-scale architectural installations, reflects the relationship between man and machine and centres on audience interaction.&lt;ref name="Barbican"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its exhibition pieces have now become permanent installations, the first of which was the critically acclaimed and popular ''Rain Room'', now permanently housed in [[Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates (UAE)]].

The group was founded in 2005 by German artists Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass. Ortkrass graduated from the [[Royal College of Art]] in London in 2005, while Koch graduated in 2004. Its relentless experimentation with digital technologies and reflections of the human form has led it to collaborate with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] roboticists on creating 'point studies' that reduce representation of the human form in motion into 15 light points,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/ew/articles/show/43500-random-international-art-technologys-magical-realists|title=Random International: Art &amp; Technology's Magical Realists {{!}} ArtSlant|website=ArtSlant|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with architects to create large scale public displays that include covering a German train station with LED lights.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''Rain Room'', now installed in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, was the first installation of a Random International project in a purpose-built, permanent structure. The work was previously shown at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London (2012);&lt;ref name="Barbican2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], New York (2013); Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2015) and [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], Los Angeles (2015–2017). ''Rain Room'' allows visitors to the installation to walk through a downpour without getting wet.&lt;ref name="Barbican3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barbican.org.uk/rain-room-random-international|title=Rain Room, Random International|website=www.barbican.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/uae/leisure/rain-room-brings-fun-intrigue-to-sharjah-1.2215470|title=Rain Room brings fun, intrigue to Sharjah|last=Reporter|first=Faisal Masudi, Staff|date=2018-05-02|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motion sensors detect visitors' movements as they navigate through the darkened space, becoming "performers in this intersection of art, technology and nature".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharjahart.org/sharjah-art-foundation/projects/rain-room|title=projects - Sharjah Art Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sharjahart.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been a celebrated [[Instagram]] theme:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peninsula.com/en/shanghai/our-city/pencities/content-calendar/everything-or-nothing|title=Everything or Nothing {{!}} The Peninsula Shanghai|website=www.peninsula.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the photo and video sharing platform has been cited as a major source of Random International's popular recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, billionaire [[Budi Tek]], Yuz Museum's founder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/03/28/lacma-yuz-museum-will-partner-exhibitions-programming/|title=In Historic U.S.-China Partnership, Budi Tek’s Shanghai-Based Yuz Museum Will Partner With LACMA|last=Binlot|first=Ann|date=2018-03-28|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced he would build a 150 square metre ''Rain Room'' in [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xy4gjj/rain-room-in-the-rain-forest-billionaire-plans-bali-art-theme-park|title=Rain Room in the Rain Forest: Billionaire Plans Bali Art Theme Park|date=2015-03-13|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was shelved due to Tek's ill-health.

A number of Chinese companies have copied the ''Rain Room'' concept and, in 2016, the Chinese Jiajiale Dream Park opened its $15 million ''Rain Room'' clone called the ''Magic Rain Zone''. One company offers as many as 12 clones of the installation. Koch estimated that as many as 8-10 companies had produced ''Rain Room'' clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vv5xyb/rent-your-own-rain-rooms-become-big-business-in-china|title=Rent-Your-Own Rain Rooms Become Big Business in China|date=2017-05-16|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instant Structure for Schacht XII ==
The group's first outdoor installation was ''Tower: Instant Structure for Schacht XII,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-build-towering-shower-at-ruhrtriennale/|title=random international builds towering shower at ruhrtriennale|date=2013-09-03|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; created  for [[Urbane Künste Ruhr]] for the [[Ruhrtriennale]] 2013. The work cycled 30,000 litres of water per minute from the former coal mines of [[Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex|Zollverin]], a World Heritage site, to create an instantaneous towering structure of water. The mines pump millions of water out each year to maintain the surrounding area's structural integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgpqpn/random-international-tower-instant-structure-for-schacht-XII|title=Random International Turn 30,000 Liters Of Water Into A Monumental Tower|date=2013-09-05|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self &amp; Other ==
The first permanent installation in the UK for Random International, ''Self &amp; Other,'' is located on the [[South Bank]] arts and cultural area of the [[Albert Embankment]]. It was launched in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/random-international-sculpture-art-270618|title=Random International is unveiling their first UK permanent kinetic sculpture|date=2018-06-27|work=It&amp;#8217;s Nice That|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swarm Studies ==
A series of works based on LED walls that mimic the flocking behavior of birds, fish, and insects,  Random International's ''Swarm Studies'' have been created ranging from a small version, ''Swarm Study / XI,'' at the Park Hyatt New York’s restaurant Bevy, to the huge ''Swarm Study / IX'', which spans the entire façade of the train station in [[Chemnitz]], Germany—the group's largest installation at the time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/random-international-public-art|title=Random International Is Creating Viral Public Art for the Instagram Age {{!}} Architectural Digest|work=Architectural Digest|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these studies, 2010's ''Swarm Light'' is in the collection of the Maxine &amp; Stuart Frankel Foundation For Art in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archello.com/project/swarm-light|title=SWARM LIGHT {{!}} Random International {{!}} Archello|website=Archello|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]], ''Swarm Study / III''  consists of four cubic forms suspended from the ceiling, each made of a grid of illuminated brass rods. A camera tracks visitors, making the lights of the installation flicker, brighten, and dim in response to their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-swarm-studyiii-at-the-va/|title=random international: swarm study/iii at the V&amp;A|date=2011-07-02|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Everything &amp; Nothing ==
The group's first [[solo exhibition]] in Asia, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'', was on display at Shanghai's Yuz Museum from 20 April – 2 September 2018. The exhibition takes its title from the video installation, ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' (2016), which attempts to question humankind’s place in a technological dynamic by showing a steamroller crushing everything in its path.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/rain-room-sharjah-uae-1275371|title=Random International’s Rain Room Gets Its First Permanent Home—in the Desert {{!}} artnet News|date=2018-04-30|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is the collective's first work to be created from video alone, a loop of over 6 hours. The piece was originally commissioned for the ''Wonder Materials'' exhibition at the [[Science and Industry Museum|Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]], where it was displayed in 2016.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.random-international.com/everything-and-nothing-2016/|title=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|website=RANDOM INTERNATIONAL|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Everything &amp; Nothing'' "documents the simultaneous decay and progress of the industrialised world in an age of relentless transformation." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yuzmshanghai.org/random-international-everything-nothing/|title=Random International: Everything &amp; Nothing - Yuz Museum Shanghai|work=Yuz Museum Shanghai|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective's newest work at the time of the exhibition was also displayed, ''Turnstiles'' (2018), an analogue piece which consists of a maze of barriers. ''Self &amp; Other'', another exhibit, consists of a reflective wall of mirrors, light and glass which reflect the visitor taking a selfie.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/event/Art-Art_Exhibitions/53866/Everything--Nothing.html|title=Everything &amp; Nothing|last=|first=|date=24 November 2018|website=Time Out Shanghai|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also saw ''Rain Room'' return to the museum in a revised and larger format, 1,600 square feet (larger, in fact, than the Sharjah installation).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' Shanghai reviewed the exhibition saying, "''Everything &amp; Nothing'' is a meditative video installation about how fucked we are in this age of un-tempered technological advancement. 'Turnstiles' tracks the same story, but instead with a matrix of spinny turnstiles that you can navigate while doing your best to avoid serious injury to the groin area."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Previous works ==
The group has previously held solo exhibitions at Lunds Konsthall, Sweden (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/702/random-international|title=Pace Gallery -  Random International|work=Pace Gallery|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenters Workshop Gallery, Paris (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designboom.com/art/random-international-self-portrait-temporary-printing-machine/|title=random international's self portrait temporary printing machine|date=2012-09-27|work=designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pace Gallery]], New York (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z4qan9/random-international-exhibition-rain-room|title=The 'Rain Room' Creators Are Getting Their Own Exhibition|date=2016-08-24|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work is held in the collections of MoMA, [[Sharjah Art Foundation]], Yuz Museum, LACMA and London's V&amp;A, where its ''Swarm Study / III'' is on long-term display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/702/random-international|title=Pace Gallery -  Random International|work=Pace Gallery|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, its work ''Zoological'' debuted at London’s [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] as part of Wayne McGregor’s ''+/- Human''. The group's work has also formed part of the Lichtsicht Biennale (2015), Ruhrtriennale (2013), and [[Moscow Biennale|Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Ar]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t (2011).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Sheldon Lee Gosline'' is an [[United States|American]] [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who has extensively studied the ancient civilizations of the Far East. He is noted for proposing the existence of a developing literate civilization in southern China dating to the second millennium BCE.

==Biography==
Sheldon Lee Gosline began his professional education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a B.A. degrees in Oriental Studies and Art History in 1985. He later continued his studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he received a B.A. degree 1988 and was awarded an M.A. degree in Oriental Studies in 1993.
He interrupted his stay at Cambridge to study at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an M.A. degree in Egyptology and Near Eastern Archaeology in 1992.
After Cambridge he studied at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. He received his Ph.D. in 2013 from [[University College London]], where he researched at the [[Wellcome Trust]] Centre for the History of Medicine and the [[UCL Centre for the History of Medicine]]. His thesis concerned the intersection of business and medicine.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;[https://www.explorers.org/events/detail/nyc_public_lecture_series_feat_sheldon_gosline ''The Explorers Club''], NYC Public Lecture Series Featuring Sheldon Gosline (8 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gosline is owner of Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts based in Warren Center, PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts|url=http://shangri-la.0catch.com/|publisher=Shangri-La|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.shangri-la.0catch.com|url=http://www.roadurls.com/www.shangri-la.0catch.com|website=Road Url|publisher=Road Url|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline has taught at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and at UW-Madison. He was at Northeast Normal University through 2004.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; 
In 2011, he moved to London to pursue a Ph.D. in the history of medicine, at [[University College London]]. Once he completed the degree, he returned to China to research the writing of the country’s minority groups.  He was first a visiting professor at [[Minzu University of China]] and [[Tsinghua University]], both in Beijing.  Since 2015, he has taught medical humanities at [[Peking University]]. He is a member of several professional associations.

He states that he has become proficient in or conversant with nine contemporary or ancient languages.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://shangri-la.0catch.com/press/vitae.html] ''Vitae of Prof. Sheldon Lee Gosline'' (shangri-la website; accessed 21 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost civilization theory==
IN 2013 Gosline was shown some inscriptions found in [[Guangxi]] province and considered that several were based on the [[Indus script]] and Persian cuneiform. On a field trip to the area where they were found in 2014 he discovered what he considered evidence of further inscriptions made up of large rocks regularly spaced and what he called “a man-made platform of megalithic construction" and something that “appeared to be a carved chair or throne.”   Sitting on it he “sensed a harmony and that I was in the midst of an ancient time calculating device".&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt; He returned to what he called an "observatory complex" with caver including royal burials in June 2014 with a group of researchers who examined the site and stated that “We confirmed most of the things I’d found as potential alignments, and we confirmed that there was artifact evidence in the area that showed human occupation.” He reported this in a talk to the New York Explorers Club later that year, saying that he believed he had found an unknown civilization. 

Reports from Chinese researchers who accompanied him were less positive. Dr. Ye Xiaohong reported that "Two suspected cave tombs are not man-made," "No artificial traces were found on the huge stone in the suspected artificial remains, neither the suspected structures for observation nor the suspected ancient topographic maps" and that what Gosline had interpreted as ancient writing on some rocks "were certainly produced by natural force".&lt;ref name="Ye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ye|first1=Xiaohong|title=Preliminary Observation and Cognition at Gansang|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0714/46829.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese researchers also surveyed the alignments that Gosline thought related to the chair (which they agreed was a natural water-created formation) and concluded that the stone could not have been used as part of an observatory. &lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Fengxian|title=A Survey of Gansang site and Further Discussion|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46710.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Chinese researcher who was part of Gosline's group stated that "Gosline proclaimed that he had found several megalithic sites including observatories, palaces, and ancient cave tombs，petro-glyphs and even plan maps at Gansang, Nadou, and Bupeng in Pingguo county, Guangxi".  The conclusion was that "We have not found any artificial remains, artifacts, and occupation layer both at Nadou and Bupeng sites" and that most of the "scratches, the petro-glyphs and plan maps on the rocks called by Gosline, are natural" with a few that might be artificial and needed microscopic examination. However they did believe that the "Gansang site might have worked as an important settlement in Youjiang River Reach." Commenting on the engraved stones reported by Gosline, they commented that they seemed too new, that they were too intact with "the whole texts just fit to the sizes of the planks", that they lacked an archaeological context and that there were too few repetitions of characters.&lt;ref name="Nu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nu|first1=He|title=Thinking about the Sites in Pingguo county, S China|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46706.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline’s observation that the newly discovered inscriptions seemed to include Persian cuneiform is unproven as of 2016.&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-a-coded-message-lead-an-american-to-a-lost-civilization-in-china?ct=t(Newsletter_4_21_20164_20_2016)&amp;mc_cid=5e86c4b93a&amp;mc_eid=34be11d5e3] Did A Coded Message Lead an American to a Lost Civilization in

'''Situational strength''' is defined as cues provided by environmental forces regarding the desirability of potential behaviors.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; Situational strength is said to result in psychological pressure on the individual to engage in and/or refrain from particular behaviors. A consequence of this psychological pressure to act in a certain way is the likelihood that despite an individual's [[Personality type|personality]], they will act in a certain manner. As such, when strong situations (situations where situational strength is high) exist, the relationship between personality variables (for example, [[extraversion]], risk-taking behaviors, etc...) and behaviors is reduced, because no matter what the personality of the individual is, they will act in a way dictated by the situation. When weak situations exist, there is less structure and more ambiguity with respect to what behaviors to perform.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; In sum, situations have the ability to restrict the expression of [[individual differences]] in terms of actual behaviors.

==Contrasting strong and weak situations==
An example of a strong situation is a red traffic light. Traffic rules dictate how people are supposed to act when they see a red light, and this influence often prevents people from engaging in behaviors that are consistent with their personality. For example, most people, no matter whether they are daring or cautious, will stop in front of a red traffic light. Therefore, one could not reasonably predict how a person would behave with personality in this situation.

In contrast, an example of a weak situation is a yellow traffic light because the most appropriate course of action is not especially well defined and norms are inconsistent. Thus, individuals who are more daring are likely to speed through the intersection on a yellow light, whereas cautious individuals are likely to stop.

==Origins and history==
Although it is difficult to formally express when situations restricting individual differences in personality began in [[psychology]], work conducted by [[Carl Rogers]] suggested that certain individual differences are mostly likely to manifest themselves in situations where there is psychological freedom and safety, compared to situations where psychological freedom and safety do not exist.&lt;ref name="rogers-1954"/&gt; Additionally, [[Stanley Milgram]] argued that psychological forces of conflict may not be brought into play under diluted conditions.&lt;ref name="milgram-1965"/&gt; However, recent conceptualization and study of situational strength can be traced back to the work of [[Walter Mischel]]. In 1968, Mischel published his classic book, ''Personality and Assessment'', where he argued that personality cannot be studied in a vacuum; instead, the complexity of human behavior and its determinants must be studied from a perspective that accounts for the simultaneous and interactive impact of individual differences and situational characteristics.&lt;ref name="mischel-1968"/&gt; It is important to note that Mischel did not imply that people show no consistencies in behavior, or that individual differences are unimportant. The major theme was rather that the trait approach to personality was not as sensitive to the influence of situations as it should have been.&lt;ref name="mischel-1999"/&gt;

In books and articles on the topic, Mischel stressed the importance of better understanding how, when, and why individual differences are most likely to be important predictors of behavior, and when they are more likely to be nullified by situational influences. Specifically, Mischel began laying the foundation for subsequent thought in this area by arguing that psychological "situations" and "treatments" are powerful to the degree that they lead all persons to construe the particular events the same way, induce uniform expectancies regarding the most appropriate response pattern, provide adequate incentives for the performance of that response pattern, and instill the skills necessary for its satisfactory construction and execution (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; He further argued that individual differences are most likely to directly affect behavior "when the situation is ambiguously structured... so that subjects are uncertain about how to categorize it and have no clear expectations about the behaviors most likely to be appropriate (normative, reinforced) in that situation" (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; Thus, he helped to lay the foundation for the general idea underlying what is now typically referred to as "situational strength" (or "situation strength").

Mischel's work led to an important shift in social scientists' thinking about the behavioral expression of personality. But, as some have recently argued, situational strength is too often viewed as being true without treating situational strength as a theoretical construct in need of conceptual development and empirical verification.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt;

==Modern conceptualization and empirical verification==
Meyer, Dalal, and Hermida argue that for theoretical understanding and practical application of situational strength to be advanced, at least three important issues must be addressed:&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Examining the nature of the situational strength. Specifically, examining if there are unique facets in situational strength.
# Examining whether these facets affect all non-ability individual differences uniformly, or if some facets affect the expression of some traits more so than others.
# If facets do in fact have differential effects on the expression of various behaviors and predictor-outcome relationships, it will be necessary to develop theory regarding the specific mechanisms through which these facet-based effects occur.

Four facets of situational strength have been identified:
# Clarity: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are available and easy to understand.
# Consistency: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are compatible with each other.
# Constraints: The extent to which an individual's freedom of decision and action is limited by forces outside his or her control.
# Consequences: The extent to which decisions or actions have important positive or negative implications for any relevant person or entity.

In an empirical study, which incorporated vote-counting [[meta-analysis]], it has been found that conceptualizations of situational strength that currently exist in psychological literature form an interaction with non-ability individual differences. Additionally, the [[effect size]] of the interaction effect was reasonably large.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;

==Implications==
Perhaps the most important implication of situational strength is that it is commonly believed to explain cross-situational variability in the criterion-related validity of non-cognitive individual differences.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mischel-1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullins-cummings-1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weiss-adler-1984"/&gt; This suggests that psychology should not focus on whether personality constructs predict job performance but rather about the conditions under which they predict job performance. This also shows great practical implications for personnel selection because the criterion-related validity of individual differences may vary across different occupations. For instance, Meyer, Dalal, and Bonaccio found that occupation-level situational strength moderates the conscientiousness–performance relationship, such that conscientiousness better predicts performance in characteristically weak occupations than in characteristically strong occupations.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-bonaccio-2009"/&gt;

Another important implication revolves around the idea of [[person-environment fit]]. One of the core ideas expressed in the fit literature is that a mismatch between individuals' needs and environmental supplies can have deleterious effects on performance, attitudes, and health.&lt;ref name="kristofbrown-zimmerman-johnson-2005"/&gt; Within the context of situational strength, some employees may view highly constraining environments as stifling and frustrating, whereas others may find the regimented and predictable nature of constraining environments to be comforting and relaxing. If these differences do in fact exist, this would suggest that employees' psychological reactions are partially a function of their individual differences profile and partially a function of the nature of the situation they are experiencing.

==Future directions==
Two critical aspects of situational strength can be fruitful for future study:
# It is possible that more or fewer categories of operationalizations exist. Thus, researchers should be encouraged to continue theoretical development and empirical tests of alternative structures of situational strength that might also serve to move our understanding of this phenomenon forward. Although the structure outlined by research carried out by Meyer, Dalal, &amp; Hermida was derived by attempting to find common themes among extant operationalizations, the approach assumed that the existing corpus of studies is a representative sample of situational strength's theoretical construct space. Thus, inductive theorizing that focuses on additional (or alternative) categories of operationalizations might be fruitful. Ultimately, however, direct empirical tests of any proposed conceptualization will need to be conducted—a task that is made more meaningful by the presence of a standardized instrument.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Once the dimensional structure of situational strength has been determined, it will be possible to develop a standardized measure for use alongside traditional job analytic tools, in order "to analyze the context within which the job is embedded" (page 349).&lt;ref name="murphy-dzieweczynski-2005"/&gt; There are many potential benefits of such an instrument. First, it would allow researchers interested in examining the effects of situational strength on relevant trait-outcome relationships to do so in a way that is not only consistent across studies (which is not the case at present, as evidenced by our review of the empirical literature), but that also helps to develop a general situational strength literature—the absence of which has been noted.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt; Second, it would allow for an assessment of the relative importance of the dimensions of situational strength, helping researchers to determine which dimensions are necessary and/or sufficient to adequately understand a given interactional question.&lt;ref name="azen-budescu-2003"/&gt; Third, it would help researchers determine whether the situational strength dimensions [[interaction|interact]] with each other—and, if they do, whether these interactions are synergistic or antagonistic. Fourth, it would allow for large-scale analyses of the relative levels of situational strength that exist in diverse situations, the results of which could then be compiled into centralized databases that could help inform future practice and research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4386">A '''sustainable community energy system''' is an integrated approach to supplying a local community with its energy requirements from [[renewable energy]] or high-efficiency [[co-generation]] energy sources. The approach can be seen as a development of the [[distributed generation]] concept.

Such systems are based on a combination of [[district heating]], [[district cooling]], plus '[[electricity generation island]]s' that are interlinked via a private wire electricity system (largely bypassing the normal [[power grid]] to cut transmission losses and charges, as well as increasing the robustness of the system). The surplus from one generating island can therefore be used to make up the deficit at another.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] the first sustainable community energy system was pioneered by [[Woking]] [[Borough]] [[Municipality|Council]], starting in 1991. The system uses traditional and a [[Phosphoric-acid fuel cell|phosphoric acid fuel cell]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060911140743/http://www.woking.gov.uk/html/queensaward/W-19.pdf] co-generation plants, [[thermal store|thermal storage]], heat fired [[absorption cooling]] and [[photovoltaics]] (over 9% of the UK's small capacity), to supply both residential and non-residential customers, as well as the Council's own facilities. By end of 2005 there were over 60 generating islands in the Borough.

Despite the investment in the plant, the system delivers cheaper energy than can be supplied from the traditional 'brown energy' suppliers, helping to tackle [[fuel poverty]]. It is part of a plan to cut local [[carbon dioxide]] emissions by 80% by 2050. Their initiatives won the Council the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] in 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070102051259/http://www.woking.gov.uk/news/archive?item=988025744].

The [[London Climate Change Agency]] is starting to construct a similar system in [[London]].

==Germany==
In 1997, people of [[Wildpoldsried]], in some cases acting as individuals, began a series of projects that produce renewable energy. The first efforts were [[wind turbine]]s and [[biomass]] digesters for [[cogeneration]] of heat and power.  In the time since, new work has included a number of [[energy conservation]] projects, more wind and biomass use, [[small hydro]] plants, [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] on private houses, and [[district heating]].  Tied to this are ecological [[flood control]] and [[wastewater]] systems.

Today, the effects of this are an unforeseen level of prosperity resulting in construction of nine new community buildings, including a school, gymnasium, and community hall, complete with solar panels.  There are three companies operating four biogas digesters with a fifth under construction.  There are seven windmills with two more on the way. One hundred and ninety private households are equipped with solar, which pays them dividends.  The district heating network has 42 connections.  There are three small hydro power plants. Wildpoldsried now produces 321 percent more energy than it needs and is generating 4.0 million Euro in annual revenue.  At the same time, there has been a 65% reduction in the town’s carbon footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Village Achieves Energy Independence … And Then Some  |publisher=BioCycle |date=August 2011 |volume= 52, No. 8, p. 37 |url=http://www.biocycle.net/2011/08/german-village-achieves-energy-independence-and-then-some/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''T.M.C. Asser Instituut''' (established in 1965) is a professional inter-university centre of knowledge and research. The institute carries out research in private and public international law, European law, international commercial arbitration and all other related fields, such as international sports law and international humanitarian and criminal law. It is based in [[The Hague]] and it is affiliated to the [[University of Amsterdam]].

The institute is named after [[Tobias Michael Carel Asser]] (1838–1913), who was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] jurist, and co-winner (with [[Alfred Fried]]) of the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]] in 1911 for his role in the formation of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the first Hague peace conference (1899). He also advocated for the creation of an international academy of law, which led to founding of the ''Revue de Droit International et de Législation Comparée'' with [[John Westlake]] and [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], the [[Institut de Droit International]] and the creation of the [[Hague Academy of International Law]].

==Fundamental research==
Besides the research facilities for its team of expert researchers, the Institute has access to an extensive international network of academic and scientific contacts. The T.M.C. Asser Instituut aims to develop young talent. The Asser Dissertations Programme offers promising young lawyers the opportunity to work on their research.
The funding and appointment of new candidates is done in collaboration with other institutions, preferably law faculties.

==Contract-research and legal advice==
Besides fundamental research, the institute focuses on contract research and consultancy work. This ranges from tailored consultancy finding (ad hoc) solutions for small legal issues to coordination and/or export of long-term structural (research) projects. Clients include among others the [[European Union]], national governments, ministries, international organizations, and law firms.

==Publisher==
The institute has its own [[publisher]]: [[T.M.C. Asser Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asser.nl/asserpress/|title=Asser Press|last=|first=|date=|website=www.asser.nl/asserpress|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following journals and yearbooks are being published: The Netherlands Yearbook of International Law (NYIL), Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law (YIHL), Netherlands International Law Review (NILR), Nederlands Internationaal Privaatrecht (NIPR) and European Business Organization Law Review (EBOR).

==Conferences and events==

'''Teachers Without Borders''' (''TWB'') is an international organization launched in 2000, with a mission to connect teachers to information and each other in order to close the education divide and based  upon the premise that teachers are community change agents and key catalysts of global development priorities. The organization was founded by [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/founder/ Dr. Fred Mednick]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} 

Teachers Without Borders received the '''[https://luxembourgpeaceprize.org/laureates/outstanding-peace-education/2018-teachers-without-borders/ 2018 Luxembourg Peace Prize]''' for Outstanding Peace Education, recognized for a free Peace Education program involving teachers from regions in conflict, for having embedded peace education into all TWB courses (see below), and its Voice of Teachers Radio Show in Nigeria. 

Teachers Without Borders received the [https://www.changemakers.com/champions-quality-education-africa '''Champions of African Education Award'''] (2010) for its use of radio and local educational capacity building to disseminate information about the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2018, TWB's membership has reached 177 countries. Teachers Without Borders membership is free and enables local educators the opportunity to connect with colleagues globally.

Teachers Without Borders also received the '''[http://peacesymposium.org.uk/the-ahmadiyya-muslim-peace-prize Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize]''' for "outstanding work in the promotion of peace through efforts to convene teachers from regions in conflict, provide unfettered access to courses and networks devoted to teacher professional development, and to ensure that peace education is integrated into all initiatives. The formal announcement can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaSBMQxcAk&amp;t=9s '''here'''].

==Approach==
Teachers Without Borders claims that teachers represent the largest professional community in the world (over 65 million); that teachers are uniquely suited as local leaders to recognize and help address development needs; that professional isolation and inconsequential or missing teacher professional development undermines social change; and that the transformation of pre-service and in-service teacher development can bring about more sustainable, equitable, democratic, and economically stable societies.

==Initiatives and Courses==
Teachers Without Borders' initiatives and courses are offered in various formats and settings: online, in schools, as community workshops, in books and journals, and on the radio. All programs have been conceived and led by Teachers Without Borders' members and partners around the world. Content of all TWB [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/allcourses/ '''courses'''] and [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/training-resources/ workshop resources] are free and governed by the least restrictive Creative Commons license.  '''Initiatives''' include: [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/eie/ education in emergencies], [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/girls-education/ girls' education], [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/twb-peace/ peace and human rights education], [https://teacherswithoutborders.org/bullying/ Bullying], [https://teacherswithoutborders.org/ict-in-education/ ICT in Education], and [https://teacherswithoutborders.org/child-friendly-spaces/ Child-Friendly Spaces]. as well as several teacher pre-service and in-service professional development opportunities - including a five-course Certificate of Teaching Mastery program. 

Most Teachers Without Borders initiatives are accompanied by [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/allcourses/ courses] offered independently, at universities such as [http://www.education.jhu.edu/faculty/SOE_Faculty/fred-mednick Johns Hopkins University's School of Education] (where TWB's founder is an Assistant Professor), and through the [https://www.canvas.net Canvas Network], an online MOOC provider.  Those courses include:  ''[http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/educating-girls/ Educating Girls]''; [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/asap-education-in-emergencies/ ASAP:  Education in Emergencies]; [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/peacecourse Peace and Human Rights]; the five course [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/ctm/ ''Certificate of Teaching Mastery'']; a course on ICTs for educators entitled:  ''[http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/high-tech-high-touch-high-teach/ High-Tech, High-Touch, High-Teach]''; and ''[http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/globaled/ Global Urban Education]''.

==Flagship Programs==

===Emergency Education===
[[File:TWB ChinatoPakistan.jpg|thumbnail|right|TWB Disaster Risk Reduction]]
The ''[http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/eie/ Emergency Education Program]'' works with teachers on preparedness and planning to avoid crises or lessen their impacts, education amidst emergencies, and in the reconstruction phase.  Teachers Without Borders has also helped to launch Parsquake, a consortium of NGOs devoted to earthquake science and safety throughout Persian speaking countries particularly vulnerable and seismically active regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/eie/&lt;/ref&gt; This program was initiated after the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|2008 earthquake]] in the [[Sichuan]] region of [[China]] and, in 2011, will engage and support teachers in [[Haiti]]. The program also supports [[emergency relief]], reconstruction and recovery efforts in areas hit by [[natural disasters]], such as the [[2010 Pakistan floods|2010 floods]] in [[Pakistan]]. The online MOOC, entitled [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/asap-education-in-emergencies/ ASAP: Education in Emergencies], is available without cost. Hirmu 10.

===Peace and Human Rights Education===
[[File:Haiti Fenel wikipedia.jpg|thumbnail|right|TWB Peace Workshop in Haiti]]
The [https://teacherswithoutborders.org/peace-ed/ Peace Education Initiative] helps teachers promote peace in their classrooms and communities. Content of [https://www.scribd.com/doc/40571872/COMPLETE-PROGRAM-Dr-Joseph-Hungwa-Memorial-Peace-Education-Program-Parts-1-6 TWB's Peace Program] is available without cost. The [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/peacecourse/ Peace Education course] is available to the public as a MOOC and has been offered for Continuing Education Unites at Johns Hopkins University.

===Girls' Education===
Teachers Without Borders' [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/girls-education/ girls' education programs] address four central themes:  (1) access (2) education in emergencies (3) public health, and (4) empowerment. The organization addresses these four themes by connecting global educators to NGOs working in the field; offering a free and low-fee course: ([http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/educating-girls/ Educating Girls]) in partnership with Johns Hopkins University and through the Canvas Network; and by promoting a [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/earthquake-science-and-safety-initiative/ Girls' Quake Science and Safety Initiative] - designed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul2JEVIH8zs in partnership with USGS] (United States Geological Survey)  to ensure access to earthquake science education for teachers and schools in seismically-vulnerable communities around the world.

'''''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended''''' is an approximately 87,000-word composition written by Sir [[Isaac Newton]], first published posthumously in 1728 in limited supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac |last= Newton |title=The chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended : To Which is Prefix'd, A Short Chronicle From the First Memory of Things in Europe, to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great  |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-37430|year=1728|publisher= Printed for J. Tonson ; J. Osborn ; T. Longman |place=London |edition=1 |volume=|access-date= June 17, 2016| via=e-rara.ch (ETH-Bibliothek Zürich)|doi= 10.3931/e-rara-37430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it had been republished in mass paperback format.  The work represents one of Newton's forays into the topic of [[chronology]], detailing the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms throughout antiquity.

The treatise is composed of eight primary sections.  First is an introductory letter to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] by Newton's estate manager [[John Conduitt]], followed by a short advertisement.  After this is found a section entitled "''A Short Chronicle''" which serves as a brief historical list of events listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest listed date of 1125 BC and the most recent listed at 331 BC.  The majority of the treatise, however, is in the form of six chapters that explore the history of specific civilizations.  These chapters are titled:

*Chap. I. Of the Chronology of the First Ages of the Greeks.
*Chap. II. Of the Empire of Egypt.
*Chap. III. Of the Assyrian Empire.
*Chap. IV. Of the two Contemporary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes.
*Chap. V. A Description of the Temple of Solomon.
*Chap. VI. Of the Empire of the Persians.

According to John Conduitt's introductory letter, ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' was Isaac Newton's last personally revised work before his death but had actually been written much earlier.  Some of its subject material and contents have led many people to categorize this work as one of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].

==Summary==

The book attempts to revise the accepted ancient chronology of Newton's day, in order to prove that [[Solomon]] was the earliest king in the world, and that his Temple the first ever built, with all others being copies, beginning with [[Sesostris]], King of Egypt, followed by others. Newton's results, therefore, diverge widely from presently accepted dates, often more widely than the system that he attempted to displace.

Newton attempted to [[Euhemerism|identify various mythological figures as historical]] or Biblical individuals, such as arguing that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] was [[Noah]], the [[Sky deity|god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was [[Shem]], and [[Osiris]] and [[Dionysus]] were [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref name="Ernest"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/Newton.pdf |title=Review of Newton and the Origin of Civilization, by Jed Z.

'''''The Little Red Schoolbook''''' ({{lang-da|Den Lille Røde Bog For Skoleelever}}; {{lang-en|The Little Red Book For School Pupils}}) is a book written by two [[Danish people|Danish]] schoolteachers, [[Søren Hansen (author)|Søren Hansen]] and [[Jesper Jensen (author)|Jesper Jensen]], published in 1969, that was subject to much controversy upon its publication. The book was translated into many languages in the early 1970s. [[Beatrice Faust]] contributed to the Australian edition of ''The Little Red Schoolbook.''&lt;ref&gt;"The Book that Shook the World", Film Australia, 3 November 2007, [[SBS Television]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

The book encourages young people to question societal norms and instructs them on how to do this. Out of 200 pages, it includes 20 pages on [[sex]] and 30 on drugs, including [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]]. Other topics included adults as "[[paper tiger]]s", the duties of teachers, discipline, examinations, intelligence, and different schools.&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt;

== Reception ==

As a result of its subject matter and its targeted audience of schoolchildren, a number of politicians in many countries criticised the book, fearing that the book would erode the moral fabric of society and be an invitation for anarchy in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=354431 2005/214/1 Book, Australian Edition 'The little red schoolbook', Powerhouse Museum, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''LRSB'' was banned in France, Italy and New Zealand.{{cn|date= March 2018}}



In Switzerland, the [[Canton of Bern|Bernese cantonal]] politician [[Hans Martin Sutermeister]] led a campaign against the book. He was successful in temporarily blocking the introduction of the book into the country. The subsequent controversy, however, ended his political career, costing him his job as director of the schools of the Swiss capital and contributed to a split in his party, the [[Ring of Independents]], which led to its mid-term decline.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus H. Thiele-Dohrmann, [http://www.zeit.de/1970/30/Ruhestoerung-in-Bern?page=all “Ruhestörung in Bern.”]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''[[Die Zeit]]'' July 24, 1970 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44943670.html “Der SPIEGEL berichtete: Schüler-Lehrerbeziehung.”] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 28/1970, July 6, 1970 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the book was the subject of a successful prosecution under the [[Obscene Publications Act]], a decision that was upheld by the Appeal Court and subsequently by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in the case known as ''[[Handyside v United Kingdom]]''. The government however allowed a second, censored edition to be published, in which some of the passages criticised in court were amended or cut.&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt;

The book was banned in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] by the Queensland Literature Board of Review in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/2017/05/04/little-red-school-book/|title=Little Red School Book|last=Bruce|first=Joan|date=4 May 2017|website=John Oxley Library blog, State Library of Queensland|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is referenced in the title of the 1998 [[Momus (artist)|Momus]] album, ''[[The Little Red Songbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imomus.com/littlereviews.html Reviews: Alternative Press - December, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discussed critically by [[Peter Hitchens]] in his book ''[[The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way]]'' (2009). It was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2008 presented and produced by [[Jolyon Jenkins]].&lt;ref name=BBCR4&gt;[[BBC Radio 4]] - In Living Memory - [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/inlivingmemory/pip/62r6s/ The Little Red Schoolbook] 18 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An unexpurgated edition of the book, bar one minor cut, was published in the UK during July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Moorhead [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/08/the-little-red-schoolbook-republished-soren-hansen "The Little Red Schoolbook - honest about sex and the need to challenge authority"], ''The Guardian'', 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering the field of [[Pagan studies]] including historical, sociological, and anthropological studies dealing with [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] and other forms of [[paganism|pagan]] religion. Since 2004 the journal has been published by [[Equinox Publishing (London)|Equinox Publishing]] and the [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Chas S. Clifton]] ([[Colorado State University–Pueblo]]).

The journal was established as a scholarly but not fully peer-reviewed publication in 1996 by [[Fritz Muntean]] and [[Diana Tracy]] with the subtitle ''A New Journal of Neopagan Thought''. In 2001 the production of the journal was put on hiatus, as Muntean stepped down as editor, to be replaced by Clifton when it resumed publication, this time as a fully peer-reviewed academic publication and with its current subtitle.

== History ==
[[File:Pomegranate New Journal.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The front cover to ''The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Studies'' (issue 17 portrayed).]]
The idea for ''The Pomegranate'' was initially developed by Fritz Muntean, a graduate student in [[religious studies]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] in Canada, who started the venture with his friend Diana Tracy, who was then living in Oregon in the United States.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially naming their work ''The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought'', the stated intention of the publication was to "provide a scholarly venue for the forthright and critical examination of Neopagan beliefs and practices".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt; From 1996 to 2001, Muntean published 18 issues of ''The Pomegranate'' on a quarterly basis, gaining a growing readership as time went on, particularly after Muntean and Tracy introduced the journal to the assembled members at the third Nature Religions Scholars Network (NRSN), a group which met in conjunction with the annual San Francisco meeting of the [[American Academy of Religion]].&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt;

Muntean eventually decided to move on from his work as editor of ''The Pomegranate'', leaving that position to be occupied by Clifton. Together, Muntean and Clifton searched for a new publisher, in 2003 eventually signing an agreement with Equinox Publishing.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt; Under Clifton's control, the journal's subtitle was changed to ''The International Journal of Pagan Studies'' and it adopted a peer review structure for the papers which it published.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 6"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in [[Religious and Theological Abstracts]], [[Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index]], [[Current Contents]]/Arts &amp; Humanities, and [[Academic Search Premier]] and other [[EBSCO Industries|EBSCO databases]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4596">'''Tierra templada''' (Spanish for ''temperate land'') is a pseudoclimatological term used in Latin America to refer to places which are either located in the [[tropics]] at a moderately high elevation or are marginally outside the astronomical tropics, producing a somewhat cooler overall [[climate]] than that found in the tropical lowlands, the zone of which is known as the [[tierra caliente]].

In countries situated close to the [[equator]], the tierra templada typically commences at an altitude of approximately 750 meters (roughly 2,500 feet), and extends to about 1,850 meters (or 6,000 feet), where the still cooler [[tierra fría]] begins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf Brigitta Schütt (2005); Azonale Böden und Hochgebirgsböden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182826/http://www.geog.fu-berlin.de/~phygeo/studium/diplom/ws_0405/ms_24505_boden/boeden_azonal_hochgebirge.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zech and Hintermaier, 2002"&gt;Zech, W. and Hintermaier-Erhard, G.

The Peruvian geographer Javier Pulgar Vidal used following altitudes: 

*1,000 m as the border between the tropical rainforest and the subtropical cloud forest
*2,300 m as the end of the subtropical cloud forest (''[[Yunga#Fluvial Yunga|Yunga fluvial]]'')
*3,500 m as the treeline
*4,800 m as the puna end&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: ''Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú''. Edit. Universo S.A., Lima 1979. First Edition (his dissertation of 1940): Las ocho regiones naturales del Perú, ''Boletín del Museo de historia natural „Javier Prado“'', n° especial, Lima, 1941, 17, pp. 145-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the English translation of its name, the tierra templada is not considered "[[Temperateness|temperate]]" by climatologists, for most of the areas so designated have average temperatures in their coldest months of above 18°C (64.4°F), thus making them tropical under climate classification schemes such as that of [[Vladimir Köppen]].  In the aforementioned scheme, many locations within the tierra templada are sometimes designated ''[[Köppen Climate Classification#Group A: Tropical|Afb]]'' or ''[[Köppen Climate Classification|Awb]]'', with the ''b'' denoting the fact that the warmest month has an average temperature of below 22°C (71.6°F), meaning that all twelve months of the year have averages of between 18°C and 22°C.  [[Chinchina, Colombia]], altitude 1,360 m, is an example of a place which would be labelled ''Afb'', as it has abundant rainfall year-round, while the climate of [[San José, Costa Rica]], altitude 1,161 m,  would fall under ''Awb'' since the latter city's rainfall regime consists of a wet summer and a dry winter. The "temperate" moniker in Spanish stems from these year-round warm temperatures that are not too hot (Tierra caliente) nor become too cold (Tierra fría). Various cities in this range have been nicknamed ''City of Eternal Spring'', most notably [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico.

In the tierra templada project pat, [[coffee]] is grown extensively as a cash crop, with grains such as [[wheat]] and [[maize|corn]] being cultivated for subsistence purposes - in contrast to the warmer tierra caliente, where tropical fruits predominate.

'''Wheat Research Centre''' is an autonomous national research institute that researches the production and cultivation of wheat in Bangladesh and is located in Nashipur, [[Dinajpur]], [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="wrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Islam|first1=Md Shahidul|title=Wheat Research Centre|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Wheat_Research_Centre|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fear of Fatal Fungal Disease: Wheat cultivation withheld in 8 dists|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/fear-fatal-fungal-disease-wheat-cultivation-withheld-8-dists-1309711|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=5 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Naresh Chandra Dev Barma is the head of the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global efforts to fight wheat blast|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/global-efforts-fight-wheat-blast-1454227|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=26 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wheat Research Centre traces its origins to the Accelerated Wheat Research Programme for Bangladesh which was founded in 1971 and ended in June 1975. It was revived as the Expanded Wheat Research Programme. Wheat Research Centre was established on July 1980 under the [[Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute]]. It is one of six research centres under the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute. It has released wheats developed by [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]]. From 1975 to 1985 wheat varieties released by the centre contributed to a 30 to 40 percent growth in wheat output in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="wrc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The centre is responsible for preventing wheat blast damage to corps and supporting farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Wheat blast' threatens yield|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/wheat-blast-threatens-yield-784372|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=1 March 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wheat blast affects 15,500 hectares of land in 5 dists|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/wheat-blast-affects-15500-hectares-land-5-dists-1208944|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=14 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
