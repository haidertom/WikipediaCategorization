'''ACT College,''' was a private [[career college]] in northern [[Virginia]]. specializing in [[Allied health]] career training.

On April 3, 2012, ACT College's website announced that the college was now closed.&lt;ref name=che1&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/financially-troubled-health-care-college-in-virginia-shuts-its-doors/42014?sid=at ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' April 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  The college had been on the U.S. Department of Education’s list of institutions with low   financial responsibility scores. The school was denied approval to continue to receive federal aid in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/college-that-abruptly-closed-reportedly-had-been-cut-off-from-federal-financial-aid/42127?sid=at ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' April 6, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__&lt;!--Table of Contents--&gt;

==Locations==

ACT College maintained locations in three communities in the Northern Virginia area: [[North Arlington, Virginia|North Arlington]], [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], and [[Bull Run, Prince William County, Virginia|Bull Run]]. The Bull Run location is named "Manassas" after the nearby city of [[Manassas]], and the North Arlington location is named "Arlington" after [[Arlington County|its county]].

The college began in Arlington in 1983 as Computer-Ease, a technology and business training institute. In 1992, the name changed to Applied Career Training as the institution changed its focus to [[Allied Health]] education.

In 1998, ACT College opened a second campus  in Alexandria, [[Virginia]]; in  2003, it opened a third campus in Bull Run (near [[Manassas]]). 
In 2004, the institution underwent another name change to '''ACT College''' to reflect its expansion into Associates Degree programs and continuing education courses.

==Academics==

ACT College offered degree and diploma programs preparing for entry-level positions as a medical assistant, medical office administrator, healthcare business administration,  dental assistant, and  pharmacy technician.

==Accreditations and approvals==

The  allied health  programs were accredited by the [[Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools]] (ABHES).,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abhes.org/accredited_institutions.htm ABHES Directory of Accredited Institutions&lt;/ref&gt; and approved by the   [[State Council of Higher Education for Virginia]] (SCHEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schev.edu/Students/PrivateCollegeList.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929200937/http://www.schev.edu/Students/PrivateCollegeList.asp |archivedate=2011-09-29 }} SCHEV Licensed Institution Listing&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AP Physics C: Mechanics''' (often referred to as '''AP C Mechanics''', '''AP Mechanics''', or simply '''AP Physics C''') is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[science]] course that studies [[Newtonian mechanics]]. It is one of the [[AP Physics]] courses offered in some [[Secondary education in the United States|U.S. secondary schools]]. 

==Course content==
Intended to be equivalent to an introductory [[college]] course in mechanics for physics or engineering majors,&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview&gt;{{citation | url = http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-course-overviews/ap-physics-c-mechanics-course-overview.pdf | format = PDF | title = AP®  PHYSICS C: MECHANICS | publisher = [[College Board]] | date = December 2016 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the course modules are:&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;
* Kinematics 
* Newton’s laws of motion 
* Work, energy and power 
* Systems of particles and linear momentum 
* Circular motion and rotation 
* Oscillations and gravitation.

Methods of [[calculus]] are used wherever appropriate in formulating physical principles and in applying them to physical problems. Therefore, students should have completed or be concurrently enrolled in a calculus class.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;

This course may be combined with [[AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism]] to make a unified Physics C course that prepares for both exams.

==AP test==

The course culminates in an optional exam for which high-performing students may receive some credit towards their college coursework, depending on which college or university they attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration===
The AP examination for AP Physics C: Mechanics is separate from the AP examination for AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. Before 2006, test-takers paid only once and were given the choice of taking either one or two parts of the Physics C test.

===Format===
The exam is configured in two categories: a 35-question [[multiple choice]] section and a 3-question [[free response]] section.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;  Test takers are allowed to use an approved calculator during the entire exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-physics-c-mechanics/calculator-and-table-policies | title = AP Physics C: Mechanics – Calculator and Table Policies | work = AP Students | publisher = [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is weighted such that each section is worth fifty percent (50%) of the final score.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;  Additionally, tables of equations, information, and constants are provided for all portions of the exam as of 2015. This and [[AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism]] are the shortest AP exams, with total testing time of 90 minutes.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | title = Topic Outline | work = College Board Tests | publisher = The College Board | year = 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130404054146/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | archive-date = April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrey Zeest - Amber Room 2 (autochrome).jpg|thumb |The Amber Room in the Catherine Palace, 1917|280px]]

The '''Amber Room''' ({{lang-rus|Янтарная комната|r=Yantarnaya Komnata}}, {{lang-de|Bernsteinzimmer}}, {{lang-pl|Bursztynowa komnata}}) is a reconstructed chamber decorated in [[amber]] panels backed with [[gold]] leaf and [[mirror]]s, located in the [[Catherine Palace]] of [[Tsarskoye Selo]] near [[Saint Petersburg]]. Constructed in the 18th century in [[Prussia]], the original Amber Room was dismantled and eventually disappeared during [[World War II]]. Before its loss, it was considered an "[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]". A reconstruction was installed in the Catherine Palace between 1979 and 2003.

The Amber Room was intended in 1701 for the [[Charlottenburg Palace]], in [[Berlin]], [[Prussia]], but was eventually installed at the [[Berlin City Palace]]. It was designed by [[Germans|German]] baroque sculptor [[Andreas Schlüter]] and [[Danes|Danish]] amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram. Schlüter and Wolfram worked on the room until 1707, when work was continued by amber masters Gottfried Turau and Ernst Schacht from [[Danzig]]. It remained in Berlin until 1716, when it was given by the Prussian King [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] to his then ally, [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. In Russia, the room was expanded, and after several renovations, it covered more than {{convert|55|m2|ft2}} and contained over {{convert|6|t|lb}} of amber.

The Amber Room was [[looted art|looted]] during World War II by the [[Army Group North]] of [[Nazi Germany]], and brought to [[Königsberg]] for reconstruction and display. Its current whereabouts remain a mystery. In 1979, efforts were undertaken to rebuild the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo. In 2003, after decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, the reconstructed Amber Room was inaugurated at the Catherine Palace.

==History==
===Creation===
[[Image:Bernsteinzimmer01.jpg|thumb|Corner section of the reconstructed Amber Room]]
The Amber Room was begun in 1701 with the purpose of being installed at [[Charlottenburg Palace]], the residence of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], the [[List of monarchs of Prussia|first King]] in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], at the urging of his second wife, [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover|Sophie Charlotte]].{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution 2014}}{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}} The concept and design of the room was drafted by [[Andreas Schlüter]].{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution 2014}}{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}} It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram, master [[artisan|craftsman]] to the [[Denmark|Danish]] court of King [[Frederick IV of Denmark]], with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau from [[Danzig]].{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution 2014}}{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|About 2014}}

Although originally intended for installation at Charlottenburg Palace, the complete panels were eventually installed at [[City Palace, Berlin|Berlin City Palace]].{{sfn|Wermusch|1991|p=15}} The Amber Room did not, however, remain at Berlin City Palace for long. [[Peter the Great]] of Russia admired it during a visit and in 1716, King Frederick I's son  [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] presented the room to Peter as a gift, which forged a Russo-Prussian alliance against [[Sweden]].{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|About 2014}}{{sfn|Daily Mail 2011}}

The original Berlin design of the Amber Room was reworked in [[Russia]] in a joint effort by German and Russian craftsmen.{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution 2014}}{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}} It was Peter's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elisabeth]] who decided the amber treasure should be installed at [[Catherine Palace]], where the Russian Imperial family typically spent their summers.{{sfn|About 2014}}{{sfn|St. Petersburg 2001}} After several other 18th-century renovations, the room covered more than {{convert|55|m2|ft2}} and contained over {{convert|6|t|lb}} of amber.{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|Daily Mail 2011}} The room took over ten years to construct.{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution 2014}}{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}

===Evacuation during World War II===
[[Image:Bernsteinzimmer05.jpg|thumb|right|An angel statue featured on the wall of the Amber Room]]

Shortly after the beginning of the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in World War II, the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room.{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution 2014}} However,   over the years the amber had dried out and become brittle, making it impossible to move the room without crumbling the amber.{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution 2014}} The Amber Room was therefore hidden behind mundane [[wallpaper]], in an attempt to keep German forces from seizing it, but the attempt to hide such a well-known piece of art failed.{{sfn|About 2014}}

German soldiers of [[Army Group North]] disassembled the Amber Room within 36 hours under the supervision of two experts.{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|About 2014}}{{sfn|St. Petersburg 2001}}{{sfn|Torney|2009|pp=185–186}} On 14 October 1941, the priceless room reached [[Königsberg]] in [[East Prussia]], for storage and display in the town's castle.{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|About 2014}}{{sfn|Torney|2009|pp=185–186}} On 13 November 1941, a Königsberg newspaper announced an exhibition of the Amber Room at [[Königsberg Castle]].{{sfn|Torney|2009|pp=185–186}}

===Last days in Königsberg===
Orders given by [[Hitler]] on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the movement of looted possessions from Königsberg.{{sfn|Toptenz 2014}} This allowed [[Albert Speer]], Reichminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport cultural goods of priority.{{sfn|Toptenz 2014}} However, before the Amber Room could be moved, [[Erich Koch]], who was in charge of civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General [[Otto Lasch]] in command.{{sfn|Los Angeles Times 1986}}

In August 1944, Königsberg was heavily fire bombed by the [[Royal Air Force]]. It suffered further extensive damage from artillery from the advancing [[Red Army]] before the final occupation on 9 April 1945.{{sfn|Spiegel 2014}}

==Reconstruction==
[[Image:Bernsteinzimmer06.jpg|thumb|right|Immense sums were spent on both the original and reconstructed Amber Room.]]
In 1979, the Soviet government decided to construct a replica of the Amber Room at [[Tsarskoye Selo]], a process that was to last 24 years and require 40 Russian and German experts in amber craftsmanship.{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|About 2014}} Using original drawings and old black-and-white photographs, every attempt was made to duplicate the original Amber Room. This included the 350 shades of amber in the original panels and fixtures that adorned the room.{{sfn|Daily Mail 2014}}{{sfn|Russia Beyond the Headlines 2013}} Another major problem was the lack of skilled workers, since amber carving was considered a nearly lost art form.{{sfn|Russia Beyond the Headlines 2013}} 

The financial difficulties that plagued the reconstruction project from the start were solved with the donation of $3.5 million from the German company [[E.ON]].{{sfn|Pravda 2003}} By 2003, the work of the Russian craftsmen was mostly completed.{{sfn|Russia Beyond the Headlines 2013}} The new room was dedicated by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.{{sfn|Telegraph 2004}}

In [[Kleinmachnow]], near Berlin, there is a miniature Amber Room, fabricated after the original.{{sfn|AskMen 2004}} The Berlin miniature collector Ulla Klingbeil had this copy made of original East Prussian amber.{{sfn|AskMen 2004}}

==Architecture==
The Amber Room is a priceless piece of art, with extraordinary architectural features such as gilding, [[carvings]], 450 kg (990 lb) amber panels, [[gold leaf]], [[gemstone]]s, and mirrors, all highlighted with candle light.{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|About 2014}}{{sfn|St. Petersburg 2001}} Additional architectural and design features include statues of [[angel]]s and children.{{sfn|About 2014}}{{sfn|St. Petersburg 2001}} Because of its unique features and singular beauty, the original Amber Room was sometimes dubbed the "[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]".{{sfn|About 2014}} Modern estimates of the room's value range from $142 million (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-amber-room-160940121/?no-ist|title=A Brief History of the Amber Room|author=Jess Blumberg|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=July 21, 2007|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over $500 million (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2016/04/23/Historian-claims-to-have-struck-gold-at-Nazi-bunker/9911461439148/|title=Historian claims to have struck gold at Nazi bunker|author=Marilyn Malara|publisher=UPI|date=April 23, 2016|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Amber Room was never seen in public again, though reports have occasionally surfaced stating that pieces of the Amber Room survived the war.{{sfn|Lucas|2000|pp=25–28}} Several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted the famous room being loaded on board the ''[[Wilhelm Gustloff (ship)|Wilhelm Gustloff]]'', which left [[Gdynia]] on 30 January 1945, and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine.{{sfn|Lucas|2000|pp=25–28}}

In 1997, an Italian stone mosaic that was part of a set of four stones which had decorated the Amber Room was found in [[Germany]], in the possession of the family of a soldier who claimed to have helped pack up the amber chamber.{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|Seattle Times 1997}} The mosaic came into the hands of the Russian authorities and was used in the reconstruction effort.{{sfn|RIA Novosti 2010}}{{sfn|Seattle Times 1997}}

[[File:Königsberg (Luftaufnahme).JPG|thumb|right 360px|Königsberg Castle, 1925]]
[[File:AfterwarKaliningrad.jpg|thumb|right 360px|Ruins of the castle, 1950s]]
In 1998, two separate teams, one German and one Lithuanian, announced they had located the Amber Room.{{sfn|Scotland on Sunday 2006}} The German team pointed to a silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the amber treasure was buried in a lagoon; neither of the two suggestions turned out to hold the Amber Room.{{sfn|Scotland on Sunday 2006}}

In 2004, a lengthy investigation by British [[investigative journalists]] Catherine Scott-Clark and [[Adrian Levy]] concluded that the Amber Room was most likely destroyed when Königsberg Castle was damaged,{{sfn|Guardian 2004}} first during the [[Bombing of Königsberg in World War II|bombing of Königsberg]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1944 and then by Soviet burning of the castle before later by the Soviet shelling of the remaining walls.{{sfn|Guardian 2004}}{{sfn|Denny|2007|p=163}} Documents from the Russian National Archives revealed this as the assessment of a Soviet report, written by Alexander Brusov, head of the Soviet team charged with locating the Amber Room following the war. The report stated:
{{cquote|Summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945.{{sfn|Khatri|2012|pp=90–95}}}}

These dates correspond with the end of the Battle of Konigsberg, which finished on 9 April with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion;{{sfn|Scott-Clark|Levy|2004|pp=309–330}} this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not want to be seen as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.{{sfn|Scott-Clark|Levy|2004|pp=309–330}}

Among other information retrieved from the archives was the revelation that the remaining Italian stone mosaics were found in the burned debris of the castle.{{sfn|Scott-Clark|Levy|2004|pp=322–323, 328}} Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction.{{sfn|Scott-Clark|Levy|2004|pp=108–109, 325}} Scott-Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful [[Cold War]] [[propaganda]] tool.{{sfn|Scott-Clark|Levy|2004|p=108-109, 325}} Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the [[Pavlovsk Palace]], reportedly stated: "It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed".{{sfn|Scott-Clark|Levy|2004|pp=301–313}}

After the report was made public, Leonid Arinshtein, who was a lieutenant in the Red Army in charge of a rifle platoon during the Battle of Konigsberg, said: "I probably was one of the last people who saw the Amber Room".{{sfn|ABC News 2004}} At the same time, he explained that the whole city was burning due to artillery bombardments, but also denied allegations that the Red Army burned the city on purpose by saying: "What soldiers would burn the city where they will have to stay?"{{sfn|ABC News 2004}}

A variation of this theory by some present-day residents of [[Kaliningrad]] (formerly Königsberg), is that at least parts of the room were found in the Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.{{sfn|ABC News 2004}}

Then in 1968, despite academic protests worldwide, Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] ordered the destruction of Königsberg Castle, thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible.{{sfn|ABC News 2004}} In more recent years, the search for the Amber Room has continued in different locations including near [[Wuppertal]], Germany.&lt;ref name="NBC_News_2015_report"&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/amber-room-go-inside-search-missing-8th-wonder-world-n371631?cid=sm_fb "Amber Room: Go Inside The Missing 8th Wonder of the World"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''{{lang|la|anno Domini}}'' is [[Medieval Latin]] and means "in the year of the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Anno%20Domini |title=Anno Domini |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |year=2003 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |quote=Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often presented using "our Lord" instead of "the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anno+Domini |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=782}} "since AD stands for ''anno Domini'', 'in the year of (Our) Lord'"&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the full original phrase "''anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi''", which translates to "''in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ".

This [[calendar era]] is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], with ''AD'' counting years from the start of this [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and ''BC'' denoting years before the start of the era. There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&amp;nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] of [[Scythia Minor]], but was not widely used until after 800.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm |authorlink=Dick Teresi |first=Dick |last=Teresi |title=Zero |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |date=July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}

The [[Gregorian calendar]] is the most widely used [[calendar]] in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation, and commercial integration, and recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |last=Eastman |first=Allan |title=A Month of Sundays |publisher=Date and Time |accessdate=2010-05-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506002355/http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |archivedate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[English language|English]] followed [[Latin]] usage by placing the "AD" abbreviation before the year number.{{efn|This convention comes from grammatical usage. ''{{lang|la|Anno 500}}'' means "in the year 500"; ''{{lang|la|anno domini 500}}'' means "in the year 500 of Our Lord". Just as "500 in the year" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas "AD 500" preserves syntactic order when translated.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010, pp. 476–7; Goldstein 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD&amp;nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&amp;nbsp;BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would neither be included in the BC nor the AD time scales.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.

== History ==
The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year—he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]", which was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. "However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date."{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}

[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}
* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
* The civil or consular year began on [[1 January]] but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).
* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.
* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984JHA....15..177T|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tøndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA347|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|date=2009|pages=345-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been speculated by Georges Declercq&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges, "Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

=== Popularization ===
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used ''Anno Domini'' dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731. In this same history, he also used another [[Latin]] term, ''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' ("in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" (''Annunciation style'').{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}

[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City. Charlemagne promoted the usage of the ''Anno Domini'' epoch throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]].]]
On the continent of [[Europe]], ''Anno Domini'' was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by the English cleric and scholar [[Alcuin]] in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[pope]]s continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in [[Roman Catholic]] countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;Patrick, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name=CathEncy-Chron &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when [[Russia]] did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Although ''Anno Domini'' was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term "Before Christ" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression ''"anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam"'' (so in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''"Anno an xpi nativitate"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the ...(th) year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. "xpi" is the [[Greek language|Greek]] χρι in Latin letters, which is an abbreviation for ''Christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios—left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis Pétau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for "Before Christ") to mark years prior to AD.&lt;ref&gt;

===New year===
{{See|New Year}}
When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:&lt;ref&gt;[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945–2000, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first "Annunciation style" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.
* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called "Nativity style" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.
* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second "Annunciation style" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.
* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180–1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.

== Birth date of Jesus ==
{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}
The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett 1992, p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches – one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M. Yamauchi 1989 {{ISBN|0-931464-50-1}} pp. 113–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other eras==
{{further|Calendar era}}
During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Although the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are yet used, in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', "year of the world" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;

The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.

The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.
&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative abbreviations [[Common Era|CE and BCE]], (sometimes written C.E. and B.C.E.) are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

The "Common/Current Era" ("CE") terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce_info1.htm |author=Robinson, B.A.|title=Justification of the use of "CE" &amp; "BCE" to identify dates.

For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that "B.C.E./C.E. …do not presuppose faith in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and hence are more appropriate for [[interfaith dialog]] than the conventional B.C./A.D."&lt;ref name=Cunningham2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=ed. by Philip A.|title=Pondering the Passion : what's at stake for Christians and Jews?|year=2004|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Md.

The translated term was 西元 ("xī yuán", "Western Era"). Later, in 1949, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] adopted 公元 (''gōngyuán'', "Common Era") for all purposes domestic and foreign.

== No year zero: start and end of a century ==
{{Further|0 (year)|Astronomical year numbering|Millennium|Century}}
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]]s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year "0" between them, so a new century begins in a year which has "01" as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This is at odds with the common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the [[Millennium celebrations|worldwide celebration of the new millennium]] took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"/&gt;

For computational reasons, [[astronomical year numbering]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc.{{efn|To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero). For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0).&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, 1992, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;}} In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

'''Attachment theory''' is a psychological model attempting to describe the dynamics of long-term and short-term [[interpersonal relationship]]s between humans. "Attachment theory is not formulated as a general theory of relationships; it addresses only a specific facet":{{sfn|Waters|Corcoran|Anafarta|2005|p=81}} how human beings respond within relationships when hurt, separated from loved ones, or perceiving a threat.{{sfn|Waters|Corcoran|Anafarta|2005|pp=80–84}} 

Provided any caregiver, all infants become attached--however individual differences in the quality of the relationships remain significant. 

In infants, attachment as a motivational and behavioral system directs the child to seek proximity with a familiar caregiver when they are alarmed, with expectation  they will receive protection and emotional support. 

[[John Bowlby]] believed that the tendency for primate infants to develop attachments to familiar caregivers was the result of evolutionary pressures, since attachment behavior would facilitate the infant's survival in the face of dangers such as predation or exposure to the elements.&lt;ref name=landa2013&gt;{{citation|last1=Landa|first1=S|last2=Duschinsky|first2=R|title=Crittenden's dynamic–maturational model of attachment and adaptation|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=17|issue=3|year=2013|pages=326–338|doi=10.1037/a0032102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important tenet of attachment theory is an infant needs to develop a relationship with at least one [[primary caregiver]] for the child's successful social and emotional development, and in particular for learning how to regulate their feelings. Any caregiver is likely to become the principal attachment figure if they provide most of the child care and related social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=J|year=1993|title=John Bowlby &amp; Attachment Theory|series=Makers of modern psychotherapy|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-07729-X|ref=harv|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of a sensitive and responsive caregiver, the infant will use the caregiver as a "safe base" from which to explore. 

This relationship can be [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]], as in the mother-child dyad often studied in Western culture, or it can involve a community of caregivers (siblings/extended family/teachers) as can be seen in areas of Africa and South America.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Nature of Human Development.|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vicedo|first=Marga|date=February 14, 2017|title=Putting attachment in its place: Disciplinary and cultural contexts|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17405629.2017.1289838|journal=European Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=14|pages=684–699|via=|doi=10.1080/17405629.2017.1289838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attachment Reconsidered Cultural Perspectives on a Western Theory|last=Quinn and Mageo|first=Naomi and Jeannette Marie|publisher=Palgrave McMillan|year=2013|isbn=978-1-137-38674-8|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It should be recognized "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about fifty per cent of the time. Their communications are either out of sync, or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Howe |first=David |date=2011 |title=Attachment across the lifecourse: A brief introduction |location=London |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=978-0-230-34476-1 |oclc=945766768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachments between infants and caregivers form even if this caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with them.&lt;ref name="Umemura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Umemura |first1=Tomo |last2=Jacobvitz |first2=Deborah |last3=Messina |first3=Serena |last4=Hazan |first4=Nancy |date=February 2013 |title=Do toddlers prefer the primary caregiver or the parent with whom they feel more secure? |journal=Infant Behavior &amp; Development |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=102–114 |pmid=23268105 |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2012.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves as best they can within such relationships. 

Based on her established [[Strange situation|Strange Situation Protocol]], research by [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Mary Ainsworth]] in the 1960s and 1970s found children will have different patterns of attachment depending on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name="Bretherton/Mul"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Bretherton I, Munholland KA |title= Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |location=New York|publisher= Guilford Press|isbn= 1-57230-087-6|pages=89–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children: [[secure attachment]], anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. 

'''Secure attachment''' is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. 

'''Anxious-ambivalent attachment''' is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. 

'''Anxious-avoidant attachment''' is when the infant avoids their parents. 

'''Disorganized attachment''' is when there is a lack of attachment behavior.

In the 1980s, the theory was extended to [[attachment in adults]]. Attachment applies to adults when adults feel close attachment to their parents, their romantic and platonic partners and their friends.

Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.

==Infant attachment==

[[Image:Mozambique024.jpg|thumb|alt=A young mother smiles up at the camera. On her back is her baby gazing at the camera with an expression of lively interest.|right|The attachment system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure. In close physical proximity this system is not activated, and the infant can direct its attention to the outside world.]]

Within attachment theory, ''attachment'' means "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought when the child senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prior|first1=V|last2=Glaser|first2=D|year=2006|title=Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders: Theory, Evidence and Practice|series=Child and Adolescent Mental Health, RCPRTU|location=London and Philadelphia|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=9781843102458|ref=harv|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | year = 1960 | title = 'Separation Anxiety' | url = | journal = [[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 89–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds are based on the child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. 

[[John Bowlby]] begins by noting organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like "fixed action patterns" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be "goal-corrected" with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). 

The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided these do not deviate much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. 

For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=15}} 

Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate bonds exist.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=15}} Some infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) toward more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top.{{sfn|Bowlby|1982|p=304–05}} 

The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain the accessibility and availability of the attachment figure.&lt;ref name=kobmad&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Kobak R, Madsen S |year=2008|title= Disruption in Attachment Bonds|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=23–47|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cultures use multiple forms of attachment including the [[Dyadic developmental psychotherapy|dyadic]] model most prominent in Western cultures and [[allomothering]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''Alarm''' is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger. 

'''Anxiety''' is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure. If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive, separation distress occurs.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=16}} 

In infants, physical separation can cause anxiety and anger, followed by sadness and despair. By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child's bond with the attachment figure. Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence, breakdowns in communication, emotional unavailability, or signs of rejection or [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]].&lt;ref name=kobmad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social and Personality Development Sixth Edition|last=Shaffer|first=David R.|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behaviours===
[[File:Kaitlyn reads a book..jpg|thumb|right|alt=A baby leans at a table staring at a picture book with intense concentration.|Insecure attachment patterns can compromise exploration and the achievement of self-confidence. A securely attached baby is free to concentrate on their environment.]]
The attachment behavioural system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=17}} 

Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble, and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity. 

During the second phase (two to six months), the infant discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive toward the caregiver; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours. The infant's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}} 

By the end of the first year, the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened, and following when able.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karen|first=R|year=1998|title=Becoming Attached: First Relationships and How They Shape Our Capacity to Love|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford and New York|isbn=0195115015|ref=harv|pages=90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a "safe base" from which to explore.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19}} Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore. If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviour is more strongly exhibited.&lt;ref name="ainsworth 67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ainsworth M |title=Infancy in Uganda: Infant Care and the Growth of Love|year=1967|isbn=0-8018-0010-2 |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety, fear, illness, and fatigue will cause a child to increase attachment behaviours.{{sfn|Karen|1998|p=97}}

After the second year, as the child begins to see the caregiver as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=19–20}} Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and plan their actions accordingly. For example, whereas babies cry because of pain, two-year-olds cry to summon their caregiver, and if that does not work, cry louder, shout, or follow.

===Tenets===
Common attachment behaviours and emotions, displayed in most social primates including humans, are [[Adaption|adaptive]]. The long-term evolution of these species has involved selection for social behaviors that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation, and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowlby|first=J|year=1971|origyear=1969|title=Attachment and Loss|edition=Pelican|volume=Vol. 1. Attachment|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780140212761|ref=harv|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the "set-goal" of the attachment behavioural system.

The baby has her arms and legs stretched out and arches her back smiling directly at the camera.|Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others.]]

Bowlby's original account of a [[Critical period|sensitivity period]] during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed. 

With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the beginning, many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term "monotropy" to describe this bias.{{sfn|Bowlby|1982|p=309}} Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean the relationship with the special figure differs ''qualitatively'' from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Rutter, Michael|year=1995|title=Clinical Implications of Attachment Concepts: Retrospect and Prospect|journal=Journal of Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|volume=36|pages=549–71 |pmid=7650083|issue = 4|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Main"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| author=Main M|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|title=Epilogue: Attachment Theory: Eighteen Points with Suggestions for Future Studies|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year=1999|pages=845–87|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|quote=although there is general agreement an infant or adult will have only a few attachment figures at most, many attachment theorists and researchers believe infants form 'attachment hierarchies' in which some figures are primary, others secondary, and so on.

Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others. This system, called the "internal working model of social relationships", continues to develop with time and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mercer|first=J|title=Understanding Attachment: Parenting, child care, and emotional development|year=2006|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0275982173|oclc=61115448|lccn=2005019272|ref=harv|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Internal models regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in the self and the attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships.&lt;ref name="Bretherton/Mul"/&gt; They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|p=39–40}}&lt;ref name="Bowlby 73"&gt;{{cite book|author= Bowlby J|year=1973|title=Separation: Anger and Anxiety|series= Attachment and loss. Vol. 2 |location=London| publisher=Hogarth |isbn=0-7126-6621-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|p=414–21}} As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child's behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.{{sfn|Bowlby|1971|p=394–395}}&lt;ref name="ainsworth 69"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Ainsworth MD|title = Object relations, dependency, and attachment: a theoretical review of the infant-mother relationship|journal = Child Development|volume = 40|issue = 4|pages = 969–1025|date=December 1969|pmid = 5360395|doi = 10.2307/1127008|publisher = Blackwell Publishing| jstor =1127008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
In Western culture child-rearing, there is a focus on single attachment to primarily the mother. This dyadic model is not the only strategy of attachment producing a secure and emotionally adept child. Having a single, dependably responsive and sensitive caregiver (namely the mother) does not guarantee the ultimate success of the child. Results from Israeli, Dutch and east African studies show children with multiple caregivers grow up not only feeling secure, but developed "more enhanced capacities to view the world from multiple perspectives."&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mothers and Others-The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding|last=Hrdy|first=Sarah Blaffer|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-674-03299-6|location=United States of America|pages=130, 131, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence can be more readily found in hunter-gatherer communities rather than Western day-care contexts.

In hunter-gatherer communities, in the past and present, mothers are the primary caregivers but share the maternal responsibility of ensuring the child's survival with a variety of different [[Allomothering|allomothers]]. So while the mother is important, she is not the only opportunity for relational attachment a child can make. Several group members (with or without blood relation) contribute to the task of bringing up a child, sharing the parenting role and therefore can be sources of multiple attachment. There is evidence of this communal parenting throughout history that "would have significant implications for the evolution of multiple attachment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attachment Reconsidered: Cultural Perspectives on a Western Theory|last=Quinn|first=Naomi|last2=Mageo|first2=Jeannette Marie|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013|isbn=978-1-137-38672-4|location=United States of America|pages=73, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "non-metropolis" India (where "dual income nuclear families" are more the norm / dyadic mother relationship is), where a family normally consists of 3 generations (and if lucky 4: grandparents, parents &amp; child / children, and maybe great-grandparents too), the child / children by default have four / six caregivers from whom to select for their "attachment figure". And a child's "uncles and aunts" (father's siblings and their spouses) also contribute to the child's psycho-social enrichment.

Although it has been debated for years, and there are tedious differences amongst cultures, research shows that the three basic aspects of Attachment Theory are in fact universal. &lt;ref&gt;van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A. Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: Universal and contextual dimensions. In: Cassidy J, Shaver PR, editors. Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications. 2nd. New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 880–905.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hypotheses are: 1)that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent. 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence. &lt;ref&gt; van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A. Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: Universal and contextual dimensions. In: Cassidy J, Shaver PR, editors. Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications. 2nd. New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 880–905.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment classification in children: The Strange Situation Protocol==
The most common and empirically supported method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by [[Mary Ainsworth]] as a result of her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below).&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S., Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S. (1978).  Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis '[[Reactive attachment disorder|Reactive Attachment Disorder]] (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and [[attachment disorder]] are not synonymous.

The 'Strange Situation' is a laboratory procedure used to assess infants' pattern of attachment to their caregiver by introducing an unexpected threat, two brief separations from the mother followed by reunion. In the procedure, the mother and infant are placed in an unfamiliar playroom equipped with toys while a researcher films the procedure through a one-way mirror. The procedure consists of eight sequential episodes in which the infant experiences both separation from and reunion with the mother as well as the presence of an unfamiliar person (the Stranger).&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."/&gt; The protocol is conducted in the following format unless modifications are otherwise noted by a particular researcher:

*Episode 1: Mother (or other familiar caregiver), Baby, Experimenter (30 seconds)
*Episode 2: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 3: Mother, Baby, Stranger (3 mins)
*Episode 4: Stranger, Baby (3 mins or less)
*Episode 5: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 6: Baby Alone (3 mins or less)
*Episode 7: Stranger, Baby (3 mins or less)
*Episode 8: Mother, Baby (3 mins)

Mainly on the basis of their reunion behaviour (although other behaviors are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Group B (later called 'secure'), Group A (later called 'anxious avoidant'), and Group C (later called 'anxious ambivalent'). There are subclassifications for each group (see below).

Beginning in 1970, a series of expansions were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=S.|title=The development of the concept of the object as related to infant-mother attachment.|journal=Child Development|date=1970|volume=41|pages=291–311|doi=10.2307/1127033}}&lt;/ref&gt; A/C (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=P.|title=Social networks, quality of parenting, and child development.|journal=Child Development|date=1985|volume=56|pages=1299–1313|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00198.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radke-Yarrow|first1=M.|last2=Cummings|first2=E.M.|last3=Kuczynski|first3=L.|last4=Chapman|first4=M.|title=Patterns of attachment in two and three year olds in normal families and families with parental depression|journal=Child Development|date=1985|volume=56|issue=4|pages=884–893|pmid=4042751|doi=10.2307/1130100}}&lt;/ref&gt; D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Main|first1=M.|last2=Cassidy|first2=J.|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age six: predictability from infant attachment classifications stable across a one-month period.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1988|volume=24|pages=415–426|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=P.M.|title=Quality of attachment in the preschool years.|journal=Development and Psychopathology|date=1992|volume=4|pages=209–241|doi=10.1017/s0954579400000110}}&lt;/ref&gt; A+, C+, &amp; Depressed (1992, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=P.

Each of these patterns reflects a different kind of attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus not a part of the infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snyder | first1 = R. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = S. | last3 = Treleaven | first3 = D. | year = 2012 | title = Attachment Theory and Mindfulness | url = | journal = Journal of Child &amp; Family Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 709–717 | doi=10.1007/s10826-011-9522-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attachment patterns==

"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond. Some insecure children will routinely display very pronounced attachment behaviours, while many secure children find that there is no great need to engage in either intense or frequent shows of attachment behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  “Individuals with different attachment styles have different beliefs about romantic love period, availability, trust capability of love partners and love readiness.” &lt;ref&gt;Honari, B., &amp; Saremi, A. A. (2015). The Study of Relationship between Attachment Styles and Obsessive Love Style. Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences, 165, 152-159. doi:10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.12.617&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure attachment===
{{Main|Secure attachment}}

A toddler who is securely attached to his or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp.441&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as "Group B" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."/&gt; Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviors led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively "loose" terminology for these subgroups. B1's have been referred to as "secure-reserved", B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as "secure-balanced", and B4's as "secure-reactive". In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply "B1" or "B2" although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.

Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.&lt;ref name="Aronoff, J. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aronoff | first1 = J | year = 2012 | title = Parental Nurturance in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: Theory, Coding, and Scores | url = | journal = Cross-Cultural Research | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 315–347 | doi=10.1177/1069397112450851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxious-ambivalent attachment===
Anxious-ambivalent attachment is also misnamed as "resistant attachment".&lt;ref name="Ainsworth,1978a"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |year=1978|title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation|publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location =Hillsdale NJ|isbn=0-89859-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a child with an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when his mother returns.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."/&gt; The anxious-ambivalent strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = J. | last2 = George | first2 = C. | last3 = De Jong | first3 = A. | year = 1995 | title = Children classified as controlling at age six: Evidence of disorganized representational strategies and aggression at home and at school | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 447–447 | doi=10.1017/s0954579400006623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organization of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp.&amp;nbsp;145–171&lt;/ref&gt;

The C1 (ambivalent resistant) subtype is coded when "resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes".&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

Regarding the C2 (ambivalent passive) subtype, Ainsworth et al. wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity. Their exploratory behavior is limited throughout the SS and their interactive behaviors are relatively lacking in active initiation. Nevertheless, in the reunion episodes they obviously want proximity to and contact with their mothers, even though they tend to use signalling rather than active approach, and protest against being put down rather than actively resisting release&amp;nbsp;... In general the C2 baby is not as conspicuously angry as the C1 baby.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), found that children with abusive childhood experiences were more likely to develop ambivalent attachments. The study also found that children with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.&lt;ref name="mccarthy1999avoidant"&gt;{{cite news|title = Avoidant/ambivalent attachment style as a mediator between abusive childhood experiences and adult relationship difficulties|last1 = McCarthy|	first1 = Gerard|last2 = Taylor|first2 = Alan|journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume = 40|number = 3|pages = 465–477|year = 1999|doi = 10.1111/1469-7610.00463|ref = mccarthy1999avoidant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxious-avoidant attachment===

An infant with an anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ainsworth | first1 = M.

Infants are depicted as anxious-avoidant when there is:&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away&amp;nbsp;... If there is a greeting when the mother enters, it tends to be a mere look or a smile&amp;nbsp;... Either the baby does not approach his mother upon reunion, or they approach in "abortive" fashions with the baby going past the mother, or it tends to only occur after much coaxing&amp;nbsp;... If picked up, the baby shows little or no contact-maintaining behavior; he tends not to cuddle in; he looks away and he may squirm to get down.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The infant's needs were frequently not met and the infant had come to believe that communication of emotional needs had no influence on the caregiver. 

Ainsworth's student [[Mary Main]] theorized that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situation Procedure should be regarded as "a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection" by de-emphasising attachment needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Main M | year = 1979 | title = The "ultimate" causation of some infant attachment phenomena | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 640–643 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00064992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver—avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ("disorganized distress"), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M. (1977a) Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. In R. Webb (ed.) Social Development in Childhood (pp.&amp;nbsp;33–78), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|disorganized attachment}}Disorganized/disoriented attachment===
Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed "tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through."&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, &amp; Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p.282&lt;/ref&gt; Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress".&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (1983) 'Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment' Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below). Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's colleague [[Mary Main]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mary |last1=Main |first2=Judith |last2=Solomon |year=1990 |chapter=Procedures for Identifying Infants as Disorganized/Disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHIfiCXE8EC&amp;pg=PA121 |pages=121–60 |editor1-first=Mark T. |editor1-last=Greenberg |editor2-first=Dante |editor2-last=Cicchetti |editor3-first=E. Mark |editor3-last=Cummings |title=Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-30630-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganized' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganized/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be more widely "recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Jean-Francois Bureau, M. Ann Easterbrooks, Ingrid Obsuth, Kate Hennighausen &amp; Lauriane Vulliez-Coady (2013) Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal, Attachment &amp; Human
Development, 15:5–6, 562–582&lt;/ref&gt;

There is rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = Grazyna | last2 = Kim | first2 = Sanghag | year = 2013 | title = Early Attachment Organization With Both Parents and Future Behavior Problems: From Infancy to Middle Childhood | journal = Child Development | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 283–296 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01852.x | pmid=23005703 | pmc=3530645}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself.&lt;ref&gt;Svanberg, P.O. (2009). Promoting a secure attachment through early assessment and interventions. In J. Barlow &amp; P.O. Svanberg (Eds.) Keeping the Baby in Mind, (pp.&amp;nbsp;100–114), London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as "open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished", as she worried that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated as if they were the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M. (1990). 'Epilogue' in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti &amp; E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;463–488&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, J. &amp; George, C. (1999a) The place of disorganization in attachment theory. In Judith Solomon &amp; Carol George (Eds) Attachment Disorganization (pp&amp;nbsp;3–32), p.27, NY: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent".&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, A. Egeland, B., Carlson, E. &amp; Collins, W.A. (2005) The Development of the person: the Minnesota study of risk and adaptation from birth to adulthood, NY: Guilford Press, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response."&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organization of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp.&amp;nbsp;159–160&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person."&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. &amp; Landini, A (2011) Assessing Adult Attachment: A Dynamic-Maturational Approach to Discourse Analysis, NY: W.W. Norton, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorization differences across cultures ===
Across different cultures deviations from the Strange Situation Protocol have been observed.  A Japanese study in 1986 (Takahashi) studied 60 Japanese mother-infant pairs and compared them with Ainsworth's distributional pattern. Although the ranges for securely attached and insecurely attached had no significant differences in proportions, the Japanese insecure group consisted of only resistant children with no children categorized as avoidant.  This may be because the Japanese child rearing philosophy stressed close mother infant bonds than in Western cultures.  In Northern Germany, Grossmann et al. (Grossmann, Huber, &amp; Wartner, 1981; Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, &amp; Unzner, 1985) replicated the Ainsworth Strange Situation with 46 mother infant pairs and found a different distributions of attachment classifications with a high number of avoidant infants: 52% avoidant, 34% secure, and 13% resistant (Grossmann et al., 1985).  Another study in Israel found there was a high frequency of an ambivalent pattern which according to Grossman et al. (1985) could be attributed a greater parental push toward children's independence. Although it has been debated for years, and there are tedious differences amongst cultures, research shows that the three basic aspects of Attachment Theory are in fact universal. &lt;ref&gt;van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A. Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: Universal and contextual dimensions. In: Cassidy J, Shaver PR, editors. Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications. 2nd. New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 880–905.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hypotheses are: 1)that secure attachment is the most desirable state, and the most prevalent. 2) maternal sensitivity influences infant attachment patterns and 3) specific infant attachments predict later social and cognitive competence. &lt;ref&gt; van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A.

New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 880–905.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model ===
Techniques have been developed to allow verbal ascertainment of the child's state of mind with respect to attachment. An example is the "stem story", in which a child is given the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and asked to complete it. For older children, adolescents and adults, semi-structured interviews are used in which the manner of relaying content may be as significant as the content itself.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaffer R|year=2007|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher= Blackwell|location=Oxford|pages=83–121|isbn=0-631-21628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no substantially validated measures of attachment for middle childhood or early adolescence (approximately 7 to 13 years of age).&lt;ref name=AACAP-2005&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |year=2005 |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=1206–19 |title=Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood |vauthors=Boris NW, Zeanah CH |others=Work Group on Quality Issues |pmid=16239871 |url=http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=September 13, 2009 |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000177056.41655.ce |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824051123/http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/rad.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behavior in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organized, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organized according to parenting authority.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M. &amp; Cassidy, J. (1988) Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6.
Developmental Psychology 24(3): 415–426&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patricia McKinsey Crittenden]] has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (2008) Raising Parents: Attachment, Parenting and Child Safety, London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden's ideas developed from Bowlby's proposal that "given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adulthood the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowlby|first=J|year=1980|title=Loss|location=London|publisher=Penguin|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strathearn | first1 = L. | last2 = Fonagy | first2 = P. | last3 = Amico | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Montague | first4 = P.R. | year = 2009 | title = Adult attachment predicts mother's brain and peripheral oxytocin response to infant cues | url = | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 13| pages = 2655–2666 | doi=10.1038/npp.2009.103 | pmid=19710635 | pmc=3041266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	'Affective information' – the emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this "affective information". In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. Where an infant is faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting, one strategy for maintaining the availability of their attachment figure is to try to exclude from consciousness or from expressed behaviour any emotional information that might result in rejection.

2.	Causal or other sequentially-ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.&lt;ref name=landa2013/&gt;

Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure (See section above on Disorganized/disoriented attachment for distinction of "Types"): "Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crittenden | first1 = P. | last2 = Newman | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Comparing models of borderline personality disorder: Mothers' experience, self-protective strategies, and dispositional representations | url = | journal = Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 433–451 [435] | doi=10.1177/1359104510368209 | pmid=20603429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively utilise both kinds of information without much distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crittenden | first1 = P.M. | year = 1992 | title = Children's strategies for coping with adverse home environments | url = | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 329–343 | doi=10.1016/0145-2134(92)90043-q | pmid=1617468}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.

===Significance of patterns===
Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care]] and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that "for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant's attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lyons-Ruth | first1 = Karlen | last2 = Jean- | last3 = Bureau | first3 = Francois | last4 = Easterbrooks | first4 = M.

Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt; Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function.&lt;ref name=bercasapp&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|vauthors=Berlin LJ, Cassidy J, Appleyard K |title=The Influence of Early Attachments on Other Relationships|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=333–47|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;

Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haltigan|first=JD|author2=Ekas NV|author3= Seifer R|author4= Messinger DS|title=Attachment security in infants at-risk for autism spectrum disorders.|journal=Attachment security in infants at-risk for autism spectrum disorders|date=July 2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=962–967|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=7&amp;sid=4ee26e89-71a6-4d34-930d-cfd04877e6fa%40sessionmgr11&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=cmedm&amp;AN=20859669|accessdate=1 December 2011|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1107-7|pmid=20859669|pmc=4486071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.&lt;ref name=bercasapp/&gt;

Some authors have questioned the idea that a [[wikt:taxonomy|taxonomy]] of categories representing a qualitative difference in attachment relationships can be developed. Examination of data from 1,139 15-month-olds showed that variation in attachment patterns was continuous rather than grouped.&lt;ref name="FraSpe"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fraley RC, Spieker SJ |title = Are infant attachment patterns continuously or categorically distributed?

There is some evidence that gender differences in attachment patterns of [[Adaption|adaptive]] significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause insecure attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. [[Adrenarche]] is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of insecure attachment in middle childhood.&lt;ref name=delguid&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sex, attachment, and the development of reproductive strategies|author=Del Giudice M|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2009|volume=32|pages=1–67|doi=10.1017/S0140525X09000016|pmid=19210806|issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in attachment during childhood and adolescence==
Childhood and adolescence allows the development of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.

Age, cognitive growth, and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining.&lt;ref name= "Waters"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Waters E, Kondo-Ikemura K, Posada G, Richters J |year=1991|title=Learning to love: Mechanisms and milestones|journal= Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology|volume= 23|issue=Self–Processes and Development|veditors=Gunnar M, Sroufe T |location= Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.&lt;ref name=marbrit&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Marvin RS, Britner PA |year=2008|title= Normative Development: The Ontogeny of Attachment|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=269–94|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Children marbles.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Three children aged about six years are in a group on the ground, a boy and girl kneeling and another boy seated cross-legged.

The third child is watching.|Peers become important in middle childhood and have an influence distinct from that of parents.]]

Ideally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship.&lt;ref name= "Waters"/&gt; By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual [[coregulation]] of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.&lt;ref name= "Waters"/&gt;

The attachment system used by adolescences is seen as a "safety regulating system" whose main function is to promote physical and psychological safety. There are 2 different events that can trigger the attachment system. Those triggers include, the presence of a potential danger or stress, internal and external, and a threat of accessibility and or availability of an attachment figure. The ultimate goal of the attachment system is security, so during a time of danger or inaccessibility the behavioral system accepts felt security in the context of the availability of protection. By adolescences we are able to find security through a variety of things, such as food, exercise, and social media. &lt;ref&gt;Kerns, Kathryn A., and Rhonda A. Richardson. Attachment in Middle Childhood. Guilford Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Felt security can be achieved through a number of ways, and often without the physical presence of the attachment figure. Higher levels of maturity allows adolescences teens to more capably interact with their environment on their own because the environment is perceived as less threatening. Adolescences teens will also see an increase in cognitive, emotional and behavioral maturity that dictates whether or not teens are less likely to experience conditions that activate their need for an attachment figure. For example, when teenagers get sick and stay home from school, surely they want their parents to be home so they can take care of them, but they are also able to stay home by themselves without experiencing serious amounts of distress. &lt;ref&gt;McElhaney, Kathleen Boykin, et al. “Attachment and Autonomy During Adolescence.” Wiley Online Library, Wiley-Blackwell, 30 Oct. 2009, onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy001012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are the attachment style differences during adolescences. &lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Harry, and B. Bradford Brown. “Primary Attachment to Parents and Peers during Adolescence: Differences by Attachment Style.” Journal of Youth and Adolescence, vol. 30, no. 6, 2001, pp. 653–674., doi:10.1023/a:1012200511045.&lt;/ref&gt;
Secure adolescences are expected to hold their mothers at a higher rate than all other support figures, including father, boy and girlfriends, and best friends.
Insecure adolescences identify more strongly with their peers than their parents as their primary attachment figures. Their friends are seen as a significantly strong source of attachment support.
Dismissing adolescences rate their parents as a less significant source of attachment support and would consider themselves as their primary attachment figure.
Preoccupied adolescences would rate their parents a their primary source of attachment support and would consider themselves as a much less significant source of attachment support.

==Attachment in adults==
{{Main|Attachment in adults}}{{See also|Attachment measures}}
Attachment theory was extended to adult [[romantic relationship]]s in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.

'''Securely attached''' adults tend to have positive views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Feeling sure has to do with a persons perception of control, feelings of competence, and a belief that they posses the ability to meet the challenges that they will face in the future. With adults, attachments in general, are more cumulative and much more multifaceted than earlier attachments. There are more exchanges of support within someones inner circle relationships or secure relationships, such as respect, confiding, reassurance, sick care, talking about one's health, and talking about things that could Corry or upset them. these types of exchanges provide adults with a secure base that they are able to depend on on a daily basis. &lt;ref&gt;Sperling, Michael B., and William H. Berman. Attachment in Adults: Clinical and Developmental Perspectives. Guilford Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anxious-preoccupied''' adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. the anxiety that adults feel prevent the establishment of satisfactory defense exclusion. Thus, it is possible that individuals that have been anxiously attached to their attachment figure or figures have not been able to develop sufficient defenses against separation anxiety. Because their lack of preparation these individuals will then overreact to the anticipation of separation or the actual separation from their attachment figure. The anxiety comes from an individuals intense and/or unstable relationship   that live the anxious or preoccupied individual in relatively defenseless. &lt;ref&gt;Sperling, Michael B., and William H. Berman. Attachment in Adults: Clinical and Developmental Perspectives. Guilford Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults with this attachment style tend to look way to far into things, whether that's a text message or a face-to-face conversation. Their thought and actions can lead to a painful cycle of self-fulfilling prophecies and even self-sabotage. They often seek a dismissive-avoidant partner. &lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Chelsea. “Avoidant Attachment: The Advanced Guide.” Depression Alliance, 29 May 2018, www.depressionalliance.org/avoidant-attachment/.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dismissive-avoidant''' adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with conflict by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Adults lack the interest of forming close relationships and maintaining emotional closeness with the people around them. They have a great amount of distrust in others but at the same time possess a positive model of self, they would prefer to invest in their own ego skills. Because of their distrust they cannot be convinced that other people have the ability to deliver emotional support. They try to create high levels of self-esteem by investing disproportionately in their abilities or accomplishments. These adults maintain their positive views of self, based on their personal achievements and competence rather than searching for and feeling acceptance from others. These adults will explicitly reject or minimize the importance of emotional attachment and passively avoid relationships when they feel as though they are becoming too close. They strive for self-reliance and independence. When it comes to the opinions of others about themselves, they are very indifferent and are relatively hesitant to positive feedback from their peers. Dismissive avoidance can also be explained as the result of defensive deactivation of the attachment system to avoid potential rejection, or genuine disregard for interpersonal closeness. &lt;ref&gt;Carvallo, Mauricio, and Shira Gabriel. “No Man Is an Island: The Need to Belong and Dismissing Avoidant Attachment Style.” PsycEXTRA Dataset, 2006, doi:10.1037/e511092014-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fearful-avoidant''' adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver, 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |title = Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 52|issue = 3|pages = 511–24|date=March 1987|pmid = 3572722|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1990|title= Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 59|pages= 270–80|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1994"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1994|title= Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships|journal= Psychological Inquiry|volume= 5|pages= 1–22|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BarthoHoro"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM |title = Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 61|issue = 2|pages = 226–44|date=August 1991|pmid = 1920064|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexually, securely attached individuals are less likely to be involved in one-night stands or sexual activity outside of the primary relationship, and more likely to report mutual initiation and enjoyment of sex. 

Dismissive-avoidant individuals tend to report activities reflecting low psychological intimacy (one-night sex, extra-dyadic sex, sex without love), as well as less enjoyment of physical contact. Research has demonstrated that for both sexes, insecure-ambivalent attachment was related to enjoyment of holding and caressing, but not of more clearly sexual behaviors.  

Relationally, insecure individuals tend to be partnered with insecure individuals, and secure individuals with secure individuals. Insecure relationships tend to be enduring but less emotionally satisfying compared to the relationship(s) of two securely attached individuals.  

Attachment styles are activated from the first date onwards and impact relationship dynamics and how a relationship ends. Secure attachment has been shown to allow for better conflict resolution in a relationship and for one's ability to exit an unsatisfying relationship compared to other attachment types.  Secure individuals authentic high self-esteem and positive view of others allows for this as they are confident that they will find another relationship.  Secure attachment has also shown to allow for the successful processing of relational losses (e.g. death, rejection, infidelity, abandonment etc.)  Attachment has also been show to impact caregiving behavior in relationships, too (Shaver &amp; Cassidy, 2018)

The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they have a set of rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.&lt;ref name="Pietro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rholes, Simpson, 2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Rholes WS, Simpson JA |year=2004|title= Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions|veditors=Rholes WS, Simpson JA |isbn=1-59385-047-6|encyclopedia= Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications|pages= 3–14|location= New York|publisher= Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of different measures of adult attachment, the most common being self-report questionnaires and coded interviews based on the [[Attachment measures#Adult Attachment Interview .28AAI.29|Adult Attachment Interview]]. The various measures were developed primarily as research tools, for different purposes and addressing different domains, for example romantic relationships, platonic relationships, parental relationships or peer relationships. Some classify an adult's state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment patterns by reference to childhood experiences, while others assess relationship behaviours and security regarding parents and peers.&lt;ref name=crofrasha&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|vauthors=Crowell JA, Fraley RC, Shaver PR |title=Measurement of Individual Differences in Adolescent and Adult Attachment|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=599–634|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternal deprivation===
The early thinking of the [[Object relations theory|object relations school]] of [[psychoanalysis]], particularly [[Melanie Klein]], influenced Bowlby. However, he profoundly disagreed with the prevalent psychoanalytic belief that infants' responses relate to their internal fantasy life rather than real-life events. As Bowlby formulated his concepts, he was influenced by case studies on disturbed and delinquent children, such as those of [[William Goldfarb]] published in 1943 and 1945.&lt;ref name= "Bowlby 51 quote"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Maternal Care and Mental Health |year=1951 |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=355–533 |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organization |quote=Each put his finger on the child's inability to make relationships as being the central feature from which all other disturbances sprang, and on the history of institutionalization or, as in the case quoted, of the child's being shifted about from one foster-mother to another as being its cause |last=Bowlby |first=John |pmid=14821768 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/issues/172381/ |pmc=2554008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref name="Bowlby 44"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bowlby J|year=1944|title=Forty-four juvenile thieves: Their characters and home life|journal= International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=25 |issue=19–52 |pages=107–27|quote= sometimes referred to by Bowlby's colleagues as "Ali Bowlby and the Forty Thieves"}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prayer Time in the Nursery--Five Points House of Industry.png|right|280px|thumb|alt=Two rows of little boys, about 20 in total, kneel before their beds in the dormitory of a residential nursery.

The maternal deprivation hypothesis published in 1951 caused a revolution in the use of residential nurseries.]]  Bowlby's contemporary [[René Spitz]] observed separated children's grief, proposing that "psychotoxic" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care.&lt;ref name=spitz1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spitz RA|year=1945|title=Hospitalism: An Inquiry into the Genesis of Psychiatric Conditions in Early Childhood|journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 1|pages=53–74|pmid=21004303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spitz"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Spitz RA|year=1951|title=The psychogenic diseases in infancy|journal= The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 6|pages= 255–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong influence was the work of social worker and psychoanalyst [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film ''A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital'' which was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visits by parents.&lt;ref name= "Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book|author= Schwartz J|title= Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis|year=1999|page=225 |publisher= Viking/Allen Lane |location=New York|isbn= 0-670-88623-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1951 monograph for the [[World Health Organization]], [[Maternal deprivation|''Maternal Care and Mental Health'']], Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment", the lack of which may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This was also published as ''Child Care and the Growth of Love'' for public consumption. The central proposition was influential but highly controversial.&lt;ref name="WHO 62"&gt;{{cite book|contribution= Preface|title=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|series= Public Health Papers|year=1962|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was limited empirical data and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowlby J|year=1988|title=A Secure Base: Clinical Applications of Attachment Theory|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415006406|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bowlby's theory sparked considerable interest in the nature of early relationships, giving a strong impetus to, (in the words of Mary Ainsworth), a "great body of research" in an extremely difficult, complex area.&lt;ref name="WHO 62"/&gt; Bowlby's work (and Robertson's films) caused a virtual revolution in hospital visiting by parents, hospital provision for children's play, educational and social needs and the use of residential nurseries. Over time, orphanages were abandoned in favour of foster care or family-style homes in most developed countries.&lt;ref name=rut&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Rutter M|year=2008|title= Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=958–74|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the publication of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'', Bowlby sought new understanding from the fields of evolutionary biology, ethology, [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and control systems theory. He formulated the innovative proposition that mechanisms underlying an infant's emotional tie to the caregiver(s) emerged as a result of [[evolutionary pressure]]. He set out to develop a theory of motivation and behaviour control built on science rather than Freud's psychic energy model. Bowlby argued that with attachment theory he had made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 86"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bowlby J|date=December 1986 |title= Citation Classic, ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''|url= http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1986/A1986F063100001.pdf|format=PDF|volume=50|issue= 18|publisher=Current Contents|accessdate = July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Szymon i Krystian 003.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A young mother kneels in a garden with her two children.

Bowlby's attention was first drawn to [[ethology]] when he read [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s 1952 publication in draft form (although Lorenz had published earlier work).&lt;ref name="lorenz 37"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lorenz KZ|year = 1937|title = The companion in the bird's world|journal = The Auk|volume = 54|issue = 3|pages = 245–73|doi=10.2307/4078077|jstor = 4078077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important influences were ethologists [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and [[Robert Hinde]].{{sfn|Holmes|1993|p=62}} Bowlby subsequently collaborated with Hinde.&lt;ref name="3 vans"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bowlby J |year = 2007|title = John Bowlby and ethology: An annotated interview with Robert Hinde|journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume = 9|issue = 4|pages = 321–35|doi = 10.1080/14616730601149809|pmid = 17852051}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 Bowlby stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests."&lt;ref name="bowlby 53"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bowlby J |title=Critical Phases in the Development of Social Responses in Man and Other Animals |year=1953 |journal=New Biology| volume=14|pages=25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "[[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]", a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a [[wikt:conspecific|conspecific]] or comparable object. After recognition comes a tendency to follow.

Certain types of learning are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range known as a [[critical period]]. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and Loss|edition=2nd|volume=Vol. 1.

====Psychoanalysis====

Adults stand in a line across the bottom right hand corner making the same gesture.|Evacuation of smiling Japanese school children in [[World War II]] from the book ''Road to Catastrophe'']]
[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] concepts influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, the observations by [[Anna Freud]] and [[Dorothy Burlingham]] of young children separated from familiar caregivers during World War II.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Freud A, Burlingham DT |title=War and children|year=1943 |isbn=978-0-8371-6942-2|publisher=Medical War Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including "[[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|drive theory]]" in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the "[[Cupboard Love|cupboard-love]]" theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.{{sfn|Holmes|1993|p=62–63}} Based on ideas of primary attachment and [[Neo-Darwinism]], Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear ''phases'' with [[regression (psychology)|''regression'']] to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.{{sfn|Holmes|1993|p=64–65}}

From early in the development of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year=1998|title= Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 92–119|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cass 98"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cassidy J|year=1998|title=Commentary on Steele and Steele: Attachment and object relations theories and the concept of independent behavioral systems|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 120–26|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele 98"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year= 1998|title= Debate: Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages=92–119 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal working model====
The philosopher [[Kenneth Craik]] had noted the ability of thought to predict events. He stressed the survival value of natural selection for this ability. A key component of attachment theory is the attachment behavior system. where certain behaviors have a predictable outcome (i.e. proximity) and serve as self-preservation method (i.e. protection). &lt;ref&gt; Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt; All taking place outside of an individuals awareness,  This [[Internal Working Model of Attachment|internal working model]] allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.&lt;ref name="JLaird"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson-Laird PN |year=1983|isbn=0-674-56881-8 |pages=179–87|title= Mental models| location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants absorb all sorts of complex social-emotional information from the social interactions that they observe. They notice the helpful and hindering behaviors of one person to another. From these observations they develop expectations of how two characters should behave, known as a "secure base script." These scripts provide as a template of how attachment related events should unfold and they are the building blocks of ones internal working models. &lt;ref&gt; Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[infant]]'s internal working model is developed in response to the infant's experience based internal working models of self, and environment, with emphasis on the caregiving environment and the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors. Theoretically, secure child and adult script, would allow for an attachment situation where one person successfully utilizes another as a secure base from which to explore and as a safe haven in times of distress. In contrast, insecure individuals would create attachment situations with more complications. &lt;ref&gt; Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Main | first1 = M. | last2 = Kaplan | first2 = N. | last3 = Cassidy | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Security in Infancy, Childhood, and Adulthood: A Move to the Level of Representation | url = | journal = Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 66–104 | doi=10.2307/3333827}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, internal working models are constant with and reflect the primary relationship with our caregivers. Childhood attachment has a direct impact on our adult relationships.

A [[parent]]'s internal working model that is operative in the attachment relationship with her infant can be accessed by examining the parent's mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lieberman|first=AF|year=1997|chapter=Toddlers' internalization of maternal attributions as a factor in quality of attachment|editors=Atkinson, Leslie; Zucker, Kenneth J|title=Attachment and psychopathology|location=New York, NY, US|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=277–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeanah | first1 = CH | last2 = Keener | first2 = MA | last3 = Anders | first3 = TF | year = 1986 | title = Adolescent mothers' prenatal fantasies and working models of their infants | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 193–203 | doi=10.1080/00332747.1986.11024321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has demonstrated that the quality of maternal attributions as markers of maternal mental representations can be associated with particular forms of maternal psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = DS | last2 = Moser | first2 = DA | last3 = Reliford | first3 = A | last4 = McCaw | first4 = JE | last5 = Coates | first5 = SW | last6 = Turner | first6 = JB | last7 = Rusconi | first7 = S | last8 = Willheim | first8 = E | year = 2015 | title = Negative and distorted attributions towards child, self, and primary attachment figure, among posttraumatically stressed mothers: What changes with Clinical Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES)? | url = | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 10–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Developments====

In the 1970s, problems with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sroufe LA, Waters E |year=1977|title= Attachment as an organizational construct|journal= Child Development|volume= 48 |pages=1184–99|doi=10.2307/1128475|issue=4|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|jstor=1128475}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct.&lt;ref name="WatCum"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Waters E, Cummings EM |title = A secure base from which to explore close relationships|journal = Child Development|volume = 71|issue = 1|pages = 164–72|year = 2000|pmid = 10836570|doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined.&lt;ref name="Tronick"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tronick EZ, Morelli GA, Ivey PK |year=1992|title=The Efe forager infant and toddler's pattern of social relationships: Multiple and simultaneous|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|pages=568–77|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.568|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.[[Image:Khmerchildren.jpg|thumb|right|alt=On the right a young boy of Asiatic appearance with a pudding basin haircut, leans over a baby lying on its back on the left. The boy and baby are touching noses. The baby gazes up at the boy with an expression of intense interest.|Research indicates that attachment pattern distributions are consistent across cultures, although the manner in which attachment is expressed may differ.]]Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies.&lt;ref name=ijzsag&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A |year=2008|title= Cross-Cultural Patterns of Attachment; Universal and Contextual Dimensions|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=880–905|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example [[Kisii people|Gusii]] infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices.&lt;ref name=ijzsag/&gt; The scholar [[Michael Rutter]] in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rutter (1974). ''The Qualities of Mothering''. New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.

The biggest challenge to the notion of the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of ''[[amae]]'' plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where ''amae'' is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory.&lt;ref name=ijzsag/&gt; Most recently a 2007 study conducted in [[Sapporo]] in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Behrens KY, Hesse E, Main M |title = Mothers' attachment status as determined by the Adult Attachment Interview predicts their 6-year-olds' reunion responses: a study conducted in Japan|journal = Developmental Psychology|volume = 43|issue = 6|pages = 1553–67|date=November 2007|pmid = 18020832|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MainCass"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Main M, Cassidy J |year=1988|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 24|pages= 415–26|doi= 10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in the 1990s such as [[Judith Rich Harris|J. R. Harris]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Jerome Kagan]] were generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism ([[nature versus nurture]]), stressing the effects of later experience on personality.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Nurture Assumption]]: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do|pages=1–4|isbn=978-0-684-84409-1 |author=Harris JR|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=Free Press |authorlink=Judith Rich Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-14-027605-3|author=Pinker S|title=[[The Blank Slate]]: The Modern Denial of Human Nature|pages=372–99|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|year=2002 |authorlink=Steven Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kagan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kagan J|year=1994|isbn=978-0-674-89033-6 |title=Three Seductive Ideas|location= Cambridge, MA|pages=83–150|publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the work on [[temperament]] of [[Stella Chess]], Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament.&lt;ref name=vbv/&gt; Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.&lt;ref name="schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author =Schaffer HR|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher=Blackwell|year = 2004|isbn=978-0-631-21627-8|page=113|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalyst/psychologists [[Peter Fonagy]] and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship through cognitive science as [[mentalization]]. Mentalization, or theory of mind, is the capacity of human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression.&lt;ref name="Fonagy et al."&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Jurist EL, Target M |year=2002 |title=Affect regulation, mentalization, and the development of the self|location= New York|publisher=Other Press|isbn=1-59051-161-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that this connection between theory of mind and the internal working model may open new areas of study, leading to alterations in attachment theory.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|p=165–68}} Since the late 1980s, there has been a developing rapprochement between attachment theory and psychoanalysis, based on common ground as elaborated by attachment theorists and researchers, and a change in what psychoanalysts consider to be central to psychoanalysis. [[Object relations]] models which emphasise the autonomous need for a relationship have become dominant and are linked to a growing recognition within psychoanalysis of the importance of infant development in the context of relationships and internalized representations. Psychoanalysis has recognized the formative nature of a child's early environment including the issue of childhood trauma. A psychoanalytically based exploration of the attachment system and an accompanying clinical approach has emerged together with a recognition of the need for measurement of outcomes of interventions.&lt;ref name=fogeta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|contribution=Psychoanalytic Constructs and Attachment Theory and Research|pages=783–810|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, research and Clinical Applications|editors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR|publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2|vauthors=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Target M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One focus of attachment research has been the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late-20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care.&lt;ref name="belsky"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Belsky J, Rovine MJ |title = Nonmaternal care in the first year of life and the security of infant-parent attachment|journal = Child Development|volume = 59|issue = 1|pages = 157–67|date=February 1988|pmid = 3342709|doi = 10.2307/1130397|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|jstor = 1130397}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific care-giver. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|p=160–63}} A [[natural experiment]] permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families after the end of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by [[Michael Rutter]], followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rutter M|date=January–February 2002| title = Nature, nurture, and development: From evangelism through science toward policy and practice| journal = Child Development| volume = 73| issue = 1| pages = 1–21| pmid = 14717240|doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.&lt;ref name=PPP/&gt;

For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers or being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change has made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries. There has been an increase in the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and gained legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.{{sfn|Mercer|2006|p=152–56}} Issues have been raised to the effect that the [[wikt:dyadic|dyadic]] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences, as infants often have multiple relationships within the family and in child care settings.&lt;ref name="McHale"&gt;{{cite journal|author= McHale JP|year=2007|title=When infants grow up in multiperson relationship systems|journal= Infant Mental Health Journal|volume= 28|pages= 370–92|doi= 10.1002/imhj.20142|issue= 4|pmc= 3079566}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested these multiple relationships influence one another reciprocally, at least within a family.&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zhang X, Chen C |year=2010|title=Reciprocal Influences between Parents' Perceptions of Mother-Child and Father-Child Relationships: A Short-Term Longitudinal Study in Chinese Preschoolers|journal= The Journal of Genetic Psychology|pmid= 20333893|volume= 171|issue= 1|pages= 22–34|doi= 10.1080/00221320903300387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a wide variety of studies have upheld the basic tenets of attachment theory, research has been inconclusive as to whether self-reported early attachment and later depression are demonstrably related.&lt;ref name = "Ma_attachment"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Ma, K |title=Attachment theory in adult psychiatry.

==Biology of attachment==
In addition to longitudinal studies, there has been [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] research on the biology of attachment.&lt;ref name=foxhane&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Fox NA, Hane AA |title=Studying the Biology of Human Attachment|year=2008|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=811–29|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has begun to include [[neural development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landers|first1=MS|last2=Sullivan|first2=RM|title=The development and neurobiology of infant attachment and fear.|journal=Developmental Neuroscience|date=2012|volume=34|issue=2–3|pages=101–14|pmid=22571921|doi=10.1159/000336732|pmc=3593124}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[behaviour genetics]] and [[temperament]] concepts.&lt;ref name= vbv/&gt; Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute to a range of interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes.&lt;ref name= vbv&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Vaughn BE, Bost KK, van IJzendoorn MH |year=2008|title=Attachment and Temperament |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=192–216|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years.&lt;ref name="marshall2005"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |pages=492–502 |doi= 10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |vauthors=Marshall PJ, Fox NA |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=219}}

 The quality of caregiving received at infancy and childhood directly affects an individuals neurological systems systems which controls stress regulation.&lt;ref name=foxhane/&gt;In psychophysiological research on attachment, the two main areas studied have been [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic response]]s, such as heart rate or respiration, and the activity of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]].  a system that is responsible for the body's reaction to stress . &lt;ref&gt; Adam EK, Klimes-Dougan B, Gunnar MR.

New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2007. pp. 264–304.&lt;/ref&gt;Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament and the extent to which attachment acts as a moderator. Recent studies convey that early attachment relationships become molecularly instilled into the being, thus affecting later immune system functioning. &lt;ref&gt; Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical Evidence communicates that early negative experiences produces pro inflammatory phenotype cells in the immune system, which is directly related to cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and certain types of cancer.  &lt;ref&gt;Chung HY, Cesari M, Anton S, Marzetti E, Giovannini S, Seo AY, Leeuwenburgh C. Molecular inflammation: Underpinnings of aging and age- related diseases. Ageing Research Reviews. 2009;8:18–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent improvements involving methods of research, have enabled researchers to further investigate the neural correlates of attachment in humans. These advances include identifying key brain structures, neural circuits, neurotransmitter systems, and neuropeptides are all involved in attachment system functioning and can tell us more about a certain individual, even predict their behavior. &lt;ref&gt;Coan JA. Toward a neuroscience of attachment. In: Cassidy J, Shaver PR, editors. Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications. 2nd. New York, NY: Guilford Press; 2008. pp. 241–265.&lt;/ref&gt; There is initial evidence that caregiving and attachment involve both unique and overlapping brain regions  &lt;ref&gt; Bartels A, Zeki S. The neural correlates of maternal and romantic love. NeuroImage. 2004;21:1155–1166.&lt;/ref&gt;Another issue is the role of inherited genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetic polymorphism|polymorphism]] of the gene coding for the [[Dopamine receptor D2|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[dopamine receptor]] has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[serotonin receptor]] with avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillath O, Shaver PR, Baek JM, Chun DS |title=Genetic correlates of adult attachment style |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=1396–405 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18687882 |doi=10.1177/0146167208321484 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies show that attachment in adulthood is simultaneously related to biomarkers of immunity. For example, individuals with an avoidance attachment attachment style produce higher levels of the pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) when reacting to an interpersonal stressor &lt;ref&gt;Gouin J, Glaser R, Loving TJ, Malarkey WB, Stowell J, Houts C, Kiecolt-Glaser JK.

Maternal warmth buffers the effects of low early-life socioeconomic status on proinflammatory signaling in adulthood. Molecular Psychiatry. 2011;16:729–737. &lt;/ref&gt; One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Belsky J, Pasco Fearon RM |year=2008|title=Precursors of Attachment Security |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=295–316|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical applications==
As a theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]], attachment theory has implications and practical applications in social policy, decisions about the care and welfare of children and mental health.

===Child care policies===
Social policies concerning the care of children were the driving force in Bowlby's development of attachment theory. The difficulty lies in applying attachment concepts to policy and practice.&lt;ref name=rut08&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Rutter M|title=Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=2008|location=New York and London|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=958–74|isbn=978-1-60623-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[C.H. Zeanah]] and colleagues stated, "Supporting early child-parent relationships is an increasingly prominent goal of mental health practitioners, community-based service providers and policy makers&amp;nbsp;... Attachment theory and research have generated important findings concerning early child development and spurred the creation of programs to support early child-parent relationships."&lt;ref name="BZL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Berlin L, Zeanah CH, Lieberman AF |title=Prevention and Intervention Programs for Supporting Early Attachment Security|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=2008|location=New York and London|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=745–61|isbn=978-1-60623-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing that early child parent relationships is crucial for child development. You would assume that individuals would be educated on child development and the importance of the early parent-child relationship. However, our current education system is more concerned with sex education rather than healthy relationship tactics and skills needed to parent in a sensitive, responsive manner.  If  Researchers and educators could work together and develop future-parent curriculum for the high school and university levels, It would benefit society as a whole. With the dynamic nature of social and economic environments,  many families struggle balancing work and family responsibilities. Finding quality childcare while at work or school is another issue for many families.NIHD recent study convey that top notch day care contributes to secure attachment relationships in children. &lt;ref&gt; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network. The effects of infant child care on infant-mother attachment security: Results of the NICHD study of early child care. Child Development. 1997;68:860–879. &lt;/ref&gt; people have commented on this matter stating that “legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate's degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions” &lt;ref&gt; Sweeney GM. Why childhood attachment matters: Implications for personal happiness, families and public policy. In: Loveless S, Homan T, editors. The family in the new millennium. Westport, CT: Praeger; 2007. pp. 332–346.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations should implement more flexible work arrangements that recognize child care as essential for all its employees. This includes re-examination of parental leave policies. Too many parents are forced to return to work too soon post childbirth because of company policy or financial necessity. No matter the reason this inhibits early parent child bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Jude, et al. “Contributions of Attachment Theory and Research: A Framework for Future Research, Translation, and Policy.” Development and Psychopathology, vol. 25, no. 4pt2, 2013, pp. 1415–1434., doi:10.1017/s0954579413000692.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, there should be increased attention to the training and screening of childcare workers. In his article reviewing Attachment Theory, Sweeney suggested, among several policy implications, “legislative initiatives reflecting higher standards for credentialing and licensing childcare workers, requiring education in child development and attachment theory, and at least a two-year associate's degree course as well as salary increases and increased stature for childcare positions” &lt;ref&gt; Sweeney GM. Why childhood attachment matters: Implications for personal happiness, families and public policy. In: Loveless S, Homan T, editors. The family in the new millennium. Westport, CT: Praeger; 2007. pp. 332–346.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Historically, attachment theory had significant policy implications for hospitalized or institutionalized children, and those in poor quality daycare.{{sfn|Karen|1998|p=252–58}} Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although it is difficult to provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.&lt;ref name=rut08/&gt;

Attachment theory has implications in [[Residence in English family law|residence]] and [[Contact (law)|contact]] disputes,{{sfn|Karen|1998|p=252–58}} and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus focusing on the quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. [[Michael Rutter|Rutter]] noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships.&lt;ref name=rut99&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Rutter M, O'Connor TG |title=Implications of Attachment Theory for Child Care Policies|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=823–44|isbn=1-57230-087-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along with the impact of step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.&lt;ref name=rut08/&gt;

Attachment theory can also inform decisions made in [[social work]], especially in [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]] ([[Microsociology|Petru Stefaroi]]),&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2012). Humanistic Paradigm of Social Work or Brief Introduction in Humanistic Social Work. ''Social Work Review'', (10)1, pp.161–174.

Humane &amp; Spiritual Qualities of the Professional in Humanistic Social Work: Humanistic Social Work – The Third Way in Theory and Practice, Charleston, SC: Createspace.&lt;/ref&gt; and court processes about [[foster care]] or other placements. Considering the child's attachment needs can help determine the level of risk posed by placement options.&lt;ref name=0to3&gt;{{cite journal|title=Separation and Reunification: Using Attachment Theory and Research to Inform Decisions Affecting the Placements of Children in Foster Care |vauthors=Goldsmith DF, Oppenheim D, Wanlass J |journal=Juvenile and Family Court Journal |volume=Spring |year=2004 |pages=1–14 |url=http://www.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/AttachmentandFosterCare.pdf?docID=2542 |accessdate=2009-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013210209/http://www.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/AttachmentandFosterCare.pdf?docID=2542 |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crittenden |first1=Patricia McKinsey |last2=Farnfield |first2=Steve |last3=Landini |first3=Andrea |last4=Grey |first4=Ben |display-authors=etal |year=2013 |title=Assessing attachment for family court decision making |journal=Journal of Forensic Practice |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=237–248 |doi=10.1108/jfp-08-2012-0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within adoption, the shift from "closed" to "open" adoptions and the importance of the search for biological parents would be expected on the basis of attachment theory. Many researchers in the field were strongly influenced by it.&lt;ref name=rut08/&gt;

===Clinical practice in children===
Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]] with one of the widest research lines in modern psychology, it has, until recently, been less used in clinical practice.
[[Image:Father and child, Dhaka.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young father dressed in a pink cotton shirt holds his child and gazes at the camera looking proud but tired. The little girl, wearing a sleeveless dress, sits on her father's arm and frowns directly at the camera.|Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives.]]The attachment theory focused on the attention of the child when the mother is there and the responses that the child shows when the mother leaves, which indicated the attachment and bonding of the mother and the child. The attention therapy is the done while the child is being restrained by the therapists and the responses displayed were noted. The tests were done to show the responses of the child.

This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] interventions misleadingly known as "[[attachment therapy]]".&lt;ref name="Ziv"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ziv Y| title=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research|encyclopedia= Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |series= Duke series in child development and public policy |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT |year=2005|publisher= Guilford Press | location=New York and London|isbn= 1-59385-470-6|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention and treatment====
{{Main|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
In 1988, Bowlby published a series of lectures indicating how attachment theory and research could be used in understanding and treating child and family disorders. His focus for bringing about change was the parents' internal working models, parenting behaviours and the parents' relationship with the therapeutic intervenor.&lt;ref name=berlinetal&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prevention and Intervention Programs for Supporting Early Attachment Security|pages=745–61|vauthors=Berlin LJ, Zeanah CH, Lieberman AF |veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year=2008|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York and London|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research has led to a number of individual treatments and prevention and intervention programmes.&lt;ref name=berlinetal/&gt; In regards to personal development, children from all the age groups were tested to show the effectiveness of the theory that is being theorized by Bowlby. They range from individual therapy to public health programmes to interventions designed for foster caregivers. For infants and younger children, the focus is on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=231–32}}&lt;ref name="BakermansKranenburg ''et al.'' (2003)"&gt;{{cite early childhood |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |pages=195–215 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.2.195 |pmid=12696839 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the caregiver is invariably included, as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behaviour and caregiver response. Some programmes are aimed at foster carers because the attachment behaviours of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Modern prevention and intervention programmes have proven successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Kent T. |last2=Marvin |first2=Robert S. |last3=Cooper |first3=Glen |last4=Powell |first4=Bert | display-authors=etal |date=December 2006 |title=Changing toddlers' and preschoolers' attachment classifications: the Circle of Security intervention |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1017–1026 |pmid=17154732 |doi=10.1037/0022-006x.74.6.1017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reactive attachment disorder and attachment disorder====
{{Main|Reactive attachment disorder|Attachment disorder}}
One atypical attachment pattern is considered to be an actual disorder, known as ''reactive attachment disorder'' or RAD, which is a recognized psychiatric diagnosis ([[ICD-10]] F94.1/2 and [[DSM-IV-TR]] 313.89). Against common misconception, this is not the same as 'disorganized attachment'. The essential feature of reactive attachment disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age five years, associated with gross pathological care. There are two subtypes, one reflecting a disinhibited attachment pattern, the other an inhibited pattern. RAD is not a description of insecure attachment styles, however problematic those styles may be; instead, it denotes a lack of age-appropriate attachment behaviours that may appear to resemble a clinical disorder.&lt;ref name="Thompson (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson RA |title=The legacy of early attachments |journal=Child Development |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=145–52 |year=2000 |pmid=10836568 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "reactive attachment disorder" is now popularly applied to perceived behavioural difficulties that fall outside the DSM or ICD criteria, particularly on the Web and in connection with the pseudo-scientific attachment therapy, "true" RAD is thought to be rare.&lt;ref name="chaffin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaffin M, Hanson R, Saunders BE |title=Report of the APSAC task force on attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems|journal=Child Maltreatment |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=76–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16382093 |doi=10.1177/1077559505283699|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Attachment disorder" is an ambiguous term, which may be used to refer to reactive attachment disorder or to the more problematical insecure attachment styles (although none of these are clinical disorders). It may also be used to refer to proposed new classification systems put forward by theorists in the field,{{sfn|Prior|Glaser|2006|p=223–25}} and is used within attachment therapy as a form of unvalidated diagnosis.&lt;ref name="chaffin"/&gt; One of the proposed new classifications, "secure base distortion" has been found to be associated with caregiver traumatization.&lt;ref name=schecter&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schechter DS, Willheim E |title=Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=665–86 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19486844 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2009.03.001 |pmc=2690512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical practice in adults and families===

As attachment theory offers a broad, far-reaching view of human functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment.&lt;ref name="Slade 2008"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Slade A|year=2008|title= Attachment Theory and Research: Implications for the theory and practice of individual psychotherapy with adults|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=762–82|isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within [[relational psychoanalysis]] and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns.&lt;ref name="Slade 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sable"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sable P|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7657-0284-5|title= Attachment &amp; Adult Psychotherapy|location= Northvale, NJ|publisher= Aaronson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berlin School of Library and Information Science''' at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] (in German, "'''Institut für Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft'''") offers study programmes at three levels: bachelors, masters (both a standard program and a postgraduate distant learning program), and doctoral. It is the only institute in Germany with a doctoral programme and the right to award doctorates. Research methods are also an integral part of the pre-doctoral curriculum.

The Berlin School is part of a growing [[list of i-schools]] devoted to the study of information as a discipline. It is one of two members in Germany and the only one in the iCaucus group.

==History==

The Berlin School traces its roots back to the early 20th century. It was closed for a time during the Nazi era. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, the two library programs at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and at [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]] were combined. During the initial years of the 21st century the university had to decide whether to close the school or to transform it. The university decided on transformation and set about gathering the financial resources to make that happen.

In the past the School had offered a quality but fundamentally conventional German library program with a strong emphasis on history and the practical skills necessary to be effective in an entry-level position at a German library. The goal in 2006 became the creation of an internationally competitive “iSchool” on the explicit model of the School of Information at the University of Michigan. It was strengthened with the addition of Peter Schirmbacher and Michael Seadle as new professors at the highest (W3) rank. Schirmbacher brought a wealth of successful digital projects with him and Seadle brought experience with comparable projects plus US connections. Other new faculty included Stefan Gradmann (2008-2013) and Vivien Petras, both of whom led important parts of the Europeana project. Konrad Umlauf completes the spectrum as an expert on public libraries and library management.

Key elements of this transformation included a curriculum with significantly more emphasis on the digital future and the skills necessary to function within that environment. The curriculum put strong emphasis on research and research methods, partly because the Berlin School is the only library and information program at a research-oriented university in Germany, and partly because problem solving in the digital environment inherently involves research. The research emphasis was  also intended to distinguish Humboldt's program from those of the “universities of applied sciences” (''Fachhochschule'').&lt;ref&gt;Seadle, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berlin Library Science Colloquium==
The Berlin Library Science Colloquium ("Berlin Bibliothekswissenschaftliches Kolloquium", BBK). offers during each semester a range of international speakers on current topics of information science, innovative projects and library and information science research. Most presentations (either in English or German) are available as recordings from the BBK-Website .&lt;ref&gt;BBK, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Below are only some of the national and international projects in which the Berlin School plays a significant role. For a full list of projects, see: http://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte


'''Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana'''&lt;ref&gt;DM2E Project, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2012-2015) aims to technically enable as many content providers as possible to integrate their content into Europeana. 

'''re3data.org''' [[Registry_of_Research_Data_Repositories|registry of research data repositories]] (2012-2014) &lt;ref&gt;re3data.org (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal of re3data.org is to create a global registry of research data repositories from different academic disciplines. re3data.org presents repositories for the permanent storage and access of data sets to researchers, funding bodies, publishers and scholarly institutions. In the course of this mission re3data.org aims to promote a culture of sharing, increased access and better visibility of research data.

'''LuKII''' ([[LOCKSS]] und KOPAL Infrastruktur und Interoperabilität) (2009-2012) was a project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;LuKII, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The project proposes interoperability between the open-source elements of two existing archiving systems (LOCKSS and KOPAL) in order to combine cost-effective bitstream preservation with an established tool for usability maintenance and format migration.
The German National Library was a partner on LuKII.

'''IUWIS''' (Infrastruktur Urheberrecht für Wissenschaft und Bildung) (2009-2011) is also project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;IUWIS, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It offers information and discussion opportunities about copyright for research and education, and aims both as the producers of copyright-protected information as well as users. The University of Constance was a partner on IUWIS.

==Building &amp; Location==

The School's home is a 1903 building by architects [[Cremer &amp; Wolffenstein|Wilhelm Cremer und Richard Wolffenstein]] and can be found Dorotheenstraße 26, directly across from the historic Main Building or Hauptgebäude of the university.&lt;ref&gt;IBI, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''big man''' is a highly influential individual in a [[tribe]], especially in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. Such a person may not have formal tribal or other authority (through for instance material possessions, or inheritance of rights), but can maintain recognition through skilled persuasion and wisdom. The big man has a large group of followers, both from his [[clan]] and from other clans. He provides his followers with protection and economic assistance, in return receiving support which he uses to increase his status.

==Big man "system"==

The [[United States|American]] anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]] has studied the big man phenomenon. In his much-quoted&lt;ref&gt;
James Whitley ("Social Diversity in Dark Age Greece", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''86''' (1991:341-365) applied Sahlins' ethnographic model to instability in settlement patterns during the [[Greek Dark Age]], 10th-8th centuries BCE.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
1963 article  "Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief: Political Types in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]", Sahlins uses analytically constructed ideal-types of hierarchy and equality to compare a larger-scale Polynesian-type hierarchical society of chiefs and sub-chiefs with a Melanesian-type big-man system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |URL=http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf |author=Marshall Sahlins |title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief; Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=5 |number=3 |pages=285-303 |date=April 1963 |archive-date=1 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101000000/http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter consists of segmented lineage groups, locally held together by faction-leaders who compete for power in the social structure of horizontally arranged and principally equal groupings (factions). Here, leadership is not ascribed, but rather gained through action and competition "with other ambitious men".

==Position==
{{main|Moka exchange}}
A big man's position is never secured in an inherited position at the top of a hierarchy, but is always challenged by the different big-men who compete with one another in an ongoing process of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and re-distribution of material and political resources. As such the big man is subject to a [[Transactional analysis|transactional]] order based on his ability to balance the simultaneously opposing pulls of securing his own renown through distributing resources to other big man groups (thereby spreading the word of his power and abilities) ''and'' redistributing resources to the people of his own faction (thereby keeping them content followers of his able leadership).

The big man concept is relatively fluid, and formal authority of such figures is very low to nonexistent. His position is not inherently heritable.

In the Island of Malaita in Solomon Islands the big man system is dying away as westernization is influencing the people,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but the big man system can be seen at the political level. Every four years in [[Solomon Islands]]' National Elections the system can be clearly seen among the people, especially in the Melanesian Islands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==System in Papua New Guinea==
The first use of the term may be found in the English-translation of Dreissig Jahre in der Sudsee (1907) by [[Richard Parkinson (explorer)|Richard Parkinson]]. The term may be often found in many historical works dealing with Papua New Guinea. Andrew J. Strathern&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, ''The Rope of Moka: big-men and ceremonial exchange in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea'' (Cambridge, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; applies the concept of big-men to a community in [[Mount Hagen]], Papua New Guinea.

Traditionally, among peoples of non-[[Austronesian]]-speaking communities, authority was obtained by a man (the so-called "big man") recognised as "performing most capably in social, political, economic and ceremonial activities".&lt;ref&gt;Waiko, John D. (1993). ''A Short History of Papua New Guinea'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-553164-7}}, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; His function was not to command, but to influence his society through his example. He was expected to act as a negotiator with neighbouring groups, and to periodically redistribute food (generally produced by his wives). In this sense, he was seen as ensuring the well-being of his community.

Such a system is still found in many parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], and other parts of [[Melanesia]].

'''''But I'm a Cheerleader''''' is a 1999 American [[Satire|satirical]] [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Jamie Babbit]] and written by [[Brian Wayne Peterson]]. [[Natasha Lyonne]] stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school cheerleader whose parents send her to a residential inpatient [[conversion therapy]] camp to cure her [[lesbianism]]. There Megan soon comes to embrace her sexual orientation, despite the therapy, and falls in love. The supporting cast includes [[Melanie Lynskey]], [[Dante Basco]], [[Eddie Cibrian]], [[Clea DuVall]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], Katrina Phillips, [[RuPaul]], [[Richard Moll]], [[Mink Stole]], [[Kip Pardue]], [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], and [[Bud Cort]].

''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first feature film. It was inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the [[social construction]] of [[gender role]]s and [[heteronormativity]]. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.

When it was initially rated as [[NC-17]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R]]. When interviewed in the documentary film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with gay content.

Many critics did not like the film, comparing it unfavorably with the films of [[John Waters]] and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, some of the characters were described as [[stereotype|stereotypical]].

== Plot ==
Seventeen-year-old Megan ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) is a sunny high school [[Twelfth grade|senior]] who loves cheerleading and is dating a [[American football|football player]], Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in [[vegetarianism]] and [[Melissa Etheridge]], her family and friends suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of [[ex-gay]] Mike ([[RuPaul]]), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a [[reparative therapy]] camp which uses a five-step program (similar to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]' [[twelve-step program]]) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.

At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown ([[Cathy Moriarty]]), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock ([[Eddie Cibrian]]),{{refn|In ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'', Nikki Sullivan calls Rock "overtly homosexual" and says that Mary's desire to cure her son of homosexuality is the inspiration for the True Directions program. (According to the film's backstory, she started True Directions after her husband left her for another man.)&lt;ref name=Sullivan55 /&gt;|group="nb"}} and a group of young people trying to "cure" themselves of their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian (step 1 of the five-step program). This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton ([[Dante Basco]] and [[Kip Pardue]]), [[making out]]. She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.

The True Directions program involves the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their [[gender identity]] by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding the [[Root cause|root]] of their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, Graham ([[Clea DuVall]]) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.

The True Directions kids are encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, [[ex-ex-gay]]s Larry and Lloyd ([[Richard Moll]] and [[Wesley Mann]]), who take the campers to a local [[gay bar]] where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all [[Picketing (protest)|picket]] Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting [[Homophobia|homophobic]] abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.

Megan and Dolph infiltrate the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham nervously declines. Megan then performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her, finally winning Graham over. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents ([[Mink Stole]] and [[Bud Cort]]) attending a [[PFLAG]] meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.

== Background and production ==
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first feature film.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; She had previously directed two [[short subject|short films]], ''Frog Crossing'' (1996) and ''[[Sleeping Beauties]]'' (1999), both of which were shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. She went on to direct the 2005 [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[The Quiet]]'' and the 2007 comedy ''[[Itty Bitty Titty Committee]]''. Babbit and Sperling (as producer) secured financing from Michael Burns, then the vice president of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Insurance]] (now Vice Chairman of [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]) after showing him the script at Sundance.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; According to Babbit, their one-sentence [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] was "Two high-school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp."&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; Burns gave them an initial budget of [[US$]]500,000 which was increased to US$1 million when the film went into production.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;

=== Conception ===
Babbit, whose mother runs a halfway house called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and the 12-step program.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate /&gt; With girlfriend Andrea Sperling, she came up with the idea for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is "...&amp;nbsp;the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity."&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; Babbit wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the [[Butch and femme|femme]] perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, ''[[Go Fish (film)|Go Fish]]'' and ''[[The Watermelon Woman]]'').&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; She also wanted to satirize both the [[Christian right|religious right]] and the [[gay community]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;
Not feeling qualified to write the script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] [[Brian Wayne Peterson]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; He has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

=== Set and costume design ===
[[File:Cheerleader-pickets.jpg|thumb|alt=Three young women and three young men stand in a line, with an older woman and an older man. One young woman stands behind the rest, with her back to a bright pink van. The women wear vivid pink skirts and tops and the men wear vivid blue shorts and shirts. They hold placards, in bright blue and pink, which display statements including "Silly Faggots&amp;nbsp;— Dicks are for Chicks" and "Procreate". One young woman, without a placard, throws a rock in front of her.|The True Directions campers picket the ex-ex-gays. The intense colors were intended to show the artificiality of gender construction.]]
Babbit says that her influences for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, [[David LaChapelle]], ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and [[Barbie]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;
She wanted the production and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of [[Gender studies|gender construction]]).&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; According to Babbit, the [[Mysophobia|germaphobic]] character of Mary Brown represents [[AIDS]] paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] outfits.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink [[picket fence]] were filmed in [[Palmdale, California]].&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

=== Casting ===
Babbit recruited Clea DuVall, who had starred in her short film ''Sleeping Beauties'', to play the role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and [[Melanie Lynskey]].&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short ''Sleeping Beauties'' and was eager to work with the director.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; Babbit briefly considered [[Rosario Dawson]] as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], would not be right for the All-American character.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;

Babbit made a conscious effort to cast [[Person of color|people of color]] for minor roles, in an effort to combat what she describes as "racism at every level of making movies."&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph ([[Dante Basco]]) and Andre ([[Douglas Spain]]) to be [[African American]], [[Asian people|Asian]] and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered [[Arsenio Hall]] for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role.&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].&lt;ref name=Fine /&gt;

== Themes ==
[[File:Grahammeg.jpg|alt=Two young women face forwards, standing over a pink wooden cradle. Both are wearing pink outfits and the background is a pink room. The woman on the left has chin-length dark hair and holds in her right hand a plastic lifelike baby doll. With her left hand she pushes the other woman, who has long, light brown hair and also leans over the doll.|thumb|Graham and Megan attempt to reinforce their gender roles through performing traditional female tasks.]]
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' is not only about sexuality, but also gender and the [[social construction]] of [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; One of the ways in which Babbit highlighted what she called the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; Chris Holmlund in ''Contemporary American Independent Film'' notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes "gender-tuned."&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt; Ted Gideonse in ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

Gender roles are further reinforced by the tasks the campers have to perform in "Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity." Nikki Sullivan in ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'' says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than the natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; Sullivan says that the film not only highlights the ways in which gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes the norms and truths about [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society and renders them strange or "queer."&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; Holmlund says that Babbit makes the straight characters less normal and less likable than the gay ones.&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt; Sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' an exemplification of [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt;

== Rating and distribution ==
When originally submitted to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] rating board, ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' received an [[NC-17]] rating. In order to get a commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a [[Panning (camera)|camera pan]] up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan "ate Graham out" (slang for [[cunnilingus]]).&lt;ref name=Taubin /&gt; Babbit was interviewed by [[Kirby Dick]] for his 2006 documentary film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]''.&lt;ref name=DickFilm /&gt; A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; It compares this movie to ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though ''American Pie'' also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film.&lt;ref name=GayWired /&gt; The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.

The film [[premiere]]d on September 12, 1999 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was shown in January 2000 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It went on to play at several international film festivals including the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] festival and the [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]]. It first appeared in U.S. theaters on July 7, 2000, distributed by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; [[Fine Line Features]] had intended to distribute the film but dropped it two months before it was due to open following a dispute with the film's production company, [[Ignite Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Churi /&gt; It closed after 8 weeks, with its widest release having been 115 theaters.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt;

The film was released on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD by Lions Gate on July 22, 2002 and by [[Universal Studios]] on October 3, 2002.&lt;ref name=Movieweb /&gt; Other than the [[film trailer|theatrical trailer]], it contains no extras.&lt;ref name=DVDReview /&gt; It was released on Region 2 DVD on June 2, 2003 by [[Prism Leisure]]. In addition to the trailer, it features an interview with Jamie Babbit and behind the scenes footage.&lt;ref name=Amazon /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Box office and audience reaction ===
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' grossed [[United States dollar|$]]2,205,627 in the United States and $389,589 elsewhere, giving a total of $2,595,216 worldwide. In its opening weekend, showing at four theaters, it earned $60,410 which was 2.7% of its total gross.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; According to [[Box Office Mojo]], it ranked at 174 for all films released in the US in 2000 and 74 for R-rated films released that year.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; {{As of|December 2011}}, its all time box-office ranking for [[LGBT]]-related films is 73.&lt;ref name=MojoGay /&gt;

The film was a hit with festival audiences and received [[standing ovation]]s at the [[San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mandelb /&gt; It has been described as a favorite with gay audiences and on the [[art film|art house]] circuit.&lt;ref name=Tropiano /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benshoff /&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
Initial mainstream critical response to ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was mostly negative. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a score of 34% based on 47 reviews,&lt;ref name=Tomatoes /&gt; and [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 39% based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref name=MetaCritic /&gt; The overall theme of reviews is that it is a heartfelt film with good intentions, but that it is flawed.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berardinelli /&gt; Some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with "genuine laughs", however.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baumgarten /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it "is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit."&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Others found it obvious, leaden, and heavy handed.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Elvis Mitchell]] described the character of Megan as a sweet heroine and Lyonne and DuVall were praised for their performances.&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] called Lyonne wonderful and said that she was well matched by DuVall.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt; Marjorie Baumgarten said that they "hit the right notes."&lt;ref name=Baumgarten /&gt; Alexandra Mendenhall, writing for [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterEllen.com]] felt that the relationship between Graham and Megan, having great chemistry, does not get enough screen time.&lt;ref name=Mendenhall /&gt; Mitchell called their love scenes "tender."&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;
Other characters, particularly the males, were described as "offputting" and "nothing but stereotypes."&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt;

Several reviewers compared the film to those of director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] but felt that it fell short of the mark.&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt; Stephanie Zacharek called it a "Waters knockoff"&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt; while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Babbit says that although Waters is one of her influences, she did not want her film to have the "bite" of his.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film,&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and [[James Berardinelli]] called it a standout feature.&lt;ref name=Berardinelli /&gt;&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt; Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;

Stephanie Zacharek, writing for [[Salon.com]] said that with regard to issues of sexual orientation and homophobia, Babbit is preaching to the converted.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt; Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that "no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film" and that "the audience who might benefit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point."&lt;ref name=FuchsReview /&gt; [[David Edelstein]] said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda.&lt;ref name=Edelstein /&gt; In contrast, LaSalle said that "the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about the difficulties of growing up gay" and [[Timothy Shary]] said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shary /&gt; Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that [[queer]] identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan that there is no one way to be a lesbian.&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt;

Reviews from the [[List of LGBT periodicals|gay media]] were more positive, and the film has undergone a critical reassessment over time as it has been understood more to have been deliberately satirical and campy, drawing on John Waters' techniques. Feminist website Autostraddle declared the film to be #1 of 100 best lesbian movies of all time in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/100-best-lesbian-queer-bisexual-movies-285412/|title=The 100 Best Lesbian Movies Of All Time|date=August 11, 2015|work=Autostraddle|access-date=June 2, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AfterEllen.com (which covers the feminist "lesbian/bi pop culture beat"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/about|title=About – AfterEllen|work=AfterEllen|access-date=June 3, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has called it "one of the five best lesbian movies ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/454739-sapphic-cinema-im-cheerleader|title=Sapphic Cinema: "But I'm a Cheerleader" – AfterEllen|date=September 25, 2015|work=AfterEllen|access-date=June 3, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That site had originally called the movie's story predictable and the characters stereotypical in its initial 2007 review, with the reviewer saying the film was, overall, funny and enjoyable.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt;  ''[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]'' called the film an "incredible comedy" and said that Babbit has "redefined lesbian film" with this movie and her other work.&lt;ref name="Curve" /&gt; Praise was not universal, however. Jan Stuart, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', said that although the film tries to subvert gay stereotypes, it is unsuccessful. She called it "numbingly crude" and said that the [[kitsch]] portrait of [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]] is out of touch with today's gay teenagers.&lt;ref name=Stuart /&gt;

=== Awards ===
The film won the Audience Award and the Graine de Cinéphage Award at the 2000 [[Créteil International Women's Film Festival]], an annual French festival which showcases the work of female directors.&lt;ref name=SullivanM /&gt; Also that year it was nominated by the [[Political Film Society]] of America for the [[Political Film Society Awards|PFS award]] in the categories of [[Political Film Society Award for Human Rights|Human Rights]] and [[Political Film Society Award for Exposé|Exposé]], but lost out to ''[[Remember the Titans]]'' and ''[[Before Night Falls (film)|Before Night Falls]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name=PFS /&gt;

A '''chinface''', sometimes referred to as a '''chinikin''', '''chinhead''', '''chinman''', or '''chinmonster''' is a [[performance]], usually of a [[comedy|comical]] nature, involving someone's chin. By drawing or attaching eyes, it gives the impression of a distorted face when viewed upside down.

==Origins==
In the early 1950s ventriloquist [[Paul Winchell]] created a chin face character named Oswald [https://books.google.com/books?id=VVYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=oswald+paul+winchell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BUHA3YUivG&amp;sig=PK9jb1tsgkTITv_G3QZeipgfOzE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwDmoVChMItfOgue2XyAIVgS6ICh3E1Qo_#v=onepage&amp;q=oswald%20paul%20winchell&amp;f=false.]

In 1964, [[Bob Denver]] performed a chin face in the [[beach party film]], "[https://archive.is/20060327025828/http://www.bobdenver.com/Big_Screen_Bob/For_Those_Who_Think_Young/for_those_who_think_young.html For Those Who Think Young]".

In 1988, McEwans Lager launched a new TV ad campaign featuring 'The Chinheads', a fictional and quirky 'upside-down' rock/soul band. The award-winning TV advert was directed by [[Steve Barron]] (director of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Billie Jean]]", [[A-Ha]]'s "[[Take on Me]]", and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'') and featured the track "Something So Real" by Scottish band, [[The Love Decree]].

In 1989, a single was subsequently released and charted nationally, peaking at No.61 (No.1, Outselling [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]]'s "[[Ride On Time]]" in Scotland).
The Love Decree were: Robin Gow (Keyboards/Songwriter), Grant Macintosh (Vocals/Songwriter) and Gordon Gow (Percussion). The track 'Something So Real" was produced by Robin Gow.

The 'Chinheads' TV Ad can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wRBBzOqafE Here]

[[Ben Elton]]'s 1990 television show ''[[The Man from Auntie]]'' featured several chinface performances.

In 1993, an episode of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', "Gunmen of the Apocalypse", Lister used a chinface when the crew had to convince a ship of simulants (artificially created, [[cyborg]] humanoids) that there were no humans aboard, insisting instead that the ship was crewed by curry-based lifeforms known as "[[Vindaloo]]vians".

==Popular culture==
Since [[video hosting]] sites have become available on the [[internet]], chinface videos have become increasingly common.

In the mid&amp;ndash;1990s, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] [[Canada]] released TV ads for [[Kraft Dinner]] featuring various people performing chinfaces and eating the product.

The [[video game]] ''[[You Don't Know Jack (franchise)|You Don't Know Jack]]'' featured as an ending to Volume 4 ''(The Ride)'' footage showing part of the hosts' faces. The character Guy Towers is portrayed as a chin face, with oversized glasses.

Disc 4 of the ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' DVD Box Set features [[Chris Pontius]] performing a chinface of a "Latvian Gangster" during a running of the [[Gumball 3000]].

[[They Might Be Giants]]' first video, for their song "[[Put Your Hand Inside the Puppet Head]]," features one of them doing the chinface, with a xeroxed picture of his eyes placed on his chin.

In the video for [[Weird Al Yankovic]]'s style-parody of [[Devo]], his band is shown several times as chinfaces wearing Devo's yellow tyvek suits.

In the [[Monstrosity (film)|Atomic Brain]] episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] demonstrates to the 'bots a "chin face".  He says that the tradition is "fun...whimsical"; [[Crow T. Robot|Crow]] counters that it is "odd and disturbing".

In ''[[The Nanny]]'', Fran and Gracie enter a Mother-Daughter beauty pageant, for the talent competition both sang a song as chin faces.

In the popular French film ''[[Amélie]]'', the main character is shown in a scene performing chinface.

In ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'', one of Gumball's classmates, Sussie, is a chin face puppet, as are her parents.

In ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', [[Chris Pontius]] performs a chinface of a barbarian as part of the stunt "Pontius the barbarian"

In the YouTube channel The 298Universe, one of the main characters, Bob Cumberland, is a chinkin puppet. He is known as simply, Bob the Chinkin.

The '''classical education movement''' advocates a form of education based in the traditions of [[Western culture]], with a particular focus on education as understood and taught in [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].  The curriculum and pedagogy of classical education was first developed during the Middle Ages by [[Martianus Capella]] and systematized during the Renaissance by [[Petrus Ramus]]. Capella's original goal was to provide a systematic, memorable framework to teach all human knowledge.  The term "classical education" has been used in Western culture for several centuries, with each era modifying the definition and adding its own selection of topics.  By the end of the 18th century, in addition to the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] of the Middle Ages, the definition of a classical education embraced study of literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, history, art, and languages.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"&gt;{{citation

In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has been used to refer to a broad-based study of the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, as opposed to a practical or pre-professional program.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"/&gt;

There exist a number of informal groups and professional organizations which undertake the classical approach to classical education in earnest.  Within the secular classical movement, in the 1930s [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]] set forth the "Great Books" of Western civilization as center stage for a classical education curriculum.  Also some public schools (primarily charters) have structured their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom.  There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], and the CiRCE Institute.

The University of Pennsylvania seal (1894) depicted the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] as a stack of books providing the foundation for a 'modified' quadrivium of mathematics, natural philosophy (empirical science), astronomy, and theology.

==Three Phases of Modern Education Linked to Classical Education==
Classical education developed many of the terms now used to describe modern education.  Western classical education has three phases, each with a different purpose.  The phases are roughly coordinated with [[developmental psychology|human development]], and would ideally be exactly coordinated with each individual student's development.

* "Primary education" teaches students how to learn.
* "Secondary education" then teaches a conceptual framework that can hold all human knowledge (history), fills in basic facts and practices of major fields of knowledge, and develops the fundamental skills (perhaps in a simplified form) of every major human activity.
* "Tertiary education" then prepares a person to pursue an educated profession such as law, theology, military strategy, medicine, or science.

=== Primary education ===
In classical terms, primary education was the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' comprising grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

Logic and rhetoric were often taught in part by the [[Socratic method]], in which the teacher raises questions and the class discusses them.  By controlling the pace, the teacher can keep the class very lively, yet disciplined.

==== Grammar ====
Grammar consists of [[language]] skills such as reading and the mechanics of writing.  An important goal of grammar is to acquire as many words and manage as many concepts as possible so as to be able to express and understand clearly concepts of varying degrees of complexity.  Classical education traditionally included study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] to reinforce understanding the workings of languages and allow students to read the [[Classics]] of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]] untranslated.  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this period refers to the upper elementary school years.

==== Logic ====
[[Logic]] ([[dialectic]]) is the process of correct [[reasoning]].  The traditional text for teaching logic was [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotelian logic|Logic]].  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this logic stage (or dialectic stage) refers to the junior high or middle school aged student, who developmentally is beginning to question ideas and authority, and truly enjoys a debate or an argument.  Training in logic, both formal and informal, enables students to critically examine arguments and to analyze their own. The whole goal is to train the student's mind not only to grasp information, but to find the analytical connections between seemingly different facts/ideas, to find out why something is true, or why something else is false (in short, reasons for a fact).

==== Rhetoric ====
[[Rhetoric]]al debate and composition are taught to somewhat older (often high school aged) students, who by this point in their education have the concepts and logic to criticize their own work and persuade others.  According to [[Aristotle]] "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic", concerned with finding "all the available means of persuasion."  The student now learns to articulate answers to important questions in his/her own words, to try to persuade others with these facts, and to defend ideas against rebuttal.  The student learns to reason correctly in the Logic stage so that they can now apply those skills to Rhetoric.  Traditionally, students would read and emulate classical poets in learning how to present their arguments well.

=== Secondary education ===
Secondary education, classically the ''[[quadrivium]]'' or "four ways," consist of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]].  Arithmetic is Number in itself, which is a pure abstraction; that is, outside of space and time.  Geometry is Number in space. Music is Number in time, and Astronomy is Number in space and time.&lt;ref name=EncycAmerEd1 /&gt;  Sometimes [[architecture]] was taught alongside these, often from the works of [[Vitruvius]].

History was always taught to provide a context and show political and military development.  The classic texts were from ancient authors such as [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]].

Biographies were often assigned as well; the classic example being [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives''.  Biographies help show how persons behave in their context, and the wide ranges of professions and options that exist.  As more modern texts became available, these were often added to the curriculum.

In the [[Middle Ages]], these were the best available texts.  In modern terms, these fields might be called [[history]], natural [[science]], [[accounting]] and [[business]], [[fine art]]s (at least two, one to amuse companions, and another to decorate one's domicile), [[military strategy]] and [[military tactics|tactics]], [[engineering]], [[agronomy]], and [[architecture]].

These are taught in a matrix of history, reviewing the natural development of each field for each phase of the trivium.  That is, in a perfect classical education, the historical study is reviewed three times: first to learn the grammar (the concepts, terms and skills in the order developed), next time the logic (how these elements could be assembled), and finally the rhetoric, how to produce good, humanly useful and beautiful objects that satisfy the grammar and logic of the field.

History is the unifying conceptual framework, because history is the study of everything that has occurred before the present.  A skillful teacher also uses the historical context to show how each stage of development naturally poses questions and then how advances answer them, helping to understand human motives and activity in each field.  The question-answer approach is called the "dialectic method," and permits history to be taught Socratically as well.

Classical educators consider the [[Socrates|Socratic]] method to be the best technique for teaching critical thinking.  In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques.  This method is widely used to teach both [[philosophy]] and [[law]].  It is currently rare in other contexts.  Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion.  The learning is most effective when the students compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning.  That is, [[fallacy|fallacies]] should not be allowed by the teacher.

By completing a project in each major field of human effort, the student can develop a personal preference for further education and professional training.

=== Tertiary education ===
Tertiary education was usually an [[apprentice]]ship to a person with the desired profession.  Most often, the understudy was called a "secretary" and had the duty of carrying on all the normal business of the "master." [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]] were both widely taught as tertiary subjects in Universities, however.

The early biographies of nobles show probably the ultimate form of classical education: a tutor.  One early, much-emulated classic example is of this tutor system is of [[Alexander the Great]], who was tutored by [[Aristotle]].

== Modern interpretations of classical education ==
There exist a number of modern groups and professional organizations which take the classical approach to education seriously, and who undertake it in earnest.

===Classical Christian education===
{{main|Classical Christian education}}
There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], the [[Classic Learning Test]], and the CiRCE Institute. 

These schools tend to rely for upon one or more of the visions of classical education represented by [[Dorothy Sayers]] essay "The Lost Tools of Learning",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Sayers, Dorothy  |title=The Lost Tools of Learning |url=http://www.cambridgestudycenter.com/artilces/Sayers1.htm |date=presented at Oxford in 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer Adler's [[Paideia Proposal]], Alfred North Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education,'' or Susan Wise Bauer's ''[https://welltrainedmind.com/ The Well Trained Mind]''.

Most classical Christian schools employ the trivium as three stages of learning which are linked to child development:

* Grammar: The fundamental rules of each subject
* Logic: The ordered relationship of particulars in each subject 
* Rhetoric: How the grammar and logic of each subject may be clearly expressed 

Classical Christian schools vary in their approach to the sectarian integration of Christian thinking. Some schools ask parents to sign a statement of faith before attending, some do not require this of parents but are clear in their sectarian teaching, others are consciously ecumenical. In the 1970s, as a response to the campus riots and sexual revolution of the 1960s, many small classical Catholic colleges began to incorporate, e.g. the [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, [[New Hampshire]] (est. 1978), [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Sao Paulo, California, and [[Christendom College]] in Front Royal, Virginia. 

===Classical secular education===
There exist a number of classical schools in the public/secular sector.  These schools, primarily charter schools, also structure their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom without involving any particular religious perspectives.

Methods of classical education have also often been integrated into [[homeschooling]], particularly due to the publication of:
"The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home," by Jessie Wise and [[Susan Wise Bauer]] (W.W. Norton, 1999), is a modern reference on classical education, particularly in a homeschool setting. It provides a history of classical education, an overview of the methodology and philosophy of classical education, and annotated lists of books divided by grade and topic that list the best books for classical education in each category.

[[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], both of the [[University of Chicago]] set forth in the 1930s to restore the "Great Books" of Western civilization to center stage in the curriculum. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] is an example of this type of classical education at the college level.  Although the standard classical works&amp;mdash;such as the [[Harvard Classics]]&amp;mdash;most widely available at the time, were decried by many as out of touch with modern times, Adler and Hutchins sought to expand on the standard "classics" by including more modern works, and by trying to tie them together in the context of what they described as the "Great Ideas," condensed into a "Syntopicon" index and bundled together with a new "five foot shelf" of books as "The [[Great Books of the Western World]]." They were wildly popular during the 1950s, and discussion groups of aficionados were found all over the USA, but their popularity waned during the 1960s, and such groups are relatively hard to find today.  Extensions to the original set are still being published, encompassing selections from both current and older works which extend the "great ideas" into the present age and other fields, including civil rights, the global environment, and discussions of multiculturalism and assimilation.

==Classical Languages==
A more traditional, but less common view of classical education arises from the ideology of the Renaissance, advocating an education grounded in the languages and literatures of Greece and Rome. The demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts in their original form has been crowded out in most American schools in favor of more contemporary subjects.

The revival of "Classical Education" has resulted in Latin being taught at Classical Schools, but less often Greek.  It is worth noting that the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]] does require Latin for accreditation, and [[New Saint Andrews College]] requires both Latin and Greek to graduate with a 4-year degree.  A new group of schools, the [http://www.classicallatin.org Classical Latin School Association], does require Latin to be taught as a core subject.

Such an approach—an education in the [[classics]]—differs from the usual approach of the Classical education movement, but is akin to an education on "The Great Books" followed by [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]].

==Parallels in the East==
In India, the classical education system is based upon the study and understanding of the ancient texts the [[Vedas]], a discipline called [[Vedanga]], and subjects based upon that foundation, referred to as [[Upaveda]] and incorporating medicine ([[Ayurveda]]), music, [[archery]] and other [[martial arts]].

Similarly, in China, the fulcrum of a classical education was the study and understanding of a core canon, the [[Four Books and Five Classics]].

In Taiwan, Classical Chinese takes up 35% of Chinese education in junior high school (7-9th grade, compulsory), and 65% in senior high school (10-12th grade).

In it, he argues that the scope of the classical [[liberal education]] is inadequate for today's society, and that people should also be conversant with the basic facts of science and technology, since they now form a much more important part of our lives than did the tertiary studies of antiquity. He argues for a new synthesis of science, engineering, and the humanities in which there is a balance between what ''can'' be done and what ''ought'' to be done, between human desires and earthly consequences, and between our ever-increasing power to affect our surroundings and the ever-present danger of destroying the ecological and environmental systems which allow us to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3881">'''Computer science and engineering''' (CSE) is an academic program at some [[University|universities]] that integrates the fields of [[computer engineering]] and [[computer science]]. It is a sub-field of [[electronics engineering]], covering only the digital aspects of electronics engineering, specializing in hardware-systems areas like [[computer architecture]], [[processor design]], [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]], [[parallel computing|parallel processing]], [[computer networks]] and [[embedded systems]]. CSE programs also include core subjects of computer science such as [[operating systems]], [[theory of computation]], design and analysis of [[algorithm]]s, [[data structures]] and [[database|database systems]]. The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting [[computing|computing devices]] (such as [[personal computers]], [[supercomputers]], [[robots]], [[smartphones]], [[networking devices]], [[embedded devices]]), focusing the underlying fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design, [[memory management]], [[digital system]] design, [[communication protocol]] design, [[software development]] and [[database management]]) in the most efficient and effective way.

Computer science programs typically centers primarily around theory and software, with only some hardware&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/overview/|title=Overview of the Degree Programs - Computer Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; upper division courses tend to allow a lot of freedom to specialize in software and theory related areas (e.g. [[algorithms]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cryptography]]/security, [[computer graphics|graphics]]/[[scientific visualization|visualization]], [[numerical analysis|numerical]] and [[symbolic computation|symbolic computing]], [[operating systems]]/[[distributed processing]], [[software engineering]]).

Computer engineering programs tend to resemble computer science at the lower division with similar introductory programming and math courses, but diverges from computer science at the upper division with heavy electrical engineering requirements (e.g. [[digital electronics|digital]] and [[analogue electronics|analog]] circuits, [[integrated circuit design]], [[VLSI]] design and [[control systems]]. Despite the overlap with computer science at the lower division level, computer engineering skews much more heavily toward the electronics side that it has more in common with [[electrical engineering]].

Computer Science and Engineering integrates all of the above and is intended to develop a solid understanding of the entire machine ([[computer hardware]] and [[software]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/programs/ECS/ECSprog.html|title=UC Davis General Catalog - Computer Science and Engineering - The Program|website=catalog.ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher unit count required to complete the program often means that a CSE student will need to spend an extra year in university.

Although Computer Science and Engineering is the common designation for the combined program, some universities (such as [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[MIT]]) deviate by calling their program ''Electrical Engineering and Computer Science'' (EECS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/electrical-engineering-computer-sciences|title=Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences|date=11 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, there are some universities (such as [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] and [[UC Merced]]) that named their department EECS and the program housed within CSE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11269">'''Ecological forecasting''' uses knowledge of physics, ecology and physiology to predict how ecological [[Population|populations]], [[Community (ecology)|communities]], or [[ecosystem]]s will change in the future in response to environmental factors such as [[climate change]]. The ultimate goal of the approach is to provide people such as resource managers and designers of [[marine reserve]]s with information that they can then use to respond, in advance, to future changes,&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"&gt;Clark et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[adaptation to global warming]].

One of the most important environmental factors for organisms today is [[global warming]].  Most physiological processes are affected by [[temperature]], and so even small changes in [[weather]] and [[climate]] can lead to large changes in the growth, reproduction and survival of animals and plants.  The [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]]&lt;ref&gt;

is that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activity caused most of the warming observed since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial era]]. These changes are in turn affecting human and natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;CCSP 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One major challenge is to predict where, when and with what magnitude changes are likely to occur so that we can mitigate or at least prepare for them.&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"/&gt; Ecological forecasting applies existing knowledge of how animals and plants interact with their physical environment&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006"&gt;Kearney 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to ask how changes in  environmental factors might result in changes to the ecosystems as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wethey and Woodin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Ecological forecasting varies in spatial and temporal extent, as well as in what is being forecast (presence, abundance, diversity, production, etc.).

* Population models may be used to generate short-term abundance forecasts using knowledge of [[population dynamics]] and recent environmental conditions. These models are used especially in [[Population dynamics of fisheries|fisheries]] and [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|disease]] forecasting. 
* [[Environmental niche modelling|Species distribution models]] (SDMs) may be used to forecast [[species distribution]] (presence or abundance) over longer ecological time scales using information about past and projected environmental conditions across the landscape.
** Correlative SDMs, also known as climate envelope models, rely on statistical correlations between existing species distributions (range boundaries) and environmental variables to outline a range (envelope) of environmental conditions within which a species can exist.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;Pearson and Dawson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elith|first=Jane|last2=Leathwick|first2=John R.|date=2009|title=Species Distribution Models: Ecological Explanation and Prediction Across Space and Time|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=677–697|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt; New range boundaries can then be forecast using future levels of environmental factors such as [[temperature]], [[rainfall]], and [[salinity]] from climate model projections. These methods are good for examining large numbers of species, but are likely not a good means of predicting effects at fine scales.
** Mechanistic SDMs use information about a species' physiological tolerances and constraints, as well as models of organismal body temperature and other biophysical properties, to define the range of environmental conditions within which a species can exist. These tolerances are mapped onto current and projected environmental conditions in the landscape to outline current and forecasted ranges for the species.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to "climate envelope" approaches, mechanistic SDMs model the fundamental niche directly, and are therefore much more exact.&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006" /&gt;  However, the approach requires more information is also usually more time consuming.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;
*Other types of models may be used to forecast (or hindcast) biodiversity over evolutionary time scales. Palaeobiology modeling uses fossil and phylogenetic evidence of biodiversity in the past to project the trajectory of biodiversity in the future. Simple plots can be constructed and then adjusted based on the varying quality of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sahney, S.|author2=Benton, M.J.|author3=Ferry, P.A.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2010|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forecasting examples==

===Biodiversity===
Using fossil evidence, studies have shown that vertebrate biodiversity has grown exponentially through Earth's history and that biodiversity is entwined with the diversity of Earth's habitats. 
{{quote|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence biodiversity will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."|Sahney ''et al''.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;}}

'''Ethical issues of [[business communication]]''' is the process by which individuals exchange information between other individuals or groups of people. Throughout the process, effective communicators try as clearly and accurately to convey their thoughts, intentions and, objectives to their receiver. Communication is successful only when both the sender and the receiver understand the same information. In today's business environments, effective communication skills are necessary due to the highly informational and technological era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essentiallifeskills.net/goodcommunicationskills.html|title=Good Communication Skills - Key to Any Success|last=Hereford|first=Z|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of context, communication involves choice, reflects values, and has consequences. For better communication, understanding the obvious and the subtle issues relating to communication is necessary. Any company that aims to be socially and ethically responsible must make a priority of [[Communication ethics|ethical communication]] both inside the company and in its interactions with the public. In theory, many [[Consumer|consumers]] prefer to do business with [[Business|companies]] they believe are ethical which gives those ethical businesses an advantage in the market.

== Overview ==
Some of the vital characteristics of ethical communication are discussed below.

*'''Conveying the point without offending the audience''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/?term=communication|title=Online etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While communicating with the audience, expressing the desired message to them in a significant manner is of primary importance. For instance, the employees in a company can be asked to increase their efficiency in a demanding manner whereas managers and executives will feel offended if the same tone is used on them. There are different ways to explain the exact things to them in a much smoother manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Meenakshi Raman, Prakash|title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0-19-567695-5|edition=2. impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Maintain a relationship with the audience''':
Maintaining the same wavelength with the audience is very important for a communicator to ensure the audiences feel at home. Experienced communicators immediately build a relationship based on trust with the audience as soon as they start speaking. Great orators such as Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi always were able to maintain a relationship with their audience because they were masters at striking the same wavelength of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogin|first=Mary Ellen Guffey, Kathleen Rhodes, Patricia|title=Business communication : process and product|year=2009|publisher=Nelson Education|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-17-650046-7|edition=3rd brief Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Avoid withholding crucial information''':

In the modern era, information is vital for all decisions. Hence, it is essential for any organization to be cautious when communicating with tvitalic. The related information should be absolute, and all crucial information must be conveyed appropriately. Purposely withholding crucial information might result in the public conceiving a bad image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=A. C. "Buddy" Krizan |title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Thomson South-Western|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0-324-37485-2|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Well organized value system''':
In order to ensure that this concept is successfully practiced and understood in an organization, a well-organized value system must be established throughout the organization by the top management. If an organization functions on the base of value systems common to both the top management and the employees, mutual respect between them will be present. A sound and healthy value system can make way for ethical communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jethwaney|first=Jaishri|title=Corporate communication : principles and practice.|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-806365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Accuracy of information is necessary''':

Any information that is to be passed on must be true and accurate. Communicating without checking the truth of the information can be highly dangerous for the organization. Identification of the source and testing the information is necessary before communicating it.

== Summary ==
The work of an organizational communication professional consists in developing communication plans that seek to restore trust, not only in the organization but the leaders and in all the people who work for it, in verbally promoting ethical behaviors and generating spaces of communication that help support institutional values.

In this way, both managers and employees will be "on the same page," employees will feel heard and respected and will treat customers in the same way. Also, this will generate more loyalty on the part of the client and, therefore, more business. In addition, a business that communicates internally with ethics will most likely project that image in the business community, will seek to maintain good relations with the government and its most successful businesses.  Without the distractions and negative effects that can have the legal implications of running a business " ethically debatable," the organization will be able to concentrate its efforts on its employees, its products, and its clients.

'''Extension transference''' is the symbolic sub-division of a particular goal or purpose so that the sub-divided concepts seem fragmented from the original purpose.

''"…when applied to language and experience, becomes a useful theoretical concept. Thus, spoken language is a symbolization of something that happened, is happening or will happen. Written language as an extension of the spoken form is therefore a symbolization of symbolization! This intellectual manoeuvre Hall terms extension transference. The extension can become confused with or take the place of the process described."'' (Lago, p68).

''"Extension transference is a phenomenon that occurs when we create systems to help us do things more efficiently and effectively and in ways that we can measure and control. Often these are processes that we once did quite naturally on our own."'' (Hanson, p.&amp;nbsp;43).

The term was coined by the American anthropologist [[Edward T. Hall]] in his book ''[[Beyond Culture]]'' (1976).

'''Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model''' ('''GFDL CM2.5''') is a coupled atmosphere–ocean [[general circulation model]] (AOGCM) developed at the [[NOAA]] [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] in the United States. It is one of the leading climate models used in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], along with models developed at the Max Planck Institute for Climate Research, the [[Hadley Centre]] and the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]].

==Composition==

'''Atmosphere'''

The atmospheric component of the CM2.X models employs a 24-level atmosphere with horizontal resolution of 2° in east–west and 2.5° in north–south directions. This resolution is sufficient to resolve the large mid-latitude cyclones responsible for weather variability. It is too coarse, however, to resolve processes such as hurricanes or intense thunderstorm outbreaks. The atmosphere includes a representation of radiative fluxes, mixing in the atmospheric boundary layer, representations of the impacts of [[Stratus cloud|stratus]] and [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] clouds, a scheme for representing drag on upper level winds caused by [[gravity wave]]s, changes in the spatial distribution of ozone and the ability to represent the impact of multiple greenhouse gases.

'''Ocean'''

The ocean component is a 50-level ocean, run at a resolution of 1° in the east–west direction and varying in the north-south direction from 1 degree in the polar regions to 1/3 of a degree along the equator. This resolution is sufficient to resolve the equatorial current system, but is too coarse to capture the highly energetic mesoscale eddies- whose [[Advection|advective]] and diffusive effects are parameterized. Other key parameterizations include a free surface height that changes in response to evaporation, precipitation, and convergence of ocean currents, absorption of sunlight tied to observed chlorophyll concentrations, a representation of the oceanic [[mixed layer]], inclusion of turbulence generated by tidal mixing on shelves and schemes allowing water from marginal seas such as the Red and Baltic Seas to "mix" across narrow straits at their mouths.

==Simulation description==

Two sets of models were run for the IPCC, consisting of very similar ocean circulations but different methodology for solving the equations of motion. The result is that the models have very different wind stresses over the [[Southern Ocean]], with the CM2.0 exhibiting the common bias of winds that are shifted equatorward but the CM2.1 model being one of the few that have winds close to the correct latitude and magnitude in this region (Russell et al., 2006). Work by Reichler and Kim at the University of Utah suggests that this model series is one of the top models in a range of atmospheric characteristics. It also has one of the better simulations of [[El Nino]] among the IPCC models (van Oldenburgh et al., 2005; Wittenberg et al., 2006). However, as is the case with most AOGCMs run without flux adjustment, the models fail to capture the cold upwelling zones along the eastern boundaries of the Pacific and Atlantic, and tend to produce an overly dry Amazon basin.

==Further development==

A '''hand boiler''' or (less commonly) '''love meter''' is a [[glass sculpture]] used as an [[experimental]] tool to demonstrate [[vapour-liquid equilibrium]], or as a [[collector's item]] to whimsically "measure love." It consists of a lower [[bulb]] containing a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid and a mixture of gases that is connected usually by a twisting [[glass tube]] that connects to an upper or "receiving" glass bulb.
[[File:Pen Finger Boiler.jpg|thumb|Hand boiler toy, built into a ballpoint pen. The warmth from the fingertips vaporizes some of the red liquid inside the tube, causing it to rise and bubble up into the top chamber as if the liquid was boiling.  ]]
==Mechanics==
A hand boiler functions similar to the "[[drinking bird]]" toy:&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  {{cite journal|last1=Ucke|first1=Christian|last2=Schlichting|first2=Hans-Joachim|title=Der Kaffeekugelschreiber oder das Liebesthermometer|journal=Physik in unserer Zeit|date=1995|volume=26|issue=4|pages=192–193|trans-title=The coffee-percolator pen or the love thermometer|language=German}}  Available at: [http://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/fachbereich_physik/didaktik_physik/publikationen/kaffeekugelschreiber_liebesthermometer.pdf University of Münster (Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany)]

Since the lower bulb is warmer, the vapor pressure in it is higher.  The difference in vapor pressure forces the liquid from the lower bulb to the upper bulb.  Thus:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta h = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho g}&lt;/math&gt;

where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt; = the height of the column of fluid above the fluid's level in the lower bulb&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; = the difference in vapor pressure between the two bulbs (which can be determined via the [[Antoine equation]])&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = the density of the liquid&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; = the acceleration of gravity at the Earth's surface

The liquid inside a hand boiler does not actually boil. The "boiling" is caused by the relationship between the [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] of a gas. As the temperature of a gas in a closed container rises, the pressure also rises. There must be a temperature (and pressure) difference between the two large chambers for the liquid to move. When held upright (with the smaller bulb on top), the liquid will move from the bulb with the higher pressure to the bulb with lower pressure. As the gas continues to expand, the gas will then bubble through the liquid, making it appear to boil. The fact that the liquid is volatile (easily vaporized) makes the hand boiler more effective. Adding heat to the liquid produces more gas, also increasing pressure in the closed container.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/hand-boiler.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a hand boiler is used to show properties of [[distillation]]. Since the liquid both [[evaporates]] and [[condenses]] at relatively cool temperatures while in an enclosed system, the boiler can be turned upside down, and the top end can be placed in ice water. The gaseous form of the liquid will condense in the cooled chamber. Since the liquid is often colored with dye, but the dye does not evaporate or condense at the same temperature, the liquid that condenses in the cooled chamber is colorless, leaving the [[pigment]] behind.

==Popular culture==
In popular culture, hand boilers used to be sometimes known as "love meters" because the tube that separates the upper and lower bulbs is twisted into a heart shape and the volatile liquid is colored red. Love meters were a common collector's item or a souvenir. Depending on how the item was packaged, one would grasp the lower bulb to "prove" how passionate one was, or a couple would each grasp one end to see who would force the liquid into the other's bulb.

Hand boilers are much more commonly used as a scientific novelty today.

== History ==

Hand boilers date back at least as early as 1767, when the American polymath [[Benjamin Franklin]] encountered them in Germany.  He developed an improved version in 1768,&lt;ref&gt;See:

'''High-altitude adaptation in humans''' is an instance of [[evolutionary adaptation|evolutionary modification]] in certain human populations, including those of [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] in Asia, the [[Andes]] of the Americas, and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high [[altitudes]]. This adaptation means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|long-term physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]].

While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen [[respiratory system|respiration]] and blood [[circulatory system|circulation]], when compared to the general lowland population.&lt;ref name=fris&gt;{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC&amp;pg|pages=175–301 |isbn =0472095110|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hillary Mayell |title=Three High-Altitude Peoples, Three Adaptations to Thin Air|date=24 February 2004 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2004/02/0224_040225_evolution.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andeans===

In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate.&lt;ref name=beall07 /&gt; This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the [[fecundity|giving birth]] or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vitzthum |first1=Virginia J. |title=Fifty fertile years: anthropologists' studies of reproduction in high altitude natives |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179–189 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22357 |pmid=23382088}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in [[alveolus|alveolar]] area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in [[red blood cells]]. Though the physical growth in body size is [[stunted growth|delayed]], growth in lung volumes is accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisancho|first1=A.

==Genetic basis==

The underlying [[molecular evolution]] of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently.&lt;ref name=mue /&gt; Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which
have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of [[recent human evolution]]. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.&lt;ref name=bea00 /&gt;

=== Tibetans ===

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and [[oxygen saturation|blood-oxygen]] levels are adaptive as [[Fitness (biology)|Darwinian fitness]]. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two [[allele]]s for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beall CM, Song K, Elston RC, Goldstein MC |year=2004 |title=Higher offspring survival among Tibetan women with high oxygen saturation genotypes residing at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/39/14300 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101|issue=39 |pages=14300–14304 |pmid=15353580|pmc=521103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405949101|last2=Song |last3=Elston |last4=Goldstein |bibcode=2004PNAS..10114300B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 [[Han Chinese]] from [[Beijing]]. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (''[[EPAS1]]''). It was found that one [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) at ''EPAS1'' shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of [[phenotype|phenotypically observable]] evolution in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Native Village Youth |author2=Education news |title=Tibetans evolved at fastest pace ever measured |url=http://www.nativevillage.org/Archives/2011%20Archives/MAY%202011%20News/Tibetans%20Evolved%20at%20Fastest%20Pace%20Ever%20Measured.htm | date=May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population.&lt;ref name=yi /&gt; [[Mutations]] in ''EPAS1'', at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (''[[EGLN1]]'') (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (''[[PPARA]]''), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonson TS, Yang Y, Huff CD, Yun H, Qin G, Witherspoon DJ, Bai Z, Lorenzo FR, Xing J, Jorde LB, Prchal JT, Ge R |year=2010 |title=Genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/72 |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5987|pages=72–75 |pmid=20466884 |doi=10.1126/science.1189406|last2=Yang |last3=Huff |last4=Yun |last5=Qin |last6=Witherspoon |last7=Bai |last8=Lorenzo |last9=Xing |last10=Jorde |last11=Prchal |last12=Ge |bibcode=2010Sci...329...72S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Sherpas]], known for their Himalayan hardiness, exhibit similar patterns in the ''EPAS1'' gene, which further fortifies that the gene is under [[Selection (biology)|selection]] for adaptation to the high-altitude life of Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanaoka M, Droma Y, Basnyat B, Ito M, Kobayashi N, Katsuyama Y, Kubo K, Ota M |year=2012 |title=Genetic variants in EPAS1 contribute to adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Sherpas | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050566 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12|pages=e50566|pmid=23227185 |pmc=3515610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050566|last2=Droma |last3=Basnyat |last4=Ito |last5=Kobayashi |last6=Katsuyama |last7=Kubo |last8=Ota |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750566H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 indicates that the mutant ''[[EPAS1]]'' gene could have been inherited from archaic [[hominin]]s, the [[Denisovans]].&lt;ref name="Huerta-Sanchez et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huerta-Sánchez|first1=Emilia |last2=Jin |first2=Xin |last3=Asan |last4=Bianba |first4=Zhuoma|last5=Peter|first5=Benjamin M. |last6=Vinckenbosch|first6=Nicolas|last7=Liang|first7=Yu|last8=Yi|first8=Xin|last9=He|first9=Mingze|last10=Somel|first10=Mehmet|last11=Ni|first11=Peixiang|last12=Wang|first12=Bo|last13=Ou|first13=Xiaohua|last14=Huasang|last15=Luosang|first15=Jiangbai|last16=Cuo|first16=Zha Xi Ping |last17=Li |first17=Kui |last18=Gao |first18=Guoyi |last19=Yin |first19=Ye |last20=Wang|first20=Wei |last21=Zhang |first21=Xiuqing |last22=Xu |first22=Xun|last23=Yang |first23=Huanming |last24=Li |first24=Yingrui |last25=Wang |first25=Jian |last26=Wang |first26=Jun |last27=Nielsen |first27=Rasmus |title=Altitude adaptation in Tibetans caused by introgression of Denisovan-like DNA |journal=Nature |date=2014 |volume=512 |issue=7513 |pages=194–197 |doi=10.1038/nature13408 |pmid=25043035 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..194H |display-authors=8 |pmc=4134395}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EPAS1'' and ''EGLN1'' are definitely the major genes for unique adaptive traits when compared with those of the Chinese and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peng Y, Yang Z, Zhang H, Cui C, Qi X, Luo X, Tao X, Wu T, Ouzhuluobu, Basang, Ciwangsangbu, Danzengduojie, Chen H, Shi H, Su B|year=2011 |title=Genetic variations in Tibetan populations and high-altitude adaptation at the Himalayas | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/2/1075.full |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28|issue=2|pages=1075–81|pmid=21030426 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq290|last2=Yang |last3=Zhang |last4=Cui |last5=Qi |last6=Luo |last7=Tao |last8=Wu |last13=Chen |last14=Shi |last15=Su }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genome analysis in 2014 revealed that the Tibetans inherited an equal mixture of genomes from the Nepalese-Sherpas and Hans, and they acquired the adaptive genes from the sherpa-lineage.

The genes (''EPAS1'', ''EGLN1'', and ''PPARA'') function in concert with another gene named [[hypoxia inducible factors]] (''HIF''), which in turn is a principal regulator of red blood cell production ([[erythropoiesis]]) in response to oxygen metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacInnis MJ, Rupert JL |year=2011 |title='ome on the Range: altitude adaptation, positive selection, and Himalayan genomics | journal=High Alt Med Biol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=133–139|pmid=21718161 |doi=10.1089/ham.2010.1090|last2=Rupert }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Patot MC, Gassmann M |year=2011 |title=Hypoxia: adapting to high altitude by mutating EPAS-1, the gene encoding HIF-2α | journal=High Alt Med Biol |volume=12|issue=2|pages=157–167|pmid=21718164 |doi=10.1089/ham.2010.1099|last2=Gassmann }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonson TS, McClain DA, Jorde LB, Prchal JT |year=2012 |title=Genetic determinants of Tibetan high-altitude adaptation | journal=Human Genetics |volume=131|issue=4|pages=527–533|pmid=22068265 |doi=10.1007/s00439-011-1109-3|last2=McClain |last3=Jorde |last4=Prchal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes  are associated not only with decreased haemoglobin levels, but also in regulating energy metabolism.

===Andeans===

The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, ''EGLN1'' appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations.&lt;ref name=bigh /&gt; Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between ''EPAS1'' or ''EGLN1'' SNP [[genotype]]s and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bigham AW, Wilson MJ, Julian CG, Kiyamu M, Vargas E, Leon-Velarde F, Rivera-Chira M, Rodriquez C, Browne VA, Parra E, Brutsaert TD, Moore LG, Shriver MD |year=2013 |title=Andean and Tibetan patterns of adaptation to high altitude | journal=Am J Hum Biol|volume=25|issue=2|pages=190–197|pmid=23348729 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22358|last2=Wilson |last3=Julian |last4=Kiyamu |last5=Vargas |last6=Leon-Velarde |last7=Rivera-Chira |last8=Rodriquez |last9=Browne |last10=Parra |last11=Brutsaert |last12=Moore |last13=Shriver }}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou D, Udpa N, Ronen R, Stobdan T, Liang J, Appenzeller O, Zhao HW, Yin Y, Du Y, Guo L, Cao R, Wang Y, Jin X, Huang C, Jia W, Cao D, Guo G, Gamboa JL, Villafuerte F, Callacondo D, Xue J, Liu S, Frazer KA, Li Y, Bafna V, Haddad GG |title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=93|issue=S0002–9297(13)00331–5 | pages=452–62|year=2013 |pmid=23954164 |pmc=3769925 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|last2=Udpa |last3=Ronen |last4=Stobdan |last5=Liang |last6=Appenzeller |last7=Zhao |last8=Yin |last9=Du |last10=Guo |last11=Cao |last12=Wang |last13=Jin |last14=Huang |last15=Jia |last16=Cao |last17=Guo |last18=Gamboa |last19=Villafuerte |last20=Callacondo |last21=Xue |last22=Liu |last23=Frazer |last24=Li |last25=Bafna |last26=Haddad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopians===

The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the [[amhara people|Amhara]] have inhabited altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2400|m|ft}} for more than 70,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Human technical behavior in the African Middle Stone Age: The lithic assemblange of Porc-Epic Cave (Dire Dawa, Ethiopia)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10437-006-9000-7|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=177–197|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9000-7|pmid=|author=Pleurdeau D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and [[oromo people|Oromo]], revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same [[locus (genetics)|gene location]] do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alkorta-Aranburu G, Beall CM, Witonsky DB, Gebremedhin A, Pritchard JK, Di Rienzo A|year=2012 |title=The genetic architecture of adaptations to high altitude in Ethiopia | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003110|pmid=23236293| pmc=3516565 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110|last2=Beall |last3=Witonsky |last4=Gebremedhin |last5=Pritchard |last6=Di Rienzo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including ''[[CBARA1]]'', ''[[VAV3]]'', ''[[ARNT2]]'' and ''[[THRB]]''. Two of these genes (''THRB'' and ''ARNT2'') are known to play a role in the [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF-1 pathway]], a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies. This supports the concept that adaptation to high altitude arose independently among different highlanders as a result of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scheinfeldt LB, Soi S, Thompson S, Ranciaro A, Woldemeskel D, Beggs W, Lambert C, Jarvis JP, Abate D, Belay G, Tishkoff SA|year=2012 |title=Genetic adaptation to high altitude in the Ethiopian highlands | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=Genome Biol |volume=13|issue=1|pages=R1 |pmid=22264333| pmc=3334582 |doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-1-r1|last2=Soi |last3=Thompson |last4=Ranciaro |last5=Woldemeskel |last6=Beggs |last7=Lambert |last8=Jarvis |last9=Abate |last10=Belay |last11=Tishkoff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20528">{{about|the approach developed by Roy Harris|the approach based on Hans-Heinrich Lieb's work|Integrational linguistics}}
'''Integrationism''' (also known as '''integrational linguistics''') is an approach in the [[theory of communication]] that emphasizes innovative participation by communicators within contexts and rejects rule-based models of language. It was developed by a group of [[linguists]] at the [[University of Oxford]] during the 1980s, notably [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]].

The International Association for the Integrational Study of Language and Communication was founded in 1998 and has members in more than twenty-five countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integrationists.com IAISLC].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrationism and language==
While the integrationist views of [[Roy Harris|Harris]] and Dr Adrian Pablé, among others, differ from those who believe that cognition is [[Distributed cognition|distributed]] (i.e.  Kravchenko and Love), the view on language between the two fields are quite similar.  Both sides criticize the traditional view of linguistics which holds language as an individual internal psychological concern that takes written language as the base from which to begin analysis. Instead, integrationists view knowledge (which includes language) as “(i) linked to an individual’s experience, and therefore dependent on the ‘evidence available’ to that particular individual, but at the same time (ii) unpredictable because any integrational task involving sign-making and sign-interpreting is carried out in actual, time-embedded situations, which are not simply ‘given’, either.”.&lt;ref name=pable2010&gt;Pablé, 2010.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, language usage is intrinsically, and without fail, contextual in all of its uses.  Furthermore, Pablé, Haas &amp; Christe&lt;ref name=phc2010&gt;Pablé, Haas &amp; Christe, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; question whether language is even amenable to scientific description, based upon its contextual nature.
The contextual nature of language leads to a rejection of the notion that language is a ‘fixed code’.  Harris discusses this extensively:

:"When we come across words we do not know, words which apparently did not exist a few years ago, it is difficult to resist two conclusions. One is that if there are verbal ‘codes’, they cannot be fixed: on the contrary, they must be changing all the time. The other conclusion is that if there are such codes, different people use different ones, and these too change. Until yesterday, mine did not include the word moshpit: today it does. But if the code has the kind of instability evidenced by the sudden emergence of new words and meanings, what guarantee of stability is there for ‘old’ words and meanings? The integrationist sees none. And if indeed there is none, then it is the viability of the concept of the code that is itself called in question. For it conspicuously fails to fulfill the theoretical function that is required of a code in semantics; namely to provide a source for those publicly invariant meanings that supposedly underpin verbal communication in the community, and can consequently be both ‘encoded’ and ‘decoded’ by those who know the code.”&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of parts of a fixed code, language is looked at as a resource to conduct action with, an idea that echoes the notions put forth by [[Speech act theory|speech act]] theorists such as [[J.L. Austin|Austin]] and [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Interactional sociolinguistics|interactional sociolinguists]] such as [[John J. Gumperz|Gumperz]], [[Conversation Analysis|conversation analysts]] such as [[Harvey Sacks|Sacks]], [[Schegloff]], and Goodwin, as well as others such as [[Goffman]], all of whom were or are active in fields outside of linguistics, including language philosophy, sociology, and anthropology. Harris claims that to not know what a word means is to not know what to do with the words, to not know “how to integrate the occurrence of the word into enough of our linguistic experience to satisfy the requirement of the [present] case”.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1998 (cited by Pablé, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
Pablé explores the integrationist views of language in terms of the naming practices related to castles in [[Bellinzona, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=pable2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=pable2009&gt;Pablé, 2009.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By asking locals the directions to castles using non-standard names for the castles, Pablé elicited various forms by which the locals referred to them, highlighting the idea that references to the places were “highly context sensitive” and that the “meaning” is created on the spot,&lt;ref name=pable2009/&gt; and that “speakers always make sense of language in light of their own experience”.&lt;ref name=pable2010/&gt;

According to integrationist principles, the separation of linguistic phenomena into distinct parts of study is a fundamental error in the conceptualization of language. In 'The Language Myth', Harris postulates that the isolation and subsequent segregational approach of orthodox linguistics is a result of the fact of language itself being the descriptive medium for its own study. A problem arises when we consider words as stand-ins for things. When we then have a word for a language, the word misleads us to consider languages to be things out there in the world rather than real time, second order processes undergoing constant adjustment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Epistemological overlaps==
Integrationism overlaps with recent and not so recent epistemologies concerning communication and interaction. It retains an interest in understanding the system of language-making as an emergent, context-bound, and fundamentally human activity. This view is philosophically consistent with sociocultural theories such as activity theory where the historicity of human experience is recognized to have implications on our activities in ways that shape how they unfold.&lt;ref&gt;Cole &amp; Hatano, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrationist linguistics overlaps with pragmatic and phenomenological approaches such as ethnomethodology and conversation analysis. The latter being rightly susceptible to a written and spoken word bias yet this is not without current attempts to broaden and include a wider range of semiotic contingencies into analyses. The more fundamental overlap is epistemological. Harold Garfinkel's (1994) ethnomethodological policies prioritize the context of interaction with strict objection to analytic presupposed systems of any kind other than that which is made so by the sequentially ordered interactions of participants. Conversation analysts have developed an empirical approach stemming from those policies where spoken and written words are centralized. A recent decentralizing move to the analysis and theorization of multimodal sequential analysis is very much consistent with an integrationist point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Streeck, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrationism and identity==
While integrationism has been in existence for over three decades, advocating against the “language myth”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Harris, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and indicating that linguistic sign alone cannot function as the basis of an independent, self-sufficient form of communication, but depends for effectiveness on its integration with non-verbal activities of many different kinds, some integrationists have recently directed this perspective to revisit another important concept in sociolinguistics – “social identity”.

This integrational view of identity concurs with the sociocultural perspective that identity is not a rigid and static system predetermined on the basis of either social class, gender, ethnicity, age or education, but rather a discursive and constantly emerging experience that is locally shared and situationally evoked. On the other hand, however, stressing that identity cannot be examined exclusively from an individual’s integrational practice (including both linguistic and non-linguistic practice), integrationists cast doubt on the way sociocultural approach analyzes identity by specifically questioning three of the latter’s tenets: (i) data, (ii) phenomenological inductivism,&lt;ref&gt;Allan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) indirect indexicality.&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; They point out an intrinsic controversy that while identity, as the speaker’s first-order experience, is highly context-dependent, the attempt to detect identity merely through inspecting the linguistic components in the tape-recorded data and interpret the data through postulating the existence of linguistically pre-labeled “concrete universals” (e.g. ‘varieties of language’, ‘style’) is actually de-contextualizing the speakers’ identity. Also, they identified another conflict in the sociocultural approach of interpreting a speaker’s identity between the claim of a socially indexical value of linguistic features (“social marker”) that is beyond a single occurrence and the one of locally indexical value of linguistic features that is analyzable only in term of one specific local context.

Compared with sociolinguistic perspective on social identity, integrationists emphasize the integrational phenomenon that occurs when we converse with each other. Sociolinguists concentrate on how people utilize linguistic structures and items, cultural norms, and macro identities that they are normatively assigned in conversation. Based on utterances, sociolinguists attempt to capture speakers’ positionality and relationality in terms of identity, emergence of identity, and indexicality of the language that speakers used.&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz &amp; Hall, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is problematic to integrationists that sociolinguists only focus upon what is said. In other words, sociolinguists take language as an independent structure that can be isolated from the ongoing conversation. Integrationists argue that utterances cannot be dissociated from the context where he utters statements. Utterances have to be integrated with the activities, linguistic and non-linguistic, at that moment.

In conclusion, from an integrational view, “social identity” is rather a “meta-discursive label used by lay speakers to cope with their everyday first-order experience”&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; than a term or object of scientific study that is static and communicationally predetermined. In other words, along with their refusal of language as a static code system to be decoded for meaning transmission, they specifically emphasize that identity is not amenable to scientific description, as “sign-making and sign-interpreting are ‘private’ and cannot be detached from an individual’s integrational activities in the here-and-now”.&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; The remaining question for integrationists is how to study ‘identity’ then. One suggestion integrationalists may be more up to is to treat what is displayed in the temporal situations as “beings” and “becomings” rather than fixed identities, and study it multimodally, which is to take different modalities and time scales into consideration, instead of merely relying on the pre-labelled linguistic features.

==The implications of first-order and second-order language on reading comprehension==
According to the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104016/http://www.unescobkk.org/resources/online-materials/aims/uis-aims-activities/uis-aims-and-literacy-assessment/ What is Literacy?] (archive), UNESCO Office in Bangkok: UIS-AIMS and Literacy Assessment&lt;/ref&gt; literacy is defined as the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. In other words, the ability to read and write does not only to fulfill one’s own need but also to communicate with the community and society where one stays. With regard to it, this section first focuses on the distinction between spoken language (first-order language) and written language (second-order language)&lt;ref name=krav&gt;Kravchenko, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and how reading comprehension is achieved, and then aims at the impact of technology-enhanced interaction on reading comprehension.

Traditionally, spoken language and written language are regarded as the two sides of the same coin&lt;ref name=krav/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, written language is believed to fully represent its corresponding spoken language. Therefore, educators believe by teaching words, or the symbolization of phonetic signs, students are equipped with the literacy to understand the written texts. However, it is often the case that students have a hard time understanding and interpreting a poem even though they know every single word. The glittering example reveals the problem of treating spoken language and written language as the same and implies the need to treat them differently.

According to Kravchenko, spoken language and written language are different in that spoken language is temporal and local, while written language is atemporal and non-local.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; The understanding of spoken language relies on the common knowledge shared by the participants who are involved in the conversation, and the cognition required is situated and highly interactional. As for written language, the understanding takes place when the text is written (product) rather than is being written (process). Therefore, it is less interactional. Despite the difference, the understanding of both linguistic systems calls for the appropriate background knowledge. An example adapted from Kravchenko is that if a traveler wants to check in and the clerk tells him/her, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, the traveler may check the watch and calculate when to come back for the check-in, so he/she does not have to stand at the front desk for 20 minutes. However, if the traveler sees a note on the front desk saying, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, he/she may be baffled due to no point of reference, so he/she does not know how long is needed.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; This example shows that it takes more efforts to establish background knowledge for the understanding of written language than spoken language. By extension, successful reading comprehension depends upon the establishment of shared knowledge between writers and readers.

With the development of technologies, written language includes not only printed work but also hypertexts. Because of the new genres of written language, new literacy is needed. Kravchenko maintained that literacy is the knowledge of using knowledge, so students have to develop the ability of reasoning and judgment based on the written texts.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; Jenkins et al. go further by claiming that the form of reasoning plays a more important role than the content of learning in the era of technology-enhanced interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins et al., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; To put it another way, the content can be easily stored and retrieved by means of technologies, so the practice of reasoning centers on how to generate, evaluate, interpret, and deploy the electronic resources. Different electronic resources can provide different affordances, so one of the aims of teaching new literacy is to help students develop the ability of knowing what functions that the certain electronic resource is good at. For instance, the text mediation through computers can facilitate the thinking, reflecting, and revising of one’s own thought.&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wertsh &amp; Biven, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Videos, with the visual and auditory modality, can better help knowledge acquisition than pictures, which have the visual modality alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypertexts available online enable readers to create their own reading paths and recontextualize the resources of websites.&lt;ref name=bt2010&gt;Baldry and Thibault, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the recontextualization, the thematic regions and semiotic formations are more idiosyncratic than fixed. The readers play a role in picking up the meaning through the created reading paths. According to Harris, linguistic signs should be understood with non-verbal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reading the hypertexts, the readers have access to other non-textual resources online, such as pictures, diagrams, videos, etc. The use of those non-verbal semiotic resources within the texts has its function and offers affordances to the readers to make meaning.&lt;ref name=bt2010/&gt;

The '''Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony''' (also called "'''Bookville'''" by former residents) was an encampment of banished, registered [[sex offender]]s who were living beneath the [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]]—a highway in [[Miami, Florida]], United States—from 2006 to April 2010. The colony was created by a lobbyist named [[Ron Book]], who wrote ordinances in several different [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] cities to restrict convicted sex offenders from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools, parks, bus stops, or homeless shelters. Since Book was also head of the Miami Homeless Trust, he was also in charge of finding housing for the released sexual offenders. Under these ordinances, the only areas where sex offenders could legally reside within Miami-Dade County were the [[Miami International Airport|Miami Airport]] and the [[Florida Everglades]]. Miami-Dade laws are significantly stricter than State of Florida laws on residency restrictions for sex offenders.  Florida State Law required that no sex offender could live within {{convert|2000|ft|m}} from "where children gather". Under that requirement, housing was possible; however, because of Book's lobbying, the Dade County Commission increased that number to {{convert|2500|ft|m}}, thereby banishing hundreds of local citizens who then began gathering under the Julia Tuttle Causeway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2009-04-16/news/julia-tuttle-bridge-sex-offenders-might-get-a-new-home/ Miami sex offenders form outcast colony], UPI (May 3, 2009).

==Colony setup==
Before the colony was established, the [[Florida|State of Florida]] provided sex offenders a list of locations where they could live that did not violate the boundaries set by the City of Miami, but the closest was in adjacent [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]].&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson, Isaiah (February 6, 2008).

As many as 140 people lived in the colony in July 2009.&lt;ref name="knipe"&gt;Knipe, Julie (July 10, 2009).

== Conflicts over responsibility ==
As the number of residents grew, the City of Miami and the State of Florida disagreed over who was ultimately responsible for the sex offenders. Miami City Commissioner Marc Sarnoff, worried about how tourists perceived the colony, prompted an attorney from the Florida Department of Corrections to write a letter to the City of Miami absolving the Department of responsibility. The City of Miami responded by filing a lawsuit against the state, citing public health and safety concerns. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had also filed a lawsuit against the City of Miami for imposing the {{convert|2500|ft|m|adj=on}} rule for sex offenders when the State of Florida's law restricts them to {{convert|1000|ft|m}} from where children congregate. The ACLU said that the {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} rule would allow many of the offenders to return home.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;Allen, Greg (July 21, 2009) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106689642&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1001 Bridge Still Home For Miami Sex Offenders], National Public Radio. Retrieved on July 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was under further scrutiny for being within the forbidden area; a city park on an island in [[Biscayne Bay]] caused questions about the Julia Tuttle Causeway colony's itself being in violation of the sex offender laws.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt;

Local clergyman Vincent Spann likened the camp to a Biblical [[leper colony]] and offered to house the sex offenders in a manner similar to that which he employed to treat those recovering from drug and alcohol addiction. He predicted it would cost more than a million dollars a year.&lt;ref name="garciaroberts"&gt;Garcia-Roberts, Gus (April 14, 2009).

Retrieved on July 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, a judge responding to the lawsuit filed by the ACLU ruled that the City of Miami was allowed to set its own ordinances. The ACLU promised to appeal the decision. {{As of|2009}} Miami was facing other lawsuits about moving the sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/southflorida/story/1239101.html Strict Miami-Dade sex-offender law to remain in place] ''The Miami Herald'' (September 18, 2009). Retrieved on September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010 Miami-Dade County passed a new ordinance that still prevented sex offenders from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools but only forbade them from living within {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of places such as parks and daycares. The county also made this ordinance effective throughout the whole county and declared any stricter ordinances passed by other Miami-Dade cities to be superseded and repealed. With this new county ordinance, various pockets of the county were now legal for sex offenders to live in, and most, but not all, of the sex offenders ceased to be homeless. Previously, the sex offenders had been banned in most parts of the county from living within {{convert|2500|ft|m}} of schools, daycare centers, parks, and in some places even school bus stops.  As of March 2015, however, the problem continues.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Attempts to relocate colony residents==

Throughout the camp's existence, the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, an organization tasked by the county to help end street homelessness in Miami-Dade County, had been working to find permanent housing for all of the sex offenders living under the bridge. The trust is chaired by [[Ron Book]], the lobbyist who helped write and pass into law the {{convert|2500|ft|m|adj=on}} restriction, prompted by the abuse of his daughter at the hands of a hired caretaker. On April 15, 2010, the Trust moved the last of the sex offenders living under the bridge into other housing. However, further protest from nearby communities ensued. Several former residents of the encampment were evicted from a Miami hotel in late April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Valdemoro, Tania (April 25, 2010). "Shorecrest residents unhappy about relocation of sex offenders - Sex offenders? Not in my backyard, Miami residents tell their mayor and other city officials", '' The Miami Herald'', Shorecrest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lebovick, Jennifer; Beasley, Adam (April 20, 2010). "Hotel evicts sex offenders", ''The Miami Herald'', p. 3B.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' reported on the fate of the former Julia Tuttle Causeway colony, which former residents nicknamed "Bookville". Analysts studying the colony unanimously agreed on two relevant issues: the inability to find a stable home for offenders increased the risk that they would re-offend, and the close proximity of offenders to schools or parks did not increase the possibility that past offenders would re-offend. Despite these findings, Book solicited for and applied [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|federal stimulus money]] to buy short-term stays for offenders, eventually costing [[US$]]1,000 a month which, as noted by the ''Herald'', would have been unnecessary without the more stringent law that Book championed. This is incorrect according to David Raymond, former executive director of the Homeless Trust: federal Stimulus funds were never utilized for this population in Miami-Dade County; the funds used were from the local Homeless Food &amp; Beverage Tax.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Rent subsidies, along with job placement services and case management, were provided for up to six months.

Residents of Miami's Shorecrest neighborhood protested about the 13 sex offenders who had relocated there. Book placed another 43 offenders in a trailer park also housing many children. Book forewarned that the stimulus funds for housing the sex offenders would run out. The ''Herald'' reported that out of 1,960 sex offenders who had registered to live in Miami-Dade, 256 stopped reporting their locations to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas, Valerie and Bradley, Walter (November 5, 2011).

Retrieved on November 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2013 and 2014, evidence began to reach the news media that there was still a problem of homelessness amongst Miami-Dade sex offenders, despite the county's relaxation of the residency restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, Sarnoff himself has built miniature "pocket parks" in order to prevent sex offenders from being able to move into the Little River area of Miami, which Sarnoff represents.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Now, many of the homeless sex offenders are sleeping on railroad tracks (although most have homes during the day since the Miami-Dade residency restriction only applies from 10 pm to 6 am.) In October 2014, the ACLU announced plans to again sue the county over the residency restrictions. A similar lawsuit by the ACLU against Miami-Dade County failed in the 2009 case Exile v. Miami-Dade County, when it was ruled that Florida law does not prevent localities from enacting stricter sex offender residency restrictions. (This is contrary to a [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] ruling that invalidated local sex offender ordinances on those grounds.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}})

When [[Hurricane Irma]] hit in September, 2017, there were 233 sex offenders registered "to the area of NW 71st Street and NW 36th Court" in [[Hialeah, Florida]], i.e., adjacent to the train tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Logology''' ("the science of science") is the study of all aspects of [[science]] and of its [[scientist|practitioner]]s—aspects [[philosophy of science|philosophical]], biological, [[psychology of science|psychological]], [[sociology of science|societal]], [[history of science|historical]], [[politics|political]], [[research institute|institutional]], [[finance|financial]].  The term "logology" is used here as a [[synonym]]&lt;ref name=Zameck/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasparek/&gt; for the equivalent term "science of science"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/ "Science of Science Cyberinfrastructure Portal... at Indiana University"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219224025/http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/ |date=2013-02-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", 1935, reprinted in [[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', Boston, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1982, {{ISBN|83-01-03607-9}}, pp. 82–95.&lt;/ref&gt; and the semi-equivalent term "[[sociology of science]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Joseph Ben-David  |author2=Teresa A.

The term "logology" is [[back-formation|back-formed]] from "''-logy''" (as in "geo''logy''", "anthropo''logy''", "socio''logy''", etc.) in the sense of the "study of study" or the "science of science"—or, more plainly, the "study of science".&lt;ref name=Zameck&gt;{{cite book |author=[[:pl:Stefan Zamecki|Stefan Zamecki]] |title=Komentarze do naukoznawczych poglądów Williama Whewella (1794–1866):  studium historyczno-metodologiczne ''[Commentaries to the Logological Views of William Whewell (1794–1866):  A Historical-Methodological Study]'' |publisher=Wydawnictwa IHN PAN |year=2012|title-link=William Whewell }}, {{ISBN|978-83-86062-09-6}}, English-language summary: pp. 741–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasparek&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25778765 |author=[[Christopher Kasparek]] |title=Prus' ''Pharaoh'': The Creation of a Historical Novel |journal=[[The Polish Review]] |volume=XXXIX |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=45–46}} note 3&lt;/ref&gt;  
The word "logology" provides grammatical variants not available with the earlier terms "science of science" and "sociology of science"—"logologist", "to logologize", "logological", "logologically".{{efn|This meaning of "logology" is distinct from "the study of words", as the term was introduced by [[Kenneth Burke]] in ''The Rhetoric of Religion: Studies in Logology'' (1961), which sought to find a universal theory and methodology of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Burke, Kenneth |year=1970  |title=The Rhetoric of Religion: Studies in Logology |publisher=University of California Press  |isbn=9780520016101 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sHD-u9uK-AAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In introducing the book, Burke wrote: "If we defined 'theology' as 'words about God', then by 'logology' we should mean 'words about words'". [[Logology (theology)|Burke's "logology"]], in this [[theology|theological]] sense, has been cited as a useful tool of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bentz, V.M. |author2=Kenny, W. |year=1997 |title="Body-As-World": Kenneth Burke's Answer to the Postmodernist Charges against Sociology |journal=Sociological Theory |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=81–96 |doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00024}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==
The early 20th century brought calls, initially from [[sociology|sociologists]], for the creation of a new, empirically-based [[science]] that would study the [[science|scientific enterprise]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], "Editor's Note", ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', edited by Bohdan Walentynowicz, Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1982, {{ISBN|83-01-03607-9}}, p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;  The early proposals were put forward with some hesitancy and tentativeness.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Klemens Szaniawski|Klemens Szaniawski]], "Preface", ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]] concluded that, while the singling out of a certain group of questions into a separate, "autonomous" discipline might be insignificant from a theoretical standpoint, it is not so from a practical one:  "A new grouping of [questions] lends additional importance to the original [questions] and gives rise to new ones and [to] new ideas.  The new grouping marks out the direction of new investigations; moreover, it may exercise an influence on university studies [and on] the found[ing] of chairs, periodicals and societies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", reprinted in [[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The new [[Metascience (research)|meta-science]] would be given a variety of names,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; including "science of knowledge", "science of science", "[[sociology of science]]", and "logology".

[[Florian Znaniecki]], who is considered to be the founder of Polish academic sociology, and who in 1954 also served as the 44th president of the [[American Sociological Association]], opened a 1923 article:&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Znaniecki]], ''"Przedmiot i zadania nauki o wiedzy"'' ("The Subject Matter and Tasks of the Science of Knowledge"), ''Nauka Polska'' (Polish Science), vol. IV (1923), no. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[T]hough theoretical reflection on [[knowledge]] — which arose as early as [[Heraclitus]] and the [[Eleatics]] — stretches... unbroken... through the history of human thought to the present day... we are now witnessing the creation of a new ''science of knowledge'' [author's emphasis] whose relation to the old inquiries may be compared with the relation of modern [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] to the '[[natural philosophy]]' that preceded them, or of contemporary [[sociology]] to the '[[political philosophy]]' of [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]].  [T]here is beginning to take shape a concept of a single, general theory of knowledge... permitting of empirical study....  This theory... is coming to be distinguished clearly from [[epistemology]], from normative [[logic]], and from a strictly descriptive [[history of knowledge]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Znaniecki]], "The Subject Matter and Tasks of the Science of Knowledge" (English translation), ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dozen years later, Polish husband-and-wife sociologists [[Stanisław Ossowski]] and [[Maria Ossowska]] (the ''Ossowscy'') took up the same subject in an article on "The Science of Science"&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", originally published in Polish as ''"Nauka o nauce"'' ("The Science of Science") in ''Nauka Polska'' (Polish Science), vol. XX (1935), no. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; whose 1935 English-language version first introduced the term ''"science of science"'' to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], Editor's Note, in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;  The article postulated that the new discipline would subsume such earlier ones as [[epistemology]], the [[philosophy of science]], the "[[psychology of science]]", and the "[[sociology of science]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", reprinted in [[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Science of science'' would also concern itself with questions of a practical character such as social and state policy in relation to science; the organization of institutions of higher learning, of research institutes, and of scientific expeditions; the protection of scientific workers, etc.  It would concern itself as well with historical questions:  the history of the conception of science, of the scientist, of the various disciplines, and of learning in general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1935 paper, the ''Ossowscy'' mentioned the German philosopher [[:de:Werner Schingnitz|Werner Schingnitz]] (1899–1953) who, in fragmentary 1931 remarks, had enumerated some possible types of research in the science of science and had proposed his own name for the new discipline:  ''"scientiology"''.  The ''Ossowscy'' took issue with the name:  "Those who wish to replace the expression 'science of science' by a one-word term [that] sound[s] international, in the belief that only after receiving such a name [will] a given group of [questions be] officially dubbed an autonomous discipline, [might] be reminded of the name ''mathesiology'', proposed long ago for similar purposes [by the French mathematician and physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836)]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]], "The Science of Science", in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', pp. 87–88, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, before long, in Poland, the unwieldy three-word term ''"nauka o nauce"'' ("science of science") was replaced by the more versatile one-word term ''"naukoznawstwo"'' ("logology") and its natural variants:  ''"naukoznawca"'' ("logologist"), ''"naukoznawczy"'' ("logological"), and ''"naukoznawczo"'' ("logologically").  And just after [[World War II]], only 11 years after the ''Ossowscy'''s landmark 1935 paper, the year 1946 saw the founding of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]' quarterly ''Zagadnienia Naukoznawstwa'' (Logology) — long before similar journals in many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Bohdan Walentynowicz|Bohdan Walentynowicz]], "Editor's Note", ''Polish Contributions to the Science of Science'', p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Other thinkers associated with the Polish school of logology who "have [also] gained international recognition" include [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Ludwik Fleck]], and [[:pl:Stefan Amsterdamski|Stefan Amsterdamski]].&lt;ref&gt;Elena Aronova, Simone Turchetti (eds.), ''Science Studies during the Cold War and Beyond: Paradigms Defected'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

The new discipline also took root elsewhere — in English-speaking countries, without the benefit of a one-word name.

==Science==
{{Main article|Science}}

===The term===
The term "[[science]]" (from the [[Latin]] "''scientia''", "[[knowledge]]") means somewhat different things in different languages.  In the [[English language]], "science", when unqualified, generally refers to the "[[natural sciences|natural]]", "[[exact sciences|exact]]", or "[[hard sciences]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis'':  Reason, empiricism and skepticism are not virtues of science alone", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding terms in other languages, for example [[:fr:science|French]], [[:Wissenschaft|German]], and  [[:pl:nauka|Polish]], refer to a broader domain that includes not only the exact sciences ([[logic]] and [[mathematics]]) and the natural sciences ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[Earth sciences]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], etc.) but also the [[engineering|engineering sciences]], [[social sciences]] ([[history]], [[geography]], [[psychology]], [[physical anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[international relations]], [[pedagogy]], etc.), and [[humanities]] ([[philosophy]], [[history]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[linguistics]], etc.).&lt;ref name="Scientia Humanitatis' 2015 p. 80"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis''", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Amsterdam]] humanities professor Rens Bod points out that science—defined as a set of [[Scientific method|methods]] that describes and interprets [[observation|observed]] or [[inference|inferred]] [[phenomena]], past or present, aimed at testing [[hypotheses]] and building [[theories]]—applies to such humanities fields as [[philology]], [[art history]], [[musicology]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], [[historiography]], and [[literary studies]].&lt;ref name="Scientia Humanitatis' 2015 p. 80"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis''", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bod gives a historic example of scientific [[Content analysis|textual analysis]].  in 1440 the Italian philologist [[Lorenzo Valla]] exposed the [[Latin]] document ''[[Donatio Constantini]]'' (The Donation of Constantine)—which was used by the [[Catholic Church]] to legitimize its claim to lands in the [[Western Roman Empire]]—as a [[forgery]].  Valla used historical, linguistic, and philological evidence, including [[counterfactual history|counterfactual reasoning]], to rebut the document.  Valla found words and constructions in the document that could not have been used by anyone in the time of [[Emperor Constantine I]], at the beginning of the fourth century A.D.  For example, the [[late Latin]] word ''[[feudum]]'' ("fief") referred to the [[feudal system]], a [[medieval]] invention that did not exist before the seventh century A.D.  Valla's methods were those of science, and inspired the later scientifically-minded work of Dutch humanist [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] (1466–1536), [[Leiden University]] professor [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] (1540–1609), and philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–77).&lt;ref name="Scientia Humanitatis' 2015 p. 80"&gt;[[Michael Shermer]], "''Scientia Humanitatis''", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowability===
{{Main article|Knowledge}}

Science's search for the [[truth]] about various aspects of [[reality]] entails the question of the very ''knowability'' of reality.  Philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]] writes:  "[In t]he pursuit of [[scientific knowledge]] through the interaction between [[theory]] and [[observation]]... we test theories against their observational consequences, but we also question or reinterpret our observations in light of theory.  (The choice between [[geocentric theory|geocentric]] and [[heliocentric theory|heliocentric theories]] at the time of the [[Copernican revolution]] is a vivid example.) ... 
How things seem is the starting point for all knowledge, and its development through further correction, extension, and elaboration is inevitably the result of more seemings—considered [[judgment]]s about the plausibility and consequences of different theoretical [[hypothesis|hypotheses]].  The only way to pursue the truth is to consider what seems true, after careful reflection of a kind appropriate to the subject matter, in light of all the relevant data, principles, and circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nagel]], "Listening to Reason" (a review of [[T.M. Scanlon]], ''Being Realistic about Reasons'', Oxford University Press, 132 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 15 (October 9, 2014), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of knowability is approached from a different perspective by physicist-astronomer [[Marcelo Gleiser]]:  "What we observe is not [[nature]] itself but nature as discerned through [[data]] we collect from [[machine]]s.  In consequence, the scientific [[worldview]] depends on the [[information]] we can acquire through our [[Scientific instrument|instrument]]s.  And given that our tools are limited, our view of the [[universe|world]] is necessarily [[myopia|myopic]].  We can see only so far into the nature of things, and our ever shifting scientific worldview reflects this fundamental limitation on how we perceive [[reality]]."  Gleiser cites the condition of [[biology]] before and after the invention of the [[microscope]] or [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]]; of [[astronomy]] before and after the [[telescope]]; of [[particle physics]] before and after [[collider]]s or fast electronics.  "[T]he theories we build and the worldviews we construct change as our tools of exploration transform.  This trend is the trademark of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?  The reach of the [[scientific method]] is constrained by the limitations of our tools and the intrinsic impenetrability of some of nature's deepest questions", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writes Gleiser:  "There is nothing defeatist in understanding the limitations of the scientific approach to knowledge....  What should change is a sense of scientific triumphalism – the belief that no question is beyond the reach of scientific discourse.

"There are clear unknowables in science – reasonable questions that, unless currently accepted laws of nature are violated, we cannot find answers to.  One example is the [[multiverse]]:  the conjecture that our [[universe]] is but one among a multitude of others, each potentially with a different set of [[Laws of science|laws of nature]].  Other universes lie outside our causal horizon, meaning that we cannot receive or send signals to them.  Any evidence for their existence would be circumstantial:  for example, scars in the radiation permeating space because of a past collision with a neighboring universe."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gleiser gives three further examples of unknowables, involving the origins of the [[universe]]; of [[life]]; and of [[mind]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Theoretical physicist]] [[Brian Greene]], asked by [[Walter Isaacson]] on [[PBS]]' ''[[Amanpour &amp; Company]]'' on 24 October 2018 what questions he would like to see answered, listed the same three questions, in the same order, that Gleiser describes as unknowable.}}

"Scientific accounts of the origin of the [[universe]] are incomplete because they must rely on a conceptual framework to even begin to work:  [[energy conservation]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[quantum physics]], for instance.  Why does the universe operate under these laws and not others?

"Similarly, unless we can prove that only one or very few [[ biochemical pathway]]s exist from nonlife to [[life]], we cannot know for sure how life originated on Earth.

"For [[consciousness]], the problem is the jump from the [[material]] to the [[Qualia|subjective]] – for example, from firing [[neuron]]s to the [[experience]] of [[pain]] or the [[color]] red.  Perhaps some kind of rudimentary consciousness could emerge in a sufficiently complex machine.  But how could we tell?  How do we establish – as opposed to conjecture – that something is conscious?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paradoxically, writes Gleiser, it is through our consciousness that we make sense of the world, even if imperfectly.  "Can we fully understand something of which we are a part?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "How Much Can We Know?, ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Herbert Spencer]] argued that the ultimate "[[reality]] existing behind all [[phenomenon|appearances]] is, and must ever be, unknown."&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Spencer]], ''First Principles'' (1862), part I:  "The Unknowable", chapter IV:  "The Relativity of All Knowledge".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Facts and theories===
{{Main article|Theory}}

Theoretical physicist and mathematician [[Freeman Dyson]] explains that "[s]cience consists of [[fact]]s and [[theory|theories]]":

"Facts are supposed to be true or false.  They are discovered by observers or experimenters.  A scientist who claims to have discovered a fact that turns out to be wrong is judged harshly....  

"Theories have an entirely different status.  They are free creations of the human mind, intended to describe our understanding of nature.  Since our understanding is incomplete, theories are provisional.  Theories are tools of understanding, and a tool does not need to be precisely true in order to be useful.  Theories are supposed to be more-or-less true...  A scientist who invents a theory that turns out to be wrong is judged leniently."&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders" (review of [[Mario Livio]], ''Brilliant Blunders:  From Darwin to Einstein—Colossal Mistakes by Great Scientists that Changed Our Understanding of Life and the Universe'', Simon and Schuster), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyson cites a psychologist's description of how theories are born:  "We can't live in a state of perpetual doubt, so we make up the best story possible and we live as if the story were true."  Dyson writes:  "The inventor of a brilliant idea cannot tell whether it is right or wrong."  The passionate pursuit of wrong theories is a normal part of the development of science.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyson cites, after [[Mario Livio]], five famous scientists who made major contributions to the understanding of nature but also believed firmly in a theory that proved wrong.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] explained the [[evolution of life]] with his [[theory of natural selection]] of inherited variations, but he believed in a theory of blending inheritance that made the propagation of new variations impossible.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;  He never read [[Gregor Mendel]]'s studies that showed that the [[laws of inheritance]] would become simple when inheritance was considered as a [[randomness|random]] process.  Though Darwin in 1866 did the same experiment that Mendel had, Darwin did not get comparable results because he failed to appreciate the [[statistics|statistical]] importance of using very large experimental [[sample (statistics)|sample]]s.  Eventually, [[Mendelian inheritance]] by random variation would, no thanks to Darwin, provide the raw material for Darwinian selection to work on.&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), pp. 6, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] discovered basic laws of [[energy]] and [[heat]], then used these laws to calculate an estimate of the [[age of the earth]] that was too short by a factor of fifty.  He based his calculation on the belief that the [[earth's mantle]] was solid and could transfer heat from the interior to the surface only by [[Thermal conduction|conduction]].  It is now known that the mantle is partly fluid and transfers most of the heat by the far more efficient process of [[convection]], which carries heat by a massive circulation of hot rock moving upward and cooler rock moving downward.  Kelvin could see the eruptions of [[volcano]]es bringing hot liquid from deep underground to the surface; but his skill in calculation blinded him to processes, such as [[volcanic eruptions]], that could not be calculated.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

[[Linus Pauling]] discovered the chemical structure of [[protein]] and proposed a completely wrong structure for [[DNA]], which carries hereditary information from parent to offspring.  Pauling guessed a wrong structure for DNA because he assumed that a pattern that worked for protein would also work for DNA.  He overlooked the gross chemical differences between protein and DNA.  [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Watson]] paid attention to the differences and found the correct structure for DNA that Pauling had missed a year earlier.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

Astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] discovered the process by which the heavier [[chemical element|element]]s essential to [[life]] are created by [[nuclear reaction]]s in the cores of massive [[star]]s.  He then proposed a theory of the history of the universe known as [[steady-state cosmology]], which has the [[universe]] existing forever without an initial [[Big Bang]] (as Hoyle derisively dubbed it).  He held his belief in the steady state long after observations proved that the Big Bang had happened.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] discovered the theory of space, time, and gravitation known as [[general relativity]], and then added a [[cosmological constant]],  later known as [[dark energy]].  Subsequently Einstein withdrew his proposal of dark energy, believing it unnecessary.  Long after his death, observations suggested that dark energy really exists, so that Einstein's addition to the theory may have been right; and his withdrawal, wrong.&lt;ref name="LXI 2014 p. 4"/&gt;

To Mario Livio's five examples of scientists who blundered, Dyson adds a sixth:  himself.  Dyson had concluded, on theoretical principles, that what was to become known as the [[W-particle]], a charged [[weak boson]], could not exist.  An experiment conducted at [[CERN]], in [[Geneva]], later proved him wrong.  "With hindsight I could see several reasons why my stability argument would not apply to W-particles.  [They] are too massive and too short-lived to be a constituent of anything that resembles ordinary matter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Freeman Dyson]], "The Case for Blunders", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empiricism===

[[Steven Weinberg]], 1979 [[Nobel Prize in physics|Nobel laureate in physics]], and a [[history of science|historian of science]], writes that the core goal of science has always been the same:  "to explain the world"; and in reviewing earlier periods of scientific thought, he concludes that only since [[Isaac Newton]] has that goal been pursued more or less correctly.  He decries the "intellectual snobbery" that [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] showed in their disdain for science's practical applications, and he holds [[Francis Bacon]] and [[René Descartes]] to have been the "most overrated" among the forerunners of modern science (they tried to prescribe rules for conducting science, which "never works").&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, [2015], 416 pp., $28.99, {{ISBN|978-0062346650}}), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg draws parallels between past and present science, as when a scientific theory is "fine-tuned" (adjusted) to make certain quantities equal, without any understanding of why they ''should'' be equal.  Such adjusting vitiated the celestial models of Plato's followers, in which different spheres carrying the [[planet]]s and [[star]]s were assumed, with no good reason, to rotate in exact unison.  But, Weinberg writes, a similar fine-tuning also besets current efforts to understand the "[[dark energy]]" that is [[Accelerating universe|speeding up the expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 53"&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, 2015), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient science has been described as having gotten off to a good start, then faltered.  The doctrine of [[atomism]], propounded by the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], was naturalistic, accounting for the workings of the world by impersonal processes, not by divine volitions.  Nevertheless these pre-Socratics come up short for Weinberg as proto-scientists, in that they apparently never tried to justify their speculations or to test them against evidence.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 53"/&gt;

Weinberg believes that science faltered early on due to Plato's suggestion that scientific truth could be attained by reason alone, disregarding [[empirical observation]], and due to Aristotle's attempt to explain nature [[teleology|teleologically]]—in terms of ends and purposes.  Plato's ideal of attaining knowledge of the world by unaided intellect was "a false goal inspired by mathematics"—one that for centuries "stood in the way of progress that could be based only on careful analysis of careful observation."  And it "never was fruitful" to ask, as Aristotle did, "what is the purpose of this or that physical phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 53"/&gt;

A scientific field in which the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic]] world did make progress was astronomy.  This was partly for practical reasons:  the sky had long served as compass, clock, and calendar.  Also, the regularity of the movements of heavenly bodies made them simpler to describe than earthly phenomena.  But not ''too'' simple:  though the sun, moon and "fixed stars" seemed regular in their celestial circuits, the "wandering stars"—the planets—were puzzling; they seemed to move at variable speeds, and even to reverse direction.  Writes Weinberg:  "Much of the story of the emergence of modern science deals with the effort, extending over two millennia, to explain the peculiar motions of the planets."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, 2015), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge was to make sense of the apparently irregular wanderings of the planets on the assumption that all heavenly motion is actually circular and uniform in speed.  Circular, because Plato held the [[circle]] to be the most perfect and symmetrical form; and therefore circular motion, at uniform speed, was most fitting for celestial bodies.  Aristotle agreed with Plato.  In Aristotle's [[cosmos]], everything had a "natural" tendency to motion that fulfilled its inner potential.  For the cosmos' sublunary part (the region below the moon), the natural tendency was to move in a straight line:  downward, for earthen things (such as rocks) and water; upward, for air and fiery things (such as sparks).  But in the [[Astronomical object|celestial]] realm things were not composed of earth, water, air, or fire, but of a "fifth element", or "[[Aether (classical element)|quintessence]]," which was perfect and eternal.  And its natural motion was uniformly circular.  The stars, the sun, the moon, and the planets were carried in their orbits by a complicated arrangement of crystalline spheres, all centered around an immobile earth.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], "At the Core of Science" (a review of [[Steven Weinberg]], ''To Explain the World:  The Discovery of Modern Science'', Harper, 2015), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Platonic-Aristotelian conviction that celestial motions must be circular persisted stubbornly.  It was fundamental to the astronomer [[Ptolemy]]'s system, which improved on Aristotle's in conforming to the astronomical data by allowing the planets to move in combinations of circles called "[[epicycle]]s".&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

It even survived the [[Copernican revolution]].  Copernicus was conservative in his Platonic reverence for the circle as the heavenly pattern.  According to Weinberg, Copernicus was motivated to dethrone the earth in favor of the sun as the immobile center of the cosmos largely by aesthetic considerations:  he objected to the fact that Ptolemy, though faithful to Plato's requirement that heavenly motion be circular, had departed from Plato's other requirement that it be of uniform speed.  By putting the sun at the center—actually, somewhat off-center—Copernicus sought to honor circularity while restoring uniformity.  But to make his system fit the observations as well as Ptolemy's system, Copernicus had to introduce still more epicycles.  That was a mistake that, writes Weinberg, illustrates a recurrent theme in the history of science:  "A simple and beautiful theory that agrees pretty well with observation is often closer to the truth than a complicated ugly theory that agrees better with observation."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

The planets, however, do not move in perfect circles but in [[ellipse]]s.  It was [[Johannes Kepler]], about a century after Copernicus, who reluctantly (for he too had Platonic affinities) realized this.  Thanks to his examination of the meticulous observations compiled by astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], Kepler "was the first to understand the nature of the departures from uniform circular motion that had puzzled astronomers since the time of Plato."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

The replacement of circles by supposedly ugly ellipses overthrew Plato's notion of [[Perfection#Aesthetics|perfection]] as the celestial explanatory principle.  It also destroyed Aristotle's model of the planets carried in their orbits by crystalline spheres; writes Weinberg, "there is no solid body whose rotation can produce an ellipse."  Even if a planet were attached to an ellipsoid crystal, that crystal's rotation would still trace a circle.  And if the planets were pursuing their elliptical motion through empty space, then what was holding them in their orbits?&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

Science had reached the threshold of explaining the world not [[geometry|geometrically]], according to shape, but dynamically, according to [[force]].  It was [[Isaac Newton]] who finally crossed that threshold.  He was the first to formulate, in his "[[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]", the concept of force.  He demonstrated that Kepler's ellipses were the very orbits the planets would take if they were attracted toward the sun by a force that decreased as the square of the planet's distance from the sun.  And by comparing the moon's motion in its orbit around the earth to the motion of, perhaps, an apple as it falls to the ground, Newton deduced that the forces governing them were quantitatively the same.  "This," writes Weinberg, "was the climactic step in the unification of the celestial and terrestrial in science."&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

By formulating a unified explanation of the behavior of planets, comets, moons, tides, and apples, writes Weinberg, Newton "provided an irresistible model for what a [[physical theory]] should be"—a model that fit no preexisting [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] criterion.  In contrast to Aristotle, who claimed to explain the falling of a rock by appeal to its inner striving, Newton was unconcerned with finding a deeper cause for [[gravity]].  He declared in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'':  "I do not 'feign' hypotheses."  What mattered were his mathematically stated principles describing this force, and their ability to account for a vast range of phenomena.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

About two centuries later, in 1915, a deeper explanation for Newton's law of gravitation was found in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]]:  gravity could be explained as a manifestation of the curvature in [[spacetime]] resulting from the presence of [[matter]] and [[energy]].  Successful theories like Newton's, writes Weinberg, may work for reasons that their creators do not understand—reasons that deeper theories will later reveal.  Scientific progress is not a matter of building theories on a foundation of [[reason]], but of unifying a greater range of [[phenomenon|phenomena]] under simpler and more general principles.&lt;ref name="Jim Holt 2015 p. 54"/&gt;

===Artificial intelligence===
{{Main article|Artificial intelligence}}
Since 1950, when [[Alan Turing]] proposed what has come to be called the “[[Turing test]],” there has been speculation whether machines such as computers can possess intelligence; and, if so, [[Technological singularity|whether intelligent machines could become a threat to human intellectual and scientific ascendancy]]—or even an existential threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”,  ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Searle]] points out common confusion about the correct interpretation of computation and information technology.  "For example, one routinely reads that in exactly the same sense in which [[Garry Kasparov]]… beat [[Anatoly Karpov]] in [[chess]], the computer called [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] played and beat Kasparov.... [T]his claim is [obviously] suspect.  In order for Kasparov to play and win, he has to be conscious that he is playing chess, and conscious of a thousand other things...  Deep Blue is conscious of none of these things because it is not conscious of anything at all.  Why is [[consciousness]] so important?  You cannot literally play chess or do much of anything else cognitive if you are totally disassociated from consciousness."&lt;ref name="autogenerated52"&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle explains that, "in the literal, real, observer-independent sense in which humans compute, mechanical computers do not compute.  They go through a set of transitions in electronic states that we can interpret computationally.  The transitions in those electronic states are absolute or observer-independent, but ''the computation is observer-relative''.  The transitions in physical states are just electrical sequences unless some conscious agent can give them a computational interpretation.... There is no psychological reality at all to what is happening in the [computer]."&lt;ref&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[A] digital computer", writes Searle, "is a syntactical machine.  It manipulates symbols and does nothing else.  For this reason, the project of creating human intelligence by designing a computer program that will pass the [[Turing Test]]... is doomed from the start.  The appropriately programmed computer has a [[syntax]] [rules for constructing or transforming the symbols and words of a language] but no [[semantics]] [comprehension of meaning].... Minds, on the other hand, have mental or semantic content."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"&gt;[[John R. Searle]], “What Your Computer Can’t Know”, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 October 2014, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of psychology and neural science [[Gary Marcus]] points out a so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence:  an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.  Our brain is so good at comprehending [[language]] that we do not usually notice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  A prominent example is known as the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"):  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer science|Computer scientist]] [[Pedro Domingos]] writes:  "AIs are like [[autistic savant]]s and will remain so for the foreseeable future.... AIs lack [[common sense]] and can easily make errors that a human never would...  They are also liable to take our instructions too literally, giving us precisely what we asked for instead of what we actually wanted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pedro Domingos]], "Our Digital Doubles:  AI will serve our species, not control it", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 3 (September 2018), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

===Discoveries and inventions===
{{Main article|Discovery (observation)|Invention}}

Fifty years before [[Florian Znaniecki]] published his 1923 paper proposing the creation of an empirical field of study to study the field of [[science]], Aleksander Głowacki (better known by his pen name, [[Bolesław Prus]]) had made the same proposal.  In an 1873 public lecture "On Discoveries and Inventions",&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions:  A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander Głowacki [Bolesław Prus]'', Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszyńska, 1873. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30407/30407-h/30407-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Prus said:
{{blockquote|Until now there has been no science that describes the means for making discoveries and inventions, and the generality of people, as well as many men of learning, believe that there never will be.  This is an error.  Someday a science of making discoveries and inventions will exist and will render services.  It will arise not all at once; first only its general outline will appear, which subsequent researchers will emend and elaborate, and which still later researchers will apply to individual branches of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions:  A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander Głowacki [Bolesław Prus]'', Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszyńska, 1873, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prus defines ''"[[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]"'' as "the finding out of a thing that has existed and exists in nature, but which was previously unknown to people";&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''"[[invention]]"'' as "the making of a thing that has not previously existed, and which nature itself cannot make."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

He illustrates the concept of "discovery":

{{blockquote|Until 400 years ago, people thought that the Earth comprised just three parts:  Europe, Asia, and Africa; it was only in 1492 that the Genoese, [[Christopher Columbus]], sailed out from Europe into the Atlantic Ocean and, proceeding ever westward, after [10 weeks] reached a part of the world that Europeans had never known.  In that new land he found copper-colored people who went about naked, and he found plants and animals different from those in Europe; in short, he had discovered a new part of the world that others would later name "America."  We say that Columbus had ''discovered'' America, because America had already long existed on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prus illustrates the concept of "invention":

{{blockquote|[As late as] 50 years ago, [[locomotive]]s were unknown, and no one knew how to build one; it was only in 1828 that the English engineer [George] Stephenson built the first locomotive and set it in motion.  So we say that Stephenson ''invented'' the locomotive, because this machine had not previously existed and could not by itself have come into being in nature; it could only have been made by man.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;}}

According to Prus, "inventions and discoveries are natural phenomena and, as such, are subject to certain laws."  Those are the laws of "gradualness", "dependence", and "combination".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|1.  ''The law of gradualness.''  No discovery or invention arises at once perfected, but it is perfected gradually; likewise, no invention or discovery is the work of a single individual but of many individuals, each adding his little contribution.  [...]  Potatoes were first discovered; later they were found to make good cattle feed; then it was learned that potatoes could nourish people; and, later, potatoes began to be used for making vodka.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to inventions, gradualness may be illustrated by the evolution of the stool.  First people found that it was better to sit on a stump or a rock than on the ground.  Then, noticing that a rock or a stump was too heavy to lug around, they built a stool consisting of a board and several legs.  Next, to the stool they added a backrest, thus making a chair; to the chair, they added arm rests, making an armchair.  Then they began painting and padding the armchairs and chairs, and so on.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  ''The law of dependence.''  An invention or discovery is conditional on the prior existence of certain known discoveries and inventions.  [...]   If potatoes grew only in America, they could not have been discovered before America had been; if the [[black swan]] lives only in Australia, the black swan could not have been seen before Australia had been.  If the rings of [[Saturn]] can be seen through telescopes, then the telescope had to have been invented before the rings could have been seen. [...]&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt;

3.  ''The law of combination.''  Any new discovery or invention is a combination of earlier discoveries and inventions, or rests on them.  When I study a new mineral, I inspect it, I smell it, I taste it, that is, I combine the mineral with my senses.  Then I weigh it and heat it, which is to say, I combine the mineral with a balance and with fire.  Then I place it into water, into sulfuric acid, and so forth, in short, I combine the mineral with everything that I have at hand and in this way I learn ever more of its properties.  And as for inventions, who does not know that a clock is a combination of wheels, springs, dials, bells, etc.?  Who does not know that gunpowder is a combination of sulfur, saltpeter and charcoal?&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each of Prus' three "laws" entails important corollaries.  The law of gradualness implies the following:&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|a)  Since every discovery and invention requires perfecting, let us not pride ourselves only on discovering or inventing something ''completely new'', but let us also work to improve or get to know more exactly things that are already known and already exist. […]&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;

b)  The same law of gradualness demonstrates the necessity of ''expert training''.  Who can perfect a watch, if not a watchmaker with a good comprehensive knowledge of his métier?  Who can discover new characteristics of an animal, if not a naturalist?&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;}}

From the law of dependence flow the following corollaries:&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;

{{blockquote|a)  No invention or discovery, even one seemingly without value, should be dismissed, because that particular trifle may later prove very useful.  There would seem to be no simpler invention than the needle, yet the clothing of millions of people, and the livelihoods of millions of seamstresses, depend on the needle’s existence.  Even today’s beautiful sewing machine would not exist, had the needle not long ago been invented.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

b)  The law of dependence teaches us that what cannot be done today, might be done later.  People give much thought to the construction of a flying machine that could carry many persons and parcels.  The inventing of such a machine will depend, among other things, on inventing a material that is, say, as light as paper and as sturdy and fire-resistant as steel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, Prus' corollaries to his law of combination:&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

{{blockquote|a)  Anyone who wants to be a successful inventor, needs to know a great many things—in the most diverse fields.  For if a new invention is a combination of earlier inventions, then the inventor’s mind is the ground on which, for the first time, various seemingly unrelated things combine.  Example:  The steam engine combines Rumford’s double boiler, the pump, and the spinning wheel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;
   
[…] What is the connection among zinc, copper, sulfuric acid, a magnet, a clock mechanism, and an urgent message?  All these had to come together in the mind of the inventor of the telegraph… […]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greater the number of inventions that come into being, the more things a new inventor must know; the first, earliest and simplest inventions were made by completely uneducated people—but today’s inventions, particularly scientific ones, are products of the most highly educated minds. […]&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

b)  A second corollary concerns societies that wish to have inventors.  I said that a new invention is created by combining the most diverse objects; let us see where this takes us.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt;

Suppose I want to make an invention, and someone tells me:  Take 100 different objects and bring them into contact with one another, first two at a time, then three at a time, finally four at a time, and you will arrive at a new invention.  Imagine that I take a burning candle, charcoal, water, paper, zinc, sugar, sulfuric acid, and so on, 100 objects in all, and combine them with one another, that is, bring into contact first two at a time:  charcoal with flame, water with flame, sugar with flame, zinc with flame, sugar with water, etc.  Each time, I shall see a phenomenon:  thus, in fire, sugar will melt, charcoal will burn, zinc will heat up, and so on.  Now I will bring into contact three objects at a time, for example, sugar, zinc and flame; charcoal, sugar and flame; sulfuric acid, zinc and water; etc., and again I shall experience phenomena.  Finally I bring into contact four objects at a time, for example, sugar, zinc, charcoal, and sulfuric acid.  Ostensibly this is a very simple method, because in this fashion I could make not merely one but a dozen inventions.  But will such an effort not exceed my capability?  It certainly will.  A hundred objects, combined in twos, threes and fours, will make over ''4 million'' combinations; so if I made 100 combinations a day, it would take me over 110 years to exhaust them all!&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

But if by myself I am not up to the task, a sizable group of people will be.  If 1,000 of us came together to produce the combinations that I have described, then any one person would only have to carry out slightly more than 4,000 combinations.  If each of us performed just 10 combinations a day, together we would finish them all in less than a year and a half:  1,000 people would make an invention which a single man would have to spend more than 110 years to make…&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Ludicrous as this metaphor for the process of invention may sound, it brings to mind some experiments that would soon be done by Prus' contemporary, the inventor [[Thomas Edison]]—nowhere more so than in his exhaustive search for a practicable [[Incandescent light bulb|light-bulb]] filament.  (Edison's work with electric light bulbs also illustrates Prus' law of gradualness:  many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps; Edison's was merely the first commercially practical incandescent light.)}}

The conclusion is quite clear:  a society that wants to win renown with its discoveries and inventions has to have a great many persons working in every branch of knowledge.  One or a few men of learning and genius mean nothing today, or nearly nothing, because everything is now done by large numbers.  I would like to offer the following simile:  Inventions and discoveries are like a lottery; not every player wins, but from among the many players a few ''must'' win.  The point is not that John or Paul, because they want to make an invention and because they work for it, shall make an invention; but where thousands want an invention and work for it, the invention must appear, as surely as an unsupported rock must fall to the ground.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt;}}

But, asks Prus, "What force drives [the] toilsome, often frustrated efforts [of the investigators]?  What thread will clew these people through hitherto unexplored fields of study?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The reference to a thread appears to be an allusion to [[Ariadne's thread#Minos and Theseus|Ariadne's thread]] in the myth of [[Theseus#The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur|Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur#Theseus and the Minotaur|Minotaur]].}}

{{blockquote|[T]he answer is very simple:  man is driven to efforts, including those of making discoveries and inventions, by ''[[need]]s''; and the thread that guides him is ''[[observation]]'':  observation of the works of nature and of man.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt;

I have said that the mainspring of all discoveries and inventions is needs.  In fact, is there any work of man that does not satisfy some need?  We build railroads because we need rapid transportation; we build clocks because we need to measure time; we build sewing machines because the speed of [unaided] human hands is insufficient.  We abandon home and family and depart for distant lands because we are drawn by curiosity to see what lies elsewhere.  We forsake the society of people and we spend long hours in exhausting contemplation because we are driven by a hunger for knowledge, by a desire to solve the challenges that are constantly thrown up by the world and by life!&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"/&gt;

Needs never cease; on the contrary, they are always growing.  While the pauper thinks about a piece of bread for lunch, the rich man thinks about wine after lunch.  The foot traveler dreams of a rudimentary wagon; the railroad passenger demands a heater.  The infant is cramped in its cradle; the mature man is cramped in the world.  In short, everyone has his needs, and everyone desires to satisfy them, and that desire is an inexhaustible source of new discoveries, new inventions, in short, of all progress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

But needs are ''general'', such as the needs for food, sleep and clothing; and ''special'', such as needs for a new steam engine, a new telescope, a new hammer, a new wrench.  To understand the former needs, it suffices to be a human being; to understand the latter needs, one must be a ''specialist''—an ''expert worker''.  Who knows better than a tailor what it is that tailors need, and who better than a tailor knows how to find the right way to satisfy the need?&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let us consider how observation can lead man to new ideas; and to that end, as an example, let us imagine how, more or less, clay products came to be invented.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt;

Suppose that somewhere there lived on clayey soil a primitive people who already knew fire.  When rain fell on the ground, the clay turned doughy; and if, shortly after the rain, a fire was set on top of the clay, the clay under the fire became fired and hardened.  If such an event occurred several times, the people might observe and thereafter remember that fired clay becomes hard like stone and does not soften in water.  One of the primitives might also, when walking on wet clay, have impressed deep tracks into it; after the sun had dried the ground and rain had fallen again, the primitives might have observed that water remains in those hollows longer than on the surface.  Inspecting the wet clay, the people might have observed that this material can be easily kneaded in one’s fingers and accepts various forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Some ingenious persons might have started shaping clay into various animal forms […] etc., including something shaped like a tortoise shell, which was in use at the time.  Others, remembering that clay hardens in fire, might have fired the hollowed-out mass, thereby creating the first [clay] bowl.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, it was a relatively easy matter to perfect the new invention; someone else could discover clay more suitable for such manufactures; someone else could invent a glaze, and so on, with nature and observation at every step pointing out to man the way to invention. […]&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"/&gt;

[This example] illustrates how people arrive at various ideas: ''by closely observing all things and wondering about all things''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"/&gt;

Take another example.  [S]ometimes, in a pane of glass, we find disks and bubbles, looking through which we see objects more distinctly than with the naked eye.  Suppose that an alert person, spotting such a bubble in a pane, took out a piece of glass and showed it to others as a toy.  Possibly among them there was a man with weak vision who found that, through the bubble in the pane, he saw better than with the naked eye.  Closer investigation showed that bilaterally convex glass strengthens weak vision, and in this way eyeglasses were invented.  People may first have cut glass for eyeglasses from glass panes, but in time others began grinding smooth pieces of glass into convex lenses and producing proper eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The art of grinding eyeglasses was known almost 600 years ago.  A couple of hundred years later, the children of a certain eyeglass grinder, while playing with lenses, placed one in front of another and found that they could see better through two lenses than through one.  They informed their father about this curious occurrence, and he began producing tubes with two magnifying lenses and selling them as a toy.  Galileo, the great Italian scientist, on learning of this toy, used it for a different purpose and built the first telescope.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

This example, too, shows us that observation leads man by the hand to inventions.  This example again demonstrates the truth of gradualness in the development of inventions, but above all also the fact that education amplifies man’s inventiveness.  A simple lens-grinder formed two magnifying glasses into a toy—while Galileo, one of the most learned men of his time, made a telescope.  As Galileo’s mind was superior to the craftsman’s mind, so the invention of the telescope was superior to the invention of a toy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt;  [...]

The three laws [that have been discussed here] are immensely important and do not apply only to discoveries and inventions, but they pervade all of nature.  An oak does not immediately become an oak but begins as an acorn, then becomes a seedling, later a little tree, and finally a mighty oak:  we see here the law of gradualness.  A seed that has been sown will not germinate until it finds sufficient heat, water, soil and air:  here we see the law of dependence.  Finally, no animal or plant, or even stone, is something homogeneous and single but is composed of various organs:  here we see the law of combination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prus holds that, over time, the multiplication of discoveries and inventions has improved the quality of people's lives and has expanded their knowledge.  "This gradual advance of civilized societies, this constant growth in knowledge of the objects that exist in nature, this constant increase in the number of tools and useful materials, is termed ''progress'', or the ''growth of civilization.''"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, Prus warns, "societies and people that do not make inventions or know how to use them, lead miserable lives and ultimately perish."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bolesław Prus]], ''On Discoveries and Inventions'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproducibility===
{{Main article|Reproducibility}}
A fundamental feature of the scientific enterprise is [[reproducibility]] of results.  "For decades", writes Shannon Palus, "it has been... an [[open secret]] that a [considerable part] of the literature in some fields is plain wrong."  This effectively sabotages the scientific enterprise and costs the world many billions of dollars annually in wasted resources.  Militating against reproducibility is scientists' reluctance to share techniques, for fear of forfeiting one's advantage to other scientists.  Also, [[scientific journal]]s and [[tenure]] committees tend to prize impressive new results rather than gradual advances that systematically build on existing literature.  Scientists who quietly fact-check others' work or spend extra time ensuring that their own [[Protocol (science)|protocol]]s are easy for other researchers to understand, gain little for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shannon Palus]], "Make Research Reproducible:  Better incentives could reduce the alarming number of studies that turn out to be wrong when repeated" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a view to improving reproducibility of scientific results, it has been suggested that research-funding agencies finance only projects that include a plan for making their work [[open research|transparent]].  In 2016 the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] introduced new application instructions and review questions to encourage scientists to improve reproducibility.  The NIH requests more information on how the study builds on previous work, and a list of variables that could affect the study, such as the sex of animal subjects—a previously overlooked factor that led many studies to describe phenomena found in male animals as universal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shannon Palus]], "Make Research Reproducible", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the questions that a funder can ask in advance could be asked by journals and reviewers.  One solution is "registered reports", a preregistration of studies whereby a scientist submits, for publication, research analysis and design plans before actually doing the study.  [[Peer review|Peer reviewers]] then evaluate the [[methodology]], and the journal promises to print the results, no matter what they are.  In order to prevent over-reliance on preregistered studies—which could encourage safer, less venturesome research, thus over-correcting the problem—the preregistered-studies model could be operated in tandem with the traditional results-focused model, which may sometimes be more friendly to [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shannon Palus]], "Make Research Reproducible", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery===
A 2016 ''[[Scientific American]]'' report highlights the role of ''rediscovery'' in science.  [[Indiana University Bloomington]] researchers combed through 22 million scientific papers published over the previous century and found dozens of "Sleeping Beauties"—studies that lay dormant for years before getting noticed.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"&gt;Amber Williams, "Sleeping Beauties of Science:  Some of the best research can slumber for years", ''[[Scientific American]], vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The top finds, which languished longest and later received the most intense attention from scientists, came from the fields of chemistry, physics, and statistics.  The dormant findings were wakened by scientists from other disciplines, such as [[medicine]], in search of fresh insights, and by the ability to test once-theoretical postulations.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;  Sleeping Beauties will likely become even more common in the future because of increasing accessibility of scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;  The ''[[Scientific American]]'' report lists the top 15 Sleeping Beauties:  7 in [[chemistry]], 5 in [[physics]], 2 in [[statistics]], and 1 in [[metallurgy]].&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;  Examples include:

[[Herbert Freundlich]]'s "Concerning Adsorption in Solutions" (1906), the first mathematical model of [[adsorption]], when [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s adhere to a surface.  Today both [[environmental remediation]] and [[decontamination]] in [[industry|industrial settings]] rely heavily on adsorption.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

''[[Physical Review]]'', vol. 47 (May 15, 1935), pp.&amp;nbsp;777–780.  This famous [[thought experiment]] in [[quantum physics]]—now known as the [[EPR paradox]], after the authors' surname initials—was discussed ''theoretically'' when it first came out.  It was not until the 1970s that [[physics]] had the experimental means to test [[quantum entanglement]].&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

Soc.'', 1951, 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–75, explains how to suspend [[gold nanoparticle]]s in liquid.  It owes its awakening to [[medicine]], which now employs gold nanoparticles to detect [[tumor]]s and deliver drugs.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

William S. Hummers and Richard E Offeman, "Preparation of Graphitic Oxide", ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'', vol. 80, no. 6 (March 20, 1958), p.&amp;nbsp;1339, introduced [[Hummers' Method]], a technique for making [[graphite oxide]].  Recent interest in [[graphene]]'s potential has brought the 1958 paper to attention.  Graphite oxide could serve as a reliable intermediate for the 2-D material.&lt;ref name="Amber Williams 2016 p. 80"/&gt;

===Multiple discovery===
{{Main article|Multiple discovery|List of multiple discoveries}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Robert K Merton.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Robert K. Merton]]]] --&gt;
Historians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence, in [[science]], of "[[multiple discovery|multiple independent discovery]]".  Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] defined such "multiples" as instances in which similar [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]] are made by scientists working independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert K. |last=Merton |title=Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science |journal=[[European Journal of Sociology]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=237–282 |year=1963 |doi=10.1017/S0003975600000801 }} Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton]], ''The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press,1973, pp. 371–82. [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226520714&amp;id=eprv7hMdO-IC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;q=multiples&amp;vq=multiples&amp;dq=Merton+multiples&amp;sig=U774PKmgujti7ktfBM2Z8tm2MDs]&lt;/ref&gt; "Sometimes the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so; sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which, unknown to him, somebody else has made years before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert K. |last=Merton |title=The Sociology of Science:  Theoretical and Empirical Investigations |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-226-52091-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merton's hypothesis is also discussed extensively in [[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States'', Free Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  Commonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and others;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Rupert |last=Hall |title=Philosophers at War: The Quarrel between Newton and Leibniz |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-521-22732-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th-century independent discovery of [[oxygen]] by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]], and others; and the 19th-century independent formulation of the [[theory of evolution]] of [[species]] by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Tori Reeve, ''[[Down House]]: the Home of [[Charles Darwin]]'', pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Merton contrasted a "multiple" with a "singleton" — a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], ''On Social Structure and Science'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the ''common'' pattern in science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert K. Merton]], "Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: a Chapter in the Sociology of Science," ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]'', 105: 470–86, 1961. Reprinted in [[Robert K. Merton]], ''The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1973, pp. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple discoveries in the history of science provide evidence for [[evolution]]ary models of science and technology, such as [[memetics]] (the study of self-replicating units of culture), [[evolutionary epistemology]] (which applies the concepts of [[biological evolution]] to study of the growth of human knowledge), and [[cultural selection theory]] (which studies sociological and cultural evolution in a Darwinian manner).  A [[recombinant DNA|recombinant-DNA]]-inspired "[[paradigm]] of paradigms", describing a mechanism of "recombinant conceptualization", predicates that a new [[concept]] arises through the crossing of pre-existing concepts and [[fact]]s.  This is what is meant when one says that a scientist, scholar, or artist has been "influenced by" another — [[etymology|etymologically]], that a concept of the latter's has "flowed into" the mind of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'': the [[Invention|Creation]] of a [[Historical Novel]]," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXIX, no. 1 (1994), pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of multiple independent discoveries and inventions can be viewed as a consequence of [[Bolesław Prus]]' three laws of gradualness, dependence, and combination (see "[[Logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|Discoveries and inventions]]", above).  The first two laws may, in turn, be seen as corollaries to the third law, since the laws of gradualness and dependence imply the impossibility of certain scientific or technological advances pending the availability of certain theories, facts, or technologies that must be combined to produce a given scientific or technological advance.

===Nonconformance===
{{Main article|Creativity}}
A practical question concerns the traits that enable some individuals to achieve extraordinary results in their fields of work – and how such [[creativity]] can be fostered.  [[Melissa Schilling]], a student of [[innovation]] strategy, has identified some traits shared by eight major innovators in [[natural science]] or [[technology]]:  [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–90), [[Thomas Edison]] (1847–1931), [[Nikola Tesla]] (1856–1943), [[Maria Skłodowska Curie]] (1867–1934), [[Dean Kamen]] (born 1951), [[Steve Jobs]] (1955–2011), [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955), and [[Elon Musk]] (born 1971).&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling chose innovators in natural science and technology rather than in other fields because she found much more consensus about important contributions to natural science and technology than, for example, to art or music.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  She further limited the set to individuals associated with ''multiple'' innovations.  "When an individual is associated with only a single major invention, it is much harder to know whether the invention was caused by the inventor's personal characteristics or by simply being at the right place at the right time."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight individuals were all extremely intelligent, but "that is not enough to make someone a serial breakthrough innovator."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly all these innovators showed very high levels of [[Emotional detachment|social detachment]], or separateness (a notable exception being Benjamin Franklin).&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Their isolation meant that they were less exposed to dominant ideas and norms, and their sense of not belonging meant that even when exposed to dominant ideas and norms, they were often less inclined to adopt them."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  From an early age, they had all shown extreme faith in their ability to overcome obstacles – what [[psychology]] calls "[[self-efficacy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Most [of them, writes Schilling] were driven by [[Ideal (ethics)|idealism]], a superordinate goal that was more important than their own comfort, reputation, or families.  Nikola Tesla wanted to free mankind from labor through unlimited free [[energy]] and to achieve international [[peace]] through global [[communication]].  Elon Musk wants to solve the world's energy problems and colonize [[Mars]].  Benjamin Franklin was seeking greater social harmony and productivity through the ideals of [[egalitarianism]], [[toleration|tolerance]], industriousness, temperance, and charity.  Marie Curie had been inspired by [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]]'s argument that [[Poland]], which was under Tsarist Russian rule, could be preserved only through the pursuit of education and technological advance by all Poles – ''including women''."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the innovators also worked hard and tirelessly because they found work extremely rewarding.  Some had an extremely high need for achievement.  Many also appeared to find work [[autotelic]] – rewarding for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  A surprisingly large portion of the breakthrough innovators have been [[autodidact]]s – self-taught persons – and excelled much more outside the classroom than inside.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Almost all breakthrough innovation," writes Schilling, "starts with an unusual idea or with beliefs that break with [[conventional wisdom]]....  However, creative ideas alone are almost never enough.  Many people have creative ideas, even brilliant ones.  But usually we lack the time, knowledge, money, or motivation to act on those ideas."  It is generally hard to get others' help in implementing original ideas because the ideas are often initially hard for others to understand and value.  Thus each of Schilling's breakthrough innovators showed ''extraordinary'' effort and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, writes Schilling, "being at the right place at the right time still matter[ed]."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa A. Schilling, ''Quirky:  The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World'', New York, Public Affairs, 2018, {{ISBN|9781610397926}}, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lichenology====
{{Main article|Lichenology}}
When Swiss botanist [[Simon Schwendener]] discovered in the 1860s that [[lichen]]s were a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] partnership between a [[fungus]] and an [[alga]], his finding at first met with resistance from the scientific community.  After his discovery that the fungus--which cannot make its own food--provides the lichen's structure, while the alga's contribution is its [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] production of food, it was found that in some lichens a [[cyanobacterium]] provides the food—and a handful of lichen species contain ''both'' an alga and a cyanobacterium, along with the fungus.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Gies, "The Meaning of Lichen:  How a self-taught naturalist unearthed hidden symbioses in the wilds of British Columbia—and helped to overturn 150 years of accepted scientific wisdom", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-taught naturalist, [[Trevor Goward]], has helped create a [[paradigm shift]] in the study of lichens and perhaps of all life-forms by doing something that people did in pre-scientific times:  going out into nature and closely observing.  His essays about lichens were largely ignored by most researchers because Goward has no scientific degrees and because some of his radical ideas are not supported by rigorous data.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Gies, "The Meaning of Lichen", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Goward told [[Toby Spribille]], who at the time lacked a high-school education, about some of his lichenological ideas, Goward recalls, "He said I was delusional."  Ultimately Spribille passed a high-school equivalency examination, obtained a Ph.D. in lichenology at the [[University of Graz]] in Austria, and became an assistant professor of the ecology and evolution of symbiosis at the [[University of Alberta]].  In July 2016 Spribille and his co-authors published a ground-breaking paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' revealing that many lichens contain a second fungus.  

Spribille credits Goward with having "a huge influence on my thinking.  [His essays] gave me license to think about lichens in [an unorthodox way] and freed me to see the patterns I worked out in ''[[Bryoria]]'' with my co-authors."  Even so, "one of the most difficult things was allowing myself to have an open mind to the idea that 150 years of literature may have entirely missed the theoretical possibility that there would be more than one fungal partner in the lichen symbiosis."  Spribille says that academia's emphasis on the canon of what others have established as important is inherently limiting.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Gies, "The Meaning of Lichen", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{Main article|Genius|Leadership}}
Contrary to previous studies indicating that higher [[intelligence]] makes for better [[leadership|leaders]] in various fields of endeavor, later research suggests that, at a certain point, a higher [[IQ]] can be viewed as harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decades ago, psychologist [[Dean Simonton]] suggested that brilliant leaders' words may go over people's heads, their solutions could be more complicated to implement, and followers might find it harder to relate to them.  At last, in the July 2017 ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'', he and two colleagues published the results of actual tests of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antonakis|first=John|last2=House|first2=Robert J.|last3=Simonton|first3=Dean Keith|date=2017|title=Can super smart leaders suffer from too much of a good thing?

Studied were 379 men and women business leaders in 30 countries, including the fields of banking, retail, and technology.  The managers took IQ tests--an imperfect but robust predictor of performance in many areas--and each was rated on leadership style and effectiveness by an average of 8 co-workers.  IQ correlated positively with ratings of leadership effectiveness, [[strategy]] formation, [[Foresight (psychology)|vision]], and several other characteristics—up to a point.  The ratings peaked at an IQ of about 120, which is higher than some 80% of office workers.  Beyond that, the ratings declined.  The researchers suggested that the ideal IQ could be higher or lower in various fields, depending on whether technical or [[social skills]] are more valued in a given work culture.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Psychologist Paul Sackett, not involved in the research, comments:  "To me, the right interpretation of the work would be that it highlights a need to understand what high-IQ leaders do that leads to lower perceptions by followers.  The wrong interpretation would be,'Don't hire high-IQ leaders.'"&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study's [[lead author]], psychologist [[John Antonakis]], suggests that leaders should use their intelligence to generate creative [[metaphor]]s that will persuade and inspire others.  "I think the only way a smart person can signal their intelligence appropriately and still connect with the people," says Antonakis, "is to speak in [[charismatic]] ways."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hutson, "Ineffective Geniuses?:  People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter, fourth Flatiron Institute division was inspired by a 2017 presentation to the Institute's leadership by [[John Grotzinger]], a "bio-geoscientist" from the [[California Institute of Technology]], who explained the challenges of climate modelling.  Grotzinger was a specialist in historical climate change—specifically, what had caused the great [[Permian extinction]], during which virtually all species died.  To properly assess this cataclysm, one had to understand both the rock record and the ocean's composition, but [[geology|geologists]] did not interact much with [[physical oceanography|physical oceanographers]].  Grotzinger's own best collaboration had resulted from a fortuitous lunch with an oceanographer.  Climate modelling was an intrinsically difficult problem made worse by [[academia]]'s structural divisions.  "If you had it all under one umbrella... it could result [much sooner] in a major breakthrough."  Simons and his team found Grotzinger's presentation compelling, and the Flatiron Institute decided to establish its fourth and final computational division.&lt;ref&gt;D.T.

===Mentoring===
{{Main article|Mentorship}}
Sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]], in her 1977 study of natural-science [[Nobel laureates]] in the United States, was struck by the fact that more than half (48) of the 92 laureates who did their prize-winning research in the U.S. by 1972 had worked either as students, postdoctorates, or junior collaborators under older Nobel laureates.  Furthermore, those 48 future laureates had worked under a total of 71 laureate masters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Zuckerman noted that many Nobel-quality scientists have never received a Nobel prize and never will, due to the limited number of such prizes available.  "These scientists, like the 'immortals' who happened not to have been included among the cohorts of forty in the [[French Academy]], may be said to occupy the 'forty-first chair' in science...  Scientists of the first rank who never won the Nobel prize include such giants as [[Dmitri Mendeleev|[Dmitri] Mendele[y]ev]] [1834–1907], whose [[Periodic Law]] and [[table of elements]] are known to every schoolchild, and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] [1839–1903], America's greatest scientist of the nineteenth century, who provided the foundations of modern [[chemical thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]].  They also include the [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] [[Oswald T. Avery]] [1877–1955], who laid the groundwork for explosive advances in modern [[molecular biology]], as well as all the [[mathematics|mathematicians]], [[astronomy|astronomers]], and [[earth sciences|earth]] and [[marine science|marine scientists]] of the first class who work in fields statutorily excluded from consideration for Nobel prizes."&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite 1977, p. 42"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social viscosity ensures that not every qualified novice scientist attains access to the most productive centers of scientific thought.  Nevertheless, writes Zuckerman, "To some extent, students of promise can choose masters with whom to work and masters can choose among the cohorts of students who present themselves for study.  This process of bilateral assortative selection is conspicuously at work among the ultra-elite of science.  Actual and prospective members of that elite select their scientist parents and therewith their scientist ancestors just as later they select their scientist progeny and therewith their scientist descendants."&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite 1977, p. 104"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerman writes:  "[T]he lines of elite apprentices to elite masters who had themselves been elite apprentices, and so on indefinitely, often reach far back into the [[history of science]], long before 1900, when [Alfred] Nobel's will inaugurated what now amounts to the International Academy of Sciences.  As an example of the many long historical chains of elite masters and apprentices, consider the German-born English laureate [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]] (1953), who traces his scientific lineage [...] back through his master, the 1931 laureate [[Otto Heinrich Warburg|Otto Warburg]].  Warburg had studied with [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fis[c]her]] [1852–1919], recipient of a prize in 1902 at the age of 50, three years before it was awarded [in 1905] to ''his'' teacher, [[Adolf von Baeyer]] [1835–1917], at age 70.  This lineage of four Nobel masters and apprentices has its own pre-Nobelian antecedents.  Von Baeyer had been the apprentice of [[August Kekule|F[riedrich] A[ugust] Kekulé]] [1829–96], whose ideas of [[structural formulae]] revolutionized [[organic chemistry]] and who is perhaps best known for the often retold story about his having hit upon the ring structure of [[benzene]] in a dream (1865).  Kekulé himself had been trained by the great [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] [[Justus von Liebig]] (1803–73), who had studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] with the master [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|J[oseph] L[ouis] Gay-Lussac]] (1778–1850), himself once apprenticed to [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] (1748–1822).  Among his many institutional and cognitive accomplishments, Berthollet helped found the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', served as science advisor to [[Napoleon]] in [[Egypt]], and, more significant for our purposes here, worked with [[Antoine Lavoisier|[Antoine] Lavoisier]] [1743–94] to revise the standard system of [[chemical nomenclature]]."&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite 1977, p. 105"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''Scientific Elite:  Nobel Laureates in the United States'', New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

====Big Science====
{{Main article|Big Science}}
What has been dubbed "[[Big Science]]" emerged from the United States' [[World War II]] [[Manhattan Project]] that produced the world's first [[nuclear weapons]]; and Big Science has since been associated with [[physics]], which requires massive [[particle accelerators]].  In [[biology]], Big Science debuted in 1990 with the [[Human Genome Project]] to sequence human [[DNA]].  In 2013 [[neuroscience]] became a Big Science domain when the U.S. announced a [[BRAIN Initiative]] and the [[European Union]] announced a [[Human Brain Project]].  Major new brain-research initiatives were also announced by Israel, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind: Two years in, a $1-billion-plus effort to simulate the human brain is in disarray. Was it poor management, or is something fundamentally wrong with [[Big Science]]?", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier successful Big Science projects had habituated politicians, [[mass media]], and the public to view Big Science programs with sometimes uncritical favor.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S.'s BRAIN Initiative was inspired by concern about the spread and cost of [[mental disorders]] and by excitement about new brain-manipulation technologies such as [[optogenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  After some early false starts, the U.S. [[National Institute of Mental Health]] let the country's brain scientists define the BRAIN Initiative, and this led to an ambitious interdisciplinary program to develop new technological tools to better monitor, measure, and simulate the brain.  Competition in research was ensured by the National Institute of Mental Health's [[peer review|peer-review process]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the [[European Commission]]'s Human Brain Project got off to a rockier start because political and economic considerations obscured questions concerning the feasibility of the Project's initial scientific program, based principally on [[computer modeling]] of [[neural circuit]]s.  Four years earlier, in 2009, fearing that the European Union would fall further behind the U.S. in computer and other technologies, the European Union had begun creating a competition for Big Science projects, and the initial program for the Human Brain Project seemed a good fit for a European program that might take a lead in advanced and emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only in 2015, after over 800 European neuroscientists threatened to boycott the European-wide collaboration, were changes introduced into the Human Brain Project, supplanting many of the original political and economic considerations with scientific ones.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Theil, "Trouble in Mind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
{{Main article|Funding of science}}
====Government funding====
{{Main article|Funding of science#Public funding}}
[[Nathan Myhrvold]], former [[Microsoft]] chief technology officer and founder of [[Microsoft Research]], argues that the funding of [[basic science]] cannot be left to the [[private sector]]—that "without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt."&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes that [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], published in 1915, did not spring full-blown from his brain in a eureka moment; he worked at it for years—finally driven to complete it by a rivalry with mathematician [[David Hilbert]].&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The history of almost any iconic scientific discovery or technological invention—the [[lightbulb]], the [[transistor]], [[DNA]], even the [[Internet]]—shows that the famous names credited with the breakthrough "were only a few steps ahead of a pack of competitors."  Some writers and elected officials have used this phenomenon of "[[list of multiple discoveries|parallel innovation]]" to argue against public financing of basic research:  government, they assert, should leave it to companies to finance the research they need.&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Myhrvold writes that such arguments are dangerously wrong:  without government support, most basic scientific research will never happen.  "This is most clearly true for the kind of pure research that has delivered... great intellectual benefits but no profits, such as the work that brought us the [[Higgs boson]], or the understanding that a supermassive [[black hole]] sits at the center of the [[Milky Way]], or the discovery of [[methane]] seas on the surface of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].  Company research laboratories used to do this kind of work:  experimental evidence for the [[big bang]] was discovered at [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[Bell Labs]], resulting in a [[Nobel Prize]].  Now those days are gone."&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in applied fields such as [[materials science]] and [[computer science]], writes Myhrvold, "companies now understand that basic research is a form of [[Charity (practice)|charity]]—so they avoid it."  Bell Labs scientists created the [[transistor]], but that invention earned billions for [[Intel]] and [[Microsoft]].  [[Xerox PARC]] engineers invented the modern [[graphical user interface]], but [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Microsoft profited most.  [[IBM]] researchers pioneered the use of giant [[magnetoresistance]] to boost [[hard-disk]] capacity but soon lost the disk-drive business to [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] and [[Western Digital]].&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Company researchers now have to focus narrowly on innovations that can quickly bring revenue; otherwise the research budget could not be justified to the company's investors.  "Those who believe profit-driven companies will altruistically pay for basic science that has wide-ranging benefits—but mostly to others and not for a generation—are naive....  If [[government]] were to leave it to the [[private sector]] to pay for [[basic research]], most [[science]] would come to a screeching halt.  What research survived would be done largely in secret, for fear of handing the next big thing to a rival."&lt;ref name="Needs a Benefactor 2016 p. 11"&gt;[[Nathan Myhrvold]], "Even Genius Needs a Benefactor:  Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private funding====
{{Main article|Funding of science#Private funding}}
A complementary perspective on the funding of scientific research is given by D.T. Max, writing about the [[Flatiron Institute]], a computational center set up in 2017 in [[Manhattan]] to provide scientists with mathematical assistance.  The Flatiron Institute was established by [[James Harris Simons]], a mathematician who had used mathematical [[algorithm]]s to make himself a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  The Institute has three computational divisions dedicated respectively to [[astrophysics]], [[biology]], and [[quantum physics]], and is working on a fourth division for [[climate model|climate modeling]] that will involve interfaces of [[geology]], [[oceanography]], [[atmospheric science]], [[biology]], and [[climatology]].&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flatiron Institute is part of a trend in the sciences toward privately-funded research.  In the United States, [[basic science]] has traditionally been financed by universities or the government, but private institutes are often faster and more focused.  Since the 1990s, when [[Silicon Valley]] began producing billionaires, private institutes have sprung up across the U.S.  In 1997 [[Larry Ellison]] launched the [[Ellison Medical Foundation]]  to study the biology of [[aging]].  In 2003 [[Paul Allen]] founded the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]].  In 2010 [[Eric Schmidt]] founded the [[Schmidt Ocean Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

These institutes have done much good, partly by providing alternatives to more rigid systems.  But [[private foundation]]s also have liabilities.  Wealthy benefactors tend to direct their funding toward their personal enthusiasms.  And foundations are not taxed; much of the money that supports them would otherwise have gone to the government.&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Max, "The Numbers King:  [[Algorithm]]s made [[James Harris Simons|Jim Simons]] a [[Wall Street]] billionaire.  His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 18 &amp; 25 December 2017, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding biases====
[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], of [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford University Medical School]], writes that "There is increasing evidence that some of the ways we conduct, evaluate, report and disseminate research are miserably ineffective.  A series of papers in 2014 in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]''... estimated that 85 percent of investment in [[biomedical research]] is wasted.  Many other disciplines have similar problems."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ioannidis identifies some science-funding biases that undermine the efficiency of the scientific enterprise, and proposes solutions:

Funding too few scientists:  "[M]ajor success [in scientific research] is largely the result of luck, as well as hard work.  The investigators currently enjoying huge funding are not necessarily genuine superstars; they may simply be the best connected."  Solutions:  "Use a [[lottery]] to decide which [[grant application]]s to fund (perhaps after they pass a basic review).... Shift... funds from senior people to younger researchers..."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

No reward for [[Open research|transparency]]:  "Many scientific protocols, analysis methods, computational processes and data are opaque.  [M]any top findings cannot be [[Reproducibility|reproduced]].  That is the case for two out of three top psychology papers, one out of three top papers in experimental economics and more than 75 percent of top papers identifying new cancer drug targets.  [S]cientists are not rewarded for sharing their techniques."  Solutions:  "Create better infrastructure for enabling transparency, openness and sharing.  Make transparency a prerequisite for funding.  [P]referentially hire, promote or tenure... champions of transparency."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

No encouragement for [[Reproducibility|replication]]:  Replication is indispensable to the [[scientific method]].  Yet, under pressure to produce new [[Discovery (observation)|discoveries]], researchers tend to have little incentive, and much counterincentive, to try replicating results of previous studies.  Solutions:  "Funding agencies must pay for replication studies.  Scientists' advancement should be based not only on their discoveries but also on their replication track record."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

No funding for young scientists:  "[[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] made their top contributions in their mid-20s."  But the average age of biomedical scientists receiving their first substantial grant is 46.  The average age for a full professor in the U.S. is 55.  Solutions:  "A larger proportion of funding should be earmarked for young investigators.  Universities should try to shift the aging distribution of their faculty by hiring more young investigators."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biased funding sources:  "Most funding for [[research and development]] in the U.S. comes not from the government but from private, for-profit sources, raising unavoidable [[conflicts of interest]] and pressure to deliver results favorable to the sponsor."  Solutions:  "Restrict or even ban funding that has overt conflicts of interest.  [[Scientific journal|Journals]] should not accept research with such conflicts.  For less conspicuous conflicts, at a minimum ensure transparent and thorough disclosure."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding the wrong fields:  "Well-funded fields attract more scientists to work for them, which increases their lobbying reach, fueling a [[vicious circle]].  Some entrenched fields absorb enormous funding even though they have clearly demonstrated limited yield or uncorrectable flaws."  Solutions:  "Independent, impartial assessment of output is necessary for lavishly funded fields.  More funds should be earmarked for new fields and fields that are high risk.  Researchers should be encouraged to switch fields, whereas currently they are incentivized to focus in one area."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not spending enough:  The U.S. military budget ($886 billion) is 24 times the budget of the [[National Institutes of Health]] ($37 billion).  "Investment in science benefits society at large, yet attempts to convince the public often make matters worse when otherwise well-intentioned science leaders promise the impossible, such as promptly eliminating all cancer or [[Alzheimer's disease]]."  Solutions:  "We need to communicate how science funding is used by making the process of science clearer, including the number of scientists it takes to make major accomplishments.... We would also make a more convincing case for science if we could show that we do work hard on improving how we run it."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rewarding big spenders:  "Hiring, promotion and [[tenure]] decisions primarily rest on a researcher's ability to secure high levels of funding.  But the expense of a project does not necessarily correlate with its importance.  Such reward structures select mostly for politically savvy managers who know how to absorb money."  Solutions:  "We should reward scientists for high-quality work, reproducibility and social value rather than for securing funding.  Excellent research can be done with little to no funding other than protected time.  Institutions should provide this time and respect scientists who can do great work without wasting tons of money."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

No funding for high-risk ideas:  "The pressure that taxpayer money be 'well spent' leads government funders to back projects most likely to pay off with a positive result, even if riskier projects might lead to more important, but less assured, advances.  Industry also avoids investing in high-risk projects...  [[Innovation]] is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict..."  Solutions:  "Fund excellent scientists rather than projects and give them freedom to pursue research avenues as they see fit.  Some institutions such as [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] already use this model with success."  It must be communicated to the public and to policy-makers that science is a cumulative investment, that no one can know in advance which projects will succeed, and that success must be judged on the total agenda, not on a single experiment or result.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of good data:  "There is relatively limited evidence about which scientific practices work best.  We need more research on research ('[[meta-research]]') to understand how to best perform, evaluate, review, disseminate and reward science."  Solutions:  "We should invest in studying how to get the best science and how to choose and reward the best scientists."&lt;ref&gt;[[John P.A. Ioannidis]], "Rethink Funding:  The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual bias===
{{Main article|Women in science|Matilda effect}}
Claire Pomeroy, president of the [[Lasker Foundation]], which is dedicated to advancing [[medical research]], points out that [[woman scientist|women scientists]] continue to be subjected to [[discrimination]] in professional advancement.&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the percentage of doctorates awarded to women in [[life sciences]] in the United States increased from 15 to 52 percent between 1969 and 2009, only a third of assistant professors  and less than a fifth of full professors in biology-related fields in 2009 were women.  Women make up only 15 percent of permanent department chairs in [[medical school]]s and barely 16 percent of medical-school deans.&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The problem is a culture of unconscious [[bias]] that leaves many women feeling demoralized and marginalized.  In one study, science faculty were given identical [[résumé]]s in which the names and genders of two applicants were interchanged; both male ''and'' female faculty judged the male applicant to be more competent and offered him a higher salary.&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unconscious bias also appears as "microassaults" against [[woman scientist|women scientist]]s:  purportedly insignificant [[sexism|sexist]] jokes and insults that accumulate over the years and undermine confidence and ambition.  Writes Claire Pomeroy:  "Each time it is assumed that the only woman in the lab group will play the role of recording secretary, each time a research plan becomes finalized in the men's lavatory between conference sessions, each time a woman is not invited to go out for a beer after the plenary lecture to talk shop, the damage is reinforced."&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

"When I speak to groups of women scientists," writes Pomeroy, "I often ask them if they have ever been in a meeting where they made a recommendation, had it ignored, and then heard a man receive praise and support for making the same point a few minutes later.  Each time the majority of women in the audience raise their hands.  Microassaults are especially damaging when they come from a [[high school|high-school]] science teacher, college [[mentor]], university dean or a member of the scientific elite who has been awarded a prestigious prize—the very people who should be inspiring and supporting the next generation of scientists."&lt;ref name="Claire Pomeroy 2016 p. 11"&gt;Claire Pomeroy, "Academia's Gender Problem", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main article|Sexual harassment}}
[[Sexual harassment]] is more prevalent in [[academia]] than in any other social sector except the [[military]].  A June 2018 report by the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] states that sexual harassment hurts individuals, diminishes the pool of scientific talent, and ultimately damages the integrity of science.&lt;ref&gt;Clara Moskowitz, "End Harassment:  A leader of a major report on sexual misconduct explains how to make science accessible to everyone" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Johnson]], co-chair of the committee that drew up the report, describes some measures for preventing sexual harassment in science.  One would be to replace trainees' individual [[mentoring]] with group mentoring, and to uncouple the mentoring relationship from the trainee's financial dependence on the mentor.  Another way would be to prohibit the use of [[confidentiality agreement]]s in connection with harassment cases.&lt;ref&gt;Clara Moskowitz, "End Harassment:  A leader of a major report on sexual misconduct explains how to make science accessible to everyone" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel approach to the reporting of sexual harassment, dubbed ''Callisto'', that has been adopted by some institutions of higher education, lets aggrieved persons record experiences of sexual harassment, date-stamped, without actually formally reporting them.  This program lets people see if others have recorded experiences of harassment from the same individual, and share information anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Clara Moskowitz, "End Harassment:  A leader of a major report on sexual misconduct explains how to make science accessible to everyone" (State of the World's Science, 2018), ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deterrent stereotypes===
[[Psychologist]] Andrei Cimpian and [[philosophy]] professor [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]] have proposed a theory to explain why American women and [[African-American]]s are often subtly deterred from seeking to enter certain academic fields by a misplaced emphasis on [[genius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 60–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cimpian and Leslie had noticed that their respective fields are similar in their substance but hold different views on what is important for success.  Much more than psychologists, philosophers value a certain ''kind of person'':  the "brilliant superstar" with an exceptional mind.  Psychologists are more likely to believe that the leading lights in psychology grew to achieve their positions through hard work and experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, women accounted for less than 30% of doctorates granted in philosophy; African-Americans made up only 1% of philosophy Ph.D.s.  Psychology, on the other hand, has been successful in attracting women (72% of 2015 psychology Ph.D.s) and African-Americans (6% of psychology Ph.D.s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early insight into these disparities was provided to Cimpian and Leslie by the work of psychologist [[Carol Dweck]].  She and her colleagues had shown that a person's beliefs about [[Aptitude|ability]] matter a great deal for that person's ultimate success.  A person who sees talent as a stable trait is motivated to "show off this aptitude" and to avoid making [[Error|mistake]]s.  By contrast, a person who adopts a "growth [[mindset]]" sees his or her current capacity as a work in progress:  for such a person, mistakes are not an indictment but a valuable signal highlighting which of their skills are in need of work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cimpian and Leslie and their collaborators tested the hypothesis that attitudes, about "genius" and about the unacceptability of making mistakes, within various academic fields may account for the relative attractiveness of those fields for American women and African-Americans.  They did so by contacting academic professionals from a wide range of disciplines and asking them whether they thought that some form of exceptional intellectual talent was required for success in their field.  The answers received from almost 2,000 academics in 30 fields matched the distribution of Ph.D.s in the way that Cimpian and Leslie had expected:  fields that placed more value on brilliance also conferred fewer Ph.D.s on women and African-Americans.  The proportion of women and African-American Ph.D.s in psychology, for example, was higher than the parallel proportions for philosophy, mathematics, or physics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigation showed that non-academics share similar ideas of which fields require brilliance.  Exposure to these ideas at home or school could discourage young members of [[stereotype]]d groups from pursuing certain careers, such as those in the natural sciences or engineering.  To explore this, Cimpian and Leslie asked hundreds of five-, six-, and seven-year-old boys and girls questions that measured whether they associated being "really, really smart" (i.e., "brilliant") with their sex.  The results, published in January 2017 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', were consistent with scientific literature on the early acquisition of sex stereotypes.  Five-year-old boys and girls showed no difference in their self-assessment; but by age six, girls were less likely to think that girls are "really, really smart."  The authors next introduced another group of five-, six-, and seven-year-olds to unfamiliar gamelike activities that the authors described as being "for children who are really, really smart."  Comparison of boys' and girls' interest in these activities at each age showed no sex difference at age five but significantly greater interest from boys at ages six and seven—exactly the ages when stereotypes emerge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cimpian and Leslie conclude that,  "Given current societal stereotypes, messages that portray [genius or brilliance] as singularly necessary [for academic success] may needlessly discourage talented members of stereotyped groups."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Cimpian]] and [[Sarah-Jane Leslie]], "The Brilliance Trap", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic snobbery&lt;!--'Sagan effect' redirects here--&gt;===
{{Main article|Snobbery}}
Largely as a result of his growing popularity, astronomer and science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]], creator of the 1980 [[PBS]] TV ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' series, came to be ridiculed by scientist peers and failed to receive tenure at [[Harvard University]] in the 1960s and membership in the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in the 1990s.  The [[eponym]]ous "Sagan effect" persists:  as a group, scientists still discourage individual investigators from engaging with the public unless they are already well-established senior researchers.&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 65"&gt;[[Susana Martinez-Conde]], Devin Powell and [[Stephen L. Macknik]], "The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Editors, "Go Public or Perish:  When universities discourage scientists from speaking out, society suffers", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 2 (February 2018), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of the Sagan effect deprives society of the full range of expertise needed to make informed decisions about complex questions, including [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], and [[energy]] alternatives.  Fewer scientific voices mean fewer arguments to counter [[antiscience]] or [[pseudoscientific]] discussion.  The Sagan effect also creates the false impression that science is the domain of older white men (who dominate the senior ranks), thereby tending to discourage women and minorities from considering science careers.&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 65"/&gt;

A number of factors contribute to the Sagan effect's durability.  At the height of the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 17th century, many researchers emulated the example of [[Isaac Newton]], who dedicated himself to physics and mathematics and never married.  These scientists were viewed as pure seekers of truth who were not distracted by more mundane concerns.  Similarly, today anything that takes scientists away from their research, such as having a hobby or taking part in public debates, can undermine their credibility as researchers.&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 66"&gt;[[Susana Martinez-Conde]], Devin Powell and [[Stephen L. Macknik]], "The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more prosaic factor in the Sagan effect's persistence may be professional [[jealousy]].&lt;ref name="Stephen L 2016 p. 66"/&gt;

However, there appear to be some signs that engaging with the rest of society is becoming less hazardous to a career in science.  So many people have social-media accounts now that becoming a public figure is not as unusual for scientists as previously.  Moreover, as traditional funding sources stagnate, going public sometimes leads to new, unconventional funding streams.  A few institutions such as [[Emory University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] may have begun to appreciate outreach as an area of academic activity, in addition to the traditional roles of research, teaching, and administration.  Exceptional among federal funding agencies, the [[National Science Foundation]] now officially favors popularization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susana Martinez-Conde]], Devin Powell and [[Stephen L. Macknik]], "The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Editors, "Go Public or Perish:  When universities discourage scientists from speaking out, society suffers", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 318, no. 2 (February 2018), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Message design logic''' is a [[communication theory]] that makes the claim that individuals possess implicit theories of communication within themselves, called message design logics.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Edwards, A. P., Rose, L. M., Edwards, C., &amp; Singer, L. M. (2008). An Investigation of the Relationships among Implicit Personal Theories of Communication, Social Support and Loneliness. Human Communication, 11(4), 445-461.
&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as a “theory of theories,” Message Design Logic offers three different fundamental premises in reasoning about [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart, J. (2002). Cultural Assumptions Underlying Message Design Logic: Premises of Development, Preference, and Understanding. Intercultural Communication Studies, XI(4), 109-120.&lt;/ref&gt; As author Barbara O’Keefe describes, Message Design Logic is “the kind of communication-constituting belief system the message producer relies on in reasoning from the goals sought to the message design used.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988"&gt;O'Keefe, B. J. (1988). The Logic of Message Design: Individual Differences in Reasoning about Communication. Communication Monographs, 55(1), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; These three premises — Expressive Logic, Conventional Logic, and Rhetorical Logic — are [[belief systems]] that communicators might utilize when designing [[messages]]. The message design logics, therefore, represent “internally consistent and developmentally ordered stages in the acquisition of working knowledge about the systematic properties of verbal messages.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As O’Keefe describes further, each premise is “associated with a constellation of related beliefs: a communication-constituting concept, a conception of the functional possibilities of communication, unit formation procedures, and principles of coherence.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; The underlying idea behind O’Keefe’s work is that “communication is not necessarily a uniform process.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

== Components ==
The three components of Message Design Logic are based on "individuals’ levels of cognitive complexity," and are expressed in messages that vary in organization, content, and effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Whether these components represent different levels of communication effectiveness is labeled as debatable by other communication scholars.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, L., &amp; Albrecht, T. L. (1996). Message design logic, social support, and mixed-status relationships. Western Journal of Communication, 60(4), 291-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expressive design logic ===
Seen as the simplest form of message production, the fundamental premise of Expressive Design Logic is that  “Language is a [[Media (communication)|medium]] for expressing thoughts and feelings.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; This premise is the simplest of the three logics and explains that someone says what they feel. As long as this feeling is conveyed in the message, the message is deemed successful. O’Keefe gives two reasons why individuals who operate under this design logic are very literal when it comes to impression in message design and interpretation. “First, they fail to appreciate that in communication, the process of [[expression (language)|expression]] can be made to serve other goals, and second, they interpret messages as independent units rather than as threads in an interaction fabric.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Individuals that communicate expressively do not recognize the idea that messages might be designed to induce particular reactions by the receiver. They believe that messages are taken straightforwardly by a receiver who has thoughts, feelings, or reactions that are to be communicated back to the sender. Through this idea there are only two possible relationships that can be held between the speaker's intentions and messages; 1) To fully and honestly express the speaker’s current mental state. 2) To convey a distorted version of the speaker’s mental state though editing or lying. Due to the extreme straightforwardness of expressive messages they may contain multiple facets that can be viewed as negative when discussing communicative effectiveness, such as pointless content (excessive knowledge of what the speaker feels or wants), [[redundancy (linguistics)|redundancies]] (due to a thought being recycled), noncontingent threats or [[insults]] (simple announcements of punishments), or inoffensive but inappropriate comments (complimentary personal remarks inappropriately delivered).&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Ultimately, individuals using Expressive Design Logic believe that the element that unites a speaker’s messages is simply what is on the speaker’s mind, whether they are items of information from one encounter or items from a complex chain of associations.

=== Conventional design logic ===
The fundamental premise of Conventional Design Logic is that “communication is a game played cooperatively, according to socially conventional rules and procedures.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As opposed to the expressive design logic, the communicator using conventional design logic distinguishes between thought and expression.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; In this design logic, language is viewed as [[Instrumental value|means]] of expressing propositions that are “specified by the social effect one wants to achieve.” &lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991"&gt;O’Keefe, B. J. (1991). Message design logic and the management of multiple goals. In K.
Tracy (Ed.), Understanding face-to-face interaction: Issues linking goals and
discourse (pp. 101-117). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who practice conventional design logic consider various contexts as having fixed parameters and therefore design messages based upon what is most appropriate to the context.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991" /&gt; This message designing is done under the format of [[cooperation]] between the speaker and hearer. Using this logic is particularly valuable to achieve particular goals. Communication then is the means by which the goals are achieved. For example, someone constructing a conventional message would relate the message most to the context (the particular situation at hand) in order to achieve certain goals.

=== Rhetorical design logic ===
Seen as the most elaborate way of constructing messages, the fundamental premise of Rhetorical Design Logic is that “communication is the creation and negotiation of social selves and situations.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; For communicators using this logic, messages are designed to portray what the speaker wants reality to reflect.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1991" /&gt; Under this belief system, O’Keefe explains that “all meaning is treated as a matter of dramaturgical enactment and social negotiation.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; As opposed to the conventional design logic, which says to design messages relevant to the given context, rhetorical design logic seeks to create the context using the designed messages. This creating of the context is accomplished using [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[negotiation]]. For coordination, rhetorical design seeks to repeatedly solve coordination problems in order to create the social reality.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; For negotiation, communication operates under the presumption that it can “strategically exploit” meaning. Rhetorical message producers always “seek to achieve consensus and social legitimation for the reality they speak,” thus having the possibility of negotiation always available.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Their messages are proactive rather than reactive, so they are designed towards effects rather than in response to the actions of others.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Rhetorical messages also normally contain “elaborating and contextualizing clauses and phrases that provide explicit definitions of the context.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt; Lastly, O’Keefe summarizes the internal coherence of rhetorical designed messages as deriving from “the elements being related by intersubjectively available, goal-oriented schemes.”&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

== Verification and other uses ==

Many other scholars have verified and used O’Keefe’s work for their own research . For example, Peterson and Albrecht uses Message Design Logic to posit the relationship between superiors’ and subordinates’ message design logic types.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; Likewise, another study done explored the relationships among individuals’ message design logics and their levels of social well-being.&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; Dr. Gwen Hullman used Message Design Logic to help in the study of perceptions of communication [[Skill|competence]]. The conclusion of her research in relation to message design was that, “speakers of rhetorical regulative messages were perceived as more effective, more appropriate, and were rated as more competent.”&lt;ref&gt;Hullman, G. A. (2004). Interpersonal Communication Motives and Message Design Logic:
Exploring Their Interaction on Perceptions of Competence. Communication Monographs, 71(2), 208-225.
&lt;/ref&gt; These findings reflect the ideas O’Keefe stated in her original work in that rhetorical speakers can better align their goals with their partner's goals.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe 1988" /&gt;

O’Keefe’s Message Design Logic has also been used in a study done in 2005 by Carmen Cortes, Chad Larson, and Dale Hample. Their study was designed to see if the difference in interpersonal construct differentiation reflected the sophistication with which they designed their messages.&lt;ref name="Cortes"&gt;Cortes, C., Larson, C., &amp; Hample, D. (2005). Relations Among Message Design Logic, Interpersonal Construct Differentiation, and Sex for Mexican and US Nationals. Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, 34(1/2), 108-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Dr. Hullman’s study, this article resulted as O’Keefe had predicted in her 1988 study, in which O’Keefe said that people who are more differentiated also tend to employ more sophisticated logics in a challenging situation.&lt;ref name="Cortes" /&gt; What Cortes, Larson, and Hample found is that “differentiation reflects the sophistication with which a person perceives others, and a Message Design Logic is a knowledge structure regarding communication.” &lt;ref name="Cortes" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===

While critics of this theory are hard to find, Joy Hart of Louisville University reviews and examines O’Keefe’s work, including a full critique of assumptions she believes are being made. Hart claims that O’Keefe “assumes a developmental continuum for communication skill.”  &lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; She examines the assumption that individuals may progress to the rhetorical message design logic, which is the highest level of development. She critiques this assumption as it is seen through cultural and intercultural differences. A specific assumption which Hart criticizes is the proposition that if a person is surrounded by a social environment or culture in which negotiation is possible, then that person will proceed more quickly to the rhetorical message design logic.&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;

[[File:Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, with President Franklin D Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill during the Quebec Conference, 18 August 1943. H32129.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]] with U. S. President [[Franklin D Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] during the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]], 18 August 1943, at which the mechanism for cooperation on [[Tube Alloys]] was agreed upon]]
The '''Montreal Laboratory''' in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, was established by the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] of Canada during [[World War II]] to undertake [[nuclear technology|nuclear research]] in collaboration with the [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], and to absorb some of the scientists and work of the [[Tube Alloys]] nuclear project in Britain. It became part of the [[Manhattan Project]], and designed and built some of the world's first [[nuclear reactor]]s.

After the [[Fall of France]], some French scientists escaped to Britain with their stock of [[heavy water]]. They were temporarily installed in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where they worked on reactor design. The [[MAUD Committee]] was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an [[atomic bomb]], although there remained a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed [[plutonium]], which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.

The Canadian government agreed to the proposal, and the Montreal Laboratory was established in a house belonging to [[McGill University]]; it moved to permanent accommodation at the [[Université de Montréal]] in March 1943. The first eight laboratory staff arrived in Montreal at the end of 1942. These were [[Bertrand Goldschmidt]] and [[Pierre Auger]] from France, [[George Placzek]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, [[Friedrich Paneth]] and [[Hans von Halban]] from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The Canadian contingent included [[George Volkoff]], [[Bernice Weldon Sargent]] and [[George Laurence]], and promising young Canadian scientists such as [[J. Carson Mark]], [[P. R. Wallace|Phil Wallace]] and [[Leo Yaffe]].

Although Canada was a major source of [[uranium ore]] and heavy water, these were controlled by the Americans. Anglo-American cooperation broke down, denying the Montreal Laboratory scientists access to the materials they needed to build a reactor. In 1943, the [[Quebec Agreement]] merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. The Americans agreed to help build the reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects left, and [[John Cockcroft]] became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. The [[Chalk River Laboratories]] opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. Two reactors were built at Chalk River. The small [[ZEEP]] went critical on 5 September 1945, and the larger [[NRX]] on 21 July 1947. NRX was for a time the most powerful [[research reactor]] in the world.

==Early nuclear research in Canada==
[[File:C.D. Howe, wartime.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Head and shoulders of a man in a suit and tie|[[C. D. Howe]], [[Minister of Munitions and Supply]]]]
Canada has a long history of involvement with nuclear research, dating back to the pioneering work of [[Ernest Rutherford]] at [[McGill University]] in 1899.&lt;ref name="Canada's role"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.cns-snc.ca//media/history/1945Aug13PressReleasePart1.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2016 |title=Canada's Role in Atomic Bomb Drama |author=Department of Reconstruction |date=13 August 1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, [[George Laurence]] of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC) began experiments in [[Ottawa]] to measure [[neutron capture]] and [[nuclear fission]] in [[uranium]] to demonstrate the feasibility of a [[nuclear reactor]]. For that purpose, he obtained {{convert|450|kg}} of [[uranium dioxide]] in paper bags from the [[Eldorado Mine (Northwest Territories)|Eldorado Mine]] at [[Port Radium]] in the [[Northwest Territories]]. For a [[neutron moderator]], he used [[carbon]] in the form of [[petroleum coke]]. This was placed with the bags of uranium oxide in a large wooden bin lined with [[paraffin wax]], another neutron moderator. A neutron source was added, and a [[Geiger counter]] used to measure [[radioactivity]].&lt;ref name="Early Years"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ieee.ca/millennium/nuclear_power/NuclEnerg.PDF |title=Early Years of Nuclear Energy Research in Canada |first=George C. |last=Laurence |authorlink=George C. Laurence  |publisher=IEEE Canada |accessdate=19 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiments continued in 1942, but were ultimately unsuccessful; the problems posed by impurities in the coke and uranium oxide had not been fully appreciated, and as a result too many neutrons were captured. But Laurence's efforts attracted some attention, and in the summer of 1940 he was visited by [[Ralph H. Fowler|R. H. Fowler]],&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; the British scientific liaison officer in Canada.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=33}} This was followed by a visit from [[John Cockcroft]] of the British [[Tizard Mission]] to the United States in the autumn. They brought news of the similar research being carried out under the supervision of the [[MAUD Committee]] in Britain and the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) in the United States.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt;{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=64–65}}

Fowler became the channel of communication between the NDRC and its counterparts in Britain and Canada.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=257}} Through him, Laurence obtained an introduction to [[Lyman J. Briggs]], the chairman of the NDRC's [[S-1 Uranium Committee]], who supplied copies of American studies.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt;{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=64–65}} On returning to England, Cockcroft arranged through [[Henry Mond, 2nd Baron Melchett|Lord Melchett]] for Laurence to receive a $5,000 grant to continue his research. This payment was made by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) through a Canadian subsidiary. It had the desired side effect of impressing the Canadian authorities with the importance of Laurence's work.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=67}}

==French connection==
Laurence had chosen to use carbon instead of [[heavy water]] because it was cheaper and more readily available.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; A team of scientists in France that included [[Hans von Halban]], [[Lew Kowarski]], and [[Francis Perrin]] had been conducting similar experiments since 1939. By 1940, they had decided to use heavy water as a moderator, and through the French [[Minister of Armaments (France)|Minister of Armaments]] obtained about {{convert|185|kg}} from the [[Norsk Hydro]] hydroelectric station at [[Vemork]] in Norway. After the [[Fall of France]], they had escaped to Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily installed in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] but, believing that Britain would soon fall as well, were eager to relocate to the United States or Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=49–51}}&lt;ref name="The Role of the French Scientists"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cns-snc.ca/media/history/fifty_years/goldschmidt.html |title=How it All Began in Canada – The Role of the French Scientists |first=Bertrand |last=Goldschmidt |authorlink=Bertrand Goldschmidt |publisher=[[Canadian Nuclear Society]] |accessdate=6 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada was an alternative source of heavy water. [[Cominco]] had been involved in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in [[Trail, British Columbia]]. On 26 February 1941, the NRC inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July by a letter from [[Hugh Stott Taylor|Hugh Taylor]], a British-born scientist working at [[Princeton University]], on behalf of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD). Taylor offered a NDRC contract to produce {{convert|2000|lb}}, for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 per pound.&lt;ref name="Cominco" /&gt;

Cominco's president, [[Selwyn G. Blaylock]], was cautious. There might be no post-war demand for heavy water, and the [[patent]] on the process was held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a profit-sharing agreement would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 for plant modifications.&lt;ref name="Cominco"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cominco and the Manhattan Project |first=C. D. |last=Andrews |pp=51–62|journal=BC Studies |issn=0005-2949 |issue=11 |date=Fall 1971 |url=http://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/bcstudies/article/viewFile/710/756 |accessdate=21 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2044704}}&lt;/ref&gt; There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock had a meeting with the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided to find another source of heavy water. Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir [[Edward Wentworth Beatty|Edward Beatty]]. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The heavy water project became known as the [[P-9 Project]] in October 1942.&lt;ref name="Cominco" /&gt;

The French scientists made good progress on the design of an [[aqueous homogeneous reactor]], but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British [[Tube Alloys]] project, that of building an [[atomic bomb]], and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed [[plutonium]], but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=71–75}} The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. It made sense to pool resources, and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as [[Henry D. Smyth]], Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=134–135}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/03/05/70-years-ago-vannevar-bush-worries-about-french-patents/ |title=70 years ago: Vannevar Bush worries about French Patents |publisher=Restricted Data |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=5 March 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using [[deuterium]] as a neutron moderator. There were also two patent applications in conjunction with [[Egon Bretscher]] and [[Norman Feather]] on the production and use of plutonium.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=74–75}} [[George Paget Thomson|George Thomson]], the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=134–135}}

==Establishment==
The next step was to broach the matter with the Canadians. The [[Lord President of the Council|Lord President]], Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], as the [[Minister (government)|minister]] responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] to Canada, [[Malcolm MacDonald]], who had been involved in Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding [[Eldorado Mining and Refining|Eldorado]]'s uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in [[Port Hope, Ontario]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=187–188}} On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with [[Jack Mackenzie|C. J. Mackenzie]], the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see [[C. D. Howe]], the [[Minister of Munitions and Supply]].&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt;

[[File:Montreal Group.jpg|thumb|left|Montreal Laboratory staff in 1944]]
Howe cabled Anderson expressing the Canadian government's agreement in principle, but requesting a more detailed appraisal of the cost of the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=187–188}}

The Canadians decided that the new laboratory should be located in Montreal, where housing accommodation was easier to find than in wartime Ottawa. They hoped to have everything ready by 1 January 1943, but negotiations for laboratory space fell through.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=190}} A search then commenced for an alternative location. [[Bertrand Goldschmidt]], a French scientist who was already in Canada, ran into [[Henri Laugier]], a French biologist who had been president of the ''[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]'' before the Fall of France, when he had escaped to Canada. Laugier suggested that they acquire some unused wings of a new building at the [[Université de Montréal]], where he was now teaching. These had been earmarked for a medical school, but had never been equipped due to a lack of funds.&lt;ref name="The Role of the French Scientists" /&gt; The {{convert|200|m2|adj=on}} space was acquired, but considerable work was required to convert it into a laboratory, and it could not be made ready before mid-February 1943.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=190}} [[Ernest Cormier]], the university architect, drew up the plans.&lt;ref name="The Role of the French Scientists" /&gt;

The first eight staff arrived in Montreal at the end of 1942. These were Goldschmidt and [[Pierre Auger]] from France, [[George Placzek]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, [[Friedrich Paneth]] and Halban from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was still raging, and men and equipment, which travelled separately, were at risk from German [[U-boat]]s. The scientists occupied a house at 3470 Simpson Street in downtown Montreal that belonged to McGill University.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; This soon became so crowded that bathrooms were used for offices, with the bath tubs used to store papers and books.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=190}} They were relieved to move to the more spacious accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=190}} The laboratory grew to over 300 staff, about half of whom were Canadians recruited by Laurence.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt;

Placzek became head of the theoretical physics division. Kowarski was designated to be the head of the experimental physics division, but there was a personality clash with Halban, and Kowarski did not wish to accept what he saw as a subordinate position under Halban. At this point, many other scientists said that they would not go without Kowarski, but Sir [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]], the [[permanent secretary]] of the British [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]], of which the Tube Alloys was a part, managed to persuade them to go. Kowarski remained at Cambridge, where he worked for [[James Chadwick]]. Auger became head of the experimental physics division instead.&lt;ref name="The Role of the French Scientists" /&gt;{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=191}} Paneth became head of the chemistry division. Two other scientists that had escaped from France joined the laboratory: the French chemist [[Jules Guéron]], who had been working for [[Free France]] at Cambridge,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=190}} and [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], an Italian scientist who had worked with [[Enrico Fermi]] in Italy before the war.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=128–129}}

For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out to recruit some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada. The first was [[George Volkoff]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], who had worked with [[Robert Oppenheimer]] on the physics of [[neutron star]]s. They also tried to recruit [[Harry Thode]] from [[McMaster University]], but found that Harold Urey from the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[SAM Laboratories]] was also interested in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with [[mass spectrography]], and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including [[J. Carson Mark]], [[P. R. Wallace|Phil Wallace]] and [[Leo Yaffe]].&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt;{{sfn|Avery|1998|pp=183–184}}

==Research==
[[File:ZEEP1945.jpg|thumb|right|[[ZEEP]] building at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] c. 1945]]
The Montreal Laboratory investigated multiple avenues of reactor development. One was a homogeneous reactor, in which a uranium compound was dissolved in heavy water to form a [[slurry]], or a "mayonnaise" as the Montreal team called it. This offered various advantages for cooling, control and the ability to draw off plutonium that was produced. Paneth, Goldschmidt and others experimented with methods of preparing such a uranium compound, but none could be found with the required density. They considered using [[enriched uranium]], but it was unavailable. Attention then turned to a heterogeneous reactor, in which a lattice of uranium metal rods were immersed in heavy water. While much less heavy water would be required, there was a danger that the water would decompose into deuterium and oxygen—a potentially explosive combination. There was great interest in [[breeder reactor]]s, which could breed plutonium from uranium or [[uranium-233]] from [[thorium]], as it was believed that uranium was scarce. A process was devised for separating the uranium from thorium.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt;

To build a working nuclear reactor, the Montreal Laboratory depended on the Americans for heavy water from Trail, which was under American contract, but this was not forthcoming. An American request for Halban to come to New York to discuss heavy water with Fermi and Urey was turned down by the British, and the Americans brought cooperation to a standstill.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=235}} By June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a halt. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; The British government seriously considered going it alone on developing nuclear weapons, despite the cost and the expected length of the project.{{sfn|Howard|1972|pp=589–592}} In August 1943, Canadian Prime Minister [[Mackenzie King]] hosted the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]], at which [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] came together, and agreed to resume cooperation. The [[Quebec Agreement]] subsumed Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project, and established the [[Combined Policy Committee]], on which Canada was represented by Howe, to control the Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=277–280}}

While some aspects of cooperation resumed quickly, it took longer to finalize the details with respect to the Montreal Laboratory. [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie Groves]] (the director of the Manhattan Project), Chadwick (now the head of the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British Mission to the Manhattan Project]]), and Mackenzie negotiated recommendations, which were approved by the Combined Policy Committee on 13 April 1944. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May. Under it, the Americans would assist with the construction of a heavy water reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium or plutonium chemistry, although irradiated uranium slugs would be made available for the British to work it out for themselves.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=281–284}} The Americans had already built their own heavy water reactor, [[Chicago Pile-3]], which went critical in May 1944.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=306–307}} The September 1944 [[Quebec Agreement#Background and negotiations|Hyde Park Agreement]] extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=340–342}}

Hans von Halban had proved to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with Mackenzie or the NRC.{{sfn|Avery|1998|pp=184–185}} The Americans saw him as a security risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI).{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=206–207, 209–214}} In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.&lt;ref name="The Role of the French Scientists" /&gt; [[Edgar William Richard Steacie|E. W. R. Steacie]] became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt;

[[File:NRX_Pile_Building_and_ZEEP_Building-_Cooling_Tanks_1945.jpg|thumb|left|[[NRX]] and [[ZEEP]] buildings at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]]]]
After the [[Liberation of Paris]] in August 1944, the French scientists wanted to go home. Auger had already returned to London to join the French Scientific Mission in April 1944. Halban returned on a visit to London and Paris in November 1944, where he saw [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] for the first time since leaving France. While he maintained that he did not divulge any nuclear secrets to his previous boss (although he had discussed patent rights), Halban was not allowed to work or to leave North America for a year, although he left the Montreal Laboratory in April 1945. In 1946 he settled in England.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=292–296}} [[Bernice Weldon Sargent|B. W. Sargent]] then became Head of the nuclear physics division.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; Cockcroft arranged for Goldschmidt, Guéron and Kowarski to remain until June 1945, later extended until the end of 1945. Goldschmidt was willing to stay longer, and Cockcroft wanted to keep him, but Groves insisted that he should go, and, in the interest of Allied harmony, he did. All the French scientists had left by January 1946.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=292–296}}

On 24 August 1944, the decision was taken to build a small reactor to test the group's calculations relating to such matters as lattice dimensions, sheathing materials, and [[control rod]]s, before proceeding with the full-scale [[NRX]] reactor.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; With Halban gone, Kowarski joined the Laboratory, and was given responsibility for the small reactor,{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=102–104}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=282–284}} which he named [[ZEEP]], for Zero Energy Experimental Pile. He was assisted in the design by Charles Watson-Munro from New Zealand, and [[George Klein (inventor)|George Klein]] and Don Nazzer from Canada.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; Building reactors in downtown Montreal was out of the question; the Canadians selected, and Groves approved, a site at [[Chalk River]], Ontario, on the south bank of the [[Ottawa River]] some {{convert|110|mi}} northwest of Ottawa.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=246–247}}

The Americans fully supported the reactor project with information and visits.{{sfn|Avery|1998|p=200}} Groves loaned the Montreal Laboratory {{convert|19|ST}} of heavy water and {{convert|5|ST}} of pure uranium metal for the reactor, and samples of pure and irradiated uranium and thorium to develop the extraction process. The irradiated materials came from the Manhattan Project's [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Some {{convert|10|ST}} of machined pure uranium rods was sold outright to Canada. He also supplied instruments, drawings and technical information, provided expertise from American scientists,{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=9.5}} and opened a liaison office in Montreal headed by Major H. S. Benbow. The American physicist [[William Weldon Watson]] from the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] and chemist John R. Huffman from the SAM Laboratories were assigned to it.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=282–284}}{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=9.6}} They were succeeded by [[George Weil]] in November 1945.{{sfn|Avery|1998|p=200}}{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=9.6}}&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/06/obituaries/george-leon-weil-87-physicist-who-helped-make-atomic-bomb.html |title=George Leon Weil, 87, Physicist Who Helped Make Atomic Bomb |first=Wolfgang |last=Saxon |date=6 July 1995 |accessdate=8 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benbow was succeeded by Major P. Firmin in December 1945, who in turn was replaced by Colonel A. W. Nielson in February 1946.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=9.7}}

The [[Chalk River Laboratories]] opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945,{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=102–104}} becoming the first operating nuclear reactor outside the United States. Using {{convert|5|ST}} of heavy water and {{convert|3.5|ST}} of uranium metal, it could operate continuously at 3.5 W, or for brief periods at 30 to 50 W.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=9.23}} The larger NRX followed on 21 July 1947.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=102–104}} With five times the [[neutron flux]] of any other reactor, it was the most powerful [[research reactor]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Fidecaro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.df.unipi.it/~rossi/PONTE_5.pdf |date=4 December 1996 |title=Bruno Pontecorvo: From Rome To Dubna (personal recollections) |first=Giuseppe |last=Fidecaro |publisher=[[Università di Pisa]] |accessdate=15 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed in July 1944 with an output of 8 MW, the power was raised to 10 MW through design changes such as replacing uranium rods clad in stainless steel and cooled by heavy water with aluminium-clad rods cooled by light water.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|pp=9.9–9.10}}

By the end of 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was estimated to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding the cost of the heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like [[phosphorus-32]], research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation.{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|pp=9.26–9.28}} With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the [[Atomic Energy Control Board]].{{sfn|Manhattan District|1947|p=9.7}}

==Atomic spies==
On 5 September 1945, [[Igor Gouzenko]], a [[cipher|cypher]] clerk at the [[Soviet Union]]'s embassy in Ottawa, and his family [[defection|defected]] to Canada. He brought with him copies of cables detailing [[GRU|Soviet intelligence]] (GRU) espionage activities in Canada. Agents included Alan Nunn May, who secretly supplied tiny samples of uranium-233 and [[uranium-235]] to GRU agent Pavel Angelov in July 1945; [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]], a [[Parliament of Canada|member of parliament]]; and NRC scientists [[Israel Halperin]], Edward Mazerall and Durnford Smith.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|pp=183–187}}{{sfn|Close|2015|p=136}} Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, has long been suspected of having been involved in espionage. No evidence that he was a Soviet agent has ever been established,{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=308–309}} but the GRU obtained samples of uranium and blueprints of the NRX, for which Nunn May could not have been the source, and Pontecorvo remains the prime suspect.{{sfn|Close|2015|pp=143–143}} When the spy ring became public knowledge in February 1946, the Americans became more cautious about sharing information with Britain and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|p=98}}

==Cooperation ends==
[[File:TrumanAttleeKing1945.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Harry Truman]] and prime ministers [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Mackenzie King]] boarding {{USS|Sequoia|presidential yacht|6}} for discussions about nuclear weapons, November 1945]]
The Montreal Laboratory had been a fruitful and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft had been appointed the head of the new [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] in Britain without any prior consultation and at a time when the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist [[Bennett Lewis]], who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born [[Walter Zinn]] turned the job down.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|pp=131–146}}

Anglo-American cooperation did not long survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=72–73}} The [[Special Relationship]] between Britain and the United States "became very much less special".{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|p=93}} The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British considered a joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King and British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] went to Washington, D.C. to confer with President [[Harry Truman]] about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|pp=73–77}} A Memorandum of Intention that replaced the Quebec Agreement made Canada a full partner.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}} The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation, but British hopes for a resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were in vain.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|p=92}} The Americans soon made it clear that cooperation was restricted to basic scientific research.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80–83}}

At the Combined Policy Committee meeting in February 1946, without prior consultation with Canada, the British announced their intention to build a [[GLEEP|graphite-moderated nuclear reactor]] in the United Kingdom. An outraged Howe told Canadian ambassador [[Lester B. Pearson]] to inform the Committee that nuclear cooperation between Britain and Canada was at an end. The Canadians had been given what they deemed assurances that the Chalk River Laboratories would be a joint enterprise, and regarded the British decision as a breach of faith. Anglo-American cooperation largely ended in April 1946 when Truman declared that the United States would not assist Britain in the design, construction or operation of a plutonium production reactor. The Americans had agreed that such a facility could be built in Canada, but the British were not willing to be dependent on Canada for the supply of [[fissile]] material.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|pp=131–146}}

'''Naro Space Center''' is a [[South Korea]]n [[spaceport]] in [[South Jeolla]]'s [[Goheung|Goheung County]], operated by the state-run [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].

The spaceport is located about {{convert|485|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} south of [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2009/08/20/0601000000AEN20090820004200320.HTML ''Software glitch halts rocket launch'' - Yonhap News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a launch pad, a control tower, rocket assembly and test facilities, facilities for satellite control testing and assembly, a media center, an electric power station, a space experience hall and a landing field.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/korea-03b.html South Korea Begins Construction Of New Space Center]'' – Korean Information Service, ''SpaceDaily'', August 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Korea to enter space race in 2008", http://www.korea.net/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20080102014&amp;part=107|, Ro Ji-woong Korea.net Staff Writer, 03 January, 2008, accessed October 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The first launch, initially planned for 19 August 2009, was performed on 25 August 2009 using a Russo-South Korean [[Naro-1]] rocket, but failed to reach the desired orbit. Another rocket launch from Naro was planned for May 2010, but delays pushed the launch to June. On June 10, 2010, this second attempt also ended in failure when the rocket lost communications 137 seconds after launch.  The South Korean science minister Ahn Byung-man  later told reporters that the rocket was believed to have exploded. A third attempt was made on January 30th 2013 and finally succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.

South Korea's next rocket, the [[KSLV-2]] is also scheduled to be launched from Naro in 2019.

'''''News from Nowhere''''' (1890) is a classic work combining [[utopian socialism]] and [[soft science fiction]] written by the artist, designer and socialist pioneer [[William Morris]]. It was first published in serial form in the ''[[Commonweal (UK)|Commonweal]]'' journal beginning on 11 January 1890. In the novel, the narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and awakes to find himself in a future society based on [[common ownership]] and democratic control of the [[means of production]]. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find pleasure in their work.

The novel explores a number of aspects of this society, including its organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people. Morris fuses [[Marxism]] and the romance tradition when he presents himself as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and fellowship—and through them for a reborn self—he encounters romance archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure: a working class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Silver, Carole. The Romance of William Morris. Athens, Ohio: Ohio UP, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The book offers Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolishment of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and work.

In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common [[criticisms of socialism]]; the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communistic society. Morris' response is that all work should be creative and pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each worker. ''News From Nowhere'' was written as a [[libertarian socialist]] response to an earlier book called ''[[Looking Backward]]'', a book that epitomises a kind of [[state socialism]] that Morris abhorred. It was also meant to directly influence various currents of thought at the time regarding the tactics to bring about socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anarchism and Utopia: William Morris's News from Nowhere |author=Michael Holzman |journal=ELH |volume=51 |issue=3 |date=1984 |pages=589–603 |doi=10.2307/2872939 |jstor=2872939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Looking Backward'' ==
Morris reviewed the novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in the ''[[Commonweal (UK)|Commonweal]]'' on 21 June 1889. In his review, Morris objects to Bellamy's portrayal of his imagined society as an authority for what socialists believe. Morris writes,
'In short a machine life is the best which Mr. Bellamy can imagine for us on all sides; it is not to be wondered at then that this, his only idea for making labour tolerable is to decrease the amount of it by means of fresh and ever fresh developments of machinery… I believe that this will always be so, and the multiplication of machinery will just multiply machinery; I believe that the ideal of the future does not point to the lessening of men's energy by the reduction of labour to a minimum, but rather the reduction of pain in labour to a minimum, so small that it will cease to be pain; a dream to humanity which can only be dreamed of till men are even more completely equal than Mr. Bellamy's utopia would allow them to be, but which will most assuredly come about when men are really equal in condition.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first= William|title=Bellamy's Looking Backward|work=The William Morris Internet Archive Works (1889)|accessdate=14 April 2008|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/1889/backward.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris’s basic antipathy with Bellamy arose chiefly from his disagreement with Bellamy’s social values and aesthetic convictions. While Bellamy favoured the urban, Morris favoured the pastoral; while Bellamy lauded the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the power of the machine, Morris yearned for the restoration of an organic way of life which utilised machines only to alleviate the burdens which humans might find irksome; while Bellamy sought salvation through an omnipotent state, Morris wished for a time when it would have withered away.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

More specifically, Morris criticised the limited nature of Bellamy's idea of life. He identifies five concerns – work, technology, centralisation, cities, arts – which demonstrates the "half change" advanced in ''Looking Backward''. Morris's review also contains an alternate future society in each of these instances. This was the framework based on which he would later attempt to elaborate his vision of an utopia in ''News From Nowhere''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, W. (2003). ''News From Nowhere''. Leopold, D (Ed.).

In ''News From Nowhere'' Morris describes women in the society as ‘respected as a child bearer and rearer of children desired as a woman, loved as a companion, un-anxious for the future of her children’ and hence possessed of an enhanced 'instinct for maternity'. The sexual division of labour remains intact. Women are not exclusively confined to domestic labour, although the range of work they undertake is narrower than that of man; but domestic labour is seen as something for which women are particularly fitted.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levitas|first= Ruth|title=Who Holds the Hose? Domestic Labor in the Work of Bellamy, Gillman, and Morris - Ebsco Host : Academic Search Premier 6 (1996)|accessdate= 15 March 2008|url=http://corvette.salemstate.edu:2561/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=3&amp;sid=a7ff7a45-7fc8-4ef0-9c41-0ca33040fd09%40sessionmgr9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ‘The men have no longer any opportunity of tyrannising over the women, or the women over the men; both of those took place in old times. The women do what they can do best and what they like best, and the men are neither jealous nor injured by it.’&lt;ref name=Nowhere/&gt; 
The practice of women waiting on men at meals is justified on the grounds that, 
‘It is a great pleasure to a clever woman to manage a house skilfully, and to do so that all house-mates about her look pleased and are grateful to her. And then you know everybody likes to be ordered about by a pretty woman…’&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

Morris presents us with a society in which women are relatively free from the oppression of men; while domestic work, respected albeit gender-specific in Morris's work here as elsewhere, is portrayed as a source of potential pleasure and edification for all denizens of his Utopia.

== Marriage ==
Morris offers a Marxian view of marriage and divorce. Dick and Clara were once married with two children. Then Clara ‘got it in her head she was in love with someone else,’ so she left Dick only to reconcile with him again.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Jan. "Concerning Love: News From Nowhere and Gender." William Morris &amp; News from Nowhere: A Vision for Our Time. Eds. Stephen Coleman and Paddy O'Sullivan. (Bideford, Devon: Green Books, 1990): 107–125&lt;/ref&gt; Old Hammond informs the reader that there are no courts in ''Nowhere'', no divorce in ''Nowhere'', and furthermore no contractual marriage in ''Nowhere''. When dealing with marriage and divorce Old Hammond explains,
‘You must understand once for all that we have changed these matters; or rather that our way of looking at them has changed…We do not deceive ourselves, indeed, or believe that we can get rid of all the trouble that besets the sexes… but we are not so mad as to pile up degradation on that unhappiness by engaging in sordid squabbles about livelihood and position, and the power of tyrannising over the children who have been the result of love or lust.'&lt;ref name=Nowhere&gt;{{cite book

In Nowhere people live in groups of various sizes, as they please, and the nuclear family is not necessary.

Concerning marriage, the people of ''Nowhere'' practice monogamy but are free to pursue romantic love because they are not bound by a contractual marriage.

== Education ==
Early in the novel we learn that though the people of ''Nowhere'' are learned there is no formal schooling for children. Although Oxford still exists as a place to study the 'Art of Knowledge', we learn that people are free to choose their own form of education. As for educating children, we learn that children in ''Nowhere''
‘often make up parties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in the summer time, living in tents, as you see. We rather encourage them to do it; they learn to do things for themselves, and get to know the wild creatures; and you see the less they stew inside houses the better for them.’&lt;ref name=Nowhere/&gt;

Here Morris breaks away from the traditional institutions of 19th century England. Learning through nature is the best suited lifestyle for this agrarian society.

== How We Might Live ==
''News from Nowhere'' is a [[utopia]]n representation of Morris’ vision of an ideal society. "Nowhere" is in fact a literal translation of the word "utopia".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|utopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Utopia, an imagined society, is idyllic because the people in it are free from the burdens of industrialisation and therefore they find harmony in a lifestyle that coexists with the natural world.
In a lecture "How We Live and How We Might Live" 1884, Morris gives his opinions about an ideal existence. This opinion is the bedrock for the novel. Morris writes,
'Before I leave this matter of the surroundings of life, I wish to meet a possible objection. I have spoken of machinery being used freely for releasing people from the more mechanical and repulsive part of necessary labour; it is the allowing of machines to be our masters and not our servants that so injures the beauty of life nowadays. And, again, that leads me to my last claim, which is that the material surroundings of my life should be pleasant, generous, and beautiful; that I know is a large claim, but this I will say about it, that if it cannot be satisfied, if every civilised community cannot provide such surroundings for all its members, I do not want the world to go on.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salmon|first= Nicholas|title=Works|work=Marxist Internet Archive|accessdate= 14 April 2008|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/morris/works/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
{{Move section to wikiquote}}
* As he formed the words, the train stopped at his station, five minutes' walk from his own house, which stood on the banks of the [[Thames]], a little way above an ugly suspension bridge. He went out of the station, still discontented and unhappy, muttering "If I could but see it! if I could but see it!" but had not gone many steps towards the river before (says our friend who tells the story) all that discontent and trouble seemed to slip off him.
* "I think I know what you mean. You think that I have done you a service; so you feel yourself bound to give me something which I am not to give to a neighbour, unless he has done something special for me. I have heard of this kind of thing; but pardon me for saying, that it seems to us a troublesome and roundabout custom; and we don't know how to manage it. And you see this ferrying and giving people casts about the water is my business, which I would do for anybody; so to take gifts in connection with it would look very queer. Besides, if one person gave me something, then another might, and another, and so on; and I hope you won't think me rude if I say that I shouldn't know where to stow away so many mementos of friendship."
* All this seemed very interesting to me, and I should like to have made the old man talk more. But Dick got rather restive under so much ancient history: besides, I suspect he wanted to keep me as fresh as he could for his great-grandfather. So he burst out laughing at last, and said: "Excuse me, neighbours, but I can't help it. Fancy people not liking to work! — it's too ridiculous. Why, even you like to work, old fellow — sometimes," said he, affectionately patting the old horse with the whip. "What a queer disease! it may well be called Mulleygrubs!"
* "Man alive! how can you ask such a question? Have I not told you that we know what a prison means by the undoubted evidence of really trustworthy books, helped out by our own imaginations? And haven't you specially called me to notice that the people about the roads and streets look happy? and how could they look happy if they knew that their neighbours were shut up in prison, while they bore such things quietly? And if there were people in prison, you couldn't hide it from folk, like you can an occasional man-slaying; because that isn't done of set purpose, with a lot of people backing up the slayer in cold blood, as this prison business is. Prisons, indeed! O no, no, no!"
* "Then you suppose nonsense," said he. "I know that there used to be such lunatic affairs as divorce courts. But just consider; all the cases that came into them were matters of property quarrels: and I think, dear guest," said he, smiling, "that though you do come from another planet, you can see from the mere outside look of our world that quarrels about private property could not go on amongst us in our days."
* But of course I understand your point of view about education, which is that of times past, when 'the struggle for life,' as men used to phrase it (i.e., the struggle for a slave's rations on one side, and for a bouncing share of the slave-holders' privilege on the other), pinched 'education' for most people into a niggardly dole of not very accurate information; something to be swallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether he liked it or not, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been chewed and digested over and over again by people who didn't care about it in order to serve it out to other people who didn't care about it."
* "I must now shock you by telling you that we have no longer anything which you, a native of another planet, would call a government."
* "A terrible tyranny our Communism, is it not? Folk used often to be warned against this very unhappiness in times past, when for every well-fed, contented person you saw a thousand miserable starvelings. Whereas for us, we grow fat and well-liking on the tyranny; a tyranny, to say the truth, not to be made visible by any microscope I know. Don't be afraid, my friend; we are not going to seek for troubles by calling our peace and plenty and happiness by ill names whose very meaning we have forgotten!"
* "As a matter of fact, the history of the terrible period of transition from commercial slavery to freedom may thus be summarised. When the hope of realising a communal condition of life for all men arose, quite late in the nineteenth century, the power of the middle classes, the then tyrants of society, was so enormous and crushing, that to almost all men, even those who had, you may say despite themselves, despite their reason and judgement, conceived such hopes, it seemed a dream. So much was this the case that some of those more enlightened men who were then called Socialists, although they well knew, and even stated in public, that the only reasonable condition of Society was that of pure Communism (such as you now see around you), yet shrunk from what seemed to them the barren task of preaching the realisation of a happy dream. Looking back now, we can see that the great motive-power of the change was a longing for freedom and equality, akin if you please to the unreasonable passion of the lover; a sickness of heart that rejected with loathing the aimless solitary life of the well-educated man of that time: phrases, my dear friend, which have lost their meaning to us of the present day; so far removed we are from the dreadful facts which they represent."
* "Go back again, now you have seen us, and your outward eyes have learned that in spite of all the infallible maxims of your day there is yet a time of rest in store for the world, when mastery has changed into fellowship — but not before. Go back again, then, and while you live you will see all round you people engaged in making others live lives which are not their own, while they themselves care nothing for their own real lives — men who hate life though they fear death. Go back and be the happier for having seen us, for having added a little hope to your struggle. Go on living while you may, striving, with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be, to build up little by little the new day of fellowship, and rest, and happiness."

Folk singer [[Leon Rosselson]]'s song "Bringing the News from Nowhere", from his eponymous 1986 album, is a tribute to Morris.

''News From Nowhere'' was an influencing factor in historian [[G. D. H. Cole]]'s conversion to socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Margaret. ''The Life of G.D.H. Cole'', p.33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A track on ''[[Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!]]'' by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] (2008) is called "[[More News from Nowhere]]".

In 2008 Waltham Forest commissioned the composer, Mike Roberts, to create a new community symphony based on the story. Incorporating Morris' axiom of 'art for the people and by the people' the piece was written in collaboration with 180 primary school children - all composing small fragments of music that were weaved into the final piece.  The result was a 90-minute work for children's choir, orchestra and 10 other smaller ensembles.  The work is being recorded with the artistic support of The William Morris Gallery during 2014-15 for release in June 2015 to commemorate the novel's 125th anniversary.

The novel ''News from Gardenia'' (2012) by [[Robert Llewellyn]] was influenced by ''News from Nowhere''.

Korean artists Moon Kyungwon and Jeon Joonho were inspired by ''News from Nowhere'' in their collaborative project "News from Nowhere" (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromnowhere.kr/ |title=Home : News from nowhere |publisher=Newsfromnowhere.kr |date= |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the English band [[Darkstar (band)|Darkstar]] released an album titled ''News from Nowhere''.

The book was adapted by Sarah Woods as a radio play, broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] on 25 May 2016.

''[[The Baffler]]'' magazine hosts a monthly [[podcast]] by journalist Corey Pein called ''[https://thebaffler.com/latest/category/bafflercasts/news-from-nowhere News from Nowhere]'', inspired by Morris' book.

In the [[politics of the United States]], '''opposition research''' (also called '''oppo research''') is the practice of collecting information on a political opponent or other adversary that can be used to discredit or otherwise weaken them. The information can include biographical, legal, criminal, medical, educational, or financial history or activities, as well as prior media coverage, or the voting record of a politician. Opposition research can also entail using "trackers" to follow an individual and record their activities or political speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-05-22/opposition-research-romney-obama/55138756/1 |title=Researchers dig deeper for dirt on political opposition |last=Schouten |first=Fredreka |date=23 May 2012 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research is usually conducted in the time period between announcement of intent to run and the actual election; however political parties maintain long-term databases that can cover several decades. The practice is both a tactical maneuver and a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephanie |last=Mencimer |title=Dirty Politics |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]] |date=30 May 2008 |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2008/05/30/3104/dirty-politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is frequently used to refer not just to the collection of information but also how it is utilized, as a component of [[negative campaigning]].

==Origins and history==
In the 1st century BC, [[Cicero]] is said to have gathered information that was damaging to opponents and using it in attacks against them. He accused one political opponent, [[Catiline]], of murdering one wife to make room for another. He attacked [[Mark Antony]] in speeches known as the ''[[Philippicae]]'', eventually prompting Antony to chop off his head and right hand and display them at the Roman Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kamber |first=Victor |author-link=Victor Kamber |title=Poison Politics |location=New York |publisher=Insight Books |year=1997 |page=9 |isbn=978-030645628-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research also has its origins in military planning, as evident in such ancient texts as ''[[The Art of War]]'', published in the 5th century BC by [[Sun Tzu]]. This manual for warriors describes the necessity for understanding an opponent's weaknesses, for using spies, and for striking in moments of weakness.

In 18th century England, opposition research took the form of scandalmongering pamphlet wars between the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] parties. Writers such as [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Jonathan Swift]], and [[Henry Fielding]] participated, often writing under assumed names.&lt;ref&gt;Kamber, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of robust attack was replicated later in the American colonies, when writers such as [[Thomas Paine]] or [[Benjamin Franklin]] conducted opposition research and published their results.

The first appearance of the phrase "opposition research" in the ''New York Times'' occurred on December 17, 1971, in an article that describes the infiltration of the [[Edmund Muskie]] presidential campaign by a female Republican volunteer:  "...an article appeared in a Washington newspaper describing the 'opposition research' program at Republican headquarters..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  |accessdate=2012-02-03}}  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition research became systematized in the 1970s when [[Ken Khachigian]], in the [[Nixon Administration]] suggested that the GOP keep files on individuals as insurance against future races, rather than "scramble" in an ''ad hoc'' fashion race by race.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Methods==

Opposition research differs immensely depending on the size and funding of a campaign, the ethics of the candidate, and the era in which it is conducted. Information gathering can be classified into three main categories: open-source research enabled by the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], [[covert operations]] or "[[tradecraft]], " and maintenance of human systems of informants. Increasingly, data-mining of electronic records is used. Information is then stored for future use, and disseminated in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John J. |last=Pitney |title=The Art of Political Warfare |location=Norman OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=2000 |pages=120–139 |isbn=978-080613263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local election sometimes has a [[political campaign staff|staff member]] dedicated to reading through all of the opponents' public statements and their voting records; others initiate whisper campaigns that employ techniques of [[disinformation]] or "black ops" to deliberately mislead the public by advancing a pre-determined "narrative" that will present the opponent in a negative light.

Another technique is to infiltrate the opposition's operations and position a paid informant there. "Gray propaganda" techniques are often used to release damaging information to news media outlets without its source being identified properly, a technique inherited from disinformation tactics employed by intelligence agencies such as the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

File-sharing between operatives of political parties is quite common.  In the 2008 presidential election, a dossier of opposition research against Republican Vice-Presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]] was posted in its entirety on a political blog site, [[Politico.com]]. The file was compiled by the staff of her opponent in the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ben |last1=Smith |first2=John |last2=Bresnehan |title=Documents Detail Palin's Political Life |website=Politico |date=2 September 2008 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2008/09/documents-detail-palins-political-life-013084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Oppo dumps" are used by political campaigns to systematically supply files of damaging information to press outlets, including matters of the public record, video footage from party archives and private collections, as well as private intelligence gathered by operatives. Many prime time television and radio news commentaries rely on this supply of party-generated material because it is free, and therefore more cost-effective than paying investigative reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Megan |last=McArdle |title=Prime Time for Oppo Dumps |magazine=[[Atlantic Monthly]] |date=31 March 2008 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2008/03/prime-time-for-oppo-dumps/3157/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Scherer |title=The Matt Drudge Primary |website=Salon.com |date=14 May 2007 |url=https://www.salon.com/2007/05/14/drudge_11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates and incumbents who benefit from opposition research often choose to remain uninformed about their campaign's operations and tactics, to insure [[plausible deniability]] should criminal charges be brought against researchers.

==="Trackers" and videography===
Yet another technique is to position information or personnel within media outlets. Often the information is video footage gathered in campaign-funded "tracker programs" wherein videographers use candidates' itineraries to track them and record as many remarks as possible, since anything they say can and will be used against them, as was the case in former Senator George Allen's "macaca moment."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In  the 2006 election cycle, a Virginia senator, [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], was unseated because of videotape of the senator calling a videographer/opposition researcher as "macaca" or monkey. The name was considered to be an ethnic slur, and Allen's campaign could not overcome the damage when the incident was broadcast widely in mainstream media and on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Bass |title=In Dixie, Signs of a Rising Biracial Politics |publisher=New York Times |date=May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/weekinreview/11bass.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital media and Wikipedia ===
A 2005 analysis of digital media strategies published by the American Academy of Political Science took the view that new technologies enable "political elites" to use database and Internet technologies to do opposition research more easily, but they use data-mining techniques that outrage privacy advocates and surreptitious technologies that few Internet users understand. Data becomes "richer" about political actors, policy options, and the diversity of actors and opinion in the public sphere, but citizenship is "thinner" by virtue of "the ease in which people can become politically expressive without being substantively engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Howard |first=Philip N. |author-link=Philip N. Howard |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |year=2005 |volume=597 |pages=153–170 |doi=10.1177/0002716204270139 |title=Deep Democracy, Thin Citizenship: The Impact of Digital Media in Political Campaign Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Facebook]] photos became a tool of opposition researchers in [[California's 32nd congressional district special election, 2009]] to replace [[Hilda Solis]].  Front-runner [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Gil Cedillo]] sent out mailers targeting 26-year-old Emanuel Pleitez, grouping Pleitez's Facebook photos to suggest that he parties to excess with alcohol, and fraternizes with [[gangs]].  The text of the mailer suggested Pleitez, posing with a Latino stage actress and using a Latino [[voter registration drive]] hand sign, was "flashing gang signs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Blake |title=Facebook Photos Used as Opposition Research |website=The Hill |date=May 7, 2009 |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/campaigns/35943-facebook-photos-used-as-opposition-research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the campaign manager of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Cathy Cox]], Morton Brilliant, resigned after Cox's opponent, Lt. Gov, [[Mark Taylor (American politician)|Mark Taylor]], revealed Cox's campaign had added information from an opposition research dossier to a Wikipedia page on Taylor. Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] confirmed that the material had come from an IP address affiliated with the Cox campaign. Citing an Associated Press analysis, CNN reported that Wikipedia being used as a "popular tool" for opposition researchers became so widespread a problem that Wikipedia altered its submission guidelines and set up alerts so that its operators know when [[Capitol Hill]] staffers alter Wikipedia content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Hamby |title=Campaign Manager Resigns Amid Wikipedia Flap |work=CNN Politics |date=April 26, 2006 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/26/cox.wikipedia/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anyone who wanted to could simply bypass this by using an IP address not associated with Capitol Hill.

===Grassroots oppo-research===
Opposition research is a necessary component of "grassroots" activist groups. Research on corporate or political opponents may enable activist groups to target neighborhoods from which to increase their numbers, to refine their focus or "target," to pinpoint the target's vulnerabilities, to reveal hidden sources of funding or little-known connections, to investigate scare tactics, and to augment a legislative initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee |last=Staples |title=Roots to Power:  A Manual for Grassroots Organizing |edition=2nd |location=Westbury, CT |publisher=Praeger |date=2003 |page=227, passim |isbn=978-027596997-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presidential election of 2008, the blog [[Talking Points Memo]] pioneered "collaborative citizen-reporting projects" based on groups of volunteers examining public documents that shed light on the George W. Bush administration's U.S. attorneys firings controversy.  Other organizations such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]] encouraged citizen examination of such public domain records as Mitt Romney's financial disclosure statements and Bill Clinton's income statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Arnoldy |title=Army of Average Joes Culls Through Candidates' Files, Bios |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=October 17, 2007 |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1017/p03s03-uspo.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventative measures===
Political strategies for campaigns often include coaching on preventive measures to avoid providing too much information in public disclosure procedures that can provide ammunition for opponents' opposition researchers, particularly in itemized expenditure reports. "To eliminate some of these potential issues your campaign should take the time to review the wording of your campaign finance reports," advises one strategist writing for ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of reporting that you spent $3,000 on a 'background check and public records search on Congressman X,' list the expenditure as 'issue research' or simply 'research'... One bonus financial filing tip:  warn your candidate about spending campaign funds on fancy restaurants for 'strategy meetings.' Eating at [[Ruth's Chris Steak House|Ruth's Chris]] or [[Morton's The Steakhouse|Morton's Steak House]] on your campaign's dime just looks bad.

===Funding and institutions===
Congressional and presidential opposition research is often conducted by or funded by a political party, lobbying group, [[political action committee]] (PAC), or a [[527 group]] that coalesces around a certain issue. In the U.S., both the Republican and Democratic parties employ full-time "Directors of Research" and maintain databases on opponents. In recent years the task of opposition research has been privatized in many areas. Full-time companies with permanent staff specializing in media productions or "grassroots" operations have replaced volunteers and campaign officials. Political media consultants may also opt for [[astroturfing]] techniques, which simulate wide popular appeal for a candidate's platform.

== In presidential elections ==
Opponents of [[Andrew Jackson]] in the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections unearthed his marriage records to imply that he was an [[adultery|adulterer]] for marrying Rachel Robards before she was legally divorced from her first husband.  Jackson had married her in 1791 on the strength of a statement from her husband that he had divorced her; Jackson had two wedding ceremonies, the not-recognizable one of 1791 and the legally corrective one of 1794.  His political opponents used this information decades later against him, and he fought many duels over his wife's honor.  Rachel Robards died before Jackson took office in his first term; he maintained that the stress of the opposition had killed her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The life of Andrew Jackson |last=Remini|first=Robert Vincent |year=2001 |publisher=Perennial |isbn=0060937351 |edition=1st Perennial classics |location=New York |oclc=46951836 |pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], the law partner of [[Abraham Lincoln]], did research in the Illinois State Library to collect "all the ammunition Mr. Lincoln saw fit to gather" to prepare for the run against [[Stephen A. Douglas]] in the 1860 presidential race.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harold Holzer, ed.  The Lincoln-Douglas Debates, New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for Ronald Reagan’s debate with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the presidential race 1980, Reagan’s campaign staff acquired under mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including information on Carter’s strategy, which staffers [[David Stockman]] and [[David Gergen]] had used to prepare Reagan.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a special investigation, based on the 1978 [[Ethics in Government Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, “Special Prosecutor Sought in Briefing Book Case,”  October 26, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter’s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan’s campaign director [[William J. Casey]], future head of the Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rottinghaus |first1=Brandon |last2=Bereznikova |first2=Zlata |date=September 2006 |title=Exorcising Scandal in the White House: Presidential Polling in Times of Crisis |journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=493–505 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2006.02559.x |issn=0360-4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baker]] attributed the acquisition of the documents to Casey, who claimed to know nothing about them, and an analysis of Carter campaign documents found in the “Afghanistan” files of Reagan aide [[David Gergen]] indicated they came from three White House offices: the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] and Domestic Adviser [[Stuart Eizenstat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed Magnuson, “I Never Knew There Was Such a Thing,” Time, July 11, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years afterward, Carter himself stated in a PBS interview that the book had been taken by columnist [[George Will]], but Will denied it, calling Carter "a recidivist liar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Will |title=Briefing Book Baloney |work=Washington Post |date=August 11, 2005 |page=A23 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001796.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Atwater]] is considered to be the "father" of modern aggressive "oppo" techniques.  Atwater honed his style working in his native South Carolina for Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] and to elect Congressman (later Governor) [[Carroll Campbell]].  From his posts on the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], Atwater encouraged and helped direct what was then the advanced oppo work of the [[Republican National Committee]] against Democrats [[Walter Mondale]] and [[Michael Dukakis]]. During the 1988 presidential campaign, dozens of RNC researchers worked three shifts around the clock to feed the then-burgeoning [[24-hour news cycle]].  The now-infamous “Willie Horton” TV ads crafted by [[Floyd Brown]] helped turn voters away from Dukakis and towards the Republican, although Atwater and Bush were protected by [[plausible deniability]] because Brown's ads were independently funded and produced.  Academic research into the Bush archives decades later revealed that a Bush staffer, Candice Strother, had released a dossier of information on Willie Horton to Elizabeth Fediay, of the non-profit group that contracted for the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Tali Mendelburg, ''The Race Card'', Princeton University Press, 2004, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Horton story had been completely public for an entire year, part of news coverage that won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune newspaper.) [[Willie Horton]] was an African-American convicted murderer released on a weekend furlough during Governor Dukakis’s tenure, who escaped and committed a brutal rape in Maryland, also stabbing his victim's husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Beloved Mug Shot For the Bush Forces |work=New York Times |date=October 3, 1988 |page=A22 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/03/us/campaign-trail-a-beloved-mug-shot-for-the-bush-forces.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atwater is also credited with originating "push polls" and "whisper campaigns" that use disinformation strategies to alienate voters from opponents.  A biography of Atwater, quotes him as saying in an interview toward the end of his life that he regretted some of his less ethical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Joseph |last=Brady |title=Bad Boy: The Life and Politics of Lee Atwater |year=1997 |isbn=0201627337}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 presidential campaign, Republicans reported that they spent $6 million on a "state of the art (opposition research) war machine" to investigate Bill Clinton, who was running against [[George H. W. Bush]].  In the same election, the Clinton campaign paid more than $100,000 to a private investigator to look into allegations about Clinton's womanizing, investigating more than two dozen women.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Johnson, ''No Place for Amateurs'', 2nd edition. New York: Routlege, Taylor, and Francis Group, 2007, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 presidential election, longtime opposition researcher and Nixon loyalist [[Roger Stone]] was recruited by former Secretary of State [[James Baker]] to oversee the recount of the disputed Presidential election in Miami-Dade County in 2000. Stone is credited with organizing the street demonstrations and eventual shut-down of the recount in that pivotal county.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Toobin, ''Too Close to Call'',&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 presidential race, [[Chris Lehane]], a Democratic opposition researcher attracted notoriety and built a reputation not for deploying his skills against Republican opponents, but for using them against other Democrats in the primary races.  Working for retired Army general Wesley Clark, Lehane sought to establish a media "narrative" that Howard Dean was hypocritical and dishonest, based on surveys of his administrative archive as governor of Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Joshua |last=Green |title=Playing Dirty |work=The Atlantic Monthly |date=June 2004 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/06/playing-dirty/302960/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protege of Atwater's, [[Karl Rove]], is considered to be the "architect" of George W. Bush's election to the governor's office in Texas, and to the presidency in 2000 and 2004. In the 2000 race, Rove is credited with masterminding the push poll that initiated the "[[John McCain]] has a black love child" whisper campaign in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Dirty Tricks, South Carolina and John McCain |magazine=The Nation |date=January 14, 2008 |last=Banks |first=Ann |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/dirty-tricks-south-carolina-and-john-mccain/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anonymous telephone pollsters, upon determining that a voter was pro-McCain, asked the question, "Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered a black child out of wedlock?" The question was not overt slander, but it prompted the president of [[Bob Jones University]] to launch his own internet campaign against McCain, and succeeded in crippling the trust of voters McCain had attracted. The Bush camp knew, as the general public did not, that in reality, John McCain was the adoptive father of a dark-skinned Bangladeshi refugee who was rescued by his wife Cindi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard H. |last=Davis |title=The Anatomy of a Smear Campaign |work=Boston Globe |date=March 21, 2004 |url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 presidential election, opposition researchers for Barack Obama unearthed the fact that John Edwards had paid $400 for haircuts at campaign expense, and supplied Politico's Ben Smith with the tip, according to a memoir later published by campaign manager David Plouffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Smith |title=A Haircut Tip |work=Politico |date=November 10, 2009 |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2009/11/a-haircut-tip-022732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Democratic National Committee]] continues to fund a research department, after the 2008 presidential election, the New York Times reported that "The legacy of the Democratic National Committee itself is hardly clear going forward.

==Executive branch==
* '''Franklin Roosevelt Administration''': In 1940, the White House accidentally taped a conversation of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] instructing a lower level aide to disseminate a rumor about his opponent [[Wendell Willkie]] having an extramarital affair: "We can't have any of our principal speakers refer to it, but the people down the line can get it out."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Roosevelt, quoted in John J. Pitney, ''The Art of Political Warfare'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Johnson Administration''': In 1964, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] sent 30 FBI agents to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, N.J., to avert assassination attempts, and to monitor his political rival [[Robert Kennedy]] and civil rights activists. Johnson later also placed his Republican challenger, [[Barry Goldwater]], under FBI surveillance, with a federal wiretap.&lt;ref&gt;Pitney, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nixon Administration''': During the [[Richard Nixon]] administration, White House staffers compiled lists of names of political opponents, journalists who had criticized Nixon, and artists and actors (such as [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Paul Newman]]) who had dissented with Nixon policy, especially on the subject of Vietnam, with the intent of prompting Internal Revenue Service investigations. The full extent of Nixon's surveillance of private citizens solely on the basis of their dissent was not known until years after Nixon was forced to resign, as former staff members such as [[Charles Colson]] and [[John Dean]] began to disclose details.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  [[Nixon's Enemies List]] is the informal name of what started as a list of President Richard Nixon’s major political opponents compiled by Charles Colson, written by George T. Bell [1] (assistant to Colson, special counsel to the White House) and sent in memorandum form to John Dean on September 9, 1971. The list was part of a campaign officially known as “Opponents List” and “Political Enemies Project.” The official purpose, as described by the White House Counsel’s Office, was to “screw” Nixon’s political enemies, by means of tax audits from the IRS, and by manipulating “grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;"List of White House 'Enemies' and Memo Submitted by Dean to the Ervin Committee," ''Facts on File, Watergate and the White House'', vol. 1, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ford Administration''': During the [[Gerald Ford]] presidency, Deputy Assistant [[Dick Cheney]] suggested in a now-infamous memo to [[Donald Rumsfeld]] that the White House use the [[United States Justice Department]] to conduct opposition research and retaliate against political opponents and critical journalists such as [[Seymour Hersh]] and the [[New York Times]], arguing that the executive branch had the power to prosecute journalists as they saw fit, under the provisions of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/preview/documents.html Dick Cheney's Memos from 30 Years Ago] – Frontline.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reagan Administration''': In 1984, during the [[Ronald Reagan]] presidency, the [[Republican National Committee]] formed [[The Opposition Research Group]], with its own budget of $1.1 million. These staff amassed information on eight Democratic presidential candidates based on data from voting records, Congressional Record speeches, media clippings and transcripts, campaign materials, all of which was stored on a computer for easy access. In this way the Reagan team was able to track inconsistencies and attack them. This original data base evolved into a network that linked information gleaned by Republicans in all 50 states, creating a master data base accessible to high-ranking Republican staff, even aboard [[Air Force One]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M Bayer &amp; J. Rodota, "Computerized Opposition Research," ''Campaigns &amp; Elections'', 6, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this RNC database was accessible to both the Reagan White House and campaign team, no evidence has surfaced that U.S. federal dollars funded [[The Opposition Research Group]] or its efforts.
* '''Clinton Administration''': During the [[Bill Clinton]] administration, the "[[White House FBI files controversy|Filegate]]" scandal erupted when White House staffers said to be acting on the directions of First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] improperly accessed 500 FBI files compiled for security checks of Reagan and Bush staffers in previous administrations. Craig Livingstone, said to be hired by Mrs. Clinton with dubious credentials, resigned amid public outcry. In testimony under oath during the [[Kenneth Starr]] special prosecutor's investigation, Mrs. Clinton stated that she had neither hired Livingstone nor improperly perused the files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=George Lardner Jr. |author2=Susan Schmidt |title=Livingstone Resigns, Denying Ill Intent |work=Washington Post |date=June 27, 1996 |page=A01 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/stories/wwtr960627.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''George W. Bush Administration''': Two former opposition researchers for the RNC appointed to Justice Department posts, [[Timothy Griffin]] and [[Monica Goodling]], were implicated in efforts to use data collected on Democratic-appointed federal attorneys as ground for dismissal. See [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]]. See also [[Karl Rove]].  Also during this administration,  [[Counterintelligence Field Activity]] (CIFA), an intelligence gathering arm of [[the Pentagon]] was disbanded in 2008, after investigations into the bribery activities directed at [[Duke Cunningham]] revealed that the U.S. government kept a sizeable database of information about 126 domestic peace activist groups, including [[Quakers]], about 1,500 "suspicious incidents" including peace demonstrations outside armed forces recruiter offices, even though the groups posed no specified threat to national security.  The program was known as Talon. About two years elapsed between the program's disbanding and the ''Post'' report. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' quoted an unnamed "official" as saying,"On the surface, it looks like things in the database that were determined not to be viable threats were never deleted but should have been," the official said. "You can also make the argument that these things should never have been put in the database in the first place until they were confirmed as threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Pincus |title=Pentagon Will Review Database on U.S. Citizens |work=Washington Post |date=December 15, 2001 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121402528.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Barack Obama Administration:'''  In February 2009, Shauna Daly, a former opposition researcher for the Democratic National Committee was appointed as a researcher for the White House's Office of Legal Counsel. Daly was [[Barack Obama]]'s deputy research director during the presidential campaign, spent much of the cycle rebutting viral online attacks on Obama's character and biography under the rubric of "Stop the Smears." Shortly thereafter, amid speculations that she would be conducting research against political opponents,  she was reassigned as Research Director to the DNC.  Politico.com reported on February 27, 2009 that "the counsel's office – which doesn't face the sort of rapid-response demands that were common in the late Clinton years – doesn't plan to fill the research post."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Smith, ''Politico.com'', February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The American Spectator]]'' reported on its "Washington Prowler" blog that Daly was posted in the White House Counsel's Office for "about a month," and thus had access to "reams of Bush administration documents related to such things as the firings of U.S. Attorney, the use and internal debate over the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] and the [[Scooter Libby]] and [[Karl Rove]] investigations.  The "Prowler" quoted  "a DNC staffer" as saying, "She realized that she could do more with all the material she saw outside of the building than inside where she'd be bound by the rules and legalities of the White House Counsel's Office.  Now she isn't.  She's good at what she does; her time at the White House means we've got a mother load (''sic'') of material that will have Republicans scrambling.  At least that's what we hope."&lt;ref&gt;"The Washington Prowler," [[The American Spectator]], March 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==

In 1916, after President [[Woodrow Wilson]] nominated [[Louis Brandeis]] for the Supreme Court, "concerned" citizens seeking to block his confirmation offered information that Brandeis was a "radical Zionist," even though he was not a practicing Jew. Brandeis aggressively outmaneuvered his detractors by mounting his own opposition research efforts, including a carefully constructed chart that exposed the social and financial connections of the group, mostly from Boston's Back Bay, and including Harvard president [[Lawrence Lowell]], as well as a group headed by former President [[William Howard Taft]] and a host of [[American Bar Association]] past presidents. Brandeis sent the chart to [[Walter Lippman]] at the ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' who penned an editorial condemning "the most homogeneous, self-centered, and self-complacent community in the United States."  Brandeis was confirmed after four months of hearings, in a Senate vote of 47–22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boudin|first=Michael|date=1976|editor-last=Urofsky|editor-first=Melvin I.|editor2-last=Levy|editor2-first=David W.|editor3-last=Brandeis|editor3-first=Louis D.|title=Justice Brandeis: The Confirmation Struggle and the Zionist Movement|jstor=795344|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=85|issue=4|pages=591–596|doi=10.2307/795344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan]] nominated Judge [[Robert Bork]] for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987, prompting a Senate floor speech from Democratic Massachusetts senator [[Ted Kennedy]], which later became known as the "Robert Bork's America" speech:
::&lt;small&gt;Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is – and is often the only – protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy.&lt;/small&gt;

Kennedy's speech prompted a rapid-response opposition research effort from Democrats, but the White House waited two and a half months to respond. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], under the direction of Delaware senator and presidential hopeful [[Joseph Biden]], commissioned a report in response to the materials Reagan's staff had released in support of Bork's nomination. Prepared by a panel of lawyers, including two Duke University law professors, the 78-page became known as "The Biden Report." The report detailed Bork's record, and analyzed the pattern of his rulings, and deeming him to be a conservative "activist" rather than an impartial jurist  Ultimately, Bork's embattled nomination failed, and Anthony Kennedy (no relation to Ted) was later confirmed to fill the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report Assails Bork's Record On Constitutional Questions |agency=AP |work=New York Times |date=September 4, 1987 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/us/report-assails-bork-s-record-on-constitutional-questions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christopher H. |last1=Schroeder |first2=Jeffrey |last2=Peck |title=Response Prepared to White House Analysis of Judge Bork’s Record (Biden Report) |date=September 2, 1987 |journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=9 |pages=219–296 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fierce research-based opposition to Bork's nomination attracted significant media attention, even though a [[Gallup Poll]] on the eve of the confirmation vote showed that very few Americans could name the nominee in question, much less recall his rulings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gallup Poll'' (2007), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; A new verb was later coined; "to bork" a candidate or nominee by mounting such voluminous research and vocal opposition that the person in question would be forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]] (2001, May 27).

After President [[George W. Bush]] nominated [[Harriet Miers]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that Republican conservative advocacy groups were conducting opposition research against her: "Groups are circulating lists of questions they want members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] to ask Miers at her confirmation hearings. The activists' thinly veiled hope is that Miers will reveal ignorance of the law and give senators a reason to oppose her."&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Savage, "Guess Who's Doing Opposition Research Against Harriet Miers?" ''Boston Globe'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miers later withdrew her name from consideration for the court.

On July 7, 2005, soon after the resignation of Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], the [[Democratic National Committee]] gathered and circulated information on the "anti-civil rights" and "anti-immigrant" rulings of [[Samuel A. Alito, Jr.]], by then nominated by President [[George W. Bush]] to replace her. Upon inspection, the documents were revealed to have been amended by [[Devorah Adler]], research director for the DNC. Alito's "record" had been pointedly altered to present him in a negative light. While the incident was not unusual, it received publicity in prominent places because it drew attention to the "meta-data" that is often unwittingly stored in documents that are altered and forwarded electronically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Zeller, Jr.]], "Beware Your Trail of Digital Fingerprints," ''New York Times'', November 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2009, after Supreme Court Justice [[David Souter]] announced his intent to retire from the court, the ''New York Times'' reported that Curt Levey, executive director of the Committee for Justice, had noted that conservatives were "focusing opposition research efforts on 17 women, whom they have divided into two tiers based on their perceived chances."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Savage]], "Wider World of Choices to Fill Souter's Vacancy," ''New York Times'', May 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven aides to members of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] pleaded guilty on January 7, 2010, to illegal use of state resources for campaign activities, including opposition research against the political opponents of incumbent officeholders during 2007.

During [[Lamar Alexander]]'s 2002 campaign for the U.S. Senate, Alexander's campaign staff received an anonymous mailing of a photograph of opponent [[Bob Clement]] obviously serving as a board member of a failed bank whose owners had been imprisoned for bank fraud.  When the Alexander campaign raised the issue of Clement's financial ties with the convicted felons, Clement denied any connection.

In early July 2009 Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that she would be resigning as governor, partly due to complications from opposition research and ethics inquiries after her inclusion on the 2008 GOP presidential race ballot as John McCain's running mate. At a later news conference Palin told reporters, "Obviously conditions had changed so drastically on August 29, the day I was tapped to be VP," she said. "The opposition research and the games that began there — which I think is the new normal in Alaska politics, until I hand the reins over to Sean Parnell — have been so distracting."&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pennsylvania state legislature in July 2009, former state House Democratic Campaign Committee Chair, Rep. [[Stephen Stetler]] found himself amidst an investigation when he rejected a plan that would have shifted the job of opposition research from employees on the state payroll to private firms.  Attorney General [[Tom Corbett]] alleged that millions in public funds were paid to state employees who did such research on the 2006 and 2004 campaigns of Democrats in the state.  Stetler left the House after 2006 to become the state's revenue secretary. A former aide, Dan Wiedemer testified before grand jurors that the suggestion to remove politically motivated research from the hands of public employees "was more or less shot down."  Though Stetler has not been charged, 12 former House members and members of their staff were charged with diverting public funds for political campaign work.&lt;ref&gt;Tracie Mauriello and [[Dennis B. Roddy]], "Ex-aide's Testimony in Probe Revealed," ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', July 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Stetler was among those subpoenaed, said Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Democratic Gov.

The practice of using tips from opposition research sources was examined in 1994 by [[Howard Kurtz]], media analyst for ''The Washington Post''. Kurtz surveyed the major networks, ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and other influential media outlets, and found varying levels of use of oppo research information on [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]] as a witness in the [[Whitewater controversy]]. At this time, Brown confirmed that he had been the source of four mainstream media stories that had received attention from the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' because they bore striking resemblance to the opposition research being disseminated by Citizens United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |title=Muckrakers and the Mudslinger: Should Media Treat Floyd Brown Seriously? |work=The Washington Post |date=April 19, 1994 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-886599.html |url-access=subscription |via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Far from being detached observers, reporters constantly call oppo staffs looking for tidbits and sometimes trading information," wrote three reporters, [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]], [[Gloria Borger]], and [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], for ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Cooper, Gloria Borger, and Michael Barone, "Dirty Tricks?  Cheap Shots?  Says Who?" ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', July 6, 1992, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political infighting==

In the spring of 2007, [[Roger Stone]], a political consultant in the employ of New York state senator [[Joseph Bruno]], was forced to resign after leaving threatening phone messages on the answering machine of the 85-year-old father of New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], alleging that Spitzer's campaign finances were conducted improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |title=Political Consultant Resigns After Allegations of Threatening Spitzer's Father |date=April 23, 2007 |page=1 |last1=Hakim |first1=Danny |last2=Confessore |first2=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/nyregion/23stone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November of that same year, Stone sent a letter to the FBI detailing Spitzer's sexual preferences with prostitutes and sexual props, right down to his black calf-length socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Weiss |title='Two on One' vs. Spitzer |work=New York Post |date=April 24, 2008 |page=1 |url=https://nypost.com/2008/04/24/two-on-one-vs-spitzer/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone was considered to be an authoritative source because he frequented the same prostitutes as a client himself. A subsequent Justice Department investigation produced evidence that ultimately led to Spitzer's resignation as governor. [[Joseph Bruno]], Stone's client, has been a longtime political enemy of Eliot Spitzer.

==In popular culture==
The television show ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' depicts many examples of opposition research, particularly the character of Doug Stamper, the loyal adviser to [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Francis "Frank" Underwood]], who regularly engages in the practice with little morality and few ethics.

The '''Picower Institute for Learning and Memory''' is, along with the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]] and the Department of Brain and [[Cognitive Science]]s, one of the three [[neuroscience]] groups at [[MIT]]. The institute is focused on studying all aspects of learning and memory; specifically, it has received over [[US$]]50 million to study [[Alzheimer's]], [[schizophrenia]] and similar diseases.

When it was established in 1994, the institute was primarily funded by the [[Sherman Fairchild Foundation]], the [[RIKEN Brain Science Institute]] and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://web.mit.edu/picower/about/index.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed after a $50 million grant by the [[Jeffry Picower#Involvement with Bernard Madoff|Picower Foundation]] in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/uwire/uwire_WFR051720027396405.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=top&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the recorder as an introduction to learning music|the recorder as a musical instrument|Recorder (musical instrument)|other uses of the word recorder|Recorder (disambiguation)}}
[[File:VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg|thumb|300px|Various recorders (second from the bottom disassembled into its three parts)]]
The '''recorder''' is a [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] [[musical instrument]] of the family which includes the [[tin whistle]]. The recorder is end-blown and the mouth of the instrument is constricted by a wooden plug, known as a ''block'' or ''fipple''.&lt;ref&gt;Grove Music Online recommends that use of the word ''fipple'' should be abandoned because its meaning is confused, however, other sources (e.g. the Oxford Dictionary of Music) continue to use it.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from other members of the family by having holes for seven fingers (the lower one or two often doubled to facilitate the production of [[semitone]]s) and one for the thumb of the uppermost hand.  Recorders can be made out of wood, plastic or ivory.&lt;ref name="Profile of the recorder"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://musiced.about.com/od/windinstruments/p/recorder.htm|title=Profile of the recorder|publisher=About.com Music Education|accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recorder was popular in [[Medieval music|medieval times]] through the [[Baroque music|baroque]] era, but declined in the 18th century in favour of orchestral woodwind instruments, such as the [[flute]], [[oboe]], and [[clarinet]].

The recorder was revived in the 20th century, partly in the pursuit of [[historically informed performance]] of early music, but also because of its suitability as a simple instrument for teaching music. Today, it is sometimes thought of as a child's instrument, but there are many professional players who demonstrate the instrument's full solo range. See [[Recorder (musical instrument)]] for further information on advanced usage.

==Name of the instrument==
The instrument has been known by its modern name at least since the 14th century. ''Grove's Dictionary'' reports the earliest use of the word ''recorder'' was in the household of the [[Earl of Derby]] (later to become [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]) in 1388: ''{{Lang|la|fistula nomine Recordour}}''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Grove's Dictionary of Music''(online Edition): "Recorder" article, part 1: Nomenclature&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from "to learn by heart", as birds do; the recorder is thought to emulate bird song.

==History==
{{details|Recorder (musical instrument)#History}}
Internal duct-flutes have a long history: an example of an [[Iron Age]] specimen, made from a sheep bone, exists in [[Leeds]] City Museum.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Music''. See section 1 of "Recorder Family" article&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|Renaissance recorders]]
The recorder achieved great popularity in the 16th and 17th centuries. This development was linked to the fact that [[art music]] (as opposed to [[folk music]]) was no longer the exclusive domain of nobility and clergy. The advent of the printing press made it available to the more affluent commoners as well. The popularity of the instrument also reached the courts however. For example, at [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s death in 1547, an [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England|inventory of his possessions]] included 76 recorders.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Music''. see section 2 of the article on "Recorder Family"&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous references to the instrument in contemporary literature (e.g. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hamlet]]'', [[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 3#Scene 2. A hall in the castle.|Act 3, scene 2]], Hamlet: "Ah, ha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Milton|Milton]]&lt;ref&gt;''Paradise Lost, Book I'': "Anon they move/ in perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood/ flutes and soft recorders"&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive database of literary references to the recorder see here [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/quotes.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several changes in the construction of recorders took place in the 17th century, resulting in the type of instrument generally referred to as ''Baroque'' recorders, as opposed to the earlier ''Renaissance'' recorders. These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone which was regarded as "sweeter" than that of the earlier instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wainwright and Peter Holman, ''From Renaissance To Baroque: Change in Instruments and Instrumental Music in the Seventeenth Century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7546-0403-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes, and a slightly reduced range.

The instrument went into decline after the 18th century, being used for about the last time as an otherworldly sound by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] in his opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]].''  By the Romantic era, the recorder had been almost entirely superseded by the flute and clarinet. One variant of the recorder survived into the 19th-century concert halls, however: the keyed recorder known as the [[czakan]] or ''{{lang|de|Stockflöte}}''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Modern revival===
The recorder was revived around the turn of the 20th century by [[early music]] enthusiasts, but used almost exclusively for this purpose. It was considered a mainly historical instrument. Even in the early 20th century it was uncommon enough that [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] thought it to be a kind of [[clarinet]], as he told one day to [[Frans Brüggen]], when asked to write a new piece for recorder. This reaction is not surprising since the early clarinet was, in a sense, derived from the recorder, at least in its outward appearance.

The eventual success of the recorder in the modern era is often attributed to [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in the UK and various German scholar/performers. While he was responsible for broadening interest beyond that of the early music specialist in the UK, Dolmetsch was far from being solely responsible for the recorder's revival. On the Continent his efforts were preceded by those of musicians at the Brussels Conservatoire (where Dolmetsch received his training), and by the performances of the [[Bogenhauser Künstlerkapelle]] (Bogenhausen Artists' Band) based in Germany. Over the period from 1890-1939 the Bogenhausers played music of all ages, including arrangements of classical and romantic music. Also in Germany, the work of Willibald Gurlitt, Werner Danckerts and Gustav Scheck proceeded quite independently of the Dolmetsches.&lt;ref&gt;Eve E. O'Kelly, ''The Recorder Today'', Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-36681-X}}. Chapter 1: The Revival&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the revival, far from being the work of one man, was the result of several strands coming and working together.

Carl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe, and consequently modern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Jürg Baur]], [[Josef Tal]], [[John Tavener]], [[Michael Tippett]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Gordon Jacob]], [[Malcolm Arnold]], [[Steven Stucky]] and [[Edmund Rubbra]].

The recorder is often used in popular music, including that of groups such as [[The Beatles]];&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''Fool on the Hill'', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S. Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818095832/http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Rolling Stones]] (see, for example, "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]"); [[Yes (band)|Yes]], for example, in the song "[[I've Seen All Good People]]"; [[Jefferson Airplane]] (see [[Jefferson Airplane#Personnel|Personnel]] as well as [[Grace Slick]]); [[Led Zeppelin]] ([[Stairway to Heaven]]); [[Jimi Hendrix]];&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the song ''[[If 6 Was 9]]'', according to [http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html The Recorder Home Page maintained by Nicholas S. Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818095832/http://www.recorderhomepage.net/torture5.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]];&lt;ref&gt;For example in the song ''Green Fingers'', according to [http://www.discogs.com/release/386971 Discogs.com's page on the album A Kiss in the Dreamhouse]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Dyble]] of [[Fairport Convention]]; [[Dido (singer)|Dido]];&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Grafton Street''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mannheim Steamroller]].

Some modern music calls for the recorder to produce unusual noises, [[rhythm]]s and [[Extended technique|effect]]s, by such techniques as [[flutter-tonguing]] and [[overblowing]] to produce [[multiphonics]]. [[David Murphy (composer)|David Murphy]]'s 2002 composition ''Bavardage'' is an example, as is Hans Martin Linde's ''Music for a Bird''.

Among late 20th-century and early 21st-century recorder ensembles, the trio [[Sour Cream Trio|Sour Cream]] (led by [[Frans Brüggen]]), [[Flautando Köln]], the [[Flanders Recorder Quartet]], [[Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet]] and [[Quartet New Generation]] have programmed remarkable mixtures of historical and contemporary repertoire. [[Piers Adams]] is a recorder player who has toured and recorded widely, as well as being involved in education.

There are two schemes of naming, one linked to the historical use of the instrument, the other to the human voice it most closely resembles.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}}&lt;!--"Descant", "treble", "soprano", "alto", "tenor", and "bass" all refer to singing ranges of the human voice. How can this be different from historical usage?--&gt; 

=== Descant or soprano ===
‘Descant’ is the usual term in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and most of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], while ‘soprano’ is the term used in [[US English]].

This is the most common instrument today and is tuned to C, meaning that the lowest note possible is a [[C (musical note)|C]].  It can be a little shrill, so in advanced playing is often restricted to a descant or extra line above the main melody.  Although actually sounding an octave higher because of the timbre it feels as though it is pitched similarly to a human soprano.  The relatively short spacing between holes and the cheapness of the instrument have made it an ideal first instrument in schools.

=== Treble or alto ===
The treble recorder is the main melody instrument in advanced work, just as the trebles are in church choral music.  When reading accounts of recorders in the past, this is usually the instrument meant unless otherwise stated.  It sounds closest to a human alto voice.  The instrument is tuned to [[F (musical note)|F]].  Many school bands consist of descant/soprano and treble/alto instruments only.  The reach on treble recorders is longer than the descant and this, together with the higher price, make it an instrument for those starting to progress.

=== Tenor ===
The tenor recorder is occasionally found in schools.  It is twice the size of the descant/soprano and so may be too large for children's fingers to reach.  The lowest hole is controlled by one or two keys because of the stretch.  It is also tuned to C, but is an octave below the smaller instrument.

=== Bass ===
The bass is the largest recorder commonly met with.  It is an F instrument, about three times the length of the descant/soprano.  Like the tenor the lowest hole is controlled by keys.

=== Other sizes ===
Specialist players may also employ smaller instruments: garklein (C) and sopranino (F).  There are larger instruments: great bass (C), contrabass (F), subcontrabass (C) and octobass (F).  Intermediate instruments in D, B-flat, G and E-flat exist but will not be found in elementary music.

==Construction and operation==
[[File:Recorder300.svg|left|thumb|Cross-section of the head of a recorder]]
Today, high-quality recorders are made from a range of hardwoods.  Plastic recorders are produced in large quantities. Plastics are cheaper and require less maintenance and quality plastic recorders can be as good as lower-end wooden instruments.  Plastic recorders can be sterilised by soaking in a mild disinfectant, which may be desirable if they are shared between classes.  Beginners' instruments, the sort usually found in children's ensembles, are plastic and can be purchased quite cheaply.

The recorder is held outwards from the player's lips (rather than to the side, like the "transverse" flute). The player's breath is compressed into a linear airstream by a channel cut into the wooden "block" or [[fipple]] (A), in the mouthpiece of the instrument, so as to travel along this channeled duct (B) called the "windway".&lt;ref name=bolton&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flute-a-bec.com/acoustiquegb.html |first= Philippe |last = Bolton |title= How Recorders Work |accessdate= 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exiting from the windway, the breath is directed against a hard edge (C), called the "labium" or "ramp", which causes the column of air within the resonator tube to oscillate with [[standing wave]]s. Unlike simple whistles where holes are progressively unstopped, the recorder uses half-holing and forking (see below) to modify the position of the nodes.&lt;ref name=bolton /&gt;

==Notation and pitch==
School recorders are [[Pitch (music)|pitched]] at [[concert pitch]] (A=440&amp;nbsp;Hz).

The recorder family is non-transposing, which means that sheet music for recorder is nearly always written in the key in which it is played. A written C in the score actually sounds as a C.  Recorders are referred to as "C-fingered" or  "F-fingered", depending on the lowest note. This implies that the player must learn two different sets of similar fingerings, one for the C recorders and another for the F recorders. A player may go from one C-fingered instrument to another easily, and from one F-fingered instrument to another easily, but switching between the two requires knowing both sets of fingerings, or the ability to transpose the music at sight.

Descant/soprano recorders transpose at the octave, as does the bass.  In modern scores, octave transpositions may be indicated by adding a small figure "8" above the treble or bass clef on descant/soprano or bass recorder parts, but in the past and still commonly today, the transpositions are not indicated and instead are assumed from context.  Bass instruments use the bass clef but may occasionally use the treble clef and transpose down an octave.  The other three common instruments all use the treble clef.

To make the transition to playing a treble/alto recorder easier, some educational music is written C-fingered, in which case the instrument transposes up a fourth.

As a rule of thumb, recorders sound one octave above the human voice after which they are named (soprano recorder is an octave above soprano voice, alto an octave above alto voice, etc.) The recorder's mellow tone and limited harmonics allows for the seemingly deeper sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tapiasgold.com/crb/instruments.html www.tapiasgold.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of a modern recorder is usually taken to be about two [[octave]]s except in virtuoso pieces. See the table above for fingerings of notes in the nominal recorder range of 2 octaves and 1 whole tone. Notes above this range are more difficult to play, and the exact fingerings vary from instrument to instrument, so it is impractical to put them into the table here.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Wollitz, ''The Recorder Book'', Knopf, 1984. {{ISBN|0-394-47973-4}}. See Chapter 1, "Technique"&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder, according to the pictures.

===Half-holing, forking, and shading===
The lowest chromatic scale degrees – a semitone and a minor third above the lowest note – are played by covering only a part of a hole, a technique known as "half-holing." Most modern instruments are constructed with double holes or keys to facilitate the playing of these notes; such double holes are occasionally found on baroque instruments, where even the hole for the third finger of the left hand can be doubled. Other chromatic scale degrees are played by so-called "fork" fingerings, uncovering one hole and covering one or more of the ones below it. Fork fingerings have a different tonal character from the diatonic notes, giving the recorder a somewhat uneven sound. Budget tenor/bass recorders might have a single key for low C/F but not low C{{music|#}}/F{{music|#}}, making this note virtually impossible to play. Double low keys allowing both C/F and C{{Music|#}}/F{{Music|#}} are more or less standard today.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt;

===Pinching===
Most of the notes in the second octave and above are produced by partially opening the thumbhole on the back of the recorder, a technique known as "pinching". There are two basic methods for achieving this: a) drawing the thumb away from the hole, and b) bending the thumb.&lt;ref name="WvHTheModernRecorderPlayerChapt5"&gt;Walter van Hauwe, ''The Modern Recorder Player'', Volume I, Schott, 1984. ISMN 979-0-2201-1382-6. See Part II, Chapter 5, "The Left Thumb"&lt;/ref&gt; The first method uses only the skin of the thumb to define the opening, while the second method uses also the nail edge. The latter technique enables better feel and thus control of the size of the opening.&lt;ref name="WvHTheModernRecorderPlayerChapt5"/&gt; The placement of the thumb is crucial to the tone, intonation and stability of these notes, and varies as the notes increase in pitch, making the boring of a double hole for the thumb unviable. To play the notes in the second register and above, the player must generally blow more air into the instrument and/or tongue somewhat harder to excite the second or upper harmonics of the instrument.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt; This is, however, not universally true; it is possible for example to slur ''piano'' between and in the second and third registers.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Heyens, ''Advanced Recorder Technique'', Volume I, Schott, 2005. {{ISBN|3-7957-0516-9}}. See Chapter 3, "Scales/Arpeggios/Chromatic Scales", p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===German fingering===
In the early part of the 20th century, [[Peter Harlan]] developed a recorder that allowed for apparently simpler fingering, called German fingering. A recorder designed for German fingering has a hole five which is smaller than hole four, whereas baroque and neo-baroque recorders have a hole four which is smaller than hole five. The immediate difference in fingering is for F and B{{Music|b}} which on a neo-baroque instrument must be fingered 0 123 4–67. With German fingering, this becomes a simpler 0 123 4 – – –. Unfortunately, however, this causes many other chromatic notes to be too badly out of tune to be usable.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique&gt;A Rowland-Jones, ''Recorder Technique'' {{ISBN|0-907908-75-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as the recorder began to be treated more seriously and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Hunt, ''The Recorder And Its Music''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many recorder makers continue to produce German fingered instruments today, essentially for beginner use only.

==Dynamics==
Changes in dynamics are not easy to achieve on the recorder if the player is accustomed to other wind instruments. The general belief is that if the player blows harder to play louder, or more softly to play softer, the pitch changes and the note goes out of tune, and unlike the transverse flute, the player cannot change the position of the mouth in relation to the labium in order to compensate, and that therefore the recorder is not capable of dynamic changes. This is misleading.  Subtle changes in wind pressure are possible if the player has a good ear for tuning and knows how hard the instrument can be pushed before pitch changes become noticeable. But this is not the correct approach to recorder dynamics.&lt;ref name=ARJtechnique /&gt;&lt;ref name=ARJsonatas&gt;A Rowland-Jones, ''Playing Recorder Sonatas'' Clarendon Press {{ISBN|0-19-879001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the recorder it is better to think of the breath controlling pitch, and the fingers controlling dynamics; for example by resting the fingers lightly on the holes breath leaks around them, lifting the pitch; and the resulting instinctive change in breath pressure to bring the pitch back also drops the volume.  The recorder is notable for its sensitivity to articulation; in addition to its obvious use for artistic effect skilled players can also use this sensitivity to suggest changes in volume.&lt;ref name=ARJsonatas /&gt;

==Use in schools==
[[File:Japanese YAMAHA Instruments Recorders 1.JPG|thumb|Plastic recorder ([[Yamaha]])]]
In the mid-20th century, German composer and music educator [[Carl Orff]] popularized the recorder for use in schools as part of [[Orff-Schulwerk]] programs in German schools. Orff's five-volume opus of educational music ''Music for Children'' contains many pieces for recorders, usually scored for other instruments as well.&lt;ref&gt;Regner, Hermann. Orff-Schulwerk Floetenbuch, Preface. Translated by I.M. Rushworth. http://www.vosa.org/paul/sales_folder/orff_recorder.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers have made recorders out of [[bakelite]] and other more modern plastics; they are thus easy to produce, hence inexpensive. Because of this, recorders are popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;Margo Hall, ''Teaching Kids Recorder'', iUniverse, 2005. {{ISBN|0-595-36743-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also relatively easy to play at a basic level because sound production needs only breath, and pitch is basically determined by fingering. It is, however, incorrect to assume that mastery is similarly easy—like any other instrument, the recorder requires study to play well and in tune, and significant study to play at an advanced or professional level.

==Unconventional uses==
[[File:Blockflötenkopf.ogg|thumb|Playing on a Soprano recorder head joint]]
[[File:StrikingBell.jpg|left|thumb|An elementary recorder class striking the bell of the recorder during a concert.]]
The head of recorders is sometimes used as a [[noisemaker|noise]], [[rhythm]] and [[sound effect|effect]] instrument, and as a toy musical instrument with children (e. g. in a [[rhythm band]]), since the recorder head works like a [[whistle]]. With a bit of practice, it is easy to play all kind of rhythms. Effects are made by opening and covering the lower end of the head joint with the hand while blowing. Agnes Dorwarth of the [[Hochschule für Musik Freiburg]] argues this is an attractive way to get children to play with part of the instrument, which can make playing the entire instrument more inviting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikschulen.de/projekte/musikschulkongress/musikschulkongress13/ag7/index.html|title=AG 7 - Musikschulkongress '13|last=Dorwarth|first=Agnes|publisher=[[:de:Verband deutscher Musikschulen|Verband deutscher Musikschulen]]|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many players blow harder than "normal" recorder playing (like with a [[pea whistle]]) to achieve a very loud, shrill and penetrating sound.

The recorder can also give an effect by striking the bell with the palm of the hand.  The note varies according to the type of instrument.  Although unfingered the note will be a soft version of the lowest note of the recorder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;!--Not my experience, but if a reliable source says so . . .--&gt;

Additional effects can be obtained by blowing across the window, somewhat after the manner of a flute.  Fingering can be used; the effect is like a soft, breathy, baroque flute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Recorder ensembles==
The recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Recorder+flute |title=Recorder flute definition of Recorder flute in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written by the French spy [[Roger de Piles]]. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in the Hague carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years, where he wote his ''L'Abrégé'' in 7 parts; 1) Sketch of the perfect painter, 2) Greek painters; 3) Painters from Rome &amp; Florence; 4) Painters from Venice; 5) Painters from [[Lombardy]]; 6) Painters from Germany and the Low Countries; 7) Painters from France and ending with his famous "Balance of painters". The book was finally published in 1699 following his appointment as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] in Paris.

'''''SAMUS: South African Music Studies''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] and the official journal of the [[South African Society for Research in Music]] (SASRIM). Contents and abstracts are listed in [[RILM]] Abstracts, The Music Index, Sabinet Online, and [[African Journals OnLine]].

'''''SAMUS''''' succeeds the now defunct '''''South African Journal of Musicology''''' which was published by the former [[Musicological Society of Southern Africa]]. SASRIM is a post-apartheid amalgamation of the Musicological Society of Southern Africa and the Ethnomusicology Symposium.

'''SA Pathology''', (formerly the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) until 2008), is an organisation providing diagnostic and clinical pathology services throughout [[South Australia]].

SA Pathology has over 60 patient collection centres and numerous [[Laboratory|laboratories]] located throughout South Australia.

As a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit organisation]], SA Pathology bulk-bills patients for all Commonwealth Medical Benefit Schedule (CMBS) pathology tests.  In a recent article by [http://www.choice.com.au/reviews-and-tests/food-and-health/general-health/health-practitioners/pathology-gap-fees/page.aspx Choice magazine], it was recognised as the only consistently 'no gap, [[bulk billing]]' pathology provider in South Australia.

Profits generated from pathology are used to support rural communities, [[Medical education|medical training]] and [[medical research]]. SA Pathology has over 250 elite medical researchers studying diseases and disorders ranging from [[Blood cancer|blood]], [[Breast cancer|breast]] and [[colon cancer]], [[bone fracture]]s, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[asthma]], [[hepatitis]], [[infectious disease]]s and [[genetic disorder]]s.

==History==
SA Pathology has a rich history of diagnostic pathology and research over 75 years. Established as the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) in the late 1930s, it was an era which saw political and community leaders introduce significant reform, with a focus on improving public health.

Situated near the old [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]], in what used to be South Australia's principal [[teaching hospital]] precinct, the Institute began as an offshoot of the hospital laboratories. RAH Superintendent and Dean of Medicine Sir [[Trent Champion de Crespigny]] created an organisation combining laboratory services with pathology training and medical research. Dr. [[E. Weston Hurst]] was appointed its first director in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131566423 |title=Surprise Bill in Assembly |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XXIX, |issue=4,479 |location=South Australia |date=30 November 1937 |accessdate=20 August 2018 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48765147 |title=Medical Institute Director Resigns |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXXVI, |issue=26488 |location=South Australia |date=27 August 1943 |accessdate=20 August 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes occurred in the 1970s with a redefinition of IMVS services, resulting in the divisions of Forensic Pathology and Biology relocating and evolving into what is now the Forensic Science Centre. The 1980s saw stronger relationships with the RAH and the [[University of Adelaide]] which allowed the IMVS to diversify activity across emerging areas of pathology.

A later review recommended creation of separate science research laboratories, proposing that any new developments be integrated into IMVS and the hospital, which led to the establishment of the Hanson Institute in the early 1990s.

The IMVS experienced further change in 2008 in a merger with the pathology department of two other hospitals, the [[Women's and Children's Hospital]] and [[Flinders Medical Centre|Flinders Medical Centre's]] South Path, when the organisation was renamed SA Pathology. The core business continued to be diagnostic pathology for public health but adhering to its founder’s original vision, integrating pathology with clinical training and medical research.

The Centre for Cancer Biology was established within SA Pathology in 2008 as a hub for innovative science. Currently hosting over twenty group leaders and their teams, the CCB is an internationally recognised cancer research centre where research teams actively form alliances with pharmaceutical companies to foster knowledge and advance new treatments.

The '''sociology of immigration''' involves the sociological analysis of immigration, particularly with respect to [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[ethnicity]], [[social structure]], and political [[policy]]. Important concepts include [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[enculturation]], [[marginalization]], [[multiculturalism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[transnationalism]] and [[social cohesion]].

==History==

===Twentieth century===

Global immigration during the twentieth century was particularly rapid during the first half of the century. Due to the emergence of World War I and World War II, European immigrants came to the United States in vast quantities. Particularly following the end of World War I, Americans labeled European immigrants as dangerous to American culture.&lt;ref name="Fleegler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleegler|first1=Robert|title=Haney Foundation Series : Ellis Island Nation : Immigration Policy and American Identity in the Twentieth Century|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780812223385|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the United States Congress passed the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which placed strict quotas on immigrants entering the United States.&lt;ref name="Fleegler" /&gt;

From the 1960s to 1990s, the [[Social stigma|stigma]] labeling immigrants as "job takers" and "criminals" subsided, and instead Americans began to consider immigrants as benefactors to the American economy, culture, and political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleegler|first1=Robert|title=Haney Foundation Series : Ellis Island Nation : Immigration Policy and American Identity in the Twentieth Century|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780812223385|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the negative labels that immigrants were given, during the first half of the twentieth century, influenced their actions in society and self-perceptions (known as [[labeling theory]] in sociology), immigrants now began to assimilate more easily into society and form strong [[social network]]s that contributed to their acquisition of [[social capital]]—the "information, knowledge of people or things, and connections that help individuals enter, gain power in, or otherwise leverage social networks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=166|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===

Sociologists have studied immigration closely in the twenty-first century. Compared to the majority of European immigrants entering the United States during the early twentieth century, the twenty-first century witnessed the arrival of immigrants predominately from Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. From 2000 to 2001, sociologists have paid particular attention to the costs and benefits of the new diversified immigration population on American institutions, culture, economic functions, and national security.&lt;ref name="FLEEGLER"/&gt; After the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, sociologists closely analyzed the symbolism of increased anti-immigration rhetoric, directed at Middle Eastern immigrants, stemming from Americans. Structural functionalists theorists have also studied the effects of mass migration—resulting from wars, economic insecurity, and terrorism—on the [[Institution|social institutions]] of host nations, international law, and assimilation rates. Additionally, sociologists exercising [[social conflict theory]] have analyzed, in particular, labor market conflicts resulting from increased marketplace competition due to the rise in competition between immigrants and native workers for jobs and [[social mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vallejo|first1=Jody Agius|title=Research in the Sociology of Work : Immigration and Work|date=2015|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|location=Bingley, UK|isbn=9781784416324|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because rates of global immigration are continuing to increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Llosa|first1=Alvaro Vargas|title=Global Crossings : Immigration, Civilization, and America|date=2013|publisher=Independent Institute|location=Oakland, CA|isbn=9781598131338|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the field of sociology has a particular interest in monitoring twenty-first century immigration as it relates to the foundational theories of symbolic interactionism, social conflict, and structural functionalism.

===Generational change===

In immigration studies, social scientists assign distinct definitions to various [[immigrant generations]]. In sociology, the word "generation" is used as a "measure of distance from the 'old country'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marrow|first1=Helen|last2=Ueda|first2=Reed|last3=Waters|first3=Mary|title=The New Americans : A Guide to Immigration since 1965|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780674023574|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people who move to, in the case of immigrants migrating to the United States, the United States from another society, as adults, are considered "first generation" immigrants, their American-born children as "second generation" immigrants, and their children in turn as "third generation" immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marrow|first1=Helen|last2=Ueda|first2=Reed|last3=Waters|first3=Mary|title=The New Americans : A Guide to Immigration since 1965|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780674023574|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-twentieth century in the United States, the first, second, and third generations of immigrants displayed distinct characteristics. Second generation immigrants, due to being the parents of immigrants and witnessing the historical events unfolding in the mid-twentieth century, created a distinct [[social identity]] both in themselves and in popular American culture. In the late 1930s, American historian [[Marcus Lee Hansen]] observed "distinct differences in attitudes toward ethnic identity between the second generation and their third-generation children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marrow|first1=Helen|last2=Ueda|first2=Reed|last3=Waters|first3=Mary|title=The New Americans : A Guide to Immigration since 1965|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780674023574|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the second generation was anxious to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]], the third generation was sentimentally invested in "[[ethnicity]]", which is defined by sociologist Dalton Conley as "one's ethnic quality or affiliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=333|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, twenty-first century immigrants now assimilate more than their twentieth-century predecessors, most notably in the transition to using English—among immigrants who move to the United States—as the primary language for communication.

While contemporary immigrant generations share common ethnic backgrounds and cultures, there are differences in the level of [[social mobility]], economic achievement, educational attainment, and familial relations among the members of those generations.

==Three sociological perspectives==

===Symbolic interactionism===

Symbolic interactionism is a "micro-level theory in which shared meanings, orientations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind people's actions".&lt;ref name="Conley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=31|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, as opposed to [[macrosociology]], is focused on how face-to-face interactions create the social world.

In order to understand how perceptions of immigrants are formed and constructed, symbolic interactionism theory has been utilized. Immigration into the United States has been on the rise since 1965.&lt;ref name="Sobczak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobczak|first1=Michael|title=The New Americans: Recent Immigration and American Society : American Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration Policy (1)|date=July 2010|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC|location=El Paso, Texas|isbn=9781593323868|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion polls have demonstrated "that the percentage of Americans who wanted immigration decreased to be very low immediately prior to 1965, but had begun an upward incline from 1965 to the late 1970's at which time it thereafter increased dramatically".&lt;ref name="Sobczak"/&gt; One of the reasons why there is a negative native response to increased immigration is because of the often-negative images of immigrants being elicited by the media. Moreover, immigration legislation, such as the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]], increased anti-immigration sentiment, and nativist rhetoric, and social movements in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sobczak" /&gt; Perceived group threat also has been proven to maintain an important role in explaining Americans' attitude toward immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobczak|first1=Michael|title=The New Americans: Recent Immigration and American Society : American Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration Policy (1)|date=2010|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing LLC|location=El Paso, Texas|isbn=9781593323868|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of foreigners altering aspects of the established culture, such as the native language, results in nativist sentiment and further polarization. Together, these instances illustrate the significance of immigrants' [[master status]] in shaping how others perceive them, and how they perceive themselves. For example, the racial stigma that Mexican immigrants encounter in the United States "reinforces the low status and the self perceptions of Mexican Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Uggen|first1=Hartmann|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780393912326|page=275|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mexican Americans internalize this perception of their [[Race (human categorization)|race]], they begin to act accordingly and indirectly reinforce this perception.

The rise in [[islamophobia]] in the United States, after the attacks on the World Trade Center, is an example of symbolic interactionism in practice. After the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, "Arabs and Muslims (as well as Latinos, South Asians, and other individuals who were mistakenly perceived to be Arab or Muslim based on their skin color, dress, or organizational affiliations) suffered an unprecedented outbreak of backlash violence" because of assumptions by others that they were terrorists who intended to do harm to Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peek|first1=Lori|title=Behind the Backlash : Muslim Americans After 9/11|date=2010|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9781592139828|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days and months following the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], Muslims and Arabs were subject to hate crimes based on personal characteristics such as their clothing, accent, facial hair, and skin tone. From a symbolic interactionist perspective, the violent attacks against Arabs and Muslims resulted from the shared assumptions and meanings that Americans attributed to Arab and Muslim people and culture.

===Social conflict===

[[Social conflict theory]] is a sociological perspective that views society as a constant struggle for power and resources. This theory holds that competition between competing interests is a central function of society. Social conflict theorists believe that competition for power and resources results in social change.

Since the early nineteenth century, advocates and opponents of immigration have analyzed the economic effects of immigration on national economies and workforces. Opponents of national increases in immigration rates have argued that restricting immigration "improves the economic well-being of native workers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borjas|first1=George|title=Heaven's Door : Immigration Policy and the American Economy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691088969|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration, opponents argue, causes unemployment for native workers. The reasoning behind this argument is that immigrant peoples compete with the native peoples for jobs and resources. This increased competition results in more jobs going to immigrant workers since it costs less for employers to hire a low-skilled immigrant than a highly skilled native worker. However, advocates of immigration argue that immigration improves a nations economy since more people enter the workforce, thus resulting in higher productivity and increased competition in the labor market. Additionally, proponents argue that the native population benefits from immigration since "immigrants increase the demand for goods and services produced by native workers and firms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borjas|first1=George|title=Heaven's Door : Immigration Policy and the American Economy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691088969|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social conflict theorists suggest that the competition between native workers and immigrant workers, for economic achievement and social mobility, is at the crux of the immigration debate as it relates to economics.

A common fear is that immigration will alter the native culture of a nation. In the discipline of sociology, "culture" is defined as a "set of beliefs, traditions, and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=75|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the view of the in-group of a society (usually considered the majority) that the [[Non-material culture|nonmaterial culture]] (i.e. values, beliefs, behaviors, and social norms) of immigrants—the out-group—will decrease the staying power and prevalence of the native culture. An example of this scenario is the fear that continuous foreign immigration to the United States will result in the prominence of the English language fading. The competition to maintain English as the "official" language of the United States, social conflict theorists theorize, is a perpetuated struggle that American society will continue to encounter as immigration continues. Moreover, the "native vs. immigrant" competition for jobs and social mobility in an increasingly diverse and specialized labor market will, social conflict theorists argue, continue as immigration continues.

===Structural functionalism===

[[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological perspective "claiming that every society has certain structures that exist to fulfill some set of necessary functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like A Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=A-8|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the ideas of sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], society through this sociological lens is thought of as a living organism—similar to the nineteenth-century theory of ''[[organicism]]''.

Regarding the economy of a society, immigrants play a prominent role in maintaining, disrupting, and/or contributing to the [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]]. For example, since the 1980s and 1990s, the American economy has favored workers who have valuable skills to offer. If immigrants to the United States, for example, have valuable skills to offer, they may "increase the chances of economic success in the United States, such as the language and culture of the American workplace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borjas|first1=George|title=Heaven's Door : Immigration Policy and the American Economy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691088969|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human capital and physical resources that immigrants may have to offer can complement those that already exist in the American economy. Structural functionalists believe that, whether the effects are positive or negative, immigration significantly impacts the level of social cohesion in the workplace. This analysis of social cohesion is closely related to the work of sociologist Émile Durkheim.

Sociologists utilizing structural functionalism would explain that immigration serves the function of a unifier for the immigrant population in a foreign society. Especially in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, immigrants in the United States tended to socialize with people of similar ethnic backgrounds in order to experience group solidarity during a time of intense [[resocialization]]. This feeling of group solidarity led to increased social capital, which held people together and decreased the sense of [[anomie]] among immigrants, which is a "sense of aimlessness or despair that arises when we can no longer reasonably expect life to be predictable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93774-9|page=25|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration, therefore, served as a mechanism for [[social network]]s to be built among immigrant populations during a period of intense [[resocialization]] and prevalent cases of [[anomic suicide]].

==Transnationalism==
A more contemporary sociological analysis of immigration can be explored within the concept of [[transnationalism]]. This analysis is perhaps more concerned with the relational dimensions of immigration, particularly in terms of the ways in which families and relationships are maintained when members migrate to another country. Theorist Zlatko Skrbis argues that within a transnational network of families, the patterns of migration are intertwined with notions of 'emotion' and 'belonging'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrbis|first=Z|title=Transnational Families: Theorizing Migration Emotions and Belonging|journal=Journal of Intercultural Studies|volume=29|issue=3|pages=231–246|doi=10.1080/07256860802169188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12751">'''Survival radios''' are carried by ships and aircraft to facilitate rescue in an emergency. They are generally designed to transmit on [[international distress frequency|international distress frequencies]]. Maritime systems have been standardized under the [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]].

==History==
The use of radio to aid in rescuing survivors of accidents at sea came to the forefront after the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912. Lifeboats were equipped with [[spark gap transmitter]]s such as the [[Marconi Company|Marconi]] Type 241, c. 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/marconi/collection/catalogue.php?invnum=59677&amp;mode=documents|title=MHS - Marconi Collection - Catalogue inventory number 59677|first=Elizabeth|last=Bruton|website=www.mhs.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shawsavillships.co.uk/radios/241.htm]{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These operated using [[Morse code]] on [[500 kHz]], the international distress frequency at the time. This frequency had the advantage of long range due to ground-wave propagation and was constantly monitored by all large ships at sea after the'' Titanic'''s sinking. However, due to its wavelength of 600 meters, a long antenna was required to achieve good range. Long wires on the order of 1/4 wavelength held up by kites or balloons were often used. Spark-gap continued to be used in lifeboats long after the technology was banned for general communication.

[[File:GibsonGirlSurvivalRadio.agr.jpg|thumb|BC-778 "Gibson Girl" radio transmitter.]]
During World War II, Germany developed a hand-crank 500&amp;nbsp;kHz rescue radio, the "Notsender" (emergency transmitter) NS2. It used two [[vacuum tube]]s and was [[Crystal oscillator|crystal-controlled]]. The radio case curved inward in the middle so that a user seated in an inflatable life boat could hold it stationary, between the thighs, while the generator handle was turned.  The distress signal, in Morse code, was produced automatically as the crank handle was turned. An NS2 unit was captured by the British in 1941, who produced a copy, the Dinghy Transmitter T-1333. Britain gave a second captured unit to the United States, which produced its own copy, the SCR-578. [[United States Army Air Forces]] aircraft carried the SCR-578 on over-water operations. Named the ''[[Gibson Girl]]'' because of its hourglass shape, it was supplied with a fold-up metal frame [[box kite]], and a balloon with a small hydrogen generator, for which the flying line was the aerial wire. Power was provided by a hand cranked generator. The transmitter component was the BC-778. The frequency was [[500 kHz]] at 4.8 watts, giving it a range of {{convert|200|mi|km nmi|-2}}. Keying could be automatic [[SOS]], or manual. Crystals were a scarce item for the U.S. during the war and the SCR-578 was not crystal-controlled.

A post-World War II version, the AN/CRT-3, which added a frequency in the 8&amp;nbsp;MHz range, was in use by ships and civil aircraft until the mid 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wftw.nl/gibsongirl/gibsongirl.html|title=Wireless for the Warrior. Gibson Girl|website=wftw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VHF era===
The use of aircraft for [[search and rescue]] in World War II brought line-of-sight [[Very high frequency|VHF]] radios into use. The much shorter wavelengths of VHF allowed a simple [[dipole antenna|dipole]] or [[whip antenna]] to be effective. Early devices included the British Walter, a compact single vacuum tube oscillator design operating at 177&amp;nbsp;MHz (1.7 meter wavelength), and the German Jäger (NS-4), a two-tube master oscillator power amplifier&lt;ref&gt;A vacuum tube "master oscillator power amplifier" radio design combines the functions of an oscillator and amplifier in the same tube or tubes to reduce parts count, weight and power consumption, and improve reliability.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Do not link to "master oscillator power amplifier", as that redirects to an article uses the term in a completely unrelated context involving lasers. --&gt; design at 58.5 and, later, 42&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wftw.nl/gibsongirl/gibsongirl2.html|title=Wireless for the Warrior. Gibson Girl|website=wftw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were small enough to include in life rafts used on single-seat fighter aircraft.

Post-war designs included the British Search And Rescue And Homing beacon (SARAH) beacon made by [[Ultra Electronics]], used in the location and recovery of astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]] after his [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] space flight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msquair.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/results-of-the-first-manned-sub-orbital-space-flight.pdf |title=Results |date=2011 |website=msquair.files.wordpress.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. AN/URC-4 and the Soviet R 855U. These operated on the [[aircraft emergency frequency|aircraft emergency frequencies]] of 121.5 and 243&amp;nbsp;MHz (2.5 and 1.2 meter wavelengths).

===Automated beacon systems===

After a light plane with [[Hale Boggs|two U.S. congressmen]] on board went down in 1972 and could not be found,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Famous_Missing/Boggs.htm|title=Hale Boggs - Missing in Alaska|website=www.check-six.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. began requiring all aircraft to carry an [[Emergency Locator Transmitter]] (ELT) that would turn on automatically in the event of a crash. Initially these units sent [[Electric beacon|beacon]] signals on the 121.5&amp;nbsp;MHz aircraft emergency frequency. These are being phased out in favor of [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|ELTs]] that use a 406.025&amp;nbsp;MHz signal, which can be picked up by the [[Cospas-Sarsat]] international satellite system for search and rescue. Each 406&amp;nbsp;MHz beacon has a unique digital ID code. Users are required to register the code with the Cospas-Sarsat, allowing inquiries to be made when a distress signal is picked up.  Some advanced models can transmit a location derived from an internal [[GPS]] or [[GLONASS]] receiver. Maritime practice has shifted from rescue radios on 500&amp;nbsp;kHz distress frequency (which is no longer officially monitored) to the [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]], which includes use of the [[Cospas-Sarsat]] system and other measures, including [[Search and Rescue Transponder|radar transponder]]s and hand-held [[marine VHF radio]]s.

There are many other types of [[emergency locator beacon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s that do not use the 406 MHz Cospas-Sarsat system, including man-overboard beacons that transmit [[Automatic identification system]] beacons and [[Avalanche transceiver]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

==U.S. Military survival radios==
Military organizations still issue pilots and other combat personnel individual survival radios, which have become increasingly sophisticated, with built-in [[Distance Measuring Equipment]] (DME), [[Global Positioning Satellite]] receivers, and satellite communication. In slang terms "PRC" radios were called a "prick" followed by the model number, "Prick-25," and "URC" radios were called an "erk." United States military survival radios include:

'''''The Case of Wagner''''' ({{lang-de|Der Fall Wagner}}) is a book by the [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], originally published in 1888. Subtitled "A Musician's Problem", it has also been known as ''The Wagner Case'' in English. 

==Contents==
The book is a critique of [[Richard Wagner]] and the announcement of Nietzsche's rupture with the German artist, who had involved himself too much, in Nietzsche's eyes, in the [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' movement]] and [[antisemitism]]. His music is no longer represented as a possible "philosophical affect," and Wagner is [[irony|ironically]] compared to [[Georges Bizet]]. However, Nietzsche  presents Wagner as only a particular symptom of a broader "disease" that is affecting Europe: that is, [[nihilism]]. The book shows Nietzsche as a capable music-critic, and provides the setting for some of his further reflections on the nature of art and its relationship to the future health of humanity.

This work is in sharp contrast with the second part of Nietzsche's ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]],'' wherein he praised Wagner as fulfilling a need in music to go beyond the analytic and dispassionate understanding of music. Nietzsche also praised Wagner effusively in his essay "Wagner at Bayreuth" (part of the ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''), but his disillusion with Wagner the composer and the man was first seen in his 1878 work ''[[Human, All Too Human]]''.  One of the last works that Nietzsche wrote returned to the critical theme of ''The Case of Wagner''.  In ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', Nietzsche pulled together excerpts from his works to show that he consistently had the same thoughts about music, only that he had misapplied them to Wagner in the earliest works.

The '''University of Brighton Design Archives''' centres on British and global design organisations of the twentieth century. It is located within the [[University of Brighton]] Grand Parade campus in the heart of [[Brighton]] and is an international research resource.  It has many archival collections that were generated by design institutions and individual designers&lt;ref&gt;University of Brighton, "Design Archives; Projects and Exhibitions" http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/projects (accessed 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The University of Brighton Design Archives has its origins in the deposit of the archive of the [[Design Council]] (formerly the Council of Industrial Design) in 1994. The organisation was restructured by recommendation of the 1993–94,"Future Design Council" report (also known as the Sorrell Report) and consequently its records needed to be relocated.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/our-history/ Design Council website]&lt;/ref&gt;
Various repositories were considered and the [[University of Brighton]] was selected since it offered the newly established Design History Research Centre (DHRC) led by Professor Jonathan Woodham and Dr Patrick Maguire, who provided research expertise in the area of design and the state. In 1996 an award from the [[Getty Foundation]] Archive Program supported not only the acquisition of the Design Council Archive but also the appointment of a curator and a research officer.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham, Jonathan; Lyon, Philippa, eds.. Art and Design at Brighton 1859–2009: from Arts and Manufactures to the Creative and Cultural Industries. (2009) p18 Brighton: University of Brighton. world war 2
  {{ISBN|978-1-905593-58-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections development ==

The Design Archives has developed its collections since the 1990s and each archive has been acquired according to a specific collecting policy; to document aspects of twentieth-century design history with a strategic focus on the connections between them. Acquisitions have included the archives of [[James Gardner (designer)|James Gardner]] and [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]], who both worked with the [[Council of Industrial Design]] (later the Design Council) in the early parts of their career.  Subsequent additions of individual designer's archives include those of [[Alison Settle]] a journalist and editor of [[Vogue (British magazine)|British Vogue]], and Council member in the 1950s; whose archive had been deposited in the University's library.

The archives of [[Bernard Schottlander]], [[Paul Clark (designer)|Paul Clark]], and [[Barbara Jones (artist)|Barbara Jones]], designers from different periods each having connections with the Design Council's work. Communication designers [[Hans Arnold Rothholz|HA Rothholz]], [[Edwin Embleton]] and [[Anthony Froshaug]]. Architects [[Joseph Emberton]] and [[Theo Crosby]], and the display and set designer, [[Natasha Kroll]].

The archive also holds a collection of papers reflecting all aspects of the work of engineer, designer and former senior project officer at the Design Council, [[WH Mayall]].

The acquisition of the archive of the International Council of Graphic Design Associations ([[Ico-D|ICOGRADA]]) in 2002-3 marked the development of an international perspective for the collection. ICOGRADA is the professional world body for graphic design and visual communication, founded in London in 1963. The ICOGRADA archive comprises a significant body of documentation relating to governance, administration and educational activities, an important collection of 1500 posters from around the world, and library holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/archives/icograda-archive | title=ICOGRADA Archive | publisher=University of Brighton Design Archives | accessdate=23 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design]] (ICSID) archive came to the University of Brighton and further extended the international reach of the Design Archives.

== Online access ==

Since 2005 the Design Archives has contributed catalogue data to the [[Archives Hub]], a gateway to thousands of archives across more than 200 UK institutions. Records are added regularly as part of the Design Archives' ongoing cataloguing programme. Increasingly, digital objects are being added to these records.

Online access to the Design Archives' visual resources has been available in digital form since 1997–1998 with the JIDI: JISC Image Digitisation Initiative, which funded the digitisation of parts of the Design Council Photographic Library, including the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]] material.  In 1999, the Archives participated in [[Scran]] (Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network), contributing images of exhibits at the 1947 Enterprise Scotland Exhibition. A further 3,000 images were added to the [[VADS (organisation)|Visual Arts Data Service]] for free public access in 2001.

In 2000, the Design Archives developed a more structured e-learning resource, 'Designing Britain 1945–1975: The Visual Experience of Post-War Society'. A £132,000 grant from [[Jisc]] supported the creation of seven modules, each containing around 100 visual records and contextual texts by subject specialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vads.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/about.html Designing Britain website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Design Archives was one of eleven image collections to take part in the JISC-funded 'Digital Images for Education' project, receiving £43,000 in funding, and delivering over 2,300 images from across the wealth of its holdings to this subscription-based service, launched in 2011. The key emphasis of this resource is on film and digital images that capture local history, UK history, and world history during the preceding 25 years.  The Archives was also among nine Higher Education partners contributing data and expertise to the "Look Here!" Project, funded and led by the Visual Arts Data Service. In 2015 the Design Archives won funding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amplification Awards|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/amplificationawards/|website=Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] for the project Exploring British Design, a prototype web portal to connect information about British design held in different museums, archives and libraries.

== Recent recognition ==

In 2009 the Design Archives team was expanded as a result of further investment by the University of Brighton.

In recognition of its national and international role in higher education, the Design Archives received a 3-year [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) grant of £180,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Snoad, Laura. [http://www.designweek.co.uk/design-archives-gets-higher-education-grant/3017052.article "Design Archives gets higher education grant."] Design Week 25, 32 (13 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The award followed a review of university museums and galleries, led by Sir [[Muir Russell]], which resulted in HEFCE widening its definition of university collections eligible for support. In 2017, the Design Archives successfully reapplied for funding from this competitive source for the next four years.

The Design Archives now form part of a group of 33 university museum, galleries and collections to receive this direct support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=413043 "Cash for design archive.’] Times Higher Education Supplement (19 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The industry publication ''[[Design Week]]'' named the Design Archives as one of the five key design research collections in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Snoad, Laura. [http://www.designweek.co.uk/step-into-the-past/3014392.article "Step into the Past."] Design Week 25, no. 23 (10 June 2010): p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual semiotics''' is a sub-domain of semiotics that analyses the way visual images communicate a message.

Studies of meaning evolve from [[semiotics]], a philosophical approach that seeks to interpret messages in terms of signs and patterns of symbolism. Originating in literary and linguistic contexts, the study of [[semiotics]] (or semiology in [[France]]) has been expanding in a number of directions since the early turn-of-the-century work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the U.S. and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Ferdinand Saussure]] in France.

A sign can be a word, sound, or visual image. Saussure divides a sign into two components: the signifier, which is the sound, image, or word, and the signified, which is the concept or meaning the signifier represents. As Berger points out, the problem of meaning arises from the fact that the relation between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary and conventional. In other words, signs can mean anything we agree that they mean, as well as mean different things to different people. Nonverbal signs can produce many complex symbols and hold multiple meanings.

==Belgian input==
[[Image:Groupe Mu 1991.jpg|thumb|The Mu Group µ in 1991 : J.-M. Klinkenberg, P. Minguet, F. Edeline.]]The Belgian Mu Group ([[Groupe µ]]) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of visual semiotics, on a cognitive basis, as well as a [[visual rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;Trait of sign visual (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most signs operate on several levels—iconic as well as symbolic and/or indexical. This suggests that visual semiotic analysis may be addressing a hierarchy of meaning in addition to categories and components of meaning. As [[Umberto Eco]] explains, "what is commonly called a 'message' is in fact a ''text'' whose content is a multilevel ''discourse''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Umberto Eco|title=A Theory of Semiotics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BoXO4ItsuaMC&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=1979|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20217-8|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadening concept of text and discourse encourages additional research into how visual communication operates to create meaning. Deely explains that "at the heart of [[semiotics]] is the realization that the whole of human experience, without exception, is an interpretive structure mediated and sustained by signs." [[Semiotics]] now considers a variety of texts, using Eco's terms, to investigate such diverse areas as movies, art, advertisements, and fashion, as well as visuals. In other words, as Berger explains, "the essential breakthrough of semiology is to take linguistics as a model and apply linguistic concepts to other phenomena--texts--and not just to language itself." Anthropologists like [[Grant McCracken]] and marketing experts like [[Sydney Levy]] have even used semiotic interpretations to analyze the rich cultural meanings of products and consumer consumption behaviors as texts.

Visual texts are an important area of analysis for semioticians and particularly for scholars working with visually intensive forms such as advertising and television because images are such a central part of our [[mass communication]] sign system. Linda Scott has deconstructed the images in perfume advertising as well as in Apple's "1984" commercial using close readings of the various messages that can be interpreted from the ads. Shay Sayre has also looked at perfume advertising images and the visual rhetoric in Hungary's first free election television advertisements using [[semiotic analysis]]. Also using [[semiotics]], [[Arthur Asa Berger]] has deconstructed the meaning of the "1984" commercial as well as programs such as Cheers and films such as Murder on the Orient Express.

Systems of meaning, Culler and Berger tells us, are analyzed by looking at cultural and communication products and events as signs and then by analysing the relationship between these signs. The categories of signs and the relationships between them create a system. Barthes, for example, has analyzed the "fashion system," and classified the system of communication through fashion into two categories: image clothing and descriptive clothing. Likewise, an advertisement has its own system of meaning. We expect an appeal to purchase, either directly or implied, to be made and a product to be shown, for example, as part of the advertising system.&lt;ref&gt;Visual Communication Division of AEJMC, Washington, DC, August 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book Discourses in Place: Language in the material world, Ron Scollon and Suzie Wong Scollon note that visual semiotics has to do with turning “from the spoken, face-to-face discourses to the representations of that interaction order in images and signs” (82). Interaction order involves the various social interactions that takes place in any setting, such as being alone, being with a companion, at a meeting, watching a show etc., and it “is almost always complex,” with various interactions occurring at once (83). When it comes to images, says Scollon and Wong, there are also multiple relationships. These include the relationships between the components of a visual image, the relationships between the producers of the visual image, the relationships between the producers and the components, as well as the relationships between the components of an image and those who are viewing it. That's are the main point.

This interaction order has four main semiotic systems, says Scollon and Wong. These include represented participants, modality, composition and interactive participants. Represented participants are elements of a visual image, and are either narrative (“present unfolding actions and events or… processes of change”) or conceptual (“show abstract, comparative or generalized categories”) (Scollon and Wong 86). Modality is how true to reality a visual image is, and main indicators include color saturation, color differentiation, depth, illumination and brightness, among others. With modality, it is often found “that truth, veracity, or sincerity might be expressed in very different ways from one society to another,” with Western cultures favoring naturalistic representation, or as true to seeing it in person as possible (Scollon and Wong 89-90).

Composition is the way in which represented participants within a visual image are arranged in relation to one another, with the three main systems of compositions being ideal-real(top to bottom), given-new(left to right), and center-margin relationships (Scollon and Wong 92). So for example, when reading a menu at a fast food restaurant, the given information would be something such as “hamburger,” and the new information would be the price, read left to right and recognized in that order. As mentioned above, interactive participants, explain Scollon and Wong, are the various relationships that occur around a visual image, such as those between the producers of the image and the represented participants in that image. In this way, these four components work together to help convey the meaning of signs and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Scollon, Ronald, and Suzanne B. K. Wong Scollon. Discourses in Place: Language in the Material World. London: Routledge, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of Visual Semiotics==
The [[International Association of Visual Semiotics]] was formed in 1989. The Association, being of an international nature, recognizes three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. The Association is in French and Spanish:  Association Internationale de Sémiotique Visuelle and El Asociación Internacional de Semiótica Visual, respectively.

Congresses have been held in Blois (France) 1989,  Bilbao (Spain) 1992, Berkeley (California, USA) 1994,  São Paulo (Brazil) 1996, Siena (Italy) 1999, Québec (Canada) 2001, Mexico city 2003, Lyon (France) 2004, Istanbul (Turkey) 2007, Venice (Italy) 2010, and Buenos Aires (Argentina) 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AISV Buenos Aires 2012 |url=http://www.aisv2012.org |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* President: José Luis Caivano (University of Buenos Aires, Argentina)
* General Secretary: [[Göran Sonesson]] (University of Lund, Sweden).

Previous Presidents: [[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] (2001-2012), Paolo Fabbri (1998-2001), Ana Claudia de Oliveira (1996-1998), [[Jacques Fontanille]] (1994-1996), Fernande Saint-Martin (1990-1994), Michel Costantini (1989-1990).

Visual Semiotics are also associated with that of Film, Fashion and Advertising. it is suggested that the use of semiotics in films are used to connote a specific underlying theme like that of the nuclear bomb in Godzilla.

'''Water pollution''' is the contamination of [[Body of water|water bodies]], usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[marine pollution|ocean]]s, [[aquifer]]s and [[groundwater]]. Water pollution results when [[Contaminant|contaminants]] are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated [[wastewater]] into natural water bodies can lead to [[environmental degradation|degradation]] of [[aquatic ecosystems]]. In turn, this can lead to [[public health]] problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or [[irrigation]]. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne diseases]].&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

Water pollution can be grouped into [[surface water]] pollution. [[Marine pollution]] and [[nutrient pollution]] are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a [[storm drain]], [[wastewater treatment plant]] or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as [[Surface runoff|agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted [[bodies of water|water bodies]] can be impacted. The effects can damage individual [[species]] and impact the natural [[Biocoenosis|biological communities]] they are part of.   

The causes of water pollution include a wide range of [[chemical]]s and [[pathogen]]s as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] substances. Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of [[thermal pollution]] is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic" /&gt;{{rp|375}}   

Water pollution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriate [[Infrastructure|infrastructure]] and management plans. The infrastructure may include [[wastewater treatment plants]]. [[Sewage treatment|Sewage treatment plants]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. [[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] for farms, and [[erosion control]] from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. [[Nature-based solutions]] are another approach to prevent water pollution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Canal-pollution.jpg|thumb|Pollution in the [[Lachine Canal]], Canada]]
Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] contaminants. Due to these contaminants it either does not support a human use, such as [[drinking water]], or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities, such as fish. Natural phenomena such as [[volcano]]es, [[algae bloom]]s, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water.

Water pollution is a major global problem. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of [[water resource policy]] at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases,&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |author=Pink, Daniel H. |publisher=Yahoo |title=Investing in Tomorrow's Liquid Gold |date=April 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423172532/https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |archivedate=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://environment.about.com/od/environmentalevents/a/waterdayqa.htm |author=West, Larry |publisher=About.com |title=World Water Day: A Billion People Worldwide Lack Safe Drinking Water |date=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily.&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt; 

India and China are two countries with high levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in [[India]] die of water pollution related illness (including [[waterborne diseases]]) every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |title=An overview of diarrhea, symptoms, diagnosis and the costs of morbidity |year=2010 |work=CHNRI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512231350/http://www.inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90 percent of the [[Water resources of China|water in the cities of China]] is polluted.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-06/07/content_449451.htm China says water pollution so severe that cities could lack safe supplies]". Chinadaily.com.cn. June 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, half a billion Chinese had no access to safe drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Joseph |last2=Yardley |first2=Jim |date=2007-08-26 |title=As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/asia/26china.html |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the acute problems of water pollution in [[developing country|developing countries]], [[developed countries]] also continue to struggle with pollution problems. For example, in a report on [[water quality]] in the [[United States]] in 2009, 44 percent of assessed stream miles, 64 percent of assessed lake acres, and 30 percent of assessed [[bays]] and [[estuary|estuarine]] square miles were classified as polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=Fact Sheet: 2004 National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-F-08-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Surface water pollution ===
{{see also|Nutrient pollution}}
Surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans. A subset of surface water pollution is [[marine pollution]].

=== Marine pollution ===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|thumb|upright|A polluted river draining an abandoned [[copper mine]] on Anglesey]]

One common path of entry by [[Contaminant|contaminants]] to the sea are rivers. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations.  

Large [[gyre]]s ([[vortex]]es) in the oceans trap floating [[plastic debris]]. Plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution, potentially poisoning any creature that eats it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaikab|first=Gwyneth Dickey|date=2011-03-28|title=Marine microbes digest plastic|url=|journal=Nature|publisher=Macmillan|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=10.1038/news.2011.191|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals. This results in obstruction of digestive pathways, which leads to reduced appetite or even starvation.

There are a variety of secondary effects stemming not from the original pollutant, but a derivative condition. An example is [[silt]]-bearing [[surface runoff]], which can inhibit the penetration of sunlight through the water column, hampering [[photosynthesis]] in aquatic plants.

===Groundwater pollution===
{{Main|Groundwater pollution}}
Interactions between [[groundwater]] and [[surface water]] are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, also referred to as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution.&lt;ref name="circ1139" /&gt; By its very nature, groundwater [[aquifer]]s are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies. The distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. 

Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on [[soil]] characteristics and site geology, [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], and the nature of the contaminants. Causes of groundwater pollution include: naturally-occurring (geogenic), [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|on-site sanitation]] systems, [[sewage]], [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticide]], commercial and industrial leaks, [[hydraulic fracturing]], [[landfill leachate]].

==Categories of pollution sources==
Surface water and [[groundwater]] have often been studied and managed as separate resources even though they are interrelated.&lt;ref name="circ1139"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (1998). [http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/circ1139/ "Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource."] Circular 1139.&lt;/ref&gt; Surface water seeps through the soil and becomes groundwater. Conversely, groundwater can also feed surface water sources. Sources of surface water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their origin.

===Point sources===
[[File:Jacuecanga Angra dos Reis Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brasfels.JPG|thumb|Point source pollution at a [[shipyard]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.]]

{{Further|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}

[[Point source water pollution]] refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, such as a [[water pipe|pipe]] or [[ditch]]. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]], a factory, or a city [[storm drain]]. 

The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) defines point source for [[regulation|regulatory]] enforcement purposes.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA), section 502(14), {{USC|33|1362}} (14).&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. CWA section 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-point sources===
[[Nonpoint source pollution]] refers to diffuse contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. This type of pollution is often the cumulative effect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. A common example is the leaching out of [[nitrogen]] compounds from fertilized agricultural lands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moss |first1=Brian |title=Water Pollution by Agriculture |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B |date=2008 |volume=363 |pages=659–666 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2176 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Moss2/publication/6173580_Water_Pollution_by_Agriculture/links/53d607050cf220632f3d6bf2.pdf|pmc=2610176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrient [[surface runoff|runoff]] in [[stormwater|storm water]] from "sheet flow" over an [[agricultural field]] or a forest are also cited as examples of non-point source pollution.

[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage]]Contaminated storm water washed off of [[parking lot]]s, roads and highways, called [[urban runoff]], is sometimes included  under the category of non-point sources. However, because this runoff is typically channeled into storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to local surface waters, it becomes a point source.

==Contaminants and their sources==
{{Further|Wastewater|Sewage|Industrial wastewater}}

The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of [[chemical]]s, [[pathogen]]s, and physical changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring ([[calcium]], [[sodium]], iron, [[manganese]], etc.) the [[concentration]] usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. High concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna.

[[Oxygen]]-depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter (e.g. leaves and grass) as well as man-made chemicals. Other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) which blocks light and disrupts plant growth, and clogs the [[gill]]s of some fish species.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact"&gt;EPA.

Alteration of water's physical chemistry includes acidity (change in [[pH]]), [[electrical conductivity]], temperature, and [[eutrophication]]. Eutrophication is an increase in the concentration of chemical nutrients in an [[ecosystem]] to an extent that increases the [[Primary production|primary productivity]] of the ecosystem. Depending on the degree of eutrophication, subsequent negative environmental effects such as [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur, affecting fish and other animal populations.

===Change in temperature===
{{Main|Thermal pollution}}
Thermal pollution is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence. Thermal pollution, unlike chemical pollution, results in a change in the physical properties of water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Pollution - Causes, Effects and Control |last=Goel |first=P.K. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-224-1839-2 |url= |accessdate= |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennish"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology of Estuaries&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Anthropogenic Effects |last=Kennish |first=Michael J. |series=Marine Science Series |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0-8493-8041-9 |url= |accessdate= |pages=415–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic"/&gt;{{rp|375}} Urban runoff may also elevate temperature in surface waters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/urban-runoff-additional-resources |title=Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=February 2003 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Fact Sheet. EPA 841-F-03-003.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers.

==Measurement==
[[File:Research- water sampling equipment.jpg|thumb|right|[[environmental science|Environmental scientists]] preparing water autosamplers.]]

Water pollution may be analyzed through several broad categories of methods: physical, chemical and biological. Most involve collection of samples, followed by specialized analytical tests. Some methods may be conducted ''[[in situ]]'', without sampling, such as temperature. Government agencies and research organizations have published standardized, validated analytical test methods to facilitate the comparability of results from disparate testing events.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{cite book |editor1-last=Baird |editor1-first=Rodger B. |editor2-last=Clesceri |editor2-first=Leonore S. |editor3-last=Eaton |editor3-first=Andrew D. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rice |editor4-first=Eugene W. |year=2012 |title=Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater |edition=22nd |url=http://www.standardmethods.org |subscription=yes |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Public Health Association |isbn=978-0875530130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
Sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods, depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. Many contamination events are sharply restricted in time, most commonly in association with rain events. For this reason "grab" samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. Scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto-sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] intervals.

Sampling for biological testing involves collection of plants and animals from the surface water body. Depending on the type of assessment, the organisms may be identified for [[biosurvey]]s (population counts) and returned to the water body, or they may be dissected for [[bioassay]]s to determine [[toxicity]].
{{Further|Water quality#Sampling and measurement}}

===Physical testing===
Common physical tests of water include temperature, solids concentrations (e.g., [[total suspended solids]] (TSS)) and turbidity.

===Chemical testing===
{{See also|water chemistry analysis|environmental chemistry}}
Water samples may be examined using the principles of [[analytical chemistry]]. Many published test methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds. Frequently used methods include [[pH]], [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD),&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David|title=Chemistry of the Environment|year=2008|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0-8160-7747-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD),&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;{{rp|104}} nutrients ([[nitrate]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds), metals (including copper, [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], lead and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]), oil and grease, total [[petroleum]] hydrocarbons (TPH), and [[pesticide]]s.

===Biological testing===
{{Main|Bioindicator}}
Biological testing involves the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They are any [[indicator species|biological species]] or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a group of bio-indicators are the [[copepod]]s and other small water [[crustacean]]s that are present in many water bodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological, or behavioral) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.

==Control of pollution==
===Municipal wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Sewage treatment|Wastewater treatment}}
[[File:Deer Island MA.JPG|right|thumb|[[Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant|Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant]] serving Boston, Massachusetts and vicinity.]]
In urban areas of developed countries, municipal [[wastewater]] (or [[sewage]]) is typically treated by centralized [[sewage treatment plants]]. Well-designed and operated systems (i.e., with secondary treatment steps or more advanced treatment) can remove 90 percent or more of the pollutant load in sewage. Some plants have additional systems to remove [[Nutrient|nutrients]] and pathogens, but these more advanced treatment steps get progressively more expensive.

[[Nature-based solutions]] are also being used instead of (or in combination with) centralized treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s or [[Combined sewer|combined sewer overflows]] employ one or more [[environmental engineering|engineering]] approaches to reduce discharges of untreated sewage, including:
* utilizing a [[green infrastructure]] approach to improve storm water management capacity throughout the system, and reduce the [[hydraulic]] overloading of the treatment plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2010 |title=Green Infrastructure Case Studies |chapter=Case Study: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100FTEM.txt |publisher=EPA |pages=49–51 |id=EPA-841-F-10-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* repair and replacement of leaking and malfunctioning equipment&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;
* increasing overall hydraulic capacity of the sewage collection system (often a very expensive option).

=== On-site sanitation and safely managed sanitation ===
{{Further|Sanitation}}
Households or businesses not served by a municipal treatment plant may have an individual [[septic tank]], which pre-treats the wastewater on site and infiltrates it into the soil. This can lead to [[groundwater pollution]] if not properly done.

Globally, about 4.5 billion people currently (in 2017) do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]], according to an estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of access to sanitation often leads to water pollution, e.g. via the practice of [[open defecation]]: during rain events or floods, the [[human feces]] are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. Simple [[pit latrines]] may also get flooded during rain events. The use of safely managed sanitation services would prevent this type of water pollution.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;

===Industrial wastewater treatment===
{{Main article|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
[[File:REDOX DAF unit 225 m3-h-1000 GPM.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dissolved air flotation]] system for treating industrial wastewater.]]
Some industrial facilities generate wastewater that is similar to domestic sewage and can be treated by sewage treatment plants. Industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease), toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia, need specialized treatment systems. Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove the pollutants, and then discharge the partially treated [[wastewater]] to the municipal sewer system. Industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own treatment systems. Some industries have been successful at redesigning their manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants, through a process called [[pollution prevention]].

To remove heat from wastewater generated by [[Power station|power plants]] or [[Factory|manufacturing plants]] the following technologies are used:
*[[cooling pond]]s, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]
*[[cooling tower]]s, which transfer [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through [[evaporation]] or [[heat transfer]]
*[[cogeneration]], a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic or industrial heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Profile of the Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation Industry |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=50000H5P.txt |publisher=EPA |date=September 1997 |id=EPA/310-R-97-007 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment}}
'''Non point source controls'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) washed off fields is the largest source of [[agricultural pollution]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact" /&gt; Farmers may utilize [[erosion control]]s to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops and installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="NRCS-NCPS"&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Washington, DC.  [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/cp/ncps/ "National Conservation Practice Standards."] National Handbook of Conservation Practices.

Nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) are typically applied to farmland as commercial [[fertilizer]], animal [[manure]], or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/integrated-pest-management-ipm-principles |title=Integrated Pest Management Principles |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Pest Control and Pesticide Safety for Consumers |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Confined-animal-feeding-operation.jpg|thumb|Feedlot in the United States]]
'''Point source wastewater treatment'''&lt;br /&gt;
Farms with large livestock and poultry operations, such as [[factory farm]]s, are called ''concentrated animal feeding operations'' or ''feedlots'' in the US and are being subject to increasing government regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Des Moines, IA. [http://www.iowadnr.gov/afo/ "Animal Feeding Operations in Iowa."] Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal [[slurry|slurries]] are usually treated by containment in [[anaerobic lagoon]]s before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. [[Constructed wetland]]s are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes. Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with [[straw]] and [[Composting|composted]] at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement.

===Erosion and sediment control from construction sites===
[[File:Silt fence EPA.jpg|right|thumb|[[Silt fence]] installed on a construction site.]]
Sediment from construction sites is managed by installation of:
* [[erosion control]]s, such as [[mulch]]ing and [[hydroseeding]], and
* [[sediment control]]s, such as [[sediment basin]]s and [[silt fence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Nashville, TN (2012). [http://tnepsc.org/handbook.asp "Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharge of toxic chemicals such as motor fuels and concrete washout is prevented by use of:
* spill prevention and control plans, and
* specially designed containers (e.g. for concrete washout) and structures such as overflow controls and diversion berms.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=February 2012 |title=Concrete Washout |series=Stormwater Best Management Practice |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater-documents |publisher=EPA |id=BMP fact sheet. EPA 833-F-11-006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control of urban runoff (storm water)===
{{Main|Urban runoff}}
{{See also|Green infrastructure}}
[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|right|thumb|[[Retention basin]] for controlling [[urban runoff]]]]
Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of storm water, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. Local governments use a variety of storm water management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. These techniques, called [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] (BMPs) in the U.S., may focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS"&gt;
{{cite report |date=August 1999 |title=Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices |chapter=Ch. 5: Description and Performance of Storm Water Best Management Practices |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-R-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollution prevention practices include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact development]] techniques, installation of [[green roof]]s and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |title=Low Impact Development and Other Green Design Strategies |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219220712/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |archive-date=2015-02-19 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff mitigation systems include [[infiltration basin]]s, [[bioretention]] systems, constructed [[wetland]]s, [[retention basin]]s and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;California Stormwater Quality Association. Menlo Park, CA. [https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks/municipal-bmp-handbook "Municipal BMP Handbook."] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Trenton, NJ. [http://www.njstormwater.org/bmp_manual2.htm "New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual."] April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal pollution from runoff can be controlled by storm water management facilities that absorb the runoff or direct it into [[groundwater]], such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;{{Rp|p. 5–58|date=May 2012}}

'''Znamenny Chant''' ({{lang-ru|Знаменное пение, знаменный распев}}) is a singing tradition used in the [[Russia]]n [[Orthodox Church]]. Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|крюки|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|знамёна|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Modes (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness.{{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}} There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.

==Notation==
Znamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znamëna'' (Russian for "marks", "banners") or ''Kryuki'' ("hooks"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure.

The stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.

The most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called "little dove" (Russian: голубчик ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]].

After the fall of [[Kievan Rus']] to the [[Mongols]], the Znamenny Chant and stolp notation continued to develop to the North (particularly in [[Novgorod]]), where it flourished and was adopted throughout the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].

Gradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.

Because of the complexity of the system, a simplification was developed by Ivan Shaidurov around 1600,&lt;ref&gt;Velimirovic, Milos. "The Present status of Research in Slavic Chant". ''Acta Musicologica''. Vol. 44, Fasc. 2 (Jul. - Dec., 1972), pp. 251&lt;/ref&gt; called "red marks" (Russian: киноварные знаки (''kinovarnye znaki'')), which consisted of small letters in red and which were placed before each Znamenny sign. These indicate the highest note of the sign it stands before. This is generally regarded as the first step towards a certain simplification of the system.

The use and evolution of the system stopped in the middle of the 17th century, after the [[raskol|church reforms]] by [[Patriarch Nikon]]. From that time Western music started to penetrate into Russian culture, and the Russian-Orthodox Church introduced a "Latin", polyphonic way of singing, based on Polish, German and Italian harmonies. The term "Latin" however was considered derogatory, since it also referred to "heretical Latin faith".  Znamenny Chant, however, has been preserved to a certain degree in the chanting traditions that are directly descended from it.

==Current usage and related traditions==

Currently, stolp notation (Znamenny signs) continues to be used by Russian [[Old Believers]], mostly in combination with the above-mentioned "red marks", as shown in the first illustration. In the 19th century [[Edinovertsy]], particularly outside Russia, have tried to move to the modern neumatic form of notation that tries to capture exact relations between [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es; and they currently use a standard [[musical notation|linear notation]].

Chanting traditions that preserve and/or are descended from the Znammeny chant include the following:

* Chanting traditions of the Russian [[Old Believers]]
** Znamenny chant proper (Знамя, Большое Знамя)
** Stolpovoy chant
** [[Demesvenny chant]] or ''Demestvo'' (Демество)
** [[Pomorsky chant]]
** [[Kievan chant]]
* '[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] Chants'
** The chanting tradition of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (known as [[Samoilka]] chant)
** [[Prostopinije]] (or Plain Chant) of the [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyns]]
* [[Valaam chant]]

The [[Strochnoy chant]] (early Russian [[polyphony]]) was also based on Znamenny chant, and although it is not widely used in the church practice now, it can be occasionally performed by some choirs. Many Russian composers ([[Sergei Rachmaninov]], [[Alexander Grechaninov]], [[Vladimir Martynov]]) studied Znamenny chant and used it in their compositions. There are also many adaptations of Znamenny melodies for four-part choir, popular in both Russia and abroad.

==Performing practice==
Because Znamenny Chant requires a specific manner of performance, the chant books contain several instructions as to dynamics and tempo. For the Old Believers church chant also has an educational function: one has to sing in such a way that the sound astonishes the ear and the truth, enclosed in the chants, penetrates the heart. Znamenny performance practice excludes classical vocal training.  Singers perform with their own, natural voices, sometimes in a style reminiscent of folk music. Znamenny Chant does not have any pauses or rests, and all chants are performed fluently. Ideally, singers will sing in such a way that their voices become united in one single voice.   
Originally Znamenny Chant was performed only by male voices. Today, on account of the small number of people able to sing at church services and the evolution of the tradition, it is usually performed by both male and female voices.
