The '''Acharius Medal''' is awarded for lifetime achievement in [[lichenology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lichenology.org/index.html?/Awards/Awards.html |title=Plant Science Bulletin, Volume 39, Issue 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Acharius Medal was made by the [[Myntverket|Royal Swedish Mint]] for the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1846, although the medal's original purpose has not been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.org/plantsciencebulletin/psb-1993-39-1.php |title=International Association for Lichenology (IAL) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621033335/http://botany.org/plantsciencebulletin/psb-1993-39-1.php |archivedate=2010-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1990 meeting at [[Regensburg]], the [[International Association for Lichenology]] (IAL) resolved that it would simultaneously honor professional achievement, and commemorate [[Erik Acharius]] (recognized as the "Father of Lichenology"), by presenting a medal in his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-hotel.uu.se/evolmuseum/fytotek/acharius.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114065315/http://www-hotel.uu.se/evolmuseum/fytotek/acharius.html |archivedate=2008-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lichenology.org/Publications/ILN/ILN_25_3.pdf International Lichenological Newsletter, volume 25, number 3 (December 1992), pp 12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Swedish Mint still had the [[coin die|die]]s for the 1846 medal, the IAL arranged for new medals to be made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lichenology.org/Publications/ILN/ILN_25_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the new medals were awarded in that same year (1992) at the association's congress in [[Båstad]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=103|title=Lichenological contributions in honour of David Galloway |author=Ingvar Kärnefelt |author2=David J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6206">In [[biochemistry]], two [[biopolymer]]s are '''antiparallel''' if they run [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other but with opposite [[directionality (molecular biology)|alignment]]s. An example is the two [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strands of a [[DNA]] [[nucleic acid double helix|double helix]], which [[antiparallel (mathematics)#Antiparallel vectors|run in opposite directions]] alongside each other.

==Nucleic acids==
[[Nucleic acid]] molecules have a [[phosphoryl]] (5') end and a [[hydroxyl]] (3') end. This notation follows from [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|organic chemistry nomenclature]], and can be used to define the movement of enzymes such as [[DNA polymerase]]s relative to the DNA strand in a non-arbitrary manner.

=== G-quadruplexes ===
[[File:G-quadruplex (G4) structure.png|thumb|283x283px|The different types of topologies in G-quadruplex, propeller, lateral, and diagonal.]]
[[G-quadruplex]]es, also known as G4 DNA are secondary structures found in nucleic acids that are rich in guanine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Routh ED, Creacy SD, Beerbower PE, Akman SA, Vaughn JP, Smaldino PJ | title = A G-quadruplex DNA-affinity Approach for Purification of Enzymatically Active G4 Resolvase1 | language = en | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 121 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28362374 | doi = 10.3791/55496 | url = https://www.jove.com/video/55496/a-g-quadruplex-dna-affinity-approach-for-purification-enzymatically }}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are normally located at the ends of the chromosomes known as the telomeric regions. The G-quadruplex can either be parallel or antiparallel depending on the loop configuration, which is a component of the structure. If all the DNA strands run in the same direction, it is termed to be a parallel quadruplex, and is known as a strand-reversal/propeller, connecting adjacent parallel strands. If one or more of the DNA strands run in opposite direction, it is termed as an anti-parallel quadruplex, and can either be in a form of a lateral/edgewise, connecting adjacent anti-parallel strands, or a diagonal, joining two diagonally opposite strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burge S, Parkinson GN, Hazel P, Todd AK, Neidle S | title = Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 19 | pages = 5402–15 | date = 2017-04-01 | pmid = 17012276 | pmc = 1636468 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of these G-quadruplexes can be determined by a cation.

===DNA replication===
In DNA, the 5' [[carbon]] is located at the top of the [[leading strand]], and the 3' carbon is located at the lower section of the [[lagging strand]]. The [[nucleic acid sequence]]s are complementary and parallel, but they go in opposite directions, hence the antiparallel designation.&lt;ref name=knex&gt;{{cite web | last = Benson | first  =Gary | name-list-format = vanc | title = Anti-Parallel Strands | url = http://tandem.bu.edu/knex/anti.parallel.knex.html |work=K*Nex DNA Modeling |publisher=Boston University |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antiparallel structure of DNA is important in [[DNA replication]] because it replicates the leading strand one way and the lagging strand the other way. During DNA replication the leading strand is replicated continuously whereas the lagging strand is replicated in segments known as [[Okazaki fragments]].

==== Anti-parallelism in biochemistry  ====
The importance of an antiparallel DNA double helix structure is because of its hydrogen bonding between the complimentary nitrogenous base pairs. If the DNA structure were to be parallel, the hydrogen bonding would not be possible, as the base pairs would not be paired in the known way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1998-11/910892899.Mb.r.html|title=Re: Why are the two strands of a DNA molecule antiparallel?|last=PhD|first=Kenneth P MItton,|website=www.madsci.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four base pairs are: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, where adenine compliments thymine, and guanine compliments cytosine. [[Transcription (biology)|Transcription]] would be another problem if the DNA structure were to be parallel, making no sense of the information being read from the DNA. This would further lead to the creation of producing the incorrect proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/27839/why-is-dna-antiparallel-can-it-be-parallel|title=why is DNA antiparallel? Can it be parallel?|website=biology.stackexchange.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polypeptides==
[[Polypeptide]]s have an [[N-terminus]] and a [[C-terminus]], which refer to the ends of the polymer in a way that reflects the direction in which the polymer was [[protein biosynthesis|synthesized]]. The chronological sequence of each [[amino acid]] [[monomer|sub-unit]] is the basis for directionality notation in polypeptides; a given [[protein structure|protein]] can be represented as its set of unique [[amino acid#Table of standard amino acid abbreviations and properties|amino acid abbreviations]] within an N-terminus and a C-terminus.

===Beta sheet===
[[File:Beta sheets.svg|thumb|440x440px|Antiparallel and parallel beta sheet]]
Many proteins may adopt a [[beta sheet]] as part of their [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]]. In beta sheets, sections of a single polypeptide may run side-by-side and antiparallel to each other, to allow for [[hydrogen bond]]ing between their [[backbone chain]]s. Beta sheets can also be either a parallel or anti-parallel secondary structure. However, an anti-parallel beta sheet is significantly more stable than a parallel structure due to their well aligned H-bonds, which are at a 90° angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/educmat/phy456/456lec01.htm | title = Secondary structure of Proteins | website = www.chembio.uoguelph.ca | access-date = 2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Army engineering maintenance''' consists of those [[engineers]], [[technicians]], and military organizations responsible for the expert repair and maintenance of [[army]] vehicles,  weapon systems, and other equipment.

Army engineering maintenance should not be confused with [[military engineering]] which is distinctly separate and analogous to [[civil engineering]] while the former analogous to [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].

== Operational and tactical level focus ==
At the operational and tactical levels, army engineering maintenance is focused on the repair and scheduled maintenance work required to keep army equipment fleets operational.

== Strategic level focus ==
At the strategic level, army engineering maintenance is closely linked to [[military logistics]].  At this level, it includes work such as the design, development, and testing of new vehicles and weapon systems.  It also includes [[Product lifecycle management|lifecycle management]] activities once new systems become operational.

&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Attribution of recent climate change''' is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent [[climate change]]s on [[Earth]], commonly known as '[[global warming]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html|title=NASA - What's in a Name? Global Warming vs. Climate Change|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of [[instrumental temperature record]], particularly in the last 50 years. This is the period when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the [[troposphere|atmosphere above the surface]] have become available. According to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), it is "extremely likely"&lt;ref&gt;The IPCC defines "extremely likely" as indicating a probability of 95 to 100%, based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence. {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013}}, Section: [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf Summary for Policymakers (finalized version)], page 4, footnote 2.
&lt;/ref&gt; that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013}}, Section: [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf Summary for Policymakers (finalized version)], Chapter: D.3 Detection and Attribution of Climate Change, page 17.  &lt;/ref&gt; The best estimate is that observed warming since 1951 has been entirely human caused.&lt;ref&gt;"The likely range of the human contribution to the global mean temperature increase over the period 1951–2010 is 1.1° to 1.4°F (0.6° to 0.8°C), and the central estimate of the observed warming of 1.2°F (0.65°C) lies within this range (high confidence). This translates to a likely human contribution of 93%–123% of the observed 1951–2010 change." [https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/3/ Chapter 3: Detection and Attribution of Climate Change], ''Climate Science Special Report '', U.S. Global Change Research Program. &lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the main human activities that contribute to global warming are:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, chapter "[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-7.html 9.7  Combining Evidence of Anthropogenic Climate Change]"&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] concentrations of [[greenhouse gas]]es
* global changes to land surface, such as [[deforestation]]
* increasing atmospheric concentrations of [[aerosol]]s.
In addition to human activities, some natural mechanisms can also cause [[climate change]], including for example, [[climate oscillation]]s, changes in [[Solar activity and climate|solar activity]], and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

Multiple lines of evidence support attribution of recent climate change to human activities:&lt;ref name="epa endangerment fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100BVZS.txt|title=EPA's Endangerment Finding Climate Change Facts|last=&lt;!--not specified--&gt;|first=|date=2009|website=National Service Center for Environmental Publications (NSCEP)|at=|format=|id=Report ID: 430F09086|access-date=22 December 2017}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
* A basic [[physics|physical]] understanding of the [[climate]] system: greenhouse gas concentrations have increased and their warming properties are well-established.
* Historical estimates of past climate changes suggest that the recent changes in global surface temperature are unusual.
* Computer-based [[climate model]]s are unable to replicate the observed warming unless human greenhouse gas emissions are included.
* Natural forces alone (such as solar and volcanic activity) cannot explain the observed warming.

The IPCC's attribution of recent global warming to human activities is a view shared by the scientific community,&lt;ref name=nrc2001&gt;{{cite book

External forcings include natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun's output.&lt;ref&gt;Le Treut ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1.html Chapter 1: Historical Overview of Climate Change Science], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-1-1.html FAQ 1.1, What Factors Determine Earth's Climate?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Human activities can also impose forcings, for example, through changing the composition of the atmosphere.

[[Radiative forcing]] is a measure of how various factors alter the [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]] of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Forster ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2.html Chapter 2: Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and Radiative Forcing], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-2-1.html FAQ 2.1, How do Human Activities Contribute to Climate Change and How do They Compare with Natural Influences?] in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A positive radiative forcing will tend to increase the energy of the Earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. Between the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the atmospheric concentration of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] ([[chemical formula]]: {{CO2}}) led to a positive radiative forcing, averaged over the Earth's [[surface area]], of about 1.66 [[watt]]s per square metre (abbreviated W&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="ipcc radiative forcing"&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spm.html Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-human-and.html Human and Natural Drivers of Climate Change], Figure SPM.2, in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate system will show internal variability both in the presence and absence of forcings imposed on it, (see images opposite). This internal variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the atmosphere and [[ocean]] (see also the later section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Internal climate variability and global warming|Internal climate variability and global warming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Albritton ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/010.htm Technical Summary], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/011.htm#box1 Box 1: What drives changes in climate?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of internal variability is the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].

Detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the IPCC.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/439.htm Chapter 12: Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/443.htm#1211 Section 12.1.1: The Meaning of Detection and Attribution], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Detection of a climate signal does not always imply significant attribution. The IPCC's [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] says "it is ''extremely likely'' that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750," where "extremely likely" indicates a probability greater than 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}, chapter "[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-6.html TS.6 Robust Findings and Key Uncertainties]"&lt;/ref&gt; ''Detection'' of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is [[Statistical significance|statistically significantly]] different from that which can be explained by natural internal variability.

''Attribution'' requires demonstrating that a signal is:
* unlikely to be due entirely to internal variability;
* consistent with the estimated responses to the given combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing
* not consistent with alternative, physically plausible explanations of recent climate change that exclude important elements of the given combination of forcings.

===Land use===
Climate change is attributed to [[land use]] for two main reasons. Between 1750 and 2007, about two-thirds of anthropogenic [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] emissions were produced from burning fossil fuels, and about one-third of emissions from changes in land use,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation both reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by deforested regions and releases greenhouse gases directly, together with aerosols, through [[slash and burn|biomass burning]] that frequently accompanies it.

A second reason that climate change has been attributed to land use is that the [[albedo|terrestrial albedo]] is often altered by use, which leads to [[radiative forcing]]. This effect is more significant locally than globally.&lt;ref name="Technical Summary"/&gt;

[[File:Climate Change Attribution.png|250px |thumb |alt=Refer to caption |One [[global climate model]]'s reconstruction of temperature change during the 20th century as the result of five studied forcing factors and the amount of temperature change attributed to each.]]
Over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This has led to increases in mean global temperature, or [[global warming]]. Other human effects are relevant—for example, sulphate [[aerosol]]s are believed to have a cooling effect. Natural factors also contribute. According to the [[historical temperature record]] of the last century, the Earth's near-surface air temperature has risen around 0.74 [[Plus-minus sign|±]] 0.18&amp;nbsp;°Celsius (1.3 ± 0.32&amp;nbsp;°Fahrenheit).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.ucar.edu/climate/faq/how-much-has-global-temperature-risen-last-100-years UCAR FAQ: How much has global temp. risen over the past 100 years?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A historically important question in climate change research has regarded the relative importance of human activity and non-[[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] causes during the period of [[instrumental temperature record|instrumental record]]. In the 1995 [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report]] (SAR), the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] made the widely quoted statement that "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate". The phrase "balance of evidence" suggested the (English) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as "beyond reasonable doubt". In 2001 the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] (TAR) refined this, saying "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities".&lt;ref name="WG1-2001-SPM"/&gt; The 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) strengthened this finding:
* "Anthropogenic warming of the climate system is widespread and can be detected in temperature observations taken at the surface, in the free atmosphere and in the oceans. Evidence of the effect of external influences, both anthropogenic and natural, on the climate system has continued to accumulate since the TAR."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ts.html Technical Summary], [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf p. ?].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other findings of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report include:
*"It is ''extremely unlikely'' (&lt;5%)&lt;ref name="ar4 uncertainty"&gt;
In the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, the following scale is used to quantify uncertainty: "virtually certain" &gt;99%; "extremely likely" &gt;95%; "very likely" &gt;90%; "likely" &gt;66%; "more likely than not" &gt;50%; "about as likely as not" 33 to 66%; "unlikely" &lt;33%; "very unlikely" &lt;10%; "extremely unlikely" &lt;5%; "exceptionally unlikely" &lt;1%. {{citation

Over the past five decades there has been a global warming of approximately 0.65&amp;nbsp;°C (1.17&amp;nbsp;°F) at the Earth's surface (see [[historical temperature record]]). Among the possible factors that could produce changes in global mean temperature are internal variability of the climate system, external forcing, an increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, or any combination of these. Current studies indicate that the increase in greenhouse gases, most notably {{CO2}}, is mostly responsible for the observed warming. Evidence for this conclusion includes:
* Estimates of internal variability from climate models, and reconstructions of past temperatures, indicate that the warming is unlikely to be entirely natural.
* Climate models forced by natural factors ''and'' increased greenhouse gases and aerosols reproduce the observed global temperature changes; those forced by natural factors alone do not.&lt;ref name="WG1-2001-SPM"&gt;IPCC, [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/007.htm Summary for Policymakers].{{page needed|date=September 2011}} in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG1|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Older data are insufficient to provide reliable hemispheric temperature estimates.&lt;ref name="noaa nh temp for last 1300 years"/&gt;]]
Recent scientific assessments find that most of the warming of the Earth's surface over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities (see also the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Scientific literature and opinion|scientific literature and opinion]]). This conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence. Like the warming "signal" that has gradually emerged from the "noise" of natural climate variability, the scientific evidence for a human influence on global climate has accumulated over the past several decades, from many hundreds of studies. No single study is a "[[smoking gun]]." Nor has any single study or combination of studies undermined the large body of evidence supporting the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming.&lt;!-- Most of the preceding paragraph drawn from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first line of evidence is based on a physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like [[tree ring]]s and [[coral]]s) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier [[isotope]]s of [[oxygen]] in [[ice core]]s), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The third line of evidence is based on the broad, qualitative consistency between observed changes in climate and the computer model simulations of how climate would be expected to change in response to human activities. For example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the Earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content and the temperature of the lower atmosphere, a [[current sea level rise|rise]] in global sea level, retreat of [[sea ice]] and [[snow]] cover, cooling of the [[stratosphere]], an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, and changes in large-scale [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[atmospheric pressure|pressure patterns]]. These and other aspects of modelled climate change are in agreement with observations.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph is from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Those that only include natural influences (blue line, based on many models) show a slight cooling, which has not occurred.&lt;ref name="lindsey 20th century gmt simulations"/&gt; The ability of models to generate reasonable histories of global temperature is verified by their response to four 20th-century volcanic eruptions: each eruption caused brief cooling that appeared in observed as well as modeled records.&lt;ref name="lindsey 20th century gmt simulations"/&gt;]]

Finally, there is extensive [[statistical]] evidence from so-called "fingerprint" studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as each person has a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate changes that have occurred since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These projections have been confirmed by observations (shown above).&lt;ref name="schneider fingerprint"/&gt;}}
For example, when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another fingerprint of human effects on climate has been identified by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on [[Attribution of recent climate change#Solar activity|solar activity]]). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the [[tropopause]] (the boundary between the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]], which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, [[drought]], surface pressure, and the [[surface runoff|runoff]] from major [[river basin]]s.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies published after the appearance of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric [[moisture]] (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of [[Arctic sea ice]] extent, and in the patterns of changes in [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] surface temperatures.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence – the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis. As noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports the case for a pronounced human influence on global climate. Much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. For example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in [[snowpack]], maximum and minimum ([[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]]) temperature, and the seasonal timing of runoff over [[mountain]]ous regions of the [[western United States]]. Human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in [[hurricane]] formation regions. Researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For over a decade, one aspect of the climate change story seemed to show a significant difference between models and observations. In the [[tropics]], all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the [[satellite]] and [[weather balloon]] data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Natural influences on temperature—El Niño, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols—have varied approximately plus and minus 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C (0.4&amp;nbsp;°F), (averaging to about zero), while human influences have contributed roughly 0.8&amp;nbsp;°C (1&amp;nbsp;°F) of warming since 1889.&lt;ref name="riebeek 20th century contributions"/&gt;]]

This does not mean, however, that all remaining differences between models and observations have been resolved. The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, some aspects of precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting is that most of the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.&lt;!-- The preceding paragraph was copied from the following reference: --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hansen ''et al.'' (2012),&lt;ref name="climate dice"/&gt; the distribution of anomalies has shifted to the right as a consequence of global warming, meaning that unusually hot summers have become more common. This is analogous to the rolling of a dice: cool summers now cover only half of one side of a six-sided die, white covers one side, red covers four sides, and an extremely hot (red-brown) anomaly covers half of one side.&lt;ref name="climate dice"/&gt;]]
One of the subjects discussed in the literature is whether or not extreme weather events can be attributed to human activities. Seneviratne ''et al.'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; stated that attributing individual extreme weather events to human activities was challenging. They were, however, more confident over attributing changes in long-term trends of extreme weather. For example, Seneviratne ''et al.'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that human activities had likely led to a warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale.

Another way of viewing the problem is to consider the effects of human-induced climate change on the probability of future extreme weather events. Stott ''et al.'' (2003),&lt;ref name="stott 2003 european heat wave"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; for example, considered whether or not human activities had increased the risk of severe [[heat wave]]s in [[Europe]], like the one [[2003 European heat wave|experienced in 2003]]. Their conclusion was that human activities had very likely more than doubled the risk of heat waves of this magnitude.&lt;ref name="stott 2003 european heat wave"/&gt;

An analogy can be made between an [[sportsperson|athlete]] on [[Doping in sport|steroid]]s and human-induced climate change.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that an athlete's performance may increase from using steroids, human-induced climate change increases the risk of some extreme weather events.

Hansen ''et al.'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Hansen|others|2012|p=1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that human activities have greatly increased the risk of summertime heat waves. According to their analysis, the land area of the Earth affected by very hot summer temperature anomalies has greatly increased over time (refer to graphs on the left). In the base period 1951-1980, these anomalies covered a few tenths of 1% of the global land area.&lt;ref name="hansen 2012 discussion"&gt;
Discussion, in {{harvnb|Hansen|others|2012|pp=6–7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, this has increased to around 10% of the global land area. With high confidence, Hansen ''et al.'' (2012)&lt;ref name="hansen 2012 discussion"/&gt; attributed the [[2010 Russian heat wave|2010 Moscow]] and [[2010–12 Southern United States drought|2011 Texas heat wave]]s to human-induced global warming.

&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the 2010 Moscow heatwave was mostly due to natural weather variability. While not directly citing Dole ''et al.'' (2011),&lt;ref name="dole 2011 russian heat wave"/&gt; Hansen ''et al.'' (2012)&lt;ref name="hansen 2012 discussion"/&gt; rejected this type of explanation. Hansen ''et al.'' (2012)&lt;ref name="hansen 2012 discussion"/&gt; stated that a combination of natural weather variability and human-induced global warming was responsible for the Moscow and Texas heat waves.

There are a number of examples of published and informal support for the consensus view.

===Detection and attribution studies===
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007), concluded that attribution was possible for a number of observed changes in the climate (see [[effects of global warming]]). However, attribution was found to be more difficult when assessing changes over smaller regions (less than continental scale) and over short time periods (less than 50 years).&lt;ref name="hegerl 2007 executive summary"&gt;Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in
{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Over larger regions, averaging reduces natural variability of the climate, making detection and attribution easier.

* In 1996, in a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' titled "A search for human influences on the thermal structure of the atmosphere", [[Benjamin D. Santer]] et al. wrote: "The observed spatial patterns of temperature change in the free atmosphere from 1963 to 1987 are similar to those predicted by state-of-the-art climate models incorporating various combinations of changes in carbon dioxide, anthropogenic sulphate aerosol and stratospheric ozone concentrations. The degree of pattern similarity between models and observations increases through this period. It is likely that this trend is partially due to human activities, although many uncertainties remain, particularly relating to estimates of natural variability."
* A 2002 paper in the ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' says "Our analysis suggests that the early twentieth century warming can best be explained by a combination of warming due to increases in greenhouse gases and natural forcing, some cooling due to other anthropogenic forcings, and a substantial, but not implausible, contribution from internal variability. In the second half of the century we find that the warming is largely caused by changes in greenhouse gases, with changes in sulphates and, perhaps, volcanic aerosol offsetting approximately one third of the warming."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Tett SFB |authorlink1=Simon Tett |title=Estimation of natural and anthropogenic contributions to twentieth century temperature change |journal=J.

Thus, the recent research supports and strengthens the IPCC Third Assessment Report conclusion that 'most of the global warming over the past 50 years is likely due to the increase in greenhouse gases.'"
* Barnett and colleagues (2005) say that the observed warming of the oceans "cannot be explained by natural internal climate variability or solar and volcanic forcing, but is well simulated by two [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]ally forced climate models," concluding that "it is of human origin, a conclusion robust to observational sampling and model differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Barnett TP, Pierce DW, Achutarao KM |title=Penetration of human-induced warming into the world's oceans |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5732 |pages=284–7 |date=July 2005|pmid=15933161 | doi = 10.1126/science.1112418|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..284B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally this position requires new physical mechanisms to explain the observed warming.&lt;ref&gt;for example: {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s00585-000-0583-z |title=Climate hypersensitivity to solar forcing? |year=2000 |last1=Soon |first1=W. |last2=Posmentier |first2=E. |last3=Baliunas |first3=S. |journal=Annales Geophysicae |volume=18 |pages=583–588| issue = 5|bibcode = 2000AnGeo..18..583S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar activity==

[[Solar sunspot maximum]] occurs when the magnetic field of the sun collapses and reverse as part of its average 11 year [[solar cycle]] (22 years for complete North to North restoration).

The role of the sun in recent climate change has been looked at by climate scientists. Since 1978, [[solar variation|output from the Sun]] has been measured by [[satellite]]s&lt;ref name=nrc2008/&gt;{{Rp|6|date=November 2012}} significantly more accurately than was previously possible from the surface. These measurements indicate that the Sun's total [[solar irradiance]] has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be directly attributed to an increase in total solar energy reaching the Earth (see graph above, left). In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and [[volcanic activity]] probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;Global Climate Change, in {{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-9-2.html Frequently Asked Question 9.2: Can the Warming of the 20th century be Explained by Natural Variability?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in total solar irradiance and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings. As has already been stated, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) concluded that greenhouse gas forcing had "very likely" caused most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. In making this conclusion, Hegerl ''et al.'' (2007) allowed for the possibility that climate models had been underestimated the effect of solar forcing.&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in
{{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of solar activity in climate change has also been calculated over [[paleoclimatology|longer time periods]] using "proxy" datasets, such as [[tree rings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Models indicate that solar and volcanic forcings can explain periods of relative warmth and cold between [[Anno Domini|A.D.]]&amp;nbsp;1000 and 1900, but human-induced forcings are needed to reproduce the late-20th century warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Models and observations (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming of the lower atmosphere at the surface (called the [[troposphere]]) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the [[stratosphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-9-2.html Frequently Asked Question 9.2: Can the Warming of the 20th century be Explained by Natural Variability?], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}. &lt;!-- Hegerl --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[ozone depletion|Depletion]] of the [[ozone layer]] by chemical [[refrigerant]]s has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming at the top of the stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Karl|others|2009}}, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. [[Hadley cells]] are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Celeste M.

&lt;/ref&gt; A number of commenters had argued that recent climate change could be attributed to changes in solar irradiance. According to the US EPA (2009), this attribution was not supported by the bulk of the [[scientific literature]]. Citing the work of the IPCC (2007), the US EPA pointed to the low contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Over this time period (1750 to 2005),&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spm.html Summary for Policymakers],

===Effect of cosmic rays===
[[Henrik Svensmark]] has suggested that the [[magnetic]] activity of the sun deflects [[cosmic ray]]s, and that this may influence the generation of [[cloud condensation nuclei]], and thereby have an effect on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;

{{harvnb|Erlykin|others|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; found that the evidence showed that connections between solar variation and climate were more likely to be mediated by direct variation of insolation rather than cosmic rays, and concluded: "Hence within our assumptions, the effect of varying solar activity, either by direct solar irradiance or by varying cosmic ray rates, must be less than 0.07 °C since 1956, i.e. less than 14% of the observed global warming."

{{harvnb|Pittock|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; review the recent and historical literature in this field and continue to find that the link between cosmic rays and climate is tenuous, though they encourage continued research. US EPA (2009)&lt;ref name="epa cosmic rays"/&gt; commented on research by Duplissy ''et al.'' (2009):&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Duplissy|others|2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The CLOUD experiments at [[CERN]] are interesting research but do not provide conclusive evidence that cosmic rays can serve as a major source of cloud seeding. Preliminary results from the experiment (Duplissy et al., 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation, for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. These experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. There is no indication that the earlier Svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the CERN experiment. We find that the Svensmark results on cloud seeding have not yet been shown to be robust or sufficient to materially alter the conclusions of the assessment literature, especially given the abundance of recent literature that is skeptical of the cosmic ray-climate linkage&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">'''Biological integrity''' is associated with how "pristine" an [[natural environment|environment]] is and its function relative to the potential or original state of an [[ecosystem]] before human alterations were imposed. Biological integrity is built on the assumption that a decline in the values of an ecosystem's [[Aquatic ecosystem#Functions|functions]] are primarily caused by human activity or alterations. The more an environment and its original processes are altered, the less biological integrity it holds for the [[community (ecology)|community]] as a whole. If these processes were to change over time naturally, without human influence, the integrity of the ecosystem would remain intact. The integrity of the ecosystem relies heavily on the processes that occur within it because those determine what [[organism]]s can inhabit an area and the complexities of their interactions.

==History==
The concept of biological integrity first appeared in the 1972 amendments to the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"The objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." Clean Water Act, section 101(a), {{USC|33|1251(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had used the term as a way to gauge the standards to which [[water]] should be maintained, but the vocabulary instigated years of debate about the implications of not only the meaning of biological integrity, but also how it can be [[Water quality#Measurement|measured]]. The first conference about the term occurred in March 1975 called "The Integrity of Water"&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine, R.K. and L.J. Guarraia (editors)(1977). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/water/owrccatalog.nsf/e673c95b11602f2385256ae1007279fe/0fdf60b25f9fc7b585256b0600723dc0!OpenDocument ''The Integrity of Water.''] Proceedings of a Symposium, March 10–12, 1975, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. EPA Publication No. 832-R-75-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  and provided the first accepted definition of biological integrity (see below). In 1981, EPA assembled a field of experts from the U.S. [[Fish and Wildlife Service]], academia, and its own staff to further refine the definition and identify key [[bioindicator|indicators]] to quantitatively measure biological integrity. The conference not only identified a definition, but also methods to evaluate the community, and they established that multiple sites should be used to determine the condition of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.M., J.H. Gakstatter, M.A. Shirazi.and J.M. Omernik (1982). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf "An approach for determining biological integrity in flowing waters."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612221954/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }} Pages 877-888 in T.B. Brown (editor), ''In Place Resource Inventories: Principles and Practices, A National Workshop.'' Paper presented at the workshop August 9–14, 1981. [http://www.safnet.org Society of American Foresters], Bethesda, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Today, the accepted definition is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a [[species]] composition, [[species diversity|diversity]], and functional organization comparable to that of the natural [[habitat]] of the region."&lt;ref&gt;Karr, J.R. and D.R. Dudley (1981). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x96t510nu2418348/fulltext.pdf "Ecological perspectives on water quality goals."] [https://www.springer.com/environment/environmental+management/journal/267 ''Environmental Management''] 5:55-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition was adapted from Frey (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Frey, D. 1977. [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf "Biological integrity of water: an historical approach."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217084900/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }} Pages 127-140 in Ballentine and Guarraia, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this definition are that [[living systems]] have a variety of scales relative to which they exist, that one can quantify the parts that sustain or contribute to a system's functioning and that all systems must be seen in the context of their environments and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary]] history. This term primarily refers to [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] because the vocabulary is derived from the Clean Water Act, but the concepts can be applied to other ecosystems.

==Evaluation methods==
In order to quantify and evaluate the biological integrity of a system, the '''[[Index of biological integrity|Index of Biological Integrity]] (IBI)''' was created.&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. (1981). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf "Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613002834/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf |date=June 13, 2010 }} [http://afs.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-moreinfo&amp;issn=1548-8446 ''Fisheries'']{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 6:21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. 1991. [https://archive.is/20120730211209/http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941848 "Biological integrity: A long-neglected aspect of water resource management."] [http://esapubs.org/esapubs/journals/applications.htm Ecological Applications] 1:66–84.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this index the baseline biological integrity (its function before human influence) and the current functions of an ecosystem are measured against one another to evaluate how much of ecosystem's function has been preserved. The IBI evaluates the ecosystem by utilizing [[biosurvey]]s and comparing [[species richness]], indicator [[taxon|taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], and [[invasive species]]. IBIs are used primarily to evaluate [[aquatic ecosystem]]s even though one could technically apply any measurement of biological integrity to any natural ecosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1312">'''Bulliform cells''' are large, bubble-shaped [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal cells]] that occur in groups on the upper surface of the leaves of many monocots.These cells are present on the adaxial or the upper surface of the leaf. They are generally present near the mid vein. These cells are large, empty and colourless.

The mechanism of working of bulliform cells can be explained as:

During [[drought]], the loss of water through [[vacuoles]] induces the reduced bulliform cells to allow the leaves of many grass species to close as the two edges of the grass blade fold up toward each other. Once adequate water is available, these cells enlarge and the leaves are forced open again.

Folded leaves offer less exposure to sunlight, so they are heated less thus reducing evaporation and conserving the remaining water in the plant. Bulliform cells occur on the leaves of a wide variety of monocotyledon families but are probably best known in grasses. They are thought to play a role in the unfolding of developing leaves and in the rolling and unrolling of mature leaves in response to alternating wet and dry periods.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, R. et al.

'''Cambridge Science Centre''', initially located on [[Jesus Lane]] in [[Cambridge]], [[England]], is the city's first interactive science museum.

The start-up exhibition space was opened by the [[Vice-Chancellor]] of [[Cambridge University]], [[Leszek Borysiewicz]], on 7 February 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Citys-first-hands-on-science-museum-ready-for-launch-25012013.htm City's first hands-on science museum ready for launch].&lt;/ref&gt; the museum was opened to the public on 8 February 2013. Its first exhibition dealt with the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and principles of [[sound]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Its target audience is families and schools, particularly children between 7 and 14 years old.

The venture was founded by Dr. Chris Lennard and Dr. Katia Smith-Litiere, backed by technology entrepreneurs, including chairman [[David Cleevely]], [[Hermann Hauser]] and Jonathan Milner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/hi-tech/14700-p5m-funding-target-as-cambridge-science-centre-sets-up-home £5M funding target as Cambridge Science Centre sets up home].&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the exhibition space was closed for relocation. While they are relocating, Cambridge Science Centre is putting on a series of pop up science events known as 'Street Science'.

A '''camouflet''', in [[military science]], is an artificial [[cavern]] created by an [[explosion]]. If the explosion reaches the surface then it is called a [[subsidence crater|crater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/c/00811.html US MIL: Camouflet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was originally defined as a countermine dug by defenders to prevent the [[Mining (military)|undermining]] of a fortress's walls during a [[siege]]. The defenders would dig a tunnel under the attackers' tunnel. An [[explosive]] charge would be detonated to create a camouflet that would collapse the attackers' tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civilwarfortifications.com/dictionary/xgc-001.html Dictionary of Fortifications:  Camouflet]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the term has been used to describe the effects of very large bombs like the [[Grand Slam bomb]], which are designed to penetrate next to a large target structure and create a camouflet to undermine the foundations of the structure. It has been observed that it is more efficient to penetrate ground next to the target than to hit the target directly.

A camouflet set describes a system used in the [[British Army]] for cratering tracks and other routes. A tube is driven into the ground using a manual post driver. The end of the tube is a disposable steel point. A small charge connected to a detonator is lowered down the tube. The tube is then removed, and the hole tamped. The charge is then blown, leaving a void and a hole to the surface. This void is then filled with a much larger charge, which is also tamped, and then blown when required to create a crater as an obstacle. A refinement was introduced in the 1980s, with the use of a [[shaped charge]] to create the initial hole. 

Because of the presence of high levels of toxic fumes from the explosive, including [[carbon monoxide]], and the weakness of the soft earth overlying the cavern, camouflets are extremely hazardous to [[bomb disposal]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Beckingham obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10740091/Captain-Harry-Beckingham-obituary.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9944">'''Cap analysis gene expression''' ('''CAGE''') is a [[gene expression]] technique used in molecular biology to produce a snapshot of the 5′ end of the [[messenger RNA]] population in a biological sample. The small fragments (usually 27 [[nucleotide]]s long) from the very beginnings of mRNAs (5' ends of [[5' cap|capped]] transcripts) are extracted, [[reverse transcription|reverse-transcribed]] to DNA, [[PCR]] amplified and [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]]. CAGE was first published by Hayashizaki, Carninci and co-workers in 2003.&lt;ref name="Shiraki-2003"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | date=2003-12-23 | volume=100 | issue=26 | pages=15776–81 | pmid=14663149 | doi=10.1073/pnas.2136655100  | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/26/15776 | title=Cap analysis gene expression for high-throughput analysis of transcriptional starting point and identification of promoter usage | pmc=307644 | last1 = Shiraki | first1 = T | last2 = Kondo | first2 = S | last3 = Katayama | first3 = S | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CAGE has been extensively used within the [[FANTOM]] research projects.

==Analysis==
The output of CAGE is a set of short nucleotide sequences (often called ''tags'') with their observed counts.

Using a reference genome, a researcher can usually determine, with some confidence, the original [[mRNA]] (and therefore which [[gene]]) the tag was extracted from.

Copy numbers of CAGE tags provide an easy way of digital quantification of the RNA transcript abundances in biological samples.

Unlike a similar technique [[serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE, superSAGE) in which tags come from other parts of transcripts, CAGE is primarily used to locate exact [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] start sites in the genome. This knowledge in turn allows a researcher to investigate [[promoter (biology)#Promoter elements|promoter]] structure necessary for gene expression.

However, the CAGE protocol has a known bias with a nonspecific [[guanine]] (G) at the most 5′ end of the CAGE tags, which is attributed to the template-free 5′-extension during the first-strand cDNA synthesis.&lt;ref name="Zhao2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Zhao |first1= Xiaobei |year= 2011 |title= Systematic Clustering of Transcription Start Site Landscapes |journal= PLoS ONE |volume= 6 |issue= 8 |pages= e23409 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0023409 |pmid=21887249 |pmc=3160847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would induce erroneous mapping of CAGE tags, for instance to nontranscribed pseudogenes.&lt;ref name="Zhao2011" /&gt; On the other hand, this addition of Gs was also utilised as a signal to filter more reliable TSS peaks.&lt;ref name="Cumbie-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cumbie |first1= Jason |year= 2015 |title= NanoCAGE-XL and CapFilter: an approach to genome wide identification of high confidence transcription start sites |journal= BMC Genomics |volume= 16 |pages= 597 |doi= 10.1186/s12864-015-1670-6 |pmid= 26268438 |pmc= 4534009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original CAGE method (Shiraki ''et al.'', 2003)&lt;ref name="Shiraki-2003"/&gt; was using CAP Trapper&lt;ref name="Carninci-1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Carninci |first1= Piero |year= 1996 |title= High-efficiency full-length cDNA cloning by biotinylated CAP trapper. |journal= Genomics |volume= 37 |issue= 3 |pages= 327–36 |pmid= 8938445 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754396905674 |accessdate= 2013-10-16 |doi=10.1006/geno.1996.0567 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for capturing the 5′ ends, oligo-dT primers for synthesizing the cDNAs, the [[Restriction enzyme#Type II|type IIs restriction enzyme]] MmeI for cleaving the tags, and the [[Sanger sequencing|Sanger method]] for sequencing them.

Random reverse-transcription primers were introduced in 2006 by Kodzius ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Kodzius-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kodzius |first1= Rimantas |year= 2006 |title= CAGE: cap analysis of gene expression. |journal= Nat Methods |volume= 3 |issue= 3 |pages= 211–22 |doi= 10.1038/nmeth0306-211 |pmid= 16489339 |url= http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v3/n3/full/nmeth0306-211.html |accessdate= 2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to better detect the non-polyadenylated RNAs.

In ''DeepCAGE'' (Valen ''et al.'', 2008),&lt;ref name="Valen-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Valen |first1= Eivind |year= 2009 |title= Genome-wide detection and analysis of hippocampus core promoters using DeepCAGE. |journal= Genome Res. |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |pages= 255–265 |doi= 10.1101/gr.084541.108 |pmid= 19074369 |url= http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/2/255 |accessdate= 2013-10-16 |pmc=2652207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the tag concatemers were sequenced at a higher throughput on the [[454 Life Sciences|454]] “''next-generation''” sequencing platform.

In 2008, barcode multiplexing was added to the DeepCAGE protocol (Maeda ''et al.'', 2008).&lt;ref name="Maeda-2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Maeda |first1= Norihiro |year= 2008 |title= Development of a DNA barcode tagging method for monitoring dynamic changes in gene expression by using an ultra high-throughput sequencer. |journal= BioTechniques |volume= 45 |issue= 1 |pages= 95–7 |doi= 10.2144/000112814 |pmid= 18611171 |url= http://www.biotechniques.com/article/000112814 |accessdate= 2016-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''nanoCAGE'' (Plessy ''et al.'', 2010),&lt;ref name="Plessy-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Plessy |first1= Charles |year= 2010 |title= Genome-wide detection and analysis of hippocampus core promoters using DeepCAGE. |journal= Nat Methods |volume= 7 |issue= 7 |pages= 528–34 |doi= 10.1038/nmeth.1470 |pmid= 20543846 |url= http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n7/full/nmeth.1470.html |accessdate= 2013-10-16 |pmc=2906222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 5′ ends or RNAs were captured with the template-switching method instead of CAP Trapper, in order to analyze smaller starting amounts of total RNA.  Longer tags were cleaved with the [[Restriction enzyme#Type III|type III restriction enzyme]] EcoP15I and directly sequenced on the [[DNA sequencing#Illumina (Solexa) sequencing|Solexa (then Illumina)]] platform without concatenation.

The ''CAGEscan'' methodology (Plessy ''et al.'', 2010),&lt;ref name="Plessy-2010"/&gt; where the enzymatic tag cleavage is skipped, and the 5′ cDNAs sequenced [[Paired-end tag|paired-end]], was introduced in the same article to connect novel promoters to known annotations.

With ''HeliScopeCAGE'' (Kanamori-Katayama ''et al.'', 2011),&lt;ref name="Kanamori-Katayama-2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kanamori-Katayama |first1= Mutsumi |year= 2011 |title= Unamplified cap analysis of gene expression on a single-molecule sequencer. |journal= Genome Res. |volume= 21 |issue= 7 |pages= 1150–9 |doi= 10.1101/gr.115469.110 |pmid= 21596820 |url= http://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/7/1150.long |accessdate= 2013-10-16 |pmc=3129257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the CAP-trapped CAGE protocol was changed to skip the enzymatic tag cleavage and sequence directly the capped 5′ ends on the [[Helicos single molecule fluorescent sequencing|HeliScope]] platform, without PCR amplification.  It was then automated by Itoh ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Itoh-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Itoh |first1= Masayoshi |year= 2012 |title= Automated workflow for preparation of cDNA for cap analysis of gene expression on a single molecule sequencer. |journal= PLoS ONE |volume= 7 |issue= 1 |pages= e30809 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0030809 |pmid= 22303458 |pmc=3268765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012.

In 2012, the standard CAGE protocol was updated by Takahashi ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Takahashi-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Takahashi |first1= Hazuki |year= 2012 |title= 5' end-centered expression profiling using cap-analysis gene expression and next-generation sequencing. |journal= Nat Protoc |volume= 7 |issue= 3 |pages= 542–61 |doi= 10.1038/nprot.2012.005 |pmid= 22362160 |url= http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n3/full/nprot.2012.005.html |accessdate= 2013-10-16 |pmc=4094379
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to cleave tags with EcoP15I and sequence them on the Illumina-Solexa platform.
In 2013, Batut ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Batut-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Batut |first1= Philippe |year= 2013 |title= High-fidelity promoter profiling reveals widespread alternative promoter usage and transposon-driven developmental gene expression. |journal= Genome Res. |volume= 23 |issue= 1 |pages= 169–80 |doi= 10.1101/gr.139618.112 |pmid= 22936248 |url= http://genome.cshlp.org/content/23/1/169.long |accessdate= 2013-10-16 |pmc=3530677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; combined CAP trapper, template switching, and 5′-phosphate-dependent exonuclease digestion in ''RAMPAGE'' to maximize promoter specificity.
In 2014, Murata ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Murata-2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murata |first1=Mitsuyoshi |year=2014 |title=Detecting Expressed Genes Using CAGE |journal=Methods Mol.

In 2017, Poulain ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Poulain-2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poulain |first1=Stéphane |year=2017 |title=NanoCAGE: A Method for the Analysis of Coding and Noncoding 5'-Capped Transcriptomes |journal=Methods Mol.

[[Danielle Hawkins]] soon launched a blog on Tumblr by the same name. Writing at ''[[The Root]]'', Diamond Sharp describes "carefree black girls" as an idea black women "have used...to anchor expressions of individuality and whimsy in the face of the heavy [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes]] and painful realities that too often color discussions of their demographic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Diamond|title=Why Carefree Black Girls Are Here to Stay|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/carefree_black_girls_how_the_hashtag_turned_into_a_movement/|accessdate=29 August 2016|work=The Root|date=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Refinery29]]'', Jamala Johns said it was "a way to celebrate all things joyous and eclectic among brown ladies.

==Education and early life==
Longuet-Higgins was born on 11 April 1923 in [[Lenham]], [[Kent]], [[England]].  His father was Henry H. L. Longuet-Higgins and his mother was Albinia Cecil Bazeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hugh Christopher Longuet-Higgins. 1923-2004 |year=2006 |last1=Gregory |first1=R. |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society |volume=52 |pages=149-166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at [[The Pilgrims' School]], [[Winchester]], and [[Winchester College]]. In 1941, he won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He read chemistry, but also took Part I of a degree in Music. He was a Balliol [[organ scholar]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} As an undergraduate he proposed the correct structure of the chemical compound [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which was then unknown because it turned out to be different from structures in contemporary chemical valence theory. This was published with his tutor, [[Ronnie Bell|R. P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Bell            | first2 = R. P. | authorlink = H.

==Career and research==
After his PhD, he did [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of Manchester]].{{fact|date=April 2017}} In 1952, he was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at [[King's College London]], and in 1954 was appointed [[John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Chemistry]] at the [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://venn.csi.cam.ac.uk/ACAD/lists/aciff.html Venn Cambridge University database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614112122/http://venn.csi.cam.ac.uk/ACAD/lists/aciff.html |date=14 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Fellow of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. He became interested in the brain and the new field of [[artificial intelligence]]. As a consequence, in 1967, he made a major change in his career by moving to the [[University of Edinburgh]] to co-found the Department of [[Machine intelligence]] and perception, with [[Richard Gregory]] and [[Donald Michie]].

He later{{when|date=April 2017}} moved to the [[experimental psychology]] department at [[Sussex University]], [[Brighton]], [[England]].  In 1981 he introduced the [[essential matrix]] to the [[computer vision]] community in a paper which also included the [[eight-point algorithm]] for the estimation of this matrix.  He retired in 1988. At the time of his death, in 2004, he was Professor Emeritus at the University of Sussex. His work on developing computational models of music understanding was recognized in the nineties by the award of an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the [[University of Sheffield]].

:You're browsing, let us imagine, in a music shop, and come across a box of faded pianola rolls. One of them bears an illegible title, and you unroll the first foot or two, to see if you can recognize the work from the pattern of holes in the paper. Are there four beats in the bar, or only three? Does the piece begin on the tonic, or some other note? Eventually you decide that the only way of finding out is to buy the roll, take it home, and play it on the pianola.

===Honours and awards===
Christopher Longuet-Higgins was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1958,&lt;ref name=rsbm/&gt; a Foreign Associate of the US [[Academy of Sciences]] in 1968{{fact|date=April 2017}} a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (FRSE) in 1969,{{fact|date=April 2017}} and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts]] (FRSA) in 1970. He was a Fellow of the [[International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science]]. He had honorary doctorates from the universities of Bristol, Essex, Sheffield, Sussex and York. Among his notable prizes were the Jasper Ridley prize in music from [[Balliol College, Oxford]], the Harrison memorial prize from the Chemical Society, and the Naylor prize from the [[London Mathematical Society]]. He was a governor of the [[BBC]] from 1979 to 1984.

In 2005 the [[Longuet-Higgins Prize]] for "Fundamental Contributions in Computer Vision that Have Withstood the Test of Time" was created in his honor.  The prize is awarded every year at the [https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/index.html IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference] for up to two distinguished papers published at that same conference ten years earlier.

==Personal life==
His younger brother is [[Michael S. Longuet-Higgins]].{{fact|date=April 2017}} Longuet-Higgins died on 27 March 2004, aged 80. Although he respected many of the features of the [[Church of England]], he was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"By that time Longuet-Higgins had become a convinced atheist, although he still respected many of the features of the Church of England."

The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from the [[citric acid]] (a type of [[tricarboxylic acid]], often called citrate, as the ionized form predominates at biological pH&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. The cycle consumes acetate (in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]]) and [[water]], reduces [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] FAD+to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct.  The NADH generated by the citric acid cycle is fed into the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] (electron transport) pathway.  The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP.

In [[eukaryotic]] cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, which lack mitochondria, the citric acid cycle reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The overall yield of energy-containing compounds from the TCA cycle is three NADH, one FAD(2H), and one GTP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/769803483|title=Marks' basic medical biochemistry : a clinical approach|last=1950-|first=Lieberman, Michael,|date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Marks, Allan D., Peet, Alisa.|isbn=9781608315727|edition=Fourth|location=Philadelphia|oclc=769803483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

Several of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the 1930s by the research of [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1937 specifically for his discoveries pertaining to [[fumaric acid]], a key component of the cycle.&lt;ref name="Nobel_Prize_1937"&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1937/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1937 | accessdate = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to make this discovery successful with the help of pigeon breast muscle. Because this tissue maintains its oxidative capacity well after breaking down in the "Latapie" mill and releasing in aqueous solutions breast muscle of the pigeon was very well qualified  for the study of oxidative reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Chandramana, Sudeep. (2014). Inclusive Growth And Youth Empowerment: Adevelopment Model For Aspirational India. Journal of Science, Technology and Management. 7. 52-62. &lt;/ref&gt; The citric acid cycle itself was finally identified in 1937 by [[Hans Adolf Krebs]] and William Arthur Johnson while at the [[University of Sheffield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krebs|first1=HA|last2=Johnson|first2=WA|title=Metabolism of ketonic acids in animal tissues.|journal=The Biochemical Journal|date=April 1937|volume=31|issue=4|pages=645–60|pmid=16746382|pmc=1266984|doi=10.1042/bj0310645}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which the former received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1953, and for whom the cycle is sometimes named (Krebs cycle).&lt;ref name="Nobel_Prize_1953"&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1953/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1953 | accessdate = 2011-10-26 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
It is believed that components of the citric acid cycle were derived from [[anaerobic bacteria]], and that the TCA cycle itself may have evolved more than once.&lt;ref name="pmid3332996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gest H | title = Evolutionary roots of the citric acid cycle in prokaryotes | journal = Biochem.

== Overview ==
[[File:Acetyl-CoA-2D_colored.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Structural diagram of [[acetyl-CoA]]: The portion in blue, on the left, is the [[Acetyl|acetyl group]]; the portion in black is [[coenzyme A]].]]
The citric acid cycle is a key metabolic pathway that connects carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. The reactions of the cycle are carried out by eight enzymes that completely oxidize acetate, in the form of acetyl-CoA, into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water. Through [[catabolism]] of sugars, fats, and proteins, the two-carbon organic product acetyl-CoA (a form of acetate) is produced which enters the citric acid cycle. The reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into three equivalents of reduced NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (NADH), one equivalent of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) into one equivalent of FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and one equivalent each of [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) into one equivalent of [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). The NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generated by the citric acid cycle are, in turn, used by the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway to generate energy-rich ATP.

One of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is from the breakdown of sugars by [[glycolysis]] which yield [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that in turn is decarboxylated by the enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction scheme:

: [[pyruvic acid|{{underset|pyruvate|2=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)C(=O)O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] + [[Coenzyme A|HSCoA]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] → [[acetyl-CoA|{{underset|acetyl-CoA|2=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(=O)SCoA}}]] + NADH + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids. Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:
* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from acetyl-CoA to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).
* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The carbons lost as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in [[anabolic|anabolism]],  they might not be lost, since many citric acid cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.&lt;ref name="pmid2106256"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolfe RR, Jahoor F | title = Recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–52 |date=February 1990 | pmid = 2106256 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most of the energy made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle is transferred as energy-rich [[electrons]] to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming NADH. For each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of NADH are produced.
* In addition, electrons from the succinate oxidation step are transferred first to the [[FAD]] cofactor of succinate dehydrogenase, reducing it to FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and eventually to [[ubiquinone]] (Q) in the mitochondrial membrane, reducing it to ubiquinol (QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which is a substrate of the electron transfer chain at the level of [[Complex III]].
* For every NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that are produced in the citric acid cycle, 2.5 and 1.5 ATP molecules are generated in oxidative phosphorylation, respectively.
* At the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.

== Steps ==
Two [[carbon]] atoms  are [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], the energy from these reactions is transferred to other metabolic processes through [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] (or ATP), and as electrons in [[NADH]] and [[Ubiquinol|QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The  NADH generated in the citric acid cycle may later be oxidized (donate its electrons) to drive ATP synthesis in a type of process called [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is covalently attached to [[succinate dehydrogenase]], an enzyme which functions both in the CAC and the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] in oxidative phosphorylation. FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to [[coenzyme Q]], which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain.&lt;ref name="Stryer"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg J, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

Mitochondria in animals, including humans, possess two succinyl-CoA synthetases: one that produces GTP from GDP, and another that produces ATP from ADP.&lt;ref name="pmid9765291"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson JD, Mehus JG, Tews K, Milavetz BI, Lambeth DO | title = Genetic evidence for the expression of ATP- and GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetases in multicellular eucaryotes | journal = J.

The GTP that is formed by GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase may be utilized by [[nucleoside-diphosphate kinase]] to form ATP (the catalyzed reaction is GTP + ADP → GDP + ATP).&lt;ref name="Stryer"/&gt;

== Products ==
Products of the first turn of the cycle are one GTP (or ATP), three NADH, one QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;and two CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/citric-acid-cycle|title=Citric acid cycle - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because two acetyl-CoA [[molecules]] are produced from each [[glucose]] molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two QH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and four CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The above reactions are balanced if P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; represents the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion, ADP and GDP the ADP&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and GDP&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, respectively, and ATP and GTP the ATP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; and GTP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, respectively.

The total number of ATP molecules obtained after complete oxidation of one glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is estimated to be between 30 and 38.&lt;ref name="pmid7654171"/&gt;

== Efficiency ==
The theoretical maximum yield of ATP through oxidation of one molecule of glucose  in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] is 38 (assuming 3 [[molar equivalent]]s of ATP per equivalent NADH and 2 ATP per FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  In eukaryotes, two equivalents of NADH and four equivalents of ATP are generated in [[glycolysis]], which takes place in the cytoplasm. Transport of two of these equivalents of NADH into the mitochondria consumes two equivalents of ATP, thus reducing the net production of ATP to 36. Furthermore, inefficiencies in [[oxidative phosphorylation]] due to leakage of protons across the mitochondrial membrane and slippage of the [[ATP synthase]]/proton pump commonly reduces the ATP yield from NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to less than the theoretical maximum yield.&lt;ref name="pmid7654171"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porter RK, Brand MD | title = Mitochondrial proton conductance and H+/O ratio are independent of electron transport rate in isolated hepatocytes | journal = Biochem.

== Variation ==

While the citric acid cycle is in general highly conserved, there is significant variability in the enzymes found in different taxa&lt;ref name="Citric acid cycle variants at MetaCyc"&gt;{{cite web | title = Citric acid cycle variants at MetaCyc | url = http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=TCA-VARIANTS }}&lt;/ref&gt; (note that the diagrams on this page are specific to the mammalian pathway variant).

Some differences exist between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The conversion of D-''threo''-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.1.41 EC 1.1.1.41], while prokaryotes employ the NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.1.1.42 EC 1.1.1.42].&lt;ref name="pmid12005040"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sahara T, Takada Y, Takeuchi Y, Yamaoka N, Fukunaga N |title=Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a gene encoding the monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenase of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Azotobacter vinelandii |journal=Biosci.

A step with significant variability is the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate. Most organisms utilize [http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=6.2.1.5 EC 6.2.1.5], succinate–CoA ligase (ADP-forming) (despite its name, the enzyme operates in the pathway in the direction of ATP formation). In mammals a GTP-forming enzyme, succinate–CoA ligase (GDP-forming) ([http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=6.2.1.4 EC 6.2.1.4]) also operates.  The level of utilization of each isoform is tissue dependent.&lt;ref name="pmid15234968"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lambeth DO, Tews KN, Adkins S, Frohlich D, Milavetz BI |title=Expression of two succinyl-CoA synthetases with different nucleotide specificities in mammalian tissues |journal=J.

Some variability also exists at the previous step&amp;nbsp;– the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. While most organisms utilize the ubiquitous NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, some bacteria utilize a ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase ([http://www.enzyme-database.org/query.php?ec=1.2.7.3 EC 1.2.7.3]).&lt;ref name="pmid19936047"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baughn AD, Garforth SJ, Vilchèze C, Jacobs WR |title=An anaerobic-type alpha-ketoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase completes the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=e1000662 |date=November 2009  |pmid=19936047 |pmc=2773412 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000662 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
The regulation of the citric acid cycle is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. If the cycle were permitted to run unchecked, large amounts of metabolic energy could be wasted in overproduction of reduced coenzyme such as NADH and ATP. The major eventual substrate of the cycle is ADP which gets converted to ATP. A reduced amount of ADP causes accumulation of precursor NADH which in turn can inhibit a number of enzymes. NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the citric acid cycle with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]],  [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]], and also [[citrate synthase]]. [[Acetyl-coA]] inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], while [[succinyl-CoA]] inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and [[citrate synthase]]. When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes,  ATP inhibits [[citrate synthase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known [[allosteric]] mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an [[allosteric]] effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Voet D, Voet JG | year = 2004 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | location = New York | page = 615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium is also used as a regulator in the citric acid cycle. Calcium levels in the mitochondrial matrix can reach up to the tens of micromolar levels during cellular activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ivannikov, M.| title = Mitochondrial Free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; Levels and Their Effects on Energy Metabolism in Drosophila Motor Nerve Terminals | journal = [[Biophys.

Calcium also activates [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]].&lt;ref name="pmid171557"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Denton RM, Randle PJ, Bridges BJ, Cooper RH, Kerbey AL, Pask HT, Severson DL, Stansbie D, Whitehouse S | title = Regulation of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase | journal = Mol.

Citrate is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits [[phosphofructokinase]], an enzyme involved in [[glycolysis]] that catalyses formation of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]], a precursor of pyruvate. This prevents a constant high rate of flux when there is an accumulation of citrate and a decrease in substrate for the enzyme.

Recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] ([[HIF1A|HIF]]). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is synthesized constitutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau [[E3 ubiquitin ligase]] complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This reaction is catalysed by [[prolyl hydroxylase|prolyl 4-hydroxylases]]. Fumarate and succinate have been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to the stabilisation of HIF.&lt;ref name="pmid17182618"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koivunen P, Hirsilä M, Remes AM, Hassinen IE, Kivirikko KI, Myllyharju J | title = Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases by citric acid cycle intermediates: possible links between cell metabolism and stabilization of HIF | journal = J.

== Major metabolic pathways converging on the citric acid cycle ==
Several [[catabolic]] pathways converge on the citric acid cycle. Most of these reactions add intermediates to the citric acid cycle, and are therefore known as [[anaplerotic reactions]], from the Greek meaning to "fill up".  These increase the amount of acetyl CoA that the cycle is able to carry, increasing the mitochondrion's capability to carry out respiration if this is otherwise a limiting factor. Processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed "cataplerotic" reactions.

In this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are indicated in ''italics'' to distinguish them from other substrates and end-products.

[[Pyruvate]] molecules produced by [[glycolysis]] are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the inner [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] membrane, and into the matrix. Here they can be [[Redox|oxidized]] and combined with [[coenzyme A]] to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''[[acetyl-CoA]]'', and [[NADH]], as in the normal cycle.&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book |last=Voet |first=Donald |author2=Judith G. Voet |author3=Charlotte W. Pratt  |title=Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 2nd Edition |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |year=2006 |pages=547, 556 |isbn=0-471-21495-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also possible for pyruvate to be [[carboxylated]] by [[pyruvate carboxylase]] to form ''oxaloacetate''. This latter reaction "fills up" the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize ''acetyl-CoA'' when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in [[striated muscle tissue|muscle]]) are suddenly increased by activity.&lt;ref name=stryer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Citric acid cycle. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 509–527, 569–579, 614–616, 638–641, 732–735, 739–748, 770–773 |isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the citric acid cycle all the intermediates (e.g. ''citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate'' and ''oxaloacetate'') are regenerated during each turn of the cycle. Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' available to combine with ''acetyl-CoA'' to form ''citric acid''. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

''Acetyl-CoA'', on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acids]], is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of ''acetyl-CoA'' is consumed for every molecule of ''oxaloacetate'' present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of ''acetyl-CoA'' that produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, with the energy thus released captured in the form of ATP.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; The three steps of beta-oxidation resemble the steps that occur in the production of oxaloacetate from succinate in the TCA cycle. Acyl-CoA is oxidized to trans-Enoyl-CoA while FAD is reduced to FADH2, which is similar to the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Following, trans-Enoyl-CoA is hydrated across the double bond to beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA, just like fumarate is hydrated to malate. Lastly, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA is oxidized to beta-ketoacyl-CoA while NAD+ is reduced to NADH, which follows the same process as the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Biochemistry |last=Garrett |first=Reginald H. |date=2013 |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning |last2=Grisham |first2=Charles M. |isbn=9781133106296 |edition=5th |location=Belmont, CA |pages=623-625, 771-773 |oclc=777722371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the liver, the carboxylation of [[cytosol]]ic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is an early step in the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway which converts [[lactic acid|lactate]] and de-aminated [[alanine]] into glucose,&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; under the influence of high levels of [[glucagon]] and/or [[epinephrine]] in the blood.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; Here the addition of ''oxaloacetate'' to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (''malate'') is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of [[glycolysis]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

In [[protein catabolism]], [[protein]]s are broken down by [[protease]]s into their constituent amino acids. Their carbon skeletons (i.e. the de-aminated amino acids) may either enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates (e.g. ''alpha-ketoglutarate'' derived from glutamate or glutamine), having an anaplerotic effect on the cycle, or, in the case of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, they are converted into ''acetyl-CoA'' which can be burned to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, or used to form [[ketone bodies]], which too can only be burned in tissues other than the liver where they are formed, or excreted via the urine or breath.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; These latter amino acids are therefore termed "ketogenic" amino acids, whereas those that enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates can only be cataplerotically removed by entering the gluconeogenic pathway via ''malate'' which is transported out of the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate and ultimately into [[glucose]]. These are the so-called "glucogenic" amino acids. De-aminated alanine, cysteine, glycine, serine, and threonine are converted to pyruvate and can consequently either enter the citric acid cycle as ''oxaloacetate'' (an anaplerotic reaction) or as ''acetyl-CoA'' to be disposed of as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

In [[fat catabolism]], [[triglyceride]]s are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to break them into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. In the liver the glycerol can be converted into glucose via [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] and [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] by way of gluconeogenesis. In many tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle tissue, fatty acids are broken down through a process known as [[beta oxidation]], which results in the production of mitochondrial ''acetyl-CoA'', which can be used in the citric acid cycle. Beta oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of [[methylene bridge]]s produces [[propionyl-CoA]], which is then converted into ''[[succinyl-CoA]]'' and fed into the citric acid cycle as an anaplerotic intermediate.&lt;ref name="pmid2647392"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halarnkar PP, Blomquist GJ | title = Comparative aspects of propionate metabolism | journal = Comp. Biochem. Physiol., B | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–31 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2647392 | doi = 10.1016/0305-0491(89)90270-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one (six-carbon) molecule of glucose by [[glycolysis]], the formation of 2 ''acetyl-CoA'' molecules, their catabolism in the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules, in eukaryotes. The number of ATP molecules derived from the beta oxidation of a 6 carbon segment of a fatty acid chain, and the subsequent oxidation of the resulting 3 molecules of ''acetyl-CoA'' is 40.

== Citric acid cycle intermediates serve as substrates for biosynthetic processes ==
In this subheading, as in the previous one, the TCA intermediates are identified by ''italics''.

Several of the  citric acid cycle intermediates are used for the synthesis of important compounds, which will have significant cataplerotic effects on the cycle.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;
''Acetyl-CoA'' cannot be transported out of the mitochondrion. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, ''citrate'' is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by [[ATP citrate lyase]] into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to mitochondrion as ''malate'' (and then converted back into ''oxaloacetate'' to transfer more ''acetyl-CoA'' out of the mitochondrion).&lt;ref name= ferre&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000100426 | title = SREBP-1c Transcription Factor and Lipid Homeostasis: Clinical Perspective | journal = Hormone Research | year = 2007 | first = P. | last = Ferre |author2=F.

Cholesterol can, in turn, be used to synthesize the [[Steroid#Steroidogenesis|steroid hormones]], [[Bile acids|bile salts]], and [[vitamin D]].&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

The carbon skeletons of many [[Essential amino acid|non-essential amino acids]] are made from citric acid cycle intermediates. To turn them into amino acids the [[Keto acid|alpha keto-acids]] formed from the citric acid cycle intermediates have to acquire their amino groups from [[glutamate]] in a [[transamination]] reaction, in which [[Pyridoxine|pyridoxal phosphate]] is a cofactor. In this reaction the glutamate is converted into [[alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|''alpha-ketoglutarate'']], which is a citric acid cycle intermediate. The intermediates that can provide the carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis are ''oxaloacetate'' which forms [[aspartate]] and [[asparagine]]; and ''alpha-ketoglutarate'' which forms [[glutamine]], [[proline]], and [[arginine]].&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

Of these amino acids, aspartate and glutamine are used, together with carbon and nitrogen atoms from other sources, to form the [[purines]] that are used as the bases in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], as well as in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] and [[Coenzyme A|CoA]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

The [[pyrimidines]] are partly assembled from aspartate (derived from ''oxaloacetate''). The pyrimidines, [[thymine]], [[cytosine]] and [[uracil]], form the complementary bases to the purine bases in DNA and RNA, and are also components of [[Cytidine triphosphate|CTP]], [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]], [[Uridine diphosphate|UDP]] and [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

The majority of the carbon atoms in the [[porphyrin]]s come from the citric acid cycle intermediate, ''[[succinyl-CoA]]''. These molecules are an important component of the [[hemoprotein]]s, such as [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and various [[cytochrome]]s.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

During gluconeogenesis [[Gluconeogenesis#Pathway|mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is reduced to ''malate'']] which is then transported out of the mitochondrion, to be oxidized back to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Cytosolic oxaloacetate is then decarboxylated to [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] by [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], which is the rate limiting step in the conversion of nearly all the gluconeogenic precursors (such as the glucogenic amino acids and lactate) into glucose by the liver and kidney.&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

Because the citric acid cycle is involved in both [[catabolic]] and [[anabolic]] processes, it is known as an [[amphibolic]] pathway.

'''Civilian control of the military''' is a doctrine in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] that places ultimate [[command responsibility|responsibility]] for a [[Country|country's]] [[military strategy|strategic]] [[Group decision making|decision-making]] in the hands of the [[civilian]] [[politics|political]] [[leadership]], rather than professional [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a [[military dictatorship]]. A lack of control over the military may result in a [[state within a state]]. One author, paraphrasing [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s writings in ''[[The Soldier and the State]]'', has summarized the civilian control ideal as "the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Edward R. ''[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA346358 Command in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Civil-Military Affairs]'' ([[pdf]]), [[United States Navy]] [[Postgraduate]] School thesis. 1998: 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable [[liberal democracy]]. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a [[democracy]] governed by [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, though the subordination of the military to [[politics|political control]] is not unique to these societies. One example is the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. [[Mao Zedong]] stated that "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party," reflecting the primacy of the [[Communist Party of China]] (and [[Communist party|communist parties]] in general) as decision-makers in [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] theories of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name=Mao-War&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], English language translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_12.htm Problems of War and Strategy]''. 1938. (''See also: [[q:Mao Zedong|Wikiquote: Mao Zedong]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] professor [[Richard H. Kohn]], "civilian control is not a fact but a process".&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;Kohn, Richard H. [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html An Essay on Civilian Control of the Military]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military [[commander]]s are expected to translate into [[military operation|operational]] plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing [[politician]]s. [[Head of government|National Leaders]] with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the [[operational art|art]] and [[military science|science]] of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear-cut lines of civilian control.

== Rationales ==

England.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Admiral [[John B. Nathman]] (far right) and Admiral [[William J.

A subordinate of the ''civilian'' [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the Secretary of the Navy is the ''civilian'' Head of the [[Department of the Navy]], which includes the [[U.S. Navy]] and the [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].]]
Advocates of civilian control generally take a [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitzian]] view of [[war]], emphasizing its [[policy|political]] character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The [[wikiquote:Georges Clemenceau|words]] of [[Georges Clemenceau]], "War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men" (also frequently rendered as "War is too important to be left to the [[general]]s"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad [[military strategy|strategic]] decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the [[citizen]]s of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their [[representative government|political representatives]]), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The [[military]] serves as a special [[government agency]], which is supposed to ''implement'', rather than ''formulate'', policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohn succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.&lt;ref name=Kohn /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[State (polity)|state's]] effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their [[authority]]. The danger of granting military leaders full [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a [[coup]] or [[military dictatorship]]. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic [[political opposition]] through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair [[election]]s, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that "because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver.  1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control."  [http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']. 23(2): 149–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html |title=Kohn: Civilian Control |publisher=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] and almost everyone in high positions were military people like [[Hideki Tojo]], and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious.

===Liberal theory and the American Founding Fathers===
Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] were suspicious of [[Standing army|standing militaries]].  As [[Samuel Adams]] wrote in 1768, "Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it".&lt;ref name=Cairo&gt;Cairo, Michael F. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026185242/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/democracy/dmpaper12.htm Democracy Papers: Civilian Control of the Military]'', [[U.S. Department of State]] International Information Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more forceful are the words of [[Elbridge Gerry]], a [[delegate]] to the American [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], who wrote that "[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism."&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 8]], one of ''[[The Federalist]]'' papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, [[Alexander Hamilton]] expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking.  In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall.  Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army.  The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division.  He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.

[[James Madison]], another writer of many of ''The Federalist'' papers,&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. 1960. ''The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate.  Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty.  The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.  Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended.  Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
&lt;ref&gt;Max Farrand. 1911.  ''[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwfr.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787]''.  New Haven: Yale University Press. 1:465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] placed considerable limitations on the [[legislature]].  Coming from a tradition of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|legislative superiority in government]], many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war.  Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty.  James Madison, in [[Federalist No. 47]], continued Hamilton’s argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable.  In [[Federalist No. 48]], however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.

Finally, in [[Federalist No. 51]], Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.  Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders.  Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing.  Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.

Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously.  These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country’s existence.  While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels.  However, with the advent of the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force "engendered new concerns" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect [[civil–military relations]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecommons.txstate.edu"&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2009.  ''Grand Army of the Republic or Grand Army of the Republicans? Political Party and Ideological Preferences of American Enlisted Personnel''. ''[http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/51 Faculty Publications – Political Science]''. Paper 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic law enforcement===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- do similar laws exist in other countries? --&gt;

The United States' [[Posse Comitatus Act]], passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority.  Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them.  The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the [[Department of Homeland Security]] versus the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy.

The act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case.  For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States.  The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a "posse" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.&lt;ref name=Hendell&gt;Hendell, Garri B. "[http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/2/336]" "Domestic Use of the Armed Forces to Maintain Law and Order—posse comitatus Pitfalls at the Inauguration of the 44th President" Publius (2011) 41(2): 336-348 first published online May 6, 2010 {{doi|10.1093/publius/pjq014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement.  Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern.  As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] forces under state control i.e., that state's [[Army National Guard]] and/or [[Air National Guard]] are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard "federalized" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include "federal" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option.

===Maoist approach===
[[Maoism|Maoist]] military-political theories of [[people's war]] and [[democratic centralism]] also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the [[communist party]] (although the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] experience of many early leading [[Communist Party of China]] figures may make their status as [[civilian]]s somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay ''On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party'', [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] explicitly refuted "comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks", prescribing increased scrutiny of the [[People's Liberation Army]] by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy &lt;ref name=Mao-Party&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], [[English language]] translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_5.htm On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party]''. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Mao's &lt;!-- in all Communist?--&gt;theory, the military—which serves both as a symbol of the [[revolution]] and an instrument of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—is not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the [[People's Republic of China]] through the [[Central Military Commission]]), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.

== Methods of asserting civilian control ==
[[Image:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|An immensely popular hero of [[World War II]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s public insistence on the need to expand the [[Korean War]], over the objections of President [[Harry S. Truman]], led to [[Dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur|the termination]] of his [[Command (military formation)|command]].]]

Civilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian [[police]] force, [[militia]], or other [[paramilitary]] group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian [[gun]] ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a [[Gun politics#Balance of power|balance of power]] in order to enforce the civilian control of the military.

===A civilian commander-in-chief===
The establishment of a civilian [[head of state]], [[head of government]] or other government figure as the military's [[commander-in-chief]] within the [[chain of command]] is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control.

In the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] (in the [[War Powers Clause]]), while [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution establishes the [[President of the United States|President]] as the commander-in-chief.  Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

American presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control.  Three examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s dismissal of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] in the [[American Civil War]] when McClellan failed to pursue the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] following the [[Battle of Antietam]], [[Harry S. Truman]] [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieving]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of command in the [[Korean War]] after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and [[Barack Obama]]'s acceptance of [[Stanley A. McChrystal|Stanley McChrystal]]'s resignation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] after a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].

=== Composition of the military ===
Differing opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In ''The Soldier and the State'', [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] argued for what he termed "objective civilian control", "focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps".&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an [[esprit de corps]] and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the [[citizen-soldier]] holds that "civilianizing" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent "[[caste]]" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was a citizen [[militia]], which minimized divisions between officers and the enlisted.&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a less [[egalitarian]] practice, societies may also blur the line between "civilian" and "military" leadership by making direct appointments of non-[[profession]]als (frequently social elites benefitting from [[patronage]] or [[nepotism]]) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]], involves active monitoring of the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] through the appointment of [[political commissar]]s, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular [[job rotation|rotation]] of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular [[military unit]]. Some governments place responsibility for approving [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] seeking advancement through the ranks.

=== Technological developments ===
[[Image:Bombing in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|During the term of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the President and his advisors often chose specific [[bomb]]ing targets in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] on the basis of larger [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] calculations, without professional knowledge of the weapons or tactics. Apropos of LBJ's direction of the bombing campaign in Vietnam, no air warfare specialists attended the Tuesday lunches at which the targeting decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch4c.htm "Washington's Management of the Rolling  Thunder Campaign"], M. Jacobsen, ''US Naval Historical Center Colloquium on Contemporary History Project''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of [[command, control, and communications]]; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a [[military campaign]], or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the [[front lines]]. The remoteness of government from the action allowed [[professional soldier]]s to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the [[general]]s and [[field marshal]]s would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments.

Improvements in [[information technology]] and its application to wartime [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] (a process sometimes labeled the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the [[theater (military)|theater of conflict]] to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. [[Precision-guided munition]]s and real-time [[videoconferencing]] with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the [[:wikt:tactical|tactical]] decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors.

=== Restrictions on Political Activities ===
In the United States the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power.

=== Political officers ===

{{main|political commissar}}

Political officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] rather than liberal democracies.

== Military dislike of political directives ==

While civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of [[military dictatorship]]s, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue "politicization" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like "Defeat Country X"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns.

===Case study: United States===
The "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure—a phenomenon termed the "[[CNN effect]]". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled "[[chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawks]]" by those who disagree with their political goals.

In contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy-making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of [[regulatory capture]] as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the "[[Weinberger doctrine|Weinberger Doctrine]]", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the [[Vietnam War]] (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of "vital national interest", "as a last resort", and, as [[Powell Doctrine|updated]] by [[Caspar Weinberger|Weinberger]]'s disciple [[Colin Powell]], with "overwhelming force". The process of setting [[List of countries by military expenditures|military budgets]] forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active [[lobbying]] by rival military services for a share of the national budget.

Nuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian [[United States Department of Energy]], not by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

During the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over [[LGBT policy in the U.S. military]] led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make.

During his tenure, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the [[Iraq War]], while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the [[Vietnam war]] experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The '''Cyrus Cylinder''' ({{lang-fa|استوانه کوروش|Ostovane-ye Kūrosh}}) or '''Cyrus Charter''' ({{lang|fa|منشور  کوروش}} ''{{transl|fa|Manshūre Kūrosh}}'') is an ancient clay cylinder, now broken into several pieces, on which is written a declaration in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform script]] in the name of [[Persia]]'s [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] king [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name="Dandamayev-Cylinder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-2007a|Kuhrt (2007)]], p. 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt; It dates from the 6th century BC and was discovered in the ruins of [[Babylon]] in [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) in 1879.&lt;ref name="Dandamayev-Cylinder"&gt;[[#Dandamayev-Cylinder|Dandamayev, (2010-01-26)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in the possession of the [[British Museum]], which sponsored the expedition that discovered the cylinder. It was created and used as a [[foundation deposit]] following the [[Babylon#Persian conquest|Persian conquest]] of [[Babylon]] in 539 BC, when the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] was invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into his [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].

The text on the Cylinder praises Cyrus, sets out his genealogy and portrays him as a king from a line of kings. The Babylonian king [[Nabonidus]], who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus, is denounced as an impious oppressor of the people of Babylonia and his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus' kingly heritage. The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian god [[Marduk]] to restore peace and order to the Babylonians. The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people of Babylon as their new ruler and entered the city in peace. It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his son [[Cambyses]]. It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives, repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across [[Mesopotamia]] and elsewhere in the region. It concludes with a description of how Cyrus repaired the city wall of Babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt;

The Cylinder's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus' policy of the [[The Return to Zion|repatriation]] of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] following their [[Babylonian captivity]]&lt;ref name="BM-CC" /&gt; (an act that the [[Book of Ezra]] attributes to Cyrus&lt;ref name="Free"&gt;[[#Free|Free &amp; Vos (1992)]], p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;), as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples.&lt;ref name="Becking" /&gt; This interpretation has been disputed, as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries, and makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt; The Cylinder has also been referred to by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of [[Iran]] as the first declaration of universal [[human rights]], a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2012/cyrus_cylinder_travels_to_us.aspx |title=The Cyrus Cylinder travels to the US |publisher=British Museum |year=2012 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/10/cyrus-cylinder-returns-iran |title=Cyrus cylinder, world's oldest human rights charter, returns to Iran on loan |author=Associated Press |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/visualarts/article.jsp?essid=124632 |title=Oldest Known Charter of Human Rights Comes to San Francisco |date=13 August 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil MacGregor]], former Director of the British Museum, has stated that the cylinder was "the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths—a new kind of statecraft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/fa/contents/articles/opinion/2013/03/cyrus-cylinder-iran-religious-freedom-minority-rights.html |title=Cyrus Cylinder a Reminder of Persian Legacy of Tolerance |author=Barbara Slavin |publisher=Al-Monitor |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted as a [[national symbol]] of Iran by the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State]] which put it on display in [[Tehran]] in 1971 to commemorate [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Ansari" /&gt; On October 14, the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah's]] sister, [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], presented the [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[U Thant]] with a replica of the Cylinder. The princess asserted that "the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and, above all, human liberty".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:Hormuzd.Rassam.reclined.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Sepia photograph of a man in 19th century Middle Eastern dress, with a large moustache, reclining in a chair with his hands crossed across his lap|Hormuzd Rassam in Mosul ''circa'' 1854. The Cyrus Cylinder was discovered during Rassam's excavations in Babylon in February–March 1879.]]
The [[Assyrian people|Assyro]]-[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] archaeologist [[Hormuzd Rassam]] discovered the Cyrus Cylinder in March 1879 during a lengthy programme of excavations in Mesopotamia carried out for the British Museum.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;[[#Finkel|Finkel (2009)]], p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; It had been placed as a [[foundation deposit]] in the foundations of the [[Esagila|Ésagila]], the city's main temple.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt; Rassam's expedition followed on from an earlier dig carried out in 1850 by the British archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]], who excavated three mounds in the same area but found little of importance.&lt;ref name="Vos" /&gt; In 1877, Layard became Britain's ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled Mesopotamia at the time. He helped Rassam, who had been his assistant in the 1850 dig, to obtain a ''[[Firman (decree)|firman]]'' (decree) from the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] to continue the earlier excavations. The ''firman'' was only valid for a year but a second ''firman'', with much more liberal terms, was issued in 1878. It was granted for two years (through to 15 October 1880) with the promise of an extension to 1882 if required.&lt;ref name="Hilprecht"&gt;[[#Hilprecht|Hilprecht (1903)]], pp. 204–05&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan's decree authorised Rassam to "pack and dispatch to England any antiquities [he] found … provided, however, there were no duplicates". A representative of the Sultan was instructed to be present at the dig to examine the objects as they were uncovered.&lt;ref name="Rassam"&gt;[[#Rassam|Rassam (1897)]], p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

With permission secured, Rassam initiated a large-scale excavation at Babylon and other sites on behalf of the Trustees of the British Museum.&lt;ref name="Vos" /&gt; He undertook the excavations in four distinct phases. In between each phase, he returned to England to bring back his finds and raise more funds for further work. The Cyrus Cylinder was found on the second of his four expeditions to Mesopotamia, which began with his departure from London on 8 October 1878. He arrived in his home town of [[Mosul]] on 16 November and travelled down the [[Tigris]] to [[Baghdad]], which he reached on 30 January 1879. During February and March, he supervised excavations on a number of Babylonian sites, including Babylon itself.&lt;ref name="Hilprecht" /&gt;

[[File:Babylon 1829 cropped.gif|left|thumb|alt=Map showing the terrain at the site of Babylon as it was in 1829. Various mounds, outcrops and canals are shown, with the river Tigris running through the middle. At the centre of the map is a mound marked "E" where the Cyrus Cylinder was discovered in March 1879|Map of the site of Babylon in 1829. Hormuzd Rassam's diggers found the Cyrus Cylinder in the mound of Tell Amran-ibn-Ali (marked with an "E" at the centre of the map) under which lay the ruined Esagila temple.]]
He soon uncovered a number of important buildings including the Ésagila temple. This was a major shrine to the chief Babylonian god Marduk, although its identity was not fully confirmed until the German archaeologist [[Robert Koldewey]]'s excavation of 1900.&lt;ref name="Koldewey"&gt;[[#Koldewey|Koldewey]], p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; The excavators found a large number of business documents written on clay tablets buried in the temple's foundations where they discovered the Cyrus Cylinder.&lt;ref name="Vos"&gt;[[#Vos|Vos (1995)]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Rassam gave conflicting accounts of where his discoveries were made. He wrote in his memoirs, ''Asshur and the land of Nimrod'', that the Cylinder had been found in a mound at the southern end of Babylon near the village of Jumjuma or Jimjima.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rassam|Rassam]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hilprecht|Hilprecht (1903)]], p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a letter sent on 20 November 1879 to [[Samuel Birch]], the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum, he wrote, "The Cylinder of Cyrus was found at Omran [Tell Amran-ibn-Ali] with about six hundred pieces of inscribed terracottas before I left Baghdad."&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;[[#Walker|Walker]], pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; He left Baghdad on 2 April, returning to Mosul and departing from there on 2 May for a journey to London which lasted until 19 June.&lt;ref name="Hilprecht" /&gt;

The discovery was announced to the public by [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]], the President of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], at a meeting of the Society on 17 November 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Royal Asiatic Society|''The Times'' (18 November 1879)]]&lt;/ref&gt; He described it as "one of the most interesting historical records in the cuneiform character that has yet been brought to light," though he erroneously described it as coming from the ancient city of [[Borsippa]] rather than Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Monument|''The Oriental Journal'' (January 1880)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlinson's "Notes on a newly-discovered Clay Cylinder of Cyrus the Great" were published in the society's journal the following year, including the first partial translation of the text.&lt;ref name="Rawlinson"&gt;[[#Rawlinson|Rawlinson (1880)]], pp. 70–97&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cyrus Cylinder is a barrel-shaped cylinder of baked clay measuring {{convert|22.5|cm|in}} by {{convert|10|cm|in}} at its maximum diameter.&lt;ref name="BM-database"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=327188&amp;partid=1|title=The Cyrus Cylinder (British Museum database)|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in several stages around a cone-shaped core of clay within which there are large grey stone inclusions. It was built up with extra layers of clay to give it a cylindrical shape before a fine surface slip of clay was added to the outer layer, on which the text is inscribed. It was excavated in several fragments, having apparently broken apart in antiquity.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; Today it exists in two main fragments, known as "A" and "B", which were reunited in 1972.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

The main body of the Cylinder, discovered by Rassam in 1879, is fragment "A". It underwent restoration in 1961, when it was re-fired and plaster filling was added.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; The smaller fragment, "B", is a section measuring {{convert|8.6|cm|in}} by {{convert|5.6|cm|in}}. The latter fragment was acquired by J.B. Nies&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; of [[Yale University]] from an antiquities dealer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curtis|Curtis, Tallis &amp; André-Salvini]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Nies published the text in 1920.&lt;ref name="Nies"&gt;[[#Nies|Nies &amp; Keiser (1920)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The fragment was apparently broken off the main body of the Cylinder during the original excavations in 1879 and was either removed from the excavations or was retrieved from one of Rassam's waste dumps. It was not confirmed as part of the Cylinder until Paul-Richard Berger of the [[University of Münster]] definitively identified it in 1970.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;[[#Berger|Berger]], pp. 155–159&lt;/ref&gt; Yale University lent the fragment to the British Museum temporarily (but, in practice, indefinitely) in exchange for "a suitable cuneiform tablet" from the British Museum collection.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

Although the Cylinder clearly post-dates Cyrus the Great's conquest of Babylon in 539 BC, the date of its creation is unclear. It is commonly said to date to the early part of Cyrus's reign over Babylon, some time after 539 BC. The British Museum puts the Cylinder's date of origin at between 539–530 BC.&lt;ref name="BM-CC" /&gt;

=== Text ===
{{Wikisource|Cyrus cylinder}}
The surviving inscription on the Cyrus Cylinder consists of 45 lines of text written in Akkadian cuneiform script. The first 35 lines are on fragment "A" and the remainder are on fragment "B".&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt; A number of lines at the start and end of the text are too badly damaged for more than a few words to be legible.

The text is written in an extremely formulaic style that can be divided into six distinct parts:

[[File:Cyrus Cylinder detail.jpg|thumb|alt=Detail image of text|Sample detail image showing cuneiform script.]]
The beginning of the text is partly broken; the surviving content reprimands the character of the deposed Babylonian king [[Nabonidus]]. It lists his alleged crimes, charging him with the desecration of the temples of the gods and the imposition of [[corvee|forced labor]] upon the populace. According to the proclamation, as a result of these offenses, the god Marduk abandoned Babylon and sought a more righteous king. Marduk called forth Cyrus to enter Babylon and become its new ruler.&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation" /&gt;

{{quote|In [Nabonidus's] mind, reverential fear of Marduk, king of the gods, came to an end. He did yet more evil to his city every day; … his [people ................…], he brought ruin on them all by a yoke without relief … [Marduk] inspected and checked all the countries, seeking for the upright king of his choice. He took the hand of Cyrus, king of the city of [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]], and called him by his name, proclaiming him aloud for the kingship over all of everything.&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation" /&gt;}}

Midway through the text, the writer switches to a [[first-person narrative]] in the voice of Cyrus, addressing the reader directly. A list of his titles is given (in a Mesopotamian rather than Persian style): "I am Cyrus, king of the world, great king, powerful king, king of Babylon, king of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], king of the four quarters [of the earth], son of [[Cambyses of Anshan|Cambyses]], great king, king of Anshan, descendent of [[Teispes of Anshan|Teispes]], great king, king of Anshan, the perpetual seed of kingship, whose reign [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] [Marduk] and [[Nabu|Nebo]] love, and with whose kingship, to their joy, they concern themselves."&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation"&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=327188&amp;partId=1 Translation of the text on the Cyrus Cylinder]. Finkel, Irving.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the pious deeds he performed after his conquest: he restored peace to Babylon and the other cities sacred to Marduk, freeing their inhabitants from their "yoke," and he "brought relief to their dilapidated housing (thus) putting an end to their (main) complaints".&lt;ref name="Pritchard"&gt;[[#Pritchard|Pritchard]]&lt;/ref&gt; He repaired the ruined temples in the cities he conquered, restored their cults, and returned their sacred images as well as their former inhabitants which Nabonidus had taken to Babylon.&lt;ref name="Pritchard" /&gt; Near the end of the inscription Cyrus highlights his restoration of Babylon's city wall, saying: "I saw within it an inscription of [[Ashurbanipal]], a king who preceded me."&lt;ref name="Finkel-Translation" /&gt; The remainder is missing but presumably describes Cyrus's rededication of the gateway mentioned.&lt;ref name="Kutsko"&gt;[[#Kutsko|Kutsko]], p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

A partial transcription by F. H. Weissbach in 1911 was supplanted by a much more complete transcription after the identification of the "B" fragment;&lt;ref name="Weissbach"&gt;[[#Weissbach|Weissbach]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; this is now available in German and in English.&lt;ref name="Schaudig"&gt;[[#Schaudig|Schaudig]], pp. 550–556&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pritchard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallo"&gt;[[#Hallo|Hallo]], p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[#Editions and translations|editions of the full text]] of the Cyrus Cylinder are available online, incorporating both "A" and "B" fragments.

A false translation of the text – affirming, among other things, the abolition of slavery and the right to self-determination, a minimum wage and asylum – has been promoted on the Internet and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;[[#Schulz|Schulz (2008-07-15)]]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as making claims that are not found on the real cylinder, it refers to the [[Zoroastrian]] divinity [[Ahura Mazda]] rather than the Mesopotamian god Marduk.&lt;ref&gt;compare {{cite web |url=http://www.niasnet.org/iran-history/artifacts-historical-places-of-iran/cyruscylinder/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615163639/http://www.niasnet.org/iran-history/artifacts-historical-places-of-iran/cyruscylinder/ |archivedate=2013-06-15 |df= }} with the British Museum translation at [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/articles/c/cyrus_cylinder_-_translation.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The false translation has been widely circulated; alluding to its claim that Cyrus supposedly has stated that "Every country shall decide for itself whether or not it wants my leadership."&lt;ref name="Schulz" /&gt; Iranian [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Shirin Ebadi]] in her acceptance speech described Cyrus as "the very emperor who proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that … he would not reign over the people if they did not wish it".&lt;ref name="Schulz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foucart"&gt;[[#Foucart|Foucart (2007-08-19)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=2003-Noble-Peace-Prize-lecture|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-lecture-e.html|title=Shirin Ebadi's 2003 Nobel Peace Prize lecture|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associated fragments ===
The British Museum announced in January 2010 that two inscribed clay fragments, which had been in the Museum's collection since 1881, had been identified as part of a cuneiform tablet that was inscribed with the same text as the Cyrus Cylinder. The fragments had come from the small site of Dailem near Babylon and the identification was made by Professor [[Wilfred Lambert]], formerly of the University of Birmingham, and [[Irving Finkel]], curator in charge of the Museum's Department of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irving Finkel|author=British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/staff/middle_east/irving_finkel.aspx|accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/cyrus_cylinder.aspx Cyrus Cylinder (press release)]. British Museum, 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to a Chinese bone inscription ===
In 1983 two fossilized horse bones inscribed with cuneiform signs surfaced in China which Professor [[Oliver Gurney]] at Oxford later identified as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. The discovery of these objects aroused much discussion about possible connections between ancient Mesopotamia and China, although their authenticity was doubted by many scholars from the beginning and they are now generally regarded as forgeries. 

The history of the putative artifact goes back almost a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Zhi|date=1987|title=Brief Note on the Bone Cuneiform Inscriptions|url=|journal=[[Journal of Ancient Civilizations]]|volume=2|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown a photo of a rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cyrus Cylinder: The King of Persia's Proclamation from Ancient Babylon|last=|first=|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2013|isbn=978-1780760636|editor-last=Finkel|editor-first=Irving|location=|pages=28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and [[Institute for the History of Ancient Civilizations|Wu Yuhong]] to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist [[Stephanie Dalley]] and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Yuhong|date=1986|title=A Horse-Bone Inscription copied from the Cyrus Cylinder (Line 18-21) in the Palace Museum in Beijing|trans-title=|url=|journal=Journal of Ancient Civilizations|volume=1|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that the second bone inscription remained undeciphered until 2010, when Irving Finkel worked on it. In that same year the British Museum held a conference dedicated to the artifacts. Based on the serious textual errors in the inscription, including the omission of a large number of signs from the Cyrus Cylinder, Wu Yuhong argued the inscriptions were most likely copied from the cylinder while housed in the British Museum or from an early modern publication based upon it. However he acknowledged the remote possibility it was copied in late antiquity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Irving Finkel disputed this conclusion based on the relative obscurity of the Cyrus Cylinder until recent decades and the mismatch in paleography between the bone inscriptions and the hand copies found in early editions from the 1880's. 

Finally, after the workshop concluded, an 1884 edition of the Cyrus Cylinder by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only a section of the whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.

== Interpretations ==

=== Mesopotamian and Persian tradition and propaganda ===
According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms.&lt;ref name="BM-CC"&gt;British Museum: [[#BM-The Cyrus Cylinder|The Cyrus Cylinder]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.&lt;ref name="BM-inscription"&gt;[[#BM-inscription|Inscription in the British Museum, Room 55]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1982"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-1982|Kuhrt (1982)]], p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is a royal building inscription, a genre which had no equivalent in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon.&lt;ref name="Kutsko" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winn"&gt;[[#Winn Leith|Winn Leith]], p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by the gods for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing the welfare of the people; the sanctuaries of the gods are rebuilt or restored, offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings of the gods are sought; and repairs are made to the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt;

Both continuity and discontinuity are emphasized in the text of the Cylinder. It asserts the virtue of Cyrus as a gods-fearing king of a traditional Mesopotamian type. On the other hand, it constantly discredits Nabonidus, reviling the deposed king's deeds and even his ancestry and portraying him as an impious destroyer of his own people. As Fowler and Hekster note, this "creates a problem for a monarch who chooses to buttress his claim to legitimacy by appropriating the 'symbolic capital' of his predecessors".&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;[[#Fowler|Fowler &amp; Hekster]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Cylinder's reprimand of Nabonidus also discredits Babylonian royal authority by association. It is perhaps for this reason that the Achaemenid rulers made greater use of Assyrian rather than Babylonian royal iconography and tradition in their declarations; the Cylinder refers to the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]] as "my predecessor", rather than any native Babylonian ruler.&lt;ref name="Fowler" /&gt;

The Cylinder itself is part of a continuous Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures. Newly crowned kings of Babylon would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns, often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum: [[#BM-The Cyrus Cylinder|The Cyrus Cylinder]]; [[#Kuhrt-1983|Kuhrt (1983)]], pp. 83–97; [[#Dandamaev|Dandamaev]], pp. 52–53; [[#Beaulieu|Beaulieu]], p. 243; [[#van der Spek|van der Spek]], pp. 273–285; [[#Wiesehöfer-2001|Wiesehöfer (2001)]], p. 82; [[#Briant|Briant]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Some contained messages, while others did not, and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through the invocation of divine protection.

The cylinder was not intended to be seen again after its burial, but the text inscribed on it would have been used for public purposes. Archive copies were kept of important inscriptions and the Cylinder's text may likewise have been copied.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haubold|Haubold]], p. 52 fn. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, the British Museum announced that two cuneiform tablets in its collection had been found to be inscribed with the same text as that on the Cyrus Cylinder,&lt;ref name="BM-discovery-2010-01-11"&gt;[[#BM-discovery-2010-01-11|British Museum e-mail (2010-01-11)]]&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to the Museum, "show that the text of the Cylinder was probably a proclamation that was widely distributed across the Persian Empire".&lt;ref name="BM-Statements"&gt;[[#BM-Statements regarding|British Museum statement (2010-01-20)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
A statue of the cylinder is now on exhibit in Los Angeles on avenue of the stars as a gift from the Persian people to the city of Los Angeles 
==== Similarities with other royal inscriptions ====
[[File:Nabonidus cylinder sippar bm1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Nabonidus Cylinder]]]]

The Cyrus Cylinder bears striking similarities to older Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. Two notable examples are the Cylinder of [[Marduk-apla-iddina II]], who seized the Babylonian throne in 722/1 BC, and the annals of [[Sargon II]] of Assyria, who conquered Babylon twelve years later. As a conqueror, Marduk-apla-iddina faced many of the same problems of legitimacy that Cyrus did when he conquered Babylon. He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk, who ensured his victory. When he took power, he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines. He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king, which he left undisturbed and honored. All of these claims also appear in Cyrus's Cylinder. Twelve years later, the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] defeated and exiled Marduk-apla-iddina, taking up the kingship of Babylonia. Sargon's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign, honouring the gods, maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite. Again, Cyrus's Cylinder makes exactly the same points. Nabonidus, Cyrus's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon, commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders – such as the [[Cylinder of Nabonidus]], also in the British Museum – that follows the same basic formula.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007b"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-2007b|Kuhrt (2007)]], pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Cylinder thus indicates a strong continuity with centuries of Babylonian tradition, as part of an established rhetoric advanced by conquerors.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007b" /&gt; As Kuhrt puts it:

{{quote|[The Cylinder] reflects the pressure that Babylonian citizens were able to bring to bear on the new royal claimant … In this context, the reign of the defeated predecessor was automatically described as bad and against the divine will – how else could he have been defeated? By implication, of course, all his acts became, inevitably and retrospectively, tainted.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007b" /&gt;}}

The familiarity with long-established Babylonian tropes suggests that the Cylinder was authored by the Babylonian priests of Marduk, working at the behest of Cyrus.&lt;ref name="Dyck"&gt;[[#Dyck|Dyck]], pp. 91–94.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be compared with another work of around the same time, the ''Verse Account of Nabonidus'', in which the former Babylonian ruler is excoriated as the enemy of the priests of Marduk and Cyrus is presented as the liberator of Babylon.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"&gt;[[#Grabbe|Grabbe (2004)]], p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Both works make a point of stressing Cyrus's qualifications as a king from a line of kings, in contrast to the non-royal ancestry of Nabonidus, who is described by the Cylinder as merely ''maţû'', "insignificant".&lt;ref name="Dick"&gt;[[#Dick|Dick]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Verse Account'' is so similar to the Cyrus Cylinder inscription that the two texts have been dubbed an example of "literary dependence" – not the ''direct'' dependence of one upon the other, but mutual dependence upon a common source. This is characterised by the historian [[Morton Smith]] as "the propaganda put out in Babylonia by Cyrus's agents, shortly before Cyrus's conquest, to prepare the way of their lord".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint has been disputed; as Simon J. Sherwin of the [[University of Cambridge]] puts it, the Cyrus Cylinder and the ''Verse Account'' are "after the event" compositions which reuse existing Mesopotamian literary themes and do not need to be explained as the product of pre-conquest Persian propaganda.&lt;ref name="Sherwin"&gt;[[#Sherwin|Sherwin]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German historian Hanspeter Schaudig has identified a line on the Cylinder ("He [i.e. Marduk] saved his city Babylon from its oppression") with a line from tablet VI of the Babylonian "Epic of Creation", ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', in which Marduk builds Babylon.&lt;ref name="Haubold"&gt;[[#Haubold|Haubold]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Haubold suggests that reference represents Cyrus's takeover as a moment of ultimate restoration not just of political and religious institutions, but of the cosmic order underpinning the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haubold|Haubold]], p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analysis of the Cylinder's claims ====
[[File:Nabonidus.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Stone stele with a carving depicting a man with a beard, carrying a tall staff and wearing a robe and conical hat, gesturing to three symbols representing the moon, sun and Venus.|[[Stele]] depicting Nabonidus praying to the [[Lunar deity|moon]], sun and the planet Venus. The Babylonian king's religious practices were harshly condemned by the Cyrus Cylinder's inscription.]]

The Cyrus Cylinder's vilification of Nabonidus is consistent with other Persian propaganda regarding the deposed king's rule. In contrast to the Cylinder's depiction of Nabonidus as an illegitimate ruler who ruined his country, the reign of Nabonidus was largely peaceful, he was recognised as a legitimate king and he undertook a variety of building projects and military campaigns commensurate with his claim to be "the king of Babylon, the universe, and the four corners [of the Earth]".&lt;ref name="Bidmead"&gt;[[#Bidmead|Bidmead]], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyriologist [[Paul-Alain Beaulieu]] has interpreted Nabonidus's exaltation of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] as "an outright usurpation of Marduk's prerogatives by the moon god".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bidmead|Bidmead]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Babylonian king continued to make rich offerings to Marduk, his greater devotion to Sin was unacceptable to the Babylonian priestly elite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bidmead|Bidmead]], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Nabonidus came from the unfashionable north of Babylonia, introduced foreign gods and went into a lengthy self-imposed exile which was said to have prevented the celebration of the vital New Year festival.&lt;ref name="Mallowan"&gt;[[#Mallowan|Mallowan]], pp. 409–411&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus's conquest of Babylonia was resisted by Nabonidus and his supporters, as the [[Battle of Opis]] demonstrated. [[Iranologist]] [[Pierre Briant]] comments that "it is doubtful that even before the fall of [Babylon] Cyrus was impatiently awaited by a population desperate for a 'liberator'."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briant|Briant]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cyrus's takeover as king does appear to have been welcomed by some of the Babylonian population.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"&gt;[[#Buchanan|Buchanan]], pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; The Judaic historian Lisbeth S. Fried says that there is little evidence that the high-ranking priests of Babylonia during the Achaemenid period were Persians and characterises them as Babylonian collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fried|Fried]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription goes on to describe Cyrus returning to their original sanctuaries the statues of the gods that Nabonidus had brought to the city before the Persian invasion. This restored the normal cultic order to the satisfaction of the priesthood. It alludes to temples being restored and deported groups being returned to their homelands but does not imply an empire-wide programme of restoration. Instead, it refers to specific areas in the border region between Babylonia and Persia, including sites that had been devastated by earlier Babylonian military campaigns. The Cylinder indicates that Cyrus sought to acquire the loyalty of the ravaged regions by funding reconstruction, the return of temple properties and the repatriation of the displaced populations. However, it is unclear how much actually changed on the ground; there is no archaeological evidence for any rebuilding or repairing of Mesopotamian temples during Cyrus's reign.&lt;ref name="Winn" /&gt;

The text presents Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully and being welcomed by the population as a liberator. This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors, notably the Assyrian rulers [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]], who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC, and [[Sennacherib]], who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; The massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements. The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message; Johannes Haubold notes that it portrays Cyrus's takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history, not a natural disaster but the salvation of Babylonia.&lt;ref name="Haubold" /&gt;

However, the Cylinder's account of Cyrus's conquest clearly does not tell the whole story, as it suppresses any mention of the earlier conflict between the Persians and the Babylonians;&lt;ref name="Haubold" /&gt; [[Max Mallowan]] describes it as a "skilled work of tendentious history".&lt;ref name="Mallowan" /&gt; The text omits the Battle of Opis, in which Cyrus's forces defeated and apparently massacred Nabonidus's army.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-2007a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, A. Leo, in Pritchard, James B. ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament''. Princeton University Press, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briant|Briant]], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does it explain a two-week gap reported by the Nabonidus Chronicle between the Persian entry into Babylon and the surrender of the Esagila temple. Lisbeth S. Fried suggests that there may have been a siege or stand-off between the Persians and the temple's defenders and priests, about whose fate the Cylinder and Chronicle makes no mention. She speculates that they were killed or expelled by the Persians and replaced by more pro-Persian members of the Babylonian priestly elite.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fried|Fried]], p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; As Walton and Hill put it, the claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by the people is "standard conqueror's rhetoric and may obscure other facts".&lt;ref name="Walton"&gt;[[#Walton|Walton &amp; Hill]], p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the claim of one's own armies being welcomed as liberators as "one of the great imperial fantasies", Bruce Lincoln, Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Chicago]], notes that the Babylonian population repeatedly revolted against Persian rule in 522 BC, 521 BC, 484 BC and 482 BC (though not against Cyrus or his son Cambeses). The rebels sought to restore national independence and the line of native Babylonian kings – perhaps an indication that they were not as favourably disposed towards the Persians as the Cylinder suggests.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln (2007)|Lincoln]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persians' policy towards their subject people, as described by the Cylinder, was traditionally viewed as an expression of tolerance, moderation and generosity "on a scale previously unknown".&lt;ref name="Masroori"&gt;[[#Masroori|Masroori]], p. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt; The policies of Cyrus toward subjugated nations have been contrasted to those of the Assyrians and Babylonians, who had treated subject peoples harshly; he permitted the resettling of those who had been previously deported and sponsored the reconstruction of religious buildings.&lt;ref name="Dandamaev"&gt;[[#Dandamaev|Dandamaev]], pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus was often depicted positively in Western tradition by sources such as the Old Testament of the Bible and the Greek writers [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]].&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arberry"&gt;[[#Arberry|Arberry]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' of Xenophon was particularly influential during the [[Renaissance]] when Cyrus was romanticised as an exemplary model of a virtuous and successful ruler.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stillman|Stillman]], p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians argue that while Cyrus's behavior was indeed conciliatory, it was driven by the needs of the Persian Empire, and was not an expression of personal tolerance per se.&lt;ref name="Min"&gt;[[#Min|Min]], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The empire was too large to be centrally directed; Cyrus followed a policy of using existing territorial units to implement a decentralized system of government. The magnanimity shown by Cyrus won him praise and gratitude from those he spared.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[[#Evans|Evans]], pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of toleration described by the Cylinder was thus, as biblical historian Rainer Albertz puts it, "an expression of conservative support for local regions to serve the political interests of the whole [empire]".&lt;ref name="Albertz"&gt;[[#Albertz|Albertz]], pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; Another biblical historian, [[Alberto Soggin]], comments that it was more "a matter of practicality and economy … [as] it was simpler, and indeed cost less, to obtain the spontaneous collaboration of their subjects at a local level than to have to impose their sovereignty by force".&lt;ref name="Soggin"&gt;[[#Soggin|Soggin]], p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical interpretations ===

[[File:Cyrus cylinder Mesopotamia.svg|right|thumb|350px|alt=Map showing various places in Mesopotamia mentioned by the Cyrus Cylinder.|Places in Mesopotamia mentioned by the Cyrus Cylinder. Most of the localities it mentions in connection with the restoration of temples were in eastern and northern Mesopotamia, in territories that had been ruled by the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus (excepting Susa).]]
The Bible records that some Jews (who were exiled by the Babylonians), returned to their homeland from Babylon, where they had been settled by [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], to rebuild the temple following an edict from Cyrus. The [[Book of Ezra]] (1–4:5) provides a narrative account of the rebuilding project.&lt;ref name="Hurowitz"&gt;[[#Hurowitz|Hurowitz]], pp. 581–591&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have linked one particular passage from the Cylinder to the Old Testament account:&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1982" /&gt;

{{quote|From [?]&lt;ref&gt;Older translations used to give "Nineveh." The relevant passage is fragmentary, but I. Finkel has recently concluded that it is impossible to interpret it as "Nineveh". (I. Finkel, "No Nineveh in the Cyrus Cylinder", in ''NABU'' 1997/23 [http://www.achemenet.com])&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Ashur|Aššur]] and [from] [[Susa]], [[Agade]], [[Eshnunna|Ešnunna]], Zabban, Me-Turnu, [[Der (Sumer)|Der]], as far as the region of [[Gutian people#Gutium as a later geographic term|Gutium]], the sacred centers on the other side of the [[Tigris]], whose sanctuaries had been abandoned for a long time, I returned the images of the gods, who had resided there [i.e., in Babylon], to their places and I let them dwell in eternal abodes. I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder2.html Cyrus Cylinder] translation, adapted from Schaudig 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage has often been interpreted as a reference to the benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples, such as the Jews, to return to their original homelands.&lt;ref name="Becking"&gt;[[#Becking|Becking]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Cylinder's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the Jews and the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dandamayev-Iranica|Dandamaev (2010-01-26)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The two edicts (one in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and one in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]) are substantially different in content and tone, leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a ''post hoc'' fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The question of their authenticity remains unresolved, though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy, albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given in the text of the biblical edicts.

The dispute over the authenticity of the biblical edicts has prompted interest in this passage from the Cyrus Cylinder, specifically concerning the question of whether it indicates that Cyrus had a ''general'' policy of repatriating subject peoples and restoring their sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the Cylinder is very specific, listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions. It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities. It emphasises the re-establishment of local religious norms, reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus – a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as "a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus". She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions and that there was no general policy as such.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1983"&gt;[[#Kuhrt-1983|Kuhrt (1983)]], pp. 83–97&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lester L. Grabbe]], a historian of early Judaism, has written that "the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them" in tolerating – but not promoting – local cults, other than their own gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grabbe-2006|Grabbe (2006)]], p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrus may have seen [[Jerusalem]], situated in a strategic location between Mesopotamia and Egypt, as worth patronising for political reasons. His Achaemenid successors generally supported indigenous cults in subject territories as an expression of their legitimacy as rulers, thereby currying favour with the cults' devotees.&lt;ref name="Bedford138"&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Persian kings could, and did, destroy the shrines of peoples who had rebelled against them, as happened at [[Miletos]] in 494 BC following the [[Ionian Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;Greaves, Alan M. ''Miletos: A History'', p. 84. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-415-23846-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Ernst Badian has noted regarding the Ionian revolt "[that] Harpagus 'devastated' all of lower Asia (1.177) is obviously an exaggeration, for the Ionians soon returned to their trading activities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ionian-revolt|title=IONIAN REVOLT – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|work=iranicaonline.org|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians evidently did give permission for its reconstruction, which would have been required given the circumstances of its destruction.&lt;ref name="Bedford138" /&gt; However, the Cylinder's text does not describe any general policy of a return of exiles or mention any sanctuary outside Babylonia;&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;[[#Janzen|Janzen]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; the biblical historian Bob Becking concludes that "it has nothing to do with Judeans, Jews or Jerusalem."&lt;ref name="Becking" /&gt; Peter Ross Bedford argues that the Cylinder "is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout the empire".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bedford|Bedford]], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhrt comments that "the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof" of the historicity of Cyrus's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1982" /&gt; though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts – an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance.&lt;ref name="Becking" /&gt;

The German scholar [[Josef Wiesehöfer]] summarizes the widely held traditional view by noting that "Many scholars have read into […] sentences [from the text of Cylinder] a confirmation of the Old Testament passages about the steps taken by Cyrus towards the erection of the Jerusalem temple and the repatriation of the Judaeans" and this interpretation was, according to Wiesehöfer, for some scholars a strict belief "that the instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of the Cyrus Cylinder".&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer-2001" /&gt;

=== Human rights ===
The Cylinder gained new prominence in the late 1960s when the last [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] called it "the world's first charter of [[human rights]]".&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;[[#MacGregor|MacGregor]]&lt;/ref&gt; The cylinder was a key symbol of the Shah's political ideology and is still regarded by some commentators as a charter of human rights, despite the disagreement of some historians and scholars.&lt;ref name="Ansari" /&gt;

==== Pahlavi Iranian government's view ====
[[File:Emblem2500Persepolis.jpg|thumb|Cyrus Cylinder at the center of the official emblem of [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] at Pahlavi Iranian imperial era]]
The Cyrus Cylinder was dubbed the "first declaration of human rights" by the pre-[[Iranian Revolution|Revolution]] Iranian government,&lt;ref name="note"&gt;[http://www.livius.org/a/1/inscriptions/cyrus.pdf United Nations Note to Correspondents no. 3699, 13 October 1971]&lt;/ref&gt; a reading prominently advanced by [[List of kings of Persia|Shah]] [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]], in a 1967 book, ''The White Revolution of Iran''. The Shah identified Cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with the Achaemenids.&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer-1999"&gt;[[#Wiesehöfer-1999|Wiesehöfer (1999)]], pp. 55–68&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "the history of our empire began with the famous declaration of Cyrus, which, for its advocacy of humane principles, justice and liberty, must be considered one of the most remarkable documents in the history of mankind."&lt;ref name="Pahlavi" /&gt; The Shah described Cyrus as the first ruler in history to give his subjects "freedom of opinion and other basic rights".&lt;ref name="Pahlavi"&gt;[[#Pahlavi|Pahlavi]], p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the Shah opened [[World Conference on Human Rights#Background|the first United Nations Conference on Human Rights]] in [[Tehran]] by saying that the Cyrus Cylinder was the precursor to the modern [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;[[#Robertson|Robertson]], p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1971 [[Nowruz]] (New Year) speech, the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year, during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy. It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized. The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran's political system, associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia's past, and with Cyrus in particular.&lt;ref name="Ansari"&gt;[[#Ansari|Ansari]], pp. 218–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as "a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create".&lt;ref name="Lincoln"&gt;[[#Lincoln|Lincoln]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration, and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history.&lt;ref name="Ansari" /&gt; The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities; it was put on display at the Shahyad Monument (now the [[Azadi Tower]]) in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="Housego"&gt;[[#Housego|Housego (1971-10-15)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|2,500 year celebrations]] commenced on October 12, 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in [[Pasargadae]]. On October 14, the shah's sister, [[Princess Ashraf Pahlavi]], presented the [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[U Thant]] with a replica of the Cylinder. The princess asserted that "the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and, above all, human liberty".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; The Secretary General accepted the gift, linking the Cylinder with the efforts of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to address "the question of Respect for Human Rights in Armed Conflict".&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; Since then the replica Cylinder has been kept at the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]] on the second floor hallway.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;United Nations Press Release 14 October 1971([http://www.livius.org/a/1/inscriptions/cyrus.pdf SG/SM/1553/HQ263])&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations continues to promote the cylinder as "an ancient declaration of human rights".&lt;ref name="Schulz" /&gt;

The interpretation of the Cylinder as a "charter of human rights" has been described by some historians as "rather [[Anachronistic#Scholarship|anachronistic]]" and tendentious.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;[[#Daniel|Daniel]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briant|Briant]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Llewellyn-Jones|Llewellyn-Jones]], p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;[[#Curtis|Curtis, Tallis &amp; Andre-Salvini]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; It has been dismissed as a "misunderstanding"&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;[[#Mitchell|Mitchell]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized as political propaganda devised by the Pahlavi regime.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt-1983" /&gt; The German historian Josef Wiesehöfer comments that the portrayal of Cyrus as a champion of human rights is as illusory as the image of the "humane and enlightened Shah of Persia".&lt;ref name="Wiesehöfer-1999" /&gt; [[D. Fairchild Ruggles]] and Helaine Silverman describe the Shah's aim as being to legitimise the Iranian nation and his own regime, and to counter the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism by creating an alternative narrative rooted in the ancient Persian past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Silverman, Helaine|author2=Ruggles, D. Fairchild |author2link=D. Fairchild Ruggles |title=Cultural Heritage and Human Rights|page=11|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-0-387-76579-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the immediate aftermath of the Shah's anniversary commemorations, the British Museum's C.B.F. Walker comments that the "essential character of the Cyrus Cylinder [is not] a general declaration of human rights or religious toleration but simply a building inscription, in the Babylonian and Assyrian tradition, commemorating Cyrus's restoration of the city of Babylon and the worship of Marduk previously neglected by Nabonidus".&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Two professors specialising in the history of the ancient Near East, Bill T. Arnold and Piotr Michalowski, comment: "Generically, it belongs with other foundation deposit inscriptions; it is not an edict of any kind, nor does it provide any unusual human rights declaration as is sometimes claimed."&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;[[#Arnold|Arnold]], pp. 426–430&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones of the [[University of Edinburgh]] notes that "there is nothing in the text" that suggests the concept of human rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Neil MacGregor comments:

{{quote|Comparison by scholars in the [[British Museum]] with other similar texts, however, showed that rulers in ancient Iraq had been making comparable declarations upon succeeding to the [Babylonian] throne for two millennia before Cyrus […] it is one of the museum's tasks to resist the narrowing of the object's meaning and its appropriation to one political agenda.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt;}} He cautions that while the Cylinder is "clearly linked with the [[History of Iran#Median and Achaemenid Empire (650 BC–330 BC)|history of Iran]]," it is "in no real sense an Iranian document: it is part of a much larger history of the ancient Near East, of Mesopotamian kingship, and of the [[Jewish diaspora#Pre-Roman diaspora|Jewish diaspora]]".&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt;

Some historians,&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Lockard, ''Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History: To 1500'' (2007) p. 147; Yunus Jaffery, editor, ''History of Persian literature'' (1981), p. 121 (author unknown);&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writers on human rights, have supported the interpretation of the Cyrus Cylinder as a human rights charter.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Kingsbury, ''Human Rights in Asia: A Reassessment of the Asian Values Debate'' (Macmillan, 2008) page 21; Sabine C. Carey, ''The Politics of Human Rights: The Quest for Dignity'' (2010) p 19; Paul Gordon Lauren, ''The Evolution of International Human Rights'' (2003) Page 11; Willem Adriaan Veenhoven, ''Case Studies on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: A World Survey: Volume 1'' (1975) Page 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Decolonisation, Globalisation: Language-in-Education Policy and Practice'', Peter W. Martin, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; W.J. Talbott, an American philosopher, believes the concept of human rights is a 20th-century concept but describes Cyrus as "perhaps the earliest known advocate of religious tolerance" and suggests that "ideas that led to the development of human rights are not limited to one cultural tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Talbott, W.J. ''Which Rights Should be Universal?'', p. 40. Oxford University Press US, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian lawyer Hirad Abtahi argues that viewing the Cylinder as merely "an instrument of legitimizing royal rule" is unjustified, as Cyrus issued the document and granted those rights when he was at the height of his power, with neither popular opposition nor visible external threat to force his hand.&lt;ref name="Abtahi"&gt;[[#Abtahi|Abtahi]], pp. 1–38.&lt;/ref&gt; A former Iranian prime minister, [[Hassan Pirnia]], writing in the early 20th century, characterizes the Cylinder as "discuss[ing] human rights in a way unique for the era, dealing with ways to protect the honor, prestige, and religious beliefs of all the nations dependent to Iran in those days".&lt;ref name="Shabani"&gt;Cited in [[#Shabani|Shabani]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition history ==
[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|alt=View of the Cyrus Cylinder in its display cabinet, situated behind glass on a display stand. Other ancient Persian artefacts can be seen lining the room in the background.|The Cyrus Cylinder in Room 55 of the British Museum in London]]
The Cyrus Cylinder has been displayed in the British Museum since its formal acquisition in 1880.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; It has been loaned four times – twice to Iran, between 7–22 October 1971 in conjunction with the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]] and again from September–December 2010, once to [[Spain]] from March–June 2006,&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt; and once to the United States in a traveling exhibition from March–October 2013. Many replicas have been made. Some were distributed by the Shah following the 1971 commemorations, while the British Museum and [[National Museum of Iran]] have sold them commercially.&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

The British Museum's ownership of the Cyrus Cylinder has been the cause of some controversy in Iran, although the artifact was obtained legally and was not excavated on Iranian soil but on former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman territory]] (modern [[Iraq]]). When it was loaned in 1971, the Iranian press campaigned for its transfer to Iranian ownership. The Cylinder was brought back to London without difficulty, but the British Museum's Board of Trustees subsequently decided that it would be "undesirable to make a further loan of the Cylinder to Iran."&lt;ref name="BM-database" /&gt;

In 2005–2006 the British Museum mounted a major exhibition on the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], ''Forgotten Empire: the World of Ancient Persia.'' It was held in collaboration with the Iranian government, which loaned the British Museum a number of iconic artefacts in exchange for an undertaking that the Cyrus Cylinder would be loaned to the National Museum of Iran in return.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jeffries|Jeffries (2005-10-22)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The planned loan of the Cylinder was postponed in October 2009 following the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|June 2009 Iranian presidential election]] so that the British Museum could be "assured that the situation in the country was suitable".&lt;ref name=Sheikholeslami&gt;[[#Sheikholeslami|Sheikholeslami (2009-10-12)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Iranian government threatened to end cooperation with the British Museum if the Cylinder was not loaned within the following two months.&lt;ref name=Sheikholeslami /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson (2010-01-24)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This deadline was postponed despite appeals by the Iranian government&lt;ref name=Sheikholeslami /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[#Iran severs|Iran severs cultural ties with British Museum over Persian treasure (2010-02-07)]]"&lt;/ref&gt; but the Cylinder did eventually go on display in Tehran in September 2010 for a four-month period.&lt;ref name="CyrusCylinderReturns"&gt;[[#CyrusCylinderReturns|''Cyrus Cylinder, world's oldest human rights charter, returns to Iran on loan,'' The Guardian (2010-09-10)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was very popular, attracting 48,000 people within the first ten days and about 500,000 people by the time it closed in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=227412 Cyrus Cylinder warmly welcomed at home]".

{{Main article|Freedom Sculpture}}
[[File:Freedom Sculpture at night.jpg|thumb|The freedom sculpture]]
The '''Freedom Sculpture''' ({{lang-fa|تندیس آزادی}}) is a [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[statue]] located on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in the [[Beverly Hills, California]].
 
The design of the Freedom Sculpture was created by artist and architect [[Cecil Balmond]]. It is themed on the Cyrus Cylinder from 2,500 years ago, which is sometimes considered the first declaration of [[human rights]]. It commemorates the declaration of [[Cyrus the Great]], King of [[History of Iran|ancient Iran]], granting individual and religious freedoms to those within his empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://la.curbed.com/2017/7/5/15923494/la-freedom-sculpture-century-city-cylinder | title=Century City Freedom Sculpture unveiled on Santa Monica Boulevard median| date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-freedom-sculpture-20170704-story.html | title='Los Angeles embodies diversity.' the city's new sculpture celebrating freedom is unveiled - Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory''' ('''DMRL''') is a [[research laboratory]] of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located in Defence Research Complex, Kanchanbagh, [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], it is responsible for the development and manufacture of complex metals and materials required for modern warfare and weapon systems.&lt;ref name=nti&gt;[http://www.nti.org/facilities/34/ DMRL Profile] on [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DMRL was set up in 1963 at Hyderabad. Since then, it has developed competence in the areas of powder metallurgy based fabrication and development of alloys, armor and rocket motor steel, aerospace light alloys, and magnetic materials. The formation of other entities such as the Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd., Heavy Alloy Penetrator Plant, Composites Production Centre, Non-Ferrous Technology Development Centre, and the Advanced Research Centre International have followed the establishment of DMRL. The DMRL is also involved in [[R&amp;D]] efforts to develop futuristic materials to provide advanced technology options.&lt;ref name=nti/&gt;

==Projects and products==
DMRL has developed:&lt;ref name=nti/&gt;

* Ultra-high-strength steel with the toughness combination equivalent to [[maraging steel]]; this steel has been used to build rocket motor casings for the [[Akash surface-to-air missile]]s
* Heavy alloy pre-fragments for [[Prithvi missile]] warheads developed for use against aerial targets
* [[OFE copper]] for the [[Nag anti-tank guided missile]] sheets
* Special magnetic materials such as [[samarium-cobalt ring magnet]]s and [[neodymium-iron-boron magnet]]s in collaboration with the [[Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre]] for applications in the space program
* [[Kanchan armour]] for use on the Arjun tank as well as other armoured vehicles like Sarath and Abhay

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10751">[[File:E-learning.jpg|thumb|A digital learning environment]]'''Digital scholarship''' is the use of digital evidence, methods of inquiry, research, publication and preservation to achieve scholarly and research goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rumsey|first=Abby|title=New-Model Scholarly Communication: Road Map for Change|url=http://www.uvasci.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SCI9-report.pdf|work=Scholarly Communication Institute 9|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital scholarship can encompass both [[scholarly communication]] using digital media and research on [[digital media]]. An important aspect of digital scholarship is the effort to establish digital media and [[social media]] as credible, professional and legitimate means of research and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Challenges of Digital Scholarship|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/the-challenges-of-digital-scholarship/38103|accessdate=30 July 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital scholarship has a close association with [[digital humanities]], though the relationship between these terms is unclear.

Digital scholarship may also include [[born-digital]] means of scholarly communication that are more traditional, like online journals and databases, e-mail correspondence and the digital or digitized collections of research and [[academic libraries]]. Since digital scholarship is concerned with the production and distribution of digital media, discussions about [[copyright]], [[fair use]] and [[digital rights management]] (DRM) frequently accompany academic analysis of the topic. Combined with [[open access]], digital scholarship is offered as a more affordable and open model for scholarly communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hornby|first=Amanda|title=Digital scholarship and scholarly communication|url=http://www.uwb.edu/getattachment/tlc/faculty/teaching-resources/newmedia/scholarlycommunicationhandout.pdf|publisher=University of Washington Libraries|accessdate=30 July 2013|author2=Leslie Bussert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}

==Outlook==
According to [https://depts.washington.edu/gs630/Spring/Boyer.pdf Ernest L. Boyer in Scholarship Reconsidered], discovery, integration, application, and teaching are the four main aspects of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Nick; Scanlon, Eileen; Weller, Martin; Ashleigh, Melanie;. ' ' Digital Scholarship Considered.' ' In Education, p. 35. [http://ineducation.couros.ca/index.php/ineducation/article/view/44/509]&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of digital media means that the main areas of scholarship can each benefit from expansions in their own way thanks to the infinite sharability of digital content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1  = Feeney| first1 = Mary| last2  = Ross| first2 = Seamus| lastauthoramp = yes| title   = Information Technology in Humanities Scholarship, British Achievements, Prospects, and Barriers | journal = Historical Social Research| volume  = 19| issue   = 1 (69)| year    = 1994| pages = 3–59| jstor = 20755828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, the main areas of relevance are science, technology, engineering and math.  It is said that students learn best in a classroom when they are actively engaged.  The emergence of digital scholarship and digital media allows for another means for students to become engaged.  Key areas of academia that digital media is used on are to illustrate concepts, model displays and reinforce 21st century skills.&lt;ref&gt;Teachers' domain: digital media (including video!) resources for the STEM classroom and collection. 2010. Knowledgeable Quest, 39 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics cite concerns about the legitimacy, accessibility and verifiability of digital scholarship and the erosion of authors' rights as reasons to be concerned about digital scholarship. As scholarly communication evolves, controversy over the definition and value of the term "digital scholarship" is likely to continue.

Digital scholarship must take all of cultural, economic, personal, and institutional responsibilities to take its position as academic scholarship and to realize the core purpose of higher education with the possibilities of our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayers|first=Edward L.|title=Does Digital Scholarship Have a Future?|url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERM1343.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property==
Concerns with how to regulate digital scholarship have arisen across universities across the world. The explosion in availability and creation of scholarly works has led many universities to adjust their policies on how they will manage scholarship in the future. These universities feel pressured to take action because digital technologies have led to the easy reproduction and commodification of these creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities are unclear how to address the copyrighting of online classes and media presentations. Current law does not cover these specific areas of media produced in the academic world.&lt;ref name=IP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheri V.T.|title=Intellectual Property Policies in Academe: Issues and Concerns with Digital Scholarship|journal=Proceedings of the Charleston Library Conference|year=2012|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1389&amp;context=charleston|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past any printed work done by professors was considered their intellectual property, but now the question stands as to who owns these different forms of multimedia. One of the main concerns of faculty is that universities will soon take ownership of this digital media.

Universities have taken a growing interest in creations that have revenue-generating potential, like online classes or lecture slides, while also showing concern for products that may be used by comparable institutions, potentially reducing their competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; In order to stay on top of others academically, universities have sought to keep the intellectual property created within the university away from others schools. Not only are universities using digital scholarship to make money and stay ahead, but they also have interests in protecting their brand.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt;

While universities attempt to protect digital scholarship, it is in many professors best interests for their creations to be seen by the world as to grow their brand and acclaim as a professor. Laws that may apply to digital scholarship are largely outdated but professors would like to use the argument of faculty ownership of traditional works as historical practice and practice compatible with mission of higher education as a public good.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors argue that it took time and serious effort to make the presentations, slides, media.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; To date professors have been rarely questioned whether they have the right to bring their course outlines, lecture outlines, and lecture notes with them if they decide to leave the university where they created them.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Change over the ability of professors to bring digital scholarship with them is expected as universities have begun to take notice and assert copyrights.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Professors will argue that since they are the creators and authors of the product they are the owners according to law.

As of now most copyright laws in America indicate that the author or creator holds the copyright, but the same cannot be said for digital scholarship. The law explicitly states that if the work is within the scope of his or her employment then the work is the property of the employer.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Since the employer here would be the university, professors are technically creating [[work for hire]]. While faculty of universities appear to not be credited for their work, the primary reason for a university to take ownership of a faculty's work is that the member created the work using university funds mostly.&lt;ref name=IP /&gt; Solutions to the lack of clear laws regarding ownership of digital scholarship are not currently being created but many universities have created written contracts with professors over who owns future work or what they can do with previous work.

For example, in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Stanford v. Roche]]'', the court decided that Roche, a former Stanford researcher, was a co-owner with Stanford of patents for testing kits to detect  HIV.&lt;ref name=Stand&gt;{{cite web|last=Lapin|first=Lisa|title=Stanford 'disappointed' in Supreme Court ruling in Roche case|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/june/court-roche-ruling-060711.html|publisher=Stanford News|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this case does not deal with digital scholarship directly, it deals with the ownership of intellectual property of university employees when they leave. This case will set a precedent for future decisions with online classes, lecture notes, and outlines.

==NEA Policy==
The [[National Education Association]] (NEA), the largest professional educational association in the United States, updated its policy on digital learning in 2013. The policy stresses that students need to develop "advanced critical thinking and information literacy skills and master new digital tools," as well as "the initiative to become self-directed learners while adapting to the ever-changing digital information landscape." The NEA also believes that digital learning creates an environment in which learning can be more individualized to meet the needs of each student. The NEA mandates that all public schools must do their best to acquire necessary modern technologies and constantly revise teaching plans to incorporate technology where viable to best prepare students for the 21st century. The NEA's digital learning policy also states that technology must be used in an adaptive manner as to not become a distraction and to remain a tool, as well as that technology should not become a replacement for instructors, merely a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEA Policy Statement on Digital Learning|url=http://www.nea.org/home/55434.htm|publisher=National Education Association|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Let alone2.jpg|thumb|''Lodgings to Let'', an 1814 engraving featuring a double entendre.&lt;br /&gt;He: "My sweet honey, I hope you are to be [[renting|let]] with the Lodgins!"&lt;br /&gt;She: "No, sir, I am to be let &lt;u&gt;alone&lt;/u&gt;".]]

A '''double entendre''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ̃|ˈ|t|ɒ̃|d|(|r|ə|)}}; {{IPA-fr|dubl ɑ̃.tɑ̃dʁ(ə)|lang}}) is a [[figure of speech]] or a particular way of wording that is devised to be understood in two ways, having a double meaning. Typically one of the meanings is obvious, given the context, whereas the other may require more thought. The [[innuendo]] may convey a message that would be socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly (the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' describes a double entendre as being used to "convey an indelicate meaning", whilst ''[[Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'' defines it as "a word or phrase that may be understood in two different ways, one of which is often sexual").&lt;ref name="Longman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | title=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English online | publisher=Longman | work=Dictionary of Contemporary English | accessdate=29 August 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903083027/http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/double-entendre | archivedate=3 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A double entendre may exploit [[pun]]s to convey the second meaning. Double entendres generally rely on multiple meanings of words, or different interpretations of the same primary meaning. They often exploit [[ambiguity]] and may be used to introduce it deliberately in a text.  Sometimes a [[homophone]] (i.e., another word which sounds the same) can be used as a pun.  When three or more meanings have been constructed, this is known as a "triple entendre", etc.

== Structure ==
A person who is unfamiliar with the hidden or alternative meaning of a sentence may fail to detect its [[innuendo]]s, aside from observing that others find it humorous for no apparent reason. Perhaps because it is not offensive to those who do not recognise it, innuendo is often used in [[sitcom]]s and other [[comedy]] where the audience may enjoy the humour while being oblivious to its secondary meaning.

A triple entendre is a phrase that can be understood in any of three ways, such as in the back cover of the 1981 [[Rush (band)|Rush]] album ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' which shows a [[moving company]] carrying paintings out of a building while people are shown being emotionally moved and a film crew makes a "[[moving picture]]" of the whole scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|title=The Rush Frequently Asked Questions on the Internet File|work=nimitz.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222184534/http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#82|archivedate=22 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The expression comes from [[French language|French]] ''double'' = "double" and ''entendre'' = "to hear" (but also "to understand"&lt;ref name="TLFi"&gt;[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre definition of entendre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429210121/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/entendre |date=29 April 2012 }}, ''sub'' II at www.cnrtl.fr, accessed on 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the English formulation is a corruption of the authentic French expression ''à double entente'' ("double meaning").&lt;ref name="reverso"&gt;[http://dictionnaire.reverso.net/francais-definition/entente definition of Entente] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322053028/http://dictionnaire.reverso.net/francais-definition/entente |date=22 March 2012 }} at dictionnaire.reverso.net accessed on 20 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Modern French uses ''double sens'' instead; the phrase ''double entendre'' has no real meaning in the modern French language.

== Usage ==

=== Literature ===
In [[Homer]]'s ''The [[Odyssey]]'', when [[Odysseus]] is captured by the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]], he tells the Cyclops that his name is Oudeis (ουδεις = No-one). When Odysseus attacks the Cyclops later that night and stabs him in the eye, the Cyclops runs out of his cave, yelling to the other cyclopes that "No-one has hurt me!", which leads the other cyclopes to take no action under the assumption that Polyphemus blinded himself by accident, allowing Odysseus and his men to escape.

[[File:Wanderer-Exeter-Book-first-page-Bernard-Muir.jpg|thumb|The first page of the poem "The Wanderer" found in the Exeter Book.]]
Some of the earliest double entendres are found in the [[Exeter Book]], or Codex exoniensis, at [[Exeter Cathedral]] in [[England]]. The book was copied around AD 975. In addition to the various poems and stories found in the book, there are also numerous riddles. The Anglo-Saxons did not reveal the answers to the riddles, but they have been answered by scholars over the years. Some riddles were double-entendres, such as [[Exeter Book#Riddle 25|Riddle 25]] ("I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall––I stand up in bed––and whiskery somewhere down below. Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. Her eye will be wet.") which suggests the answer "a [[Human penis|penis]]" but has the correct answer "an [[onion]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Exeter Book Riddles|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/britannia/anglo-saxon/flowers/enigmata.html|website = penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of [[innuendo|sexual innuendo]] and double-entendre occur in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (14th century), in which the Wife of Bath's Tale is laden with double entendres. The most famous of these may be her use of the word "queynte" to describe both domestic duties (from the homonym "quaint") and genitalia ("queynte" being the root of '[[cunt]]', a [[Vulgarity|vulgar]] English word for [[vagina]]).  
The title of [[Sir Thomas More]]'s 1516 fictional work ''[[Utopia]]'' is a double entendre because of the [[pun]] between two [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived words that would have identical pronunciation: with his spelling, it means "no place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster.com/dictionary/Utopia|title=Utopia – Definition of utopia by Merriam-Webster|work=webster.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052252/http://webster.com/dictionary/utopia|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as echoed later in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s later [[Erewhon]]); spelled as the rare word [[Eutopia]], it is pronounced the same&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Cousins, Macquarie University. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=8578 "Utopia." The Literary Encyclopedia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711213449/http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=8578 |date=11 July 2007 }}  25 October 2004. The Literary Dictionary Company. {{Nowrap|3 January}} 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[English language|English]]-speaking readers, but has the meaning "good place".

Sometimes, it is unclear whether a double entendre was intended.  For example, the character [[Charley Bates]] from [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' is frequently referred to as Master Bates. The word "[[masturbation|masturbate]]" was in use when the book was written, and Dickens often used colourful names related to the natures of the characters.

The title of [[Damon Knight]]'s story ''[[To Serve Man]]'' is a double entendre which could mean "to perform a service to humanity" or "to serve a human as food". An alien [[cookbook]] with the title ''To Serve Man'' is featured in the story which could imply that the aliens eat humans. The story was the basis for [[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|an episode]] of [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|''The Twilight Zone'']]. At the end of the episode the line "It's a cookbook!" reveals the truth.

=== Stage performances ===
[[File:Wilhelm Maria Hubertus Leibl 010.jpg|thumb|right|Flax on a distaff]]
Shakespeare frequently used double entendres in his plays. [[Sir Toby Belch]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' says of [[Sir Andrew Aguecheek|Sir Andrew's]] hair, that "it hangs like [[flax]] on a [[distaff]]; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off"; [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|the Nurse]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' says that her husband had told [[Juliet]] when she was learning to walk that "Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit"; or is told the time by [[Mercutio]]: "for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the [[Prick (slang)|prick]] of noon";  and in ''[[Hamlet]]'', [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] publicly torments [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] with a series of sexual puns, including "country matters" (similar to "[[cunt]]"). The title of Shakespeare's play ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' is a pun on the Elizabethan use of "no-thing" as slang for [[vagina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Gordon |year=1997 |title=''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' |publisher=Althone Press  |ISBN= 0-485-12130-1 |page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917011921/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | archivedate=17 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, starting in the 19th century, [[Victorian morality]] disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience. In [[music hall]] songs, on the other hand, this kind of innuendo remained very popular. [[Marie Lloyd]]'s song "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas" is an example of this. (Music hall in this context is to be compared with [[Variety show|Variety]], the one common, [[low-class]] and vulgar; the other [[demi-monde]], worldly and sometimes [[Chic (style)|chic]].)  In the 20th century there began to a crackdown on lewdness, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. [[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]], famously, had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow, the white book was rarely used (in the UK, 'blue' [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] refers to sexual content, as in 'blue jokes', 'blue movies' etc.).

=== Radio and television ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In the United States, innuendo and double entendre were only lightly used in radio media until the 1980s when the [[Howard Stern Show]] began to push the envelope of what was acceptable on the radio through use of double entendre and ironies. This garnered so much attention it spawned an entire genre of Radio called "[[Shock Jock]] Radio" where DJs will push the limits of what is an "acceptable" double entendre to use on over the air as the FCC has been known to hand out large fines for the use of double entendre on radio if they deem it to be in violation of their standards.

In Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to [[radio]] and [[film|cinema]] from the late 1950s on. Particularly significant in this respect were the ''[[Carry On (series)|Carry On]]'' series of films and the [[BBC]] radio series ''[[Round the Horne]]'', although some of ''Round the Horne'' appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having 'rude' conversations in [[Polari]] (gay slang). ''Round the Horne'' depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show's name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor [[Kenneth Horne]] and those around him, the sailor's expression 'going round the horn' (i.e. [[Cape Horn]]), and the fact that 'horn' is slang for an [[erection]]. [[Spike Milligan]], writer of ''[[The Goon Show]]'', remarked that a lot of 'blue' (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen's jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were "Officer class".

In 1968, the office of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ceased to have responsibility for censoring live [[entertainment]], after the [[Theatres Act 1968]]. By the 1970s innuendo had become widely used across much of the British broadcast media, including [[British sitcom|sitcoms]] and [[radio comedy]], such as ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]''. For example, in the 1970s TV comedy series ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'', Mrs. Slocombe frequently referred to her pet cat as her "pussy", apparently unaware of how easily her statement could be misinterpreted, such as "It's a wonder I'm here at all, you know. My pussy got soakin' wet. I had to dry it out in front of the fire before I left". Someone unfamiliar with sexual slang might find this statement funny simply because of the references to her sodden cat, whereas others would find further humour in the [[innuendo]] ("pussy" being [[sexual slang]] for vulva).

Modern comedies, such as the US version of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', often do not hide the addition of sexual innuendos into the script; for example, main character [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] often deploys the phrase "[[Said the actress to the bishop|that's what she said]]" after another character's innocent statement, to turn it retroactively into a sexual pun.

On The Scott Mills Show on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with double meanings in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movies ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Double entendres are popular in modern movies, as a way to conceal adult humour in a work aimed at general audiences. The [[James Bond]] films are rife with such humour.  For example, in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), when Bond is disturbed by the telephone while in bed with a Danish girl, he explains to Moneypenny that he is busy "brushing up on a little Danish".  Moneypenny responds by pointing out that Bond was known as "a cunning linguist", a play on the word "[[cunnilingus]]". In the final scene of ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', while Bond is taking Dr Holly Goodhead “round the world one more time”, Q says to Sir Frederick Gray, “I think he’s attempting re-entry, sir.” In ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), while in bed with Dr [[Christmas Jones]], Bond tells her “I thought Christmas only comes once a year”. Other obvious examples include [[Pussy Galore]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and [[Holly Goodhead]] in ''Moonraker''. The double entendres of the Bond films were parodied in the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' series.

Bawdy double entendres, such as "I'm the kinda girl who works for Paramount by day, and Fox all night", and (from the movie ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'') "I feel like a million tonight — but only one at a time", are typical of the comedy writing of [[Mae West]], for her early-career vaudeville performances as well as for her later plays and movies.

=== Music ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Double entendres are very common in the titles and lyrics of pop songs, such as "[[If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me]]" by The Bellamy Brothers, which is based on an old [[Groucho Marx]] quote. By one interpretation, the person being talked to is asked if they would be offended; by the other interpretation, they are asked if they would press their body against the person doing the talking.

Singer and songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], in his somewhat controversial song "[[Rainy Day Women No. 12 &amp; 35|Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35]]", repeats the line "Everybody must get stoned". In context, the phrase refers to the punishment of [[capital punishment|execution]] by [[stoning]], but on another level it means to 'get stoned', a common slang term for being high on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. In their song "Big Balls" on the album ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', [[AC/DC]] the chorus "we've got big balls" can be read as referring to either [[ball (dance)|formal dances]] or [[testicle]]s.  During the 1940s, [[Benny Bell]] recorded several "party records" that contained double entendre including "Everybody Wants My Fanny".

=== Social interaction ===
Double entendres can arise in the replies to inquiries. The clichéd phrase "[[that's what she said]]", as well as "so to speak" can be used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fighter Pilot Speak | url = http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | accessdate = 11 February 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150123010403/http://christianfighterpilot.com/blog/2006/06/13/fighter-pilot-linguistic-games-so-to-speak/ | archivedate = 23 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to remark on a sentence said by another which was not intended as a double entendre but nevertheless could be interpreted with a double meaning, one of them sexual. In recent times, due to prevalence of [[Meme|memes]], the sentence "If you know what I mean" has taken a similar meaning.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Ecological genetics''' is the study of [[genetics]] in natural populations.

This contrasts with [[classical genetics]], which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]], which studies genes at the molecular level.

Research in this field is on [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] of ecological significance—that is, traits related to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, [[drought]] tolerance, [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], [[mimicry]], avoidance of attacks by [[predator]]s.

Research usually involves a mixture of field and laboratory studies.&lt;ref&gt;Ford E.B. 1981. ''Taking genetics into the countryside''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of [[death|mortality]] in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on [[insect]]s and other organisms that have short generation times.

== History ==
Although work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the [[United Kingdom|English]] biologist [[Edmund Brisco Ford|E.B. Ford]] (1901–1988) in the early 20th century. Ford was taught genetics at [[Oxford University]] by [[Julian Huxley]], and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924. Ford also had a long working relationship with [[R.A. Fisher]]. By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of [[genetic polymorphism]],&lt;ref name ="New systematics"&gt;Ford E.B. 1940. Polymorphism and taxonomy. In Huxley J. ''The new systematics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford E.B. 1965. ''Genetic polymorphism''. All Souls Studies, Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher had got accustomed to high [[natural selection]] values in nature. This was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations. Ford's magnum opus was ''Ecological genetics'', which ran to four editions and was widely influential.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Ford E.B. 1975. ''Ecological genetics'', 4th ed. Chapman and Hall, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable ecological geneticists would include [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] who worked on [[chromosome]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in [[Drosophila|fruit flies]]. As a young researcher in Russia, Dobzhansky had been influenced by [[Sergei Chetverikov]], who also deserves to be remembered as a founder of genetics in the field, though his significance was not appreciated until much later. Dobzhansky and colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of ''Drosophila'' species in western USA and Mexico over many years.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius. ''Genetics and the origin of species''. Columbia, N.Y. 1st ed 1937; second ed 1941; 3rd ed 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius 1970. ''Genetics of the evolutionary process''. Columbia, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius 1981. ''Dobzhansky's genetics of natural populations I-XLIII''. R.C. Lewontin, J.A. Moore, W.B. Provine &amp; B. Wallace, eds. Columbia University Press, New York 1981. (reprints the 43 papers in this series, all but two of which were authored or co-authored by Dobzhansky)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Sheppard]], [[Cyril Clarke]], [[Bernard Kettlewell]] and [[A.J. Cain]] were all strongly influenced by Ford; their careers date from the post World War II era. Collectively, their work on [[lepidoptera]], and on human [[blood groups]], established the field, and threw light on selection in natural populations where its role had been once doubted.

Work of this kind needs long-term funding, as well as grounding in both ecology and genetics. These are both difficult requirements. Research projects can last longer than a researcher's career; for instance, research into [[mimicry]] started 150 years ago, and is still going strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Mallet J. and Joron M. 1999. Evolution in diversity in warning color and mimicry: polymorphisms, shifting balance and speciation. ''Annual Review of Ecological Systematics'' 1999. '''30''' 201–233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruxton G.D. Sherratt T.N. and Speed M.P. 2004. ''Avoiding attack: the evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals &amp; mimicry''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding of this type of research is still rather erratic, but at least the value of working with natural populations in the field cannot now be doubted.

'''Ex-Rad''' (or '''Ex-RAD'''), also known by the code name '''ON 01210.Na''', or '''recilisib sodium''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Approved Name|USAN]]) is a drug developed by Onconova Therapeutics and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name=pr2010&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-09/poc-otp092710.php |title=Onconova Therapeutics presents new data demonstrating radioprotection by Ex-RAD at RRS annual meeting |date=2010-09-27 |publisher=EurekAlert |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xNPCFCyV?url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-09/poc-otp092710.php |archivedate=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This newly developed compound is said to be a potent radiation protection agent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Chemically, it is the sodium salt of 4-carboxystyryl-4-chlorobenzylsulfone.&lt;ref name=ghosh2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1667/RR1367.1 |title=Radiation Protection by a New Chemical Entity, Ex-Rad: Efficacy and Mechanisms |year=2009 |last1=Ghosh |first1=Sanchita P. |last2=Perkins |first2=Michael W. |last3=Hieber |first3=Kevin |last4=Kulkarni |first4=Shilpa |last5=Kao |first5=Tzu-Cheg |last6=Reddy |first6=E.

Sree |journal=Radiation Research |volume=171 |issue=2 |pages=173–9 |pmid=19267542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical trials==
The results of two [[Clinical trial#Phase I|Phase I]] clinical studies in healthy human volunteers indicate that subcutaneously injected Ex-Rad is safe and well tolerated, with "no evidence of systemic side effects".&lt;ref name=onsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onconova.com/exrad.shtml |title=Ex-RAD® for Protection from Radiation Injury |year=2009 |publisher=Onconova Therapeutics |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xNOvmmk0?url=http://www.onconova.com/exrad.shtml |archivedate=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in mice demonstrated the efficacy of Ex-Rad by increasing the survival rate of mice exposed to typically lethal whole-body irradiation. The study tested oral and [[parenteral]] administration of Ex-Rad for both pre- and post-exposure radiomitigation.&lt;ref name=pr2010 /&gt;

Research on Ex-Rad has involved collaboration with the [[Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute]] (AFRRI), the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology at [[Georgetown University]], [[Long Island University]]'s Arnold &amp; Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy, and the Department of Oncological Sciences at the [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine|Mt. Sinai School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=pr2010 /&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Onconova suggests that Ex-Rad protects cells exposed to radiation against DNA damage, and that the drug's mechanism of action does not involve scavenging [[free radicals]] or arresting the [[cell cycle]]. Instead, they claim it employs a "novel mechanism" involving "intracellular signaling, damage sensing, and DNA repair pathways".&lt;ref name=onsite /&gt; Ex-RAD is a chlorobenzylsulfone derivative that works after free radicals have damaged DNA. Onconova CEO Ramesh Kumar believes this is a better approach than trying to scavenge free radicals. “Free radicals are very short-lived, and so the window of opportunity to give a drug is very narrow,” he says. In cell and animal models, Ex-RAD protects [[hematopoietic]] and [[gastrointestinal]] tissues from radiation injury when given either before or after exposure.&lt;ref name="cen"/&gt;

'''Explosion-proof enclosures''' are solid cabinets that contain different electrical components like switches, plugs, sockets, transformers, controls, and knobs to keep the surroundings safe from electrical hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfliq.net/electrical-materials-products/explosion-proof-enclosures/|title=Explosion Proof Electrical Enclosures - D &amp; F Liquidators Inc|website=dfliq.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated with sound technology, these boxes are resistant to spark and shock and have a high tolerance to extreme temperatures. An ideal solution for hazardous locations; these explosion-proof enclosures keep any interior explosion from spreading to the external environment and damaging life and property.

==Types of explosion-proof enclosures==
Explosion-proof enclosures are classified into different types depending on the location and the level of protection they offer&lt;ref&gt;[https://iscsales.com/hazardous-location-enclosures-the-definitive-guide-for-2018/ ''Hazardous Location Enclosures: The Definitive Guide for 2018''], by ISC Sales&lt;/ref&gt;. These codes are based on [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] (NEMA) standards which indicate the level of protection against electrical hazards like fire and explosion. Below is a list of location-specific enclosures and their applications:

==Non-hazardous locations==

===Type 1===
Designed for indoor use, type 1 enclosures offer protection against hazardous parts and protect the electronic equipment from dirt, dust, and debris.

===Type 2===
These enclosures are constructed for indoor applications and provide protection to the employees from electric hazards. It keeps the electrical equipment protected from the harmful effects of foreign objects.

===Type 3===
Designed for both indoor and outdoor use, type 3 enclosures keep the personnel protected from hazardous parts and the equipment safe from foreign objects and ingress of sleet, snow, dust, dirt, and rain.

===Type 3R===
In addition to the features and benefits that accompany Type 1 and Type 2, this make offers a much higher resistance to rain, sleet, snow, dust, and extreme weather conditions.

===Type 3S===
Offers protection against hazardous parts and guards the equipment from getting damaged by solid foreign objects. Type 3S enclosures can be used both indoors and outdoors to keep electrical equipment from deteriorating due to the ingress of rain, snow and sleet and functional flaws even when it is fully covered with ice.

===Type 3X===
Over and above the protection offered by Type 3R, these enclosures offer a much higher degree of protection against the external environment. The designation X stands for resistance to corrosion.

===Type 3RX===
Constructed for both indoor and outdoor use, this specific type offers additional protection against snow, sleet and extreme weather conditions apart from being corrosion resistant.

===Type 3SX===
It has all the features and benefits that accompany Type 3S. Designed for rugged use, this make features an efficient external mechanism that is corrosion resistant and facilitates operation even when the unit is covered with snow.

===Types 4, 4X===
These enclosures are ideal for both indoor and outdoor use and designed for protection against hazardous parts. These units keep the inside equipment guarded against harsh environmental conditions and ingress of external factors like rain, snow, dirt, dust and sleet. The designation X signifies resistance to corrosion which implies that the enclosure remains undamaged even with the formation of ice.

===Type 5===
Type 5 enclosures feature a mechanism that is similar to type 2. It comes with an additional gasket that keeps the enclosure guarded against fibers, lint, dust, dirt, and flyings. It is ideal for indoor use.

===Types 6, 6P===
Over and above the safety offered by type 4 units, these have a much higher resistance to water even when there are chances of temporary immersion. It prevents the entry of water and keeps hazardous consequences at bay in case of prolonged immersion.

===Types 12, 12K===
Designed specifically for indoor use, these enclosures provide a very high level of protection against dust, dirt, debris, lint, drips, water splashes, fibers, and flyings. Type 12 units are not resistant to rusting and corrosion but 12k units are. 12k enclosures are available in multiple variants including heavy-duty, wall mount, floor mount, modular, consoles, pushbutton and more.

===Type 13===
These all-purpose units are specifically constructed for indoor use and provide complete protection against ingress of circulating dust, blowing dirt, debris, lint, fibers, and flyings. It keeps the equipment protected against seepage of non-corrosive coolants, splashing, oil, and dripping.

==Explosion-proof enclosures rated for hazardous locations==
===Type 7 Enclosures===
Type 7 enclosures are designed for indoor use in Division 1, Class 1, and Groups A, B, C, and D as defined by the National Fire Protection Association.

===Type 8 Enclosures===
Type 8 enclosures are designed to meet the needs of indoor as well as outdoor applications in hazardous locations. These units are compatible for use in Division 1, Class 1 and Groups A, B, C, and D.

===Type 9 Enclosures===
Compatible with indoor and outdoor installations in hazardous locations, these units are an ideal solution for Division 1, Class 1, and Groups E, F and G.

===Type 10 Enclosures===
Type 10 enclosures are designed to meet the safety specifications of Mines and Health Administration as stated under part 18 of CFR 30.
Environments that contain combustible substances need multi-rated explosion-proof enclosures. Certain environments may also need high pressurizing and purging, provided there is a dependable system that complies with the safety requirements of [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA).

==Applications of explosion-proof enclosures==
Explosion-proof enclosures are available in different shapes, sizes, and specifications for different applications. These spark resistant units house electrical equipment and ensure complete safety of surroundings. Typical applications include:
* Petroleum refineries
* Industries using flammable liquids for operations
* Petrochemical industries
* Dry cleaning plants
* Fuel servicing areas
* Gas plants
* Feed mills
* Plants running metallurgical processes
* Chemical plants
* Producers of plastics and fireworks
* Producers of medicines, sugar plants, and candies
* Carbon-handling units
* Textile mills
* Flax processing plants

==Choosing enclosures for industrial applications==
With more and more companies going green, electronic products are now being designed for use in turbines, solar power systems and alternative energy systems that run with the aid of power and employ smart grids. Faulty installations can lead to fatal injuries and accidents. With the increasing need for electronics in every industry, it is important to consider these five points when selecting enclosures for specific applications:
* Location
Where the product will be installed determines the level of protection needed. Wind turbines are installed outdoors due to which they need to meet NEMA specifications for which 4X enclosures need to be installed. It is important to determine which enclosure has the required strength and durability to protect the equipment from dripping water, powerful sprays, dirt, dust, snow, sleet and debris depending on the location of installation.
* Capabilities
The capacity of your chosen enclosure plays a vital role in maintaining safety and speeding installation. The availability of brackets and attachments can be a huge help. It is important to have a mounting panel when installing a variety of electric components. Standard enclosures are readily available and cost much less as compared to customized units.
* NEMA/RFI Ratings
Applications that involve monitoring and consolidation of excess power from different sources require added protection. A die-cast enclosure made from aluminum with a double layering of gaskets and an outer gasket for sealing the moisture makes an ideal solution for such applications.
* Dimensions
Apart from environmental safety, you should also consider the future needs of your industry. The scope and extent of expansion play a decisive role in determining the dimensions of the enclosure. A small enclosure may prove to be an excellent space saver but can invite significant expenses in the long run. Enclosure modifications for cable access also need to be taken into consideration in enclosure selection.
* Design
The appearance of the enclosure becomes particularly important when it is being installed in a home or an office. The material of the enclosure also needs to be selected depending on the end-use. Installing an industrial unit for controlling a domestic solar system is not a sound choice. A plastic unit with a sleek design makes a perfect solution for residential installations.

'''Forest restoration''' is defined as “actions to re-instate ecological processes, which accelerate recovery of forest structure, ecological functioning and biodiversity levels towards those typical of [[Ecological succession#Climax community|climax forest]]”&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, S., D. Blakesley and K. Hardwick, in press. Restoring Tropical Forests: a Practical Guide. Kew Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the end-stage of natural forest [[secondary succession|succession]]. Climax forests are relatively stable ecosystems that have developed the maximum biomass, structural complexity and species diversity that are possible ''within the limits imposed by climate and soil and without continued disturbance from humans'' [[Climax community|(more explanation here)]]. Climax forest is therefore the target ecosystem, which defines the ultimate aim of forest restoration. Since climate is a major factor that determines climax forest composition, global climate change may result in changing restoration aims.&lt;ref&gt;Sgró, C.M., A. J. Lowe and A. A. Hoffmann, 2011. Building evolutionary resilience for conserving biodiversity under climate change. Evolutionary Applications 4 (2): 326-337&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest restoration is a specialized form of [[reforestation]], but it differs from conventional tree plantations in that its primary goals are [[biodiversity]] recovery and environmental protection.&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Regreening the Bare Hills|last = Lamb|first = David|publisher = Springer|year = 2011|isbn = 978-90-481-9870-2|location = |pages = 547|url = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789048198696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Stanturf"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Restoration of boreal and temperate forests|last = Stanturf|first = John A.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2005|isbn = |location = Boca Raton|pages = 3–11|chapter = What is forest restoration?|url = http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/22209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Forest restoration may include simply protecting remnant vegetation (fire prevention, cattle exclusion etc.) or more active interventions to accelerate natural regeneration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assisted natural regeneration of forests|url = http://www.fao.org/forestry/anr/en/|website = www.fao.org|access-date = 2016-02-24|first = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United|last = Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[tree planting]] and/or sowing seeds ([[direct seeding]]) of species characteristic of the target ecosystem. Tree species planted (or encouraged to establish) are those that are typical of, or provide a critical ecological function in, the target ecosystem. However, wherever people live in or near restoration sites, restoration projects often include economic species amongst the planted trees, to yield subsistence or cash-generating products.

Forest restoration is an inclusive process, which depends on collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders including local communities, government officials, non-government organizations, scientists and funding agencies. Its ecological success is measured in terms of increased biological diversity, biomass, [[primary productivity]], [[soil organic matter]] and water-holding capacity, as well as the return of rare and [[keystone species]], characteristic of the target ecosystem. Economic indices of success include the value of forest products and ecological services generated (e.g. watershed protection, carbon storage etc.), which ultimately contribute towards poverty reduction. [[payment for ecosystem services|Payments for such ecological services (PES)]] and forest products can provide strong incentives for local people to implement restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martínez de Aragón|first1=Juan|last2=Fischer|first2=Christine|last3=Bonet|first3=Jose-Antonio|last4=Olivera|first4=Antoni|last5=Oliach|first5=Daniel|last6=Colinas|first6=Carlos|title=Economically profitable post fire restoration with black truffle (Tuber melanosporum) producing plantations|journal=New Forests|date=2012|volume=43|pages=615–630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunities for forest restoration ==
[[File:ESF-Forest-Restoration-Corner-2014.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Demonstration forest restoration plot, [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY-ESF]], Syracuse, NY]]

Forest restoration is appropriate wherever biodiversity recovery is one of the main goals of reforestation, such as for wildlife conservation, environmental protection, eco-tourism or to supply a wide variety of forest products to local communities. Forests can be restored in a wide range of circumstances, but degraded sites within protected areas are a high priority, especially where some climax forest remains as a seed source within the landscape. Even in protected areas, there are often large deforested sites: logged over areas or sites formerly cleared for agriculture. If protected areas are to act as Earth’s last wildlife refuges, restoration of such areas will be needed.&lt;ref name ="Lamb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanturf" /&gt;

Many restoration projects are now being implemented under the umbrella of “[[forest landscape restoration]]” (FLR),&lt;ref&gt;Mansourian, S., D. Vallauri, and N. Dudley (eds.) (in co-operation with WWF International), 2005. Forest Restoration in Landscapes: Beyond Planting Trees. Springer, New York&lt;/ref&gt; defined as a “planned process to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded landscapes”. FLR recognizes that forest restoration has social and economic functions. It aims to achieve the best possible compromise between meeting both conservation goals and the needs of rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;Reitbergen-McCraken, J., S. Maginnis A. Sarre, 2007. The Forest Landscape Restoration Handbook. Earthscan, London, 175 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; As human pressure on landscapes increases, forest restoration will most commonly be practiced within a mosaic of other forms of forest management, to meet the economic needs of local people.

== Natural regeneration ==

Tree planting is not always essential to restore forest ecosystems. A lot can be achieved by studying how forests regenerate naturally, identifying the factors that limit regeneration and devising methods to overcome them. These can include weeding and adding fertilizer around natural tree seedlings, preventing fire, removing cattle and so on. This is "accelerated" or "assisted" [[natural regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;Shono, K., E. A. Cadaweng and P. B. Durst, 2007. Application of Assisted Natural Regeneration to Restore Degraded Tropical Forestlands. Restoration Ecology, 15(4): 620–626.&lt;/ref&gt; It is simple and cost-effective, but it can only operate on trees that are already present, mostly light-loving [[pioneer species]]. Such tree species are not usually those that comprise climax forests, but they can foster recolonization of the site by shade-tolerant climax forest tree species, via natural seed dispersal from remnant forest. Because this is a slow process, biodiversity recovery can usually be accelerated by planting some climax forest tree species, especially large-seeded, poorly dispersed species. It is not feasible to plant all the tree species that may have formerly grown in the original primary forest and it is usually unnecessary to do so, if the [[framework species method]]&lt;ref&gt;Elliott S, Navakitbumrung P, Kuarak C, Zankum S, Anusarnsunthorn V, Blakesley D, 2003. Selecting framework tree species for restoring seasonally dry tropical forests in northern Thailand based on field performance. For Ecol Manage 184:177-191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goosem, S. and N. I. J. Tucker, 1995. Repairing the Rainforest. Wet Tropics Management Authority, Cairns, Australia. Pp 72. http://www.wettropics.gov.au/media/med_landholders.html&lt;/ref&gt; can be used.

== Post-fire regeneration ==

In large parts of the world, forest fires cover a heavy toll on forests. That can be because of provoked deforestation in order to substitute forests by crop areas, or in dry areas, because of wild fires occurring naturally or intentionally. A whole section of forest landscape restoration in linked to this particular problem, as in many cases, the net loss of ecosystem value is very high and can open the drop to an accelerated further degradation of the soil conditions through erosion and [[desertification]]. This indeed has dire consequences on both the quality of the habitats and their related fauna. Nevertheless, in some specific cases, wild fires do actually allow to increase the bio[[diversity index]] of the burnt area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regos|first1=Adrian|last2=D'Amen|first2=M|last3=Titeux|first3=Nicolas|last4=Herrando|first4=Sergi|last5=Guisan|first5=A|last6=Brotons|first6=Lluis|title=Predicting the future effectiveness of protected areas for bird conservation in Mediterranean ecosystems under climate change and novel fire regime scenarios|journal=Diversity and Distributions|date=2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=83–96|doi=10.1111/ddi.12375}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case the Forest Restoration Strategies tend to look for a different land-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martín-Alcón|first1=Santiago|last2=Coll|first2=Lluis|title=Unraveling the relative importance of factors driving post-fire regeneration trajectories in non-serotinous Pinus nigra forests|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2016|volume=361|pages=13–22|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2015.11.006|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_489_Martin-Alcon_and_Coll_2016_FORECO.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forest restoration projects==

===Ashland Forest Resiliency Stewardship Project===

The Ashland Forest Resiliency Stewardship Project (AFR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = City of Ashland, Oregon - Ashland Forest Resiliency Project - What is AFR?|url = http://www.ashland.or.us/Page.asp?NavID=12907|website = www.ashland.or.us|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a decade long, science-based project launched in 2010 with the intent of reducing severe wildfire risk, but also protecting water quality, old-growth forest, wildlife, people, property, and the overall quality of life within the Ashland watershed. The primary stakeholders in this cooperative restoration effort are the U.S. Forest Service, the City of Ashland, Lomaktsi Restoration Project, and the Nature Conservancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ashland Forest Resilency Project - Lomakatsi Restoration Project|url = http://lomakatsi.org/ashland-forest-resilency-project/|website = Lomakatsi Restoration Project|access-date = 2016-02-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was launched with initial funding from the Economic Recovery stimulus, and has more recently received funding from the Forest Service Hazardous Fuels program and the Joint Chiefs Landscape Restoration Partnerships program to back the project through 2016 .

Located in the dry forests of southern Oregon, the threat of wildfire is a reality for land managers and property owners alike. The boundaries of the city of Ashland intersect with the surrounding forest in what is referred to as the wildland-urban interface (WUI).&lt;ref&gt;Toman, E., Stidham, M., Shindler, B., McCaffrey, S. 2011. Reducing fuels in the wildland-urban interface: community perceptions of agency fuel treatments. Intl. Journal of Wildland Fire 20 (3):340-349&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the forests of this region experienced a relatively frequent fire return interval, which prevented buildup of heavy fuel loads.&lt;ref&gt;Hagmann, R.K., Franklin, J.F., Johnson, N.K. 2013. Historical structure and composition of ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests in south-central Oregon. Forest Ecology and Management 304: 492-504&lt;/ref&gt; A century of fire exclusion and suppression on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest has led to increased forest density and fuel loads, and thus a more persistent threat of devastating wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J.F., and Johnson, K.N. 2012. A restoration framework for federal forests in the Pacific Northwest. Journal of Forestry 110 (8): 429-439&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFR project has implemented restoration techniques and prescriptions that aim to replicate the process of [[ecological succession]] in dry, mixed-conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest. The approach involves a combination of fuels reduction, thinning small-diameter trees, and carrying out prescribed burns. Priority is given to maintaining ecological function and complexity by retaining the largest and oldest trees, preserving wildlife habitat and riparian areas, and protecting erodible soils and maintaining slope stability.

Since its inception in 2010, the AFR project has completed restoration work on 4,000 of the 7,600 acres slated for the project. The project has provided educational experience to over 2,000 students and has benefitted the local community by creating jobs and providing workforce training. Currently, helicopter logging operations are thinning 1,100 acres of the watershed while controlled burning operations take place as air quality conditions allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = City of Ashland, Oregon - Ashland Forest Resiliency Project - AFR Work Update|url = http://www.ashland.or.us/Page.asp?NavID=13128|website = www.ashland.or.us|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forest landscape restoration==
Forest landscape restoration (FLR) is defined as “a planned process to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in [[deforested]] or [[land degradation|degraded]] landscapes”.&lt;ref&gt;Reitbergen-McCraken, J., S. Maginnis A. Sarre, 2007. ''The Forest Landscape Restoration Handbook''. Earthscan, London, 175 pp&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises  tools and procedures to integrate site-level forest restoration actions with desirable landscape-level objectives, which are decided upon via various participatory mechanisms among stakeholders. The concept has grown out of collaboration among some of the world's major international conservation organizations including the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), the [[World Resources Institute]] and the [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] (ITTO).

===Aims===
The concept of FLR was conceived to bring about compromises between meeting the needs of both humans and wildlife, by [[land restoration|restoring]] a range of forest functions at the landscape level. It includes actions to strengthen the resilience and ecological integrity of landscapes and thereby keep future management options open. The participation of local communities is central to the concept, because they play a critical role in shaping the landscape and gain significant benefits from restored forest resources. Therefore, FLR activities are inclusive and participatory.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, D., 2011. ''Regreening the Bare Hills''. Springer 547pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desirable outcomes ===
The desirable outcomes of an FLR program usually comprise a combination of the following, depending on local needs and aspirations:
*identification of the root causes of [[forest degradation]] and prevention of further deforestation,
*positive engagement of people in the planning of forest restoration, resolution of [[land-use conflict]]s and agreement on benefit-sharing systems,
*compromises over [[land-use]] trade-offs that are acceptable to the majority of stakeholders,
*a repository of [[biological diversity]] of both local and global value,
*delivery of a range of utilitarian benefits to local communities including:
**a reliable supply of clean water,
**[[environmental protection]] particularly [[Drainage basin|watershed]] services (e.g. reduced soil erosion, lower landslide risk, flood/drought mitigation etc.),
**a sustainable supply of a diverse range of forest products including foods, medicines, firewood etc.,
**monetary income from various sources e.g. [[ecotourism]], [[carbon trading]] via the [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|REDD+]] mechanism and from [[payment for ecosystem services|payments for other environmental services (PES)]]&lt;ref&gt;Mansourian, S., D. Vallauri, and N. , Dudley (eds.) (in co-operation with WWF International), ''Forest Restoration in Landscapes: Beyond Planting Trees''. Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
FLR combines several existing principles and techniques of development, conservation and natural resource management, such as landscape character assessment, [[participatory rural appraisal]], [[adaptive management]] etc. within a clear and consistent evaluation and learning framework. An FLR program may comprise various forestry practices on different sites within the landscape, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic factors. These may include protection and management of secondary and degraded primary forests, standard forest restoration techniques such as "assisted" or "accelerated" [[natural regeneration]] (ANR) and the planting of [[framework tree species]] to restore degraded areas, as well as conventional tree plantations and [[agroforestry]] systems to meet more immediate monetary needs &lt;ref&gt;Elliott, S., D. Blakesley and K. Hardwick, in press. ''Restoring Tropical Forests: a Practical Guide''. Kew Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] hosts the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature#The Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration|Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration|url=http://www.forestlandscaperestoration.org/|website=The Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration|publisher=IUCN}}&lt;/ref&gt; which co-ordinates development of the concept around the world.

In 2014, the [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]] established the Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/flrm/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mechanism supports countries to implement FLR as a contribution to achieving the [[Bonn Challenge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration|title=The Bonn Challenge|url=http://www.bonnchallenge.org/|website=The Bonn Challenge|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the restoration of 150 million hectare of deforested and degraded lands by 2020 - and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] Aichi Biodiversity Targets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Convention on Biological Diversity|title=Aichi Biodiversity Targets|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/targets/T15-quick-guide-en.pdf|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt; - related to ecosystem conservation and restoration.

In partnership with the [[UNCCD|Global Mechanism of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], FAO released two discussion papers on sustainable financing for FLR in 2015. ''Sustainable Financing for Forest and Landscape Restoration: The Role of Public Policy Makers'' provides recommendations and examples of FLR financing for countrues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sustainable Financing for Forest and Landscape Restoration.

[[File:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Tuning-fork-style diagram of the [[Hubble sequence]]]]

'''Galaxy morphological classification''' is a system used by [[astronomer]]s to divide [[galaxy|galaxies]] into groups based on their visual appearance. There are several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, the most famous being the [[Hubble sequence]], devised by [[Edwin Hubble]] and later expanded by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] and [[Allan Sandage]].

== Hubble sequence ==
{{main|Hubble sequence}}
[[File:A remarkable galactic hybrid.jpg|thumb|Spiral galaxy [[UGC 12591]] is classified as an S0/Sa galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A remarkable galactic hybrid|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1709a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Hubble sequence is a morphological classification scheme for [[galaxies]] invented by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="hubble26a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1926 |title=Extra-galactic nebulae |journal=Contributions from the Mount Wilson Observatory / Carnegie Institution of Washington |volume=324 |pages=1–49|bibcode = 1926CMWCI.324....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |title=The Realm of the Nebulae |date=1936 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |lccn=36018182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is often known colloquially as the “Hubble tuning-fork” because of the shape in which it is traditionally represented. Hubble’s scheme divides galaxies into three broad classes based on their visual appearance (originally on [[photographic plate]]s):
* '''[[Elliptical galaxy|Elliptical galaxies]]''' have smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in images. They are denoted by the letter "E", followed by an integer ''n'' representing their degree of ellipticity on the sky.
* '''[[Spiral galaxy|Spiral galaxies]]''' consist of a flattened disk, with [[star]]s forming a (usually two-armed) [[spiral]] structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], which is similar in appearance to an [[elliptical galaxy]]. They are given the symbol "S". Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge. These [[barred spiral galaxy|barred spirals]] are given the symbol "SB".
* '''[[Lenticular galaxy|Lenticular galaxies]]''' (designated S0) also consist of a bright central [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]] surrounded by an extended, disk-like structure but, unlike [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity.

[[File:The Hubble Sequence throughout the Universe's history.jpg|thumb|300px|The Hubble sequence throughout the universe's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hubble explores the origins of modern galaxies|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1315/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These broad classes can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance and to encompass other types of galaxies, such as [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]], which have no obvious regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal).

The Hubble sequence is often represented in the form of a two-pronged fork, with the ellipticals on the left (with the degree of ellipticity increasing from left to right) and the barred and unbarred spirals forming the two parallel prongs of the fork. Lenticular galaxies are placed between the ellipticals and the spirals, at the point where the two prongs meet the “handle”.

To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in [[amateur astronomy]].

More modern observations of galaxies have given us the following information about these types:

* Elliptical galaxies are generally fairly low in gas and dust, and are composed mostly of older stars.
* Spiral galaxies generally have plentiful supplies of gas and dust, and have a broad mix of older and younger stars.
* Irregular galaxies are fairly rich in gas, dust, and young stars.

From this, astronomers have constructed a theory of galaxy evolution which suggests that ellipticals are, in fact, the result of collisions between spiral and/or irregular galaxies, which strip out much of the gas and dust and randomize the [[orbit]]s of the stars. See [[galaxy formation and evolution]].

The de Vaucouleurs system for classifying galaxies is a widely used extension to the [[Hubble sequence]], first described by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs|date=1959 |title=Classification and Morphology of External Galaxies |journal=Handbuch der Physik |volume=53 |pages=275|bibcode = 1959HDP....53..275D }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Vaucouleurs argued that Hubble's two-dimensional classification of [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]—based on the tightness of the spiral arms and the presence or absence of a bar—did not adequately describe the full range of observed galaxy morphologies. In particular, he argued that [[torus|rings]] and [[lens (geometry)|lenses]] are important structural components of spiral galaxies.&lt;ref name="binney_merrifield"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |authorlink=James Binney |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |date=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The de Vaucouleurs system retains Hubble’s basic division of galaxies into [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]], [[spiral galaxy|spirals]] and [[irregular galaxy|irregulars]]. To complement Hubble’s scheme, de Vaucouleurs introduced a more elaborate classification system for spiral galaxies, based on three morphological characteristics:

{{unordered list
&lt;!-- this list is coded to allow proper formatting of the final item in which the first-level paragraph continues after the sublist --&gt;
|1= '''Bars.''' Galaxies are divided on the basis of the presence or absence of a nuclear bar. De Vaucouleurs introduced the notation SA to denote spiral galaxies without bars, complementing Hubble’s use of SB for barred spirals. He also allowed for an intermediate class, denoted SAB, containing weakly barred spirals.&lt;ref name="Class"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vaucouleurs|first=Gérard|title=Revised Classification of 1500 Bright Galaxies|journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement|date=April 1963|volume=8|page=31|doi=10.1086/190084|bibcode = 1963ApJS....8...31D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenticular galaxies are also classified as unbarred (SA0) or barred (SB0), with the notation S0 reserved for those galaxies for which it is impossible to tell if a bar is present or not (usually because they are edge-on to the line-of-sight).

|2= '''Rings.''' Galaxies are divided into those possessing ring-like structures (denoted ‘(r)’) and those without rings (denoted ‘(s)’). So-called ‘transition’ galaxies are given the symbol (rs).&lt;ref name="Class"/&gt;

|3= '''Spiral arms.''' As in Hubble’s original scheme, spiral galaxies are assigned to a class based primarily on the tightness of their spiral arms. The de Vaucouleurs scheme extends the arms of Hubble’s tuning fork to include several additional spiral classes:
{{unordered list
  |1= Sd (SBd) - diffuse, broken arms made up of individual stellar clusters and nebulae; very faint central bulge
  |2= Sm (SBm) - irregular in appearance; no bulge component
  |3= Im - highly irregular galaxy
  }}
Most galaxies in these three classes were classified as Irr I in Hubble’s original scheme. In addition, the Sd class contains some galaxies from Hubble’s Sc class. Galaxies in the classes Sm and Im are termed the [[Magellanic spiral|“Magellanic” spirals]] and irregulars, respectively, after the [[Magellanic Clouds]]. The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] is of type SBm, while the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] is an irregular (Im).
}}

The different elements of the classification scheme are combined — in the order in which they are listed — to give the complete classification of a galaxy. For example, a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms and a ring is denoted SAB(r)c.

Visually, the de Vaucouleurs system can be represented as a [http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/galaxies/classify.html three-dimensional version] of Hubble’s tuning fork, with stage (spiralness) on the ''x''-axis, family (barredness) on the ''y''-axis, and variety (ringedness) on the ''z''-axis.&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1994"&gt;{{cite journal | first = G. | last = De Vaucouleurs | authorlink = Gérard de Vaucouleurs | title = Global Physical Parameters of Galaxies | date = 1994 | url = http://www.stsci.edu/institute/conference/galaxy-morphology/devaucouleurs.ps | format = [[PostScript]] | accessdate = 2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerical Hubble stage===
De Vaucouleurs also assigned numerical values to each class of galaxy in his scheme. Values of the numerical Hubble stage ''T'' run from −6 to +10, with negative numbers corresponding to early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) and positive numbers to late types (spirals and irregulars). Elliptical galaxies are divided into three 'stages': compact ellipticals (cE), normal ellipticals (E) and late types (E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Lenticulars are similarly subdivided into early (S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), intermediate (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and late (S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) types. Irregular galaxies can be of type magellanic irregulars (''T'' = 10) or 'compact' (''T'' = 11).

== Yerkes (or Morgan) scheme ==
Created by American astronomer [[William Wilson Morgan]].  Together with [[Philip Childs Keenan|Philip Keenan]], Morgan developed the MK system for the classification of stars through their spectra. The Yerkes scheme uses the spectra of stars in the galaxy; the shape, real and apparent; and the degree of the central concentration to classify galaxies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25880">'''Genetic monitoring''' is the use of [[Genetic marker|molecular markers]] to (i) identify individuals, species or populations, or (ii) to quantify changes in [[population genetic]] metrics (such as [[effective population size]], [[genetic diversity]] and population size) over time. Genetic monitoring can thus be used to detect changes in species abundance and/or diversity, and has become an important tool in both [[conservation management system|conservation]] and [[livestock]] management. The types of molecular markers used to monitor populations are most commonly [[mitochondrial]], [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs), while earlier studies also used [[allozyme]] data. Species gene diversity is also recognized as an important [[biodiversity]] metric for implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/ Website of the Convention on Biological Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Types of population changes that can be detected by genetic monitoring include population growth and decline, spread of pathogens, adaptation to environmental change, hybridization, introgression and habitat fragmentation events. Most of these changes are monitored using ‘neutral’ [[genetic markers]] (markers for which mutational changes do not change their adaptive [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] within a population). However markers showing adaptive responses to environmental change can be ‘non-neutral’ (e.g. mutational changes affect their relative fitness within a population). [[File:Genetic Monitoring Categories.png|thumb|right|250px|Categories of Genetic Monitoring as defined by Schwartz et al. 2007&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;Schwartz, M.K., et al. (2007) Genetic monitoring as a promising tool for conservation and management. Trends Ecol. Evol. 22, 25&amp;ndash;33. {{DOI|10.1016/j.tree.2006.08.009}}[http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/publications/2007_schwartz_trends/2007_schwartz_trends.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Two broad categories of genetic monitoring have been defined:&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt; Category I encompasses the use of genetic markers as identifiers of individuals (Category Ia), populations and species (Category Ib) for traditional population monitoring. Category II represents the use of genetic markers to monitor changes of [[population genetic]] parameters, which include estimators of [[effective population size]] (Ne), genetic variation, population inter-mixing, structure and migration.

==Examples==

===Estimating abundance and life history parameters – Category Ia===
At the individual level, genetic identification can enable estimation of population abundance and population increase rates within the framework of [[mark-recapture]] models. The abundance of cryptic or elusive species that are difficult to monitor can be estimated by collecting non-invasive biological samples in the field (e.g. feathers, scat or fur) and using these to identify individuals through [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) genotyping. This census of individuals can then be used to estimate population abundance via mark-recapture analysis. For example, this technique has been used to monitor populations of [[grizzly bear]],&lt;ref name="boulanger"&gt;Boulanger, J., et al. (2004) Monitoring of grizzly bear population trends and demography using DNA mark-recapture methods in the Owikeno Lake area of British Columbia. Canadian Journal of Zoology 82, 1267&amp;ndash;1277. {{DOI|10.1139/Z04-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[brush-tailed rock-wallaby]],&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, M.P., et al. (2006) Estimating population size of endangered Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) colonies using faecal DNA. Mol. Ecol. 15, 81&amp;ndash;91. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02783.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bengal tiger]]&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavatula, J., and Singh, L. (2006) Genotyping faecal samples of Bengal tiger Panthera tigris tigris for population estimation: A pilot study. BMC Genet. 7, 48. {{doi|10.1186/1471-2156-7-48}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[snow leopard]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaňecka, J.E., et al. (2008) Population monitoring of snow leopards using noninvasive collection of scat samples: a pilot study. Anim. Conserv. 11, 401&amp;ndash;411. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population growth rates are a product of rates of population [[Birth rate|recruitment]] and [[Mortality rate|survival]], and can be estimated through open [[mark-recapture]] models. For example, DNA from feathers shed by the [[eastern imperial eagle]] shows lower cumulative survival over time than seen for other long-lived raptors.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnick, J.A., et al. (2005) Using naturally shed feathers for individual identification, genetic parentage analyses, and population monitoring in an endangered Eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) population from Kazakhstan. Mol. Ecol. 14, 2959&amp;ndash;2967. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Identifying species &amp;ndash; Category Ib===
Use of molecular genetic techniques to identify species can be useful for a number of reasons. Species identification in the wild can be used to detect changes in population ranges or site occupancy, rates of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and the emergence and spread of [[pathogens]] and [[invasive species]]. Changes in population ranges have been investigated for [[Iberian lynx]]&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, N., et al.

Appl. 16, 1037&amp;ndash;1049. {{DOI|10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[1037:LEICMS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wolverine]],&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M.K., et al.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Species identification is also of considerable utility in monitoring [[fisheries]] and [[wildlife trade]], where conventional visual identification of butchered or flensed products is difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;Baker, C.S. (2008) A truer measure of the market: the molecular ecology of fisheries and wildlife trade. Mol. Ecol. 17, 3985&amp;ndash;3998. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03867.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monitoring of trade and consumption of species of conservation interest can be carried out using molecular amplification and identification of meat or fish obtained from markets.  For example, genetic market surveys have been used to identify protected species and populations of whale (e.g., North Pacific [[minke whale]]) and dolphin species appearing in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C.S., et al. (2007) Estimating the number of whales entering trade using DNA profiling and capture-recapture analysis of market products. Mol. Ecol. 16, 2617&amp;ndash;2626. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other surveys of market trade have focused on [[pinnipeds]],&lt;ref&gt;Malik, S., et al.

(2006) Identification of shark species composition and proportion in the Hong Kong shark fin market based on molecular genetics and trade records. Conserv.

Although initial applications focused on species identification and population assessments, market surveys also provide the opportunity for a range of molecular ecology investigations including capture-recapture, assignment tests and population modeling.&lt;ref name="baker"/&gt; These developments are potentially relevant to genetic monitoring Category II.

===Monitoring population genetic parameters – Category II===
Monitoring of population changes through genetic means can be done retrospectively, through analysis of [[Ancient DNA|'historical' DNA]] recovered from museum-archived species and comparison with contemporary DNA of that species. It can also be used as a tool for evaluating ongoing changes in the status and persistence of current populations.  Genetic measures of relative population change include changes in diversity (e.g. [[heterozygosity]] and allelic richness). Monitoring of relative population changes through these metrics has been performed retrospectively for [[Beringia]]n [[bison]],&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, B., et al. (2004) Rise and fall of the Beringian Steppe Bison. Science 306, 1561&amp;ndash;1565. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1101074}} {{PMID|15567864}} [http://www.bio.psu.edu/people/faculty/bshapiro/riseAndFall_Shapiro04.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galapagos tortoise]],&lt;ref&gt;Poulakakis, N., et al.

Genetic monitoring has also been increasingly used in studies that monitor environmental changes through changes in the frequency of adaptively selected markers. For example, the genetically controlled photo-periodic response (hibernating time) of pitcher-plant mosquitos (''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'') has shifted in response to longer growing seasons for pitcher plants brought on by warmer weather.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, W.E., and Holzapfel, C.M. (2001) Genetic shift in photoperiodic response correlated with global warming. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98, 14509&amp;ndash;14511. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.241391498}} [http://www.pnas.org/content/98/25/14509.full.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[wheat]] populations grown in contrasting environments over a period of 12 generations found that changes in [[flowering]] time were closely correlated with regulatory changes in one gene, suggesting a pathway for genetic adaptation to changing climate in plants.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoné, B., et al. (2008) Insight into the genetic bases of climatic adaptation in experimentally evolving wheat populations. Mol. Ecol. 17, 930&amp;ndash;943. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03619.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburg, J.L., and Gross, B.L. (2008) Adapting to winter in wheat: a long-term study follows parallel phenotypic and genetic changes in three experimental wheat populations. Mol. Ecol. 17, 716&amp;ndash;718. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03639.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic monitoring is also useful in monitoring the ongoing health of small, relocated populations. Good examples of this are found for [[New Zealand birds]], many species of which were greatly impacted by habitat destruction and the appearance of numerous mammalian predators in the last century and have recently become part of relocation programs that transfer a few ‘founder’ individuals to predator-free offshore [[Ecological island|“ecological” islands]]. E.g. [[black robin]],&lt;ref&gt;Ardern, S.L., and Lambert, D.M. (1997) Is the black robin in genetic peril? Mol. Ecol. 6, 21&amp;ndash;28. {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-294X.1997.00147.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kakapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, H.C., et al. (2003) Minisatellite DNA profiling detects lineages and parentage in endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) despite low microsatellite DNA variation. Conserv. Genet. 4, 265&amp;ndash;274. {{DOI|10.1023/A:1024037601708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of genetic monitoring in science==
In February 2007 an international summit was held at the Institute of the Environment at [[UCLA]], concerning ‘Evolutionary Change in Human Altered Environments: An International Summit to translate Science into Policy’. This led to a special issue of the journal of [[Molecular ecology#Molecular Ecology (journal)|Molecular Ecology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/ctr/symposium/docs/Summit-Report.pdf A Report on the Results and Recommendations of the International Summit on Evolutionary Change in Human-altered Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; organized around our understanding of genetic effects in three main categories: (i) habitat disturbance and [[climate change]] (ii) exploitation and [[captive breeding]] (iii) [[invasive species]] and [[pathogens]].

In 2007 a [[Working group|Working Group]] on Genetic Monitoring was launched with joint support from [[NCEAS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NESCent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nescent.org The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center]&lt;/ref&gt; to further develop the techniques involved and provide general monitoring guidance for policy makers and managers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/featured/allendorf Genetic Monitoring: Development of Tools for Conservation and Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the topic is covered in several well known text books, including McComb et al. (2010) and Allendorf et al. (2013)

==Genetic monitoring in natural resource agencies==
Many [[natural resource]] agencies see genetic monitoring as a cost-effective and defensible way to monitor fish and wildlife populations.  As such scientists in the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], [[USFS|U.S. Forest Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/wildlife/genetics/index.php Rocky Mountain Research Station Wildlife Genetics Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Park Service]], and [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] have been developing new methods and tools to use genetic monitoring, and applying such tools across broad geographic scales.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kendall"/&gt;  Currently the USFWS hosts a website that informs managers as to the best way to use genetic tools for monitoring (see below).

'''Health information on the Internet''' refers to all communication related to health done on the [[Internet]].

==Types==
As a general communication channel, various Internet products serve every type of general health information.

===Targeting types of information to different audiences===
In the late 1990s researchers began to note that huge numbers of people were using the Internet to seek health information, despite various problems with the quality of information or inefficiencies in accessing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Risk | first1 = A. | last2 = Petersen | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.20.2713 | title = Health Information on the Internet | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 20 | pages = 2713–2715 | year = 2002 | pmid =  12020308| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various problems have been identified for those using [[search engines]] to seek health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berland | first1 = G.

There is a premise that patients with access to their personal health information presented in a form they can understand will be able to interpret and learn from this information in a way that benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beaudin|first=JS|author2=Intille, SS |author3=Morris, ME |title=To track or not to track: user reactions to concepts in longitudinal health monitoring.|journal=Journal of medical Internet research|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e29|pmid=17236264|pmc=1794006|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.4.e29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians worry that patients using their own medical history records as a starting point for personal research on the Internet are at risk for being overwhelmed and misinformed when seeking health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robeznieks|first=A|title=Getting personal.

As of 2013 opinions about the relationship health care providers should have with online health information were still being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnan|first=Jeanne M.|title=Online Medical Professionalism: Patient and Public Relationships: Policy Statement From the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=16 April 2013|volume=158|issue=8|pages=620–7|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-8-201304160-00100|pmid=23579867}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one 2014 study, "The flow of information has fundamentally changed, and physicians have less control over health information relayed to patients. Not surprisingly, this paradigm shift has elicited varied and sometimes conflicting views about the value of the Internet as a tool to improve health care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonsaker|first=Tabitha|last2=Bartlett|first2=Gillian|last3=Trpkov|first3=Cvetan|date=2016-11-14|title=Health information on the Internet|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=60|issue=5|pages=407–408|issn=0008-350X|pmc=4020634|pmid=24828994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background on the doctor–patient relationship====
{{main article|Doctor–patient relationship}}
Physicians have difficulty explaining complicated medical concepts to their patients and patients have difficulty understanding complicated things which physicians tell them. One reasons for this is that a patient's visit to a physician is likely to be less than 15 minutes, and in any case, physicians are unable to spend the amount of time which patients that patients typically desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechanic|first=David|author2=McAlpine, Donna D. |author3=Rosenthal, Marsha |title=Are Patients' Office Visits with Physicians Getting Shorter?|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 January 2001|volume=344|issue=3|pages=198–204|doi=10.1056/NEJM200101183440307|pmid=11172143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians use medical terms which patients do not understand, but which they would like to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=CM|author2=Wilson, C |author3=Wang, F |author4= Schillinger, D |title=Babel babble: physicians' use of unclarified medical jargon with patients|journal=American journal of health behavior|date=Sep–Oct 2007|volume=31 Suppl 1|pages=S85–95|pmid=17931142 |doi=10.5993/ajhb.31.s1.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is consensus that patients should have [[shared decision making]], which means that they make informed decisions about the direction of their health care in collaboration with their physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braddock III|first=Clarence H.|author2=Edwards, Kelly A. |author3=Hasenberg, Nicole M. |author4=Laidley, Tracy L. |author5= Levinson, Wendy |title=Informed Decision Making in Outpatient Practice|journal=JAMA|date=22 December 1999|volume=282|issue=24|pages=2313–20|doi=10.1001/jama.282.24.2313|pmid=10612318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich, educated, socially advantaged patients enjoy many more benefits of shared decision making than patients who have disadvantages in getting healthcare, including lower socioeconomic class or having a minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiscella|first=Kevin|author2=Epstein, Ronald M.|title=So Much to Do, So Little Time:care for the socially disadvantaged and the 15-minute visit |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=22 September 2008|volume=168|issue=17|pages=1843–52|doi=10.1001/archinte.168.17.1843|pmid=18809810|pmc=2606692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of patient understanding of health contributes to a range of problems including tendency to not adhere to the physician's medical advice and missing medical appointments.&lt;ref name="Wicks 2010"&gt;A better source should be used to support this claim, although this source is good enough for how it is used here.

====Resources====
Various social forums exist in which anyone can have conversations about health with their peers. Such forums are especially popular among patients who seek to have conversations with other patients with a shared medical concern.&lt;ref name="Eysenbach 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenbach|first=G.|title=Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions|journal=BMJ|date=15 May 2004|volume=328|issue=7449|pages=1166–0|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166|pmid=15142921|pmc=411092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who participate in online communities which discuss health issues report feeling relief about their health worries, perceiving more control over their health and medical condition, having more medical knowledge, and having more personal agency overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barak|first=Azy|author2=Boniel-Nissim, Meyran |author3=Suler, John |title=Fostering empowerment in online support groups|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=September 2008|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1867–1883|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has failed to find evidence to validate physicians' concerns that patients typically receive misinformation online or using health information to inappropriately conduct [[self diagnosis]].&lt;ref name="Eysenbach 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=F|author2=Hudak, PL |author3=Bercovitz, K |author4=Hollenberg, E |author5= Levinson, W |title=Are physicians ready for patients with Internet-based health information?|journal=Journal of medical Internet research|date=Sep 29, 2006|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e22|pmid=17032638 |doi=10.2196/jmir.8.3.e22 |pmc=2018833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crocco|first=AG|author2=Villasis-Keever, M |author3=Jadad, AR |title=Analysis of cases of harm associated with use of health information on the internet|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Jun 5, 2002|volume=287|issue=21|pages=2869–71|pmid=12038937|doi=10.1001/jama.287.21.2869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with chronic diseases who use the Internet to get health information often acquire good skills to judge the quality of information which they find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=FA|author2=Kerr, C |author3=Murray, E |author4= Nazareth, I |title=Information from the Internet and the doctor-patient relationship: the patient perspective--a qualitative study.|journal=BMC Family Practice|date=Aug 16, 2007|volume=8|pages=47|pmid=17705836 |doi=10.1186/1471-2296-8-47 |pmc=2041946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic medical literature===
The written record of medical consensus is stored in [[scientific journals]]. Since the advent of [[electronic publishing]] there has been [[academic journal publishing reform]] which had a range of effects, including more researchers and physicians having greater access to professional information in medical journals through the Internet.

===Patients' personal health information===
Through various sources both publicly and privately available, datasets containing health information about large numbers of patients are available on the Internet to an extent which was impossible to manage before the Internet.

==Quality==
Measures and standards for ensuring quality control on the Internet have been criticized and no one standard is universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jadad | first1 = A.

The nature and quality of online health-related information seeking on the web is challenging and complex and many researchers investigated this issue benefiting from a wide range of theories from different disciplines.&lt;/ref&gt; Among all sources there is a wide variance in quality of health information on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Khosrowjerdi, M. (2016). A review of theory-driven models of trust in the online health context. IFLA Journal, 42(3): pp. 189-206. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0340035216659299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal health information==
For many applications people wish to use health information on the Internet to give insight about a personal health concern. Because of this, the goal is often to use the Internet to find information described in a person's [[medical record]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Since the advent of [[electronic media]], medical records have been increasingly kept as [[electronic medical records]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} If electronic medical records were shared online then it would be easy to match those with information and conduct a range of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pagliari|first=C|author2=Detmer, D |author3=Singleton, P |title=Potential of electronic personal health records.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Aug 18, 2007|volume=335|issue=7615|pages=330–3|pmid=17703042|doi=10.1136/bmj.39279.482963.AD|pmc=1949437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, all medical records are [[protected health information]] because sharing personal health information exposes an individual to a range of harms which result from violation of their [[expectation of privacy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

There is currently broad international debate about how to balance patient and commercial medicine demands for personal health information with individual's needs for safety and respect.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Electronic medical records===
{{main article|Electronic medical record}}
An electronic medical record is a [[medical record]] stored as [[electronic media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=P. C|author2=Ash, J. S |author3=Bates, D. W |author4=Overhage, J M. |author5= Sands, D.

===De-identification===
{{main article|De-identification}}
De-identification is an attempt to divide a collection of information about a particular person so that all information which identifies the person is removed, and with intent to distribute whatever information is left. The closer the data is to [[anonymization]] the less valuable the data is to those who want it, so in general, data is only de-identified somewhat and rarely anonymized. There are many controversies in de-identification.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Research using personal health information===
There is a large demand for access to large collections of various types of personal health information.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Almost all of this demand is commercial.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Distribution of collections of personal health information===
Various groups have expressed worry over danger to the public which results from the distribution of collections of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jun/05/data-protection-eu-anonymous |title=Data protection in the EU: the certainty of uncertainty |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |work=theguardian.com |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[National Health Service]] in the United Kingdom proposed to sell datasets of personal health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/19/nhs-patient-data-available-companies-buy |title=NHS patient data to be made available for sale to drug and insurance firms |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |work=theguardian.com |date=19 January 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/04/care-data-nhs-healthcare |title=Thanks to Care.data, your secrets are no longer safe with your GP (Wired UK) |first=Asher |last=Wolf |work=wired.co.uk |date=7 February 2014|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major providers of health information on the Internet==
===PubMed===

This article details the history and status of '''Heritage conservation in [[Hong Kong]]''', as well as the role of various stakeholders.

An indication of the size of the built heritage in Hong Kong is given by a territory-wide survey conducted by the [[Antiquities and Monuments Office]] (AMO) between 1996 and 2000, which recorded some 8,800 buildings. The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is also an emerging theme.

==Historic buildings==
[[File:HK CausewayBayTinHauTemple.JPG|thumb|The [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Tin Hau Temple]] in Causeway Bay is a declared monument since 1982.]]
As of 20 May 2016, there were 114 [[Declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared monuments]] in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/DM_Mon_List_e.pdf List of declared monuments on LCSD website]&lt;/ref&gt; and as of February 2013, there were 917 graded historic buildings (153 Grade I, 322 Grade II, 442 Grade III), of which 203 were owned by the Government and 714 by private bodies.&lt;ref name="Audit60"&gt;Report No. 60 of the Director of Audit, [http://www.aud.gov.hk/pdf_e/e60ch01.pdf Chapter 1: "Conservation of monuments and historic buildings"], 28 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading system===
Grades for historic buildings are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-eng.pdf Results of the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade I]]: "Buildings of outstanding merit, which every effort should be made to preserve if possible."
* [[List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade II]]: "Buildings of special merit; efforts should be made to selectively preserve."
* [[List of Grade III historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade III]]: "Buildings of some merit; preservation in some form would be desirable and alternative means could be considered if preservation is not practicable."

===Surveys and assessment===
[[File:King Yin Lei SingChiu.jpg|thumb|[[King Yin Lei]] was declared a monument in 2008 after media had reported that its owner had begun demolishing the building.]]
A territory-wide survey on historic buildings conducted by the Antiquities and Monuments Office (AMO) between 1996 and 2000 recorded some 8,800 buildings. A more detailed survey conducted between 2002-2004 focused on 1,444 buildings.&lt;ref name="Completion"&gt;[http://www.devb-wb.gov.hk/press_releases_and_publications/UMPR/index.aspx?langno=1&amp;nodeid=1779&amp;Branch=W&amp;lstYear=2009&amp;PressReleaseID=11946 Press Release: "Completion of the assessment of 1,444 historic buildings announced". March 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005,&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; a seven-member Expert Panel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-A.pdf Composition of the Expert Panel for the Assessment of 1,444 Historic Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising historians and members of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Architects]], [[Hong Kong Institute of Planners]] and [[Hong Kong Institute of Engineers]] was formed by the Antiquities Advisory Board (AAB) to assess the heritage value of these buildings. The assessment was completed on March 19, 2009. As part of this work, the AMO proposed changes in the grading of historic buildings: 212 buildings to be Grade I, 366 to be Grade II, and 576 to be Grade III, and no grading for the remaining 290 ones.&lt;ref name="Completion" /&gt; Current grades may be increased, decreased or removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/AAB-SM-E.pdf List of the Historic Buildings in Building Assessment (as of 18 March 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:QP Hungerstrike.jpg|thumb|Public protest against the demolition of [[Queen's Pier]]: hunger strikers occupied the location in July 2007.]]
The demolition of several historic buildings has led to public protest in recent years. This included the [[Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier]] (demolition completed in early 2007) and [[Queen's Pier]], demolished in February 2008.

===Other issues===
Other issues include:
* Ownership of historic buildings and private owners' rights
* Funding of Heritage conservation programs

==Intangible cultural heritage==
The preservation of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] is an emerging theme in Hong Kong, with The Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee having held its first meeting on July 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/ppr_release_det2.php?id=190 Press release: "Intangible Cultural Heritage Advisory Committee holds first meeting". July 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A territory-wide survey was carried out in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hkheritage.ust.hk/english|title=Introduction {{!}} Territory-wide Survey of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Hong Kong|website=hkheritage.ust.hk|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green insect on hand.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The "Spanish Fly", ''[[Lytta vesicatoria]]'' has been considered to have medicinal, [[aphrodisiac]], and other properties&lt;!--, though it contains an irritant chemical, [[cantharidin]], which is certainly toxic--&gt;.]]
'''Human interactions with insects''' include both a wide variety of uses, whether practical such as for food, textiles, and dyestuffs, or symbolic, as in art, music, and literature, and negative interactions including serious damage to crops and extensive efforts to eliminate insect pests. 

Academically, the interaction of insects and society has been treated in part as '''cultural entomology''', dealing mostly with "advanced" societies, and in part as '''ethnoentomology''', dealing mostly with "primitive" societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence of [[insects]] on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in [[anthropology]] and [[natural history]], as well as [[entomology]], the study of insects. Other [[culture|cultural]] uses of insects, such as [[biomimicry]], do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.

More generally, people make a wide range of uses of insects, both practical and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of [[insecticide]]s has failed to exterminate any [[insect pest]], but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.

Practical uses include [[entomophagy|as food]], [[Insects in medicine|in medicine]], for the valuable [[textile]] [[silk]], for [[dyestuff]]s such as [[carmine]], in science, where the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] is an important [[model organism]] in [[genetics]], and [[Entomological warfare|in warfare]], where insects were successfully used in the [[Second World War]] to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the [[honey bee]], provides [[honey]], [[pollen]], [[royal jelly]], [[propolis]] and an anti-inflammatory peptide, [[melittin]]; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include [[maggot therapy]] for wound [[debridement]]. Over a thousand protein families have been identified in the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, [[vasodilation|vasodilators]], [[antihistamine]]s and [[anaesthetic]]s.

Symbolic uses include roles [[Insects in art|in art]], [[Insects in music|in music]] (with [[List of insect-inspired songs|many songs featuring insects]]), [[Arthropods in film|in film]], [[Insects in literature|in literature]], [[Insects in religion|in religion]], and in mythology. Insect [[costume]]s are used in theatrical productions and worn for parties and carnivals.

==Context==

===Culture===

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by insects in human culture so defined.

===Cultural entomology and ethnoentomology===

[[File:Malay Archipelago Beetles.jpg|thumb|left|"[[The Malay Archipelago|Remarkable Beetles Found at Simunjon, Borneo]]": [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was a pioneer of ethnoentomology.]]

Ethnoentomology developed from the 19th century with early works by authors such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1852) and [[Henry Walter Bates]] (1862). [[Hans Zinsser]]'s "classic" ''[[Rats, Lice and History]]'' (1935) showed that insects were an important force in human history. Writers like [[William Morton Wheeler]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Jean Henri Fabre]] described insect life and  communicated their meaning to people "with imagination and brilliance". Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy, and showed a positive aspect of insects. [[Food]] is the most studied topic in ethnoentomology, followed by [[medicine]] and [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref name=Posey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posey |first1=Darrell Addison |title=Topics And Issues In Ethnoentomology With Some Suggestions For The  Development Of Hypothesis-Generation And Testing In Ethnobiology |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology |date=1986 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=99–120 |url=https://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801192909/http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crop Duster.jpg|thumb|upright|Fighting insects: an [[agricultural aircraft]] applies low-[[insecticide]] bait to kill [[western corn rootworm]]s.]]

In 1968, {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Schimitschek|de}} claimed cultural entomology as a branch of insect studies, in a review of the roles insects played in [[folklore]] and culture including [[religion]], food, medicine and the arts.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schimitschek |first=E. |title=Handbuch der Zoologie |year=1968 |publisher=Berliner Akademie Verlag|editor=Helmcke J.G. |editor2=Stark D. |editor3=Wermuth H. |chapter=Insekten als Nahrung, Brauchtum, Kult und Kultur |volume= 4 | pages=1–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Charles Hogue]] covered the field in English and from 1994 to 1997, Hogue's ''The Cultural Entomology Digest'' served as a forum on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogue|first=Charles|title=Cultural Entomology|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who? What? Why?|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/who_what_why.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogue argued that "Humans spend their intellectual energies in three basic areas of activity: surviving, using practical learning (the application of technology); seeking pure knowledge through inductive mental processes (science); and pursuing enlightenment to taste a pleasure by aesthetic exercises that may be referred to as the "humanities." [[Entomology]] has long been concerned with survival ([[economic entomology]]) and scientific study (academic entomology), but the branch of investigation that addresses the influence of insects (and other terrestrial Arthropoda, including [[arachnids]] and [[myriapods]]) in literature, language, music, the arts, interpretive history, religion, and recreation has only become recognized as a distinct field through Schimitschek's work.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schimitschek | first=E. | title=Die Bedeutung der Insekten für Kultur und Wirtschaft des Menschen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart | journal=Istanbul Universitesi | date= 1961 |volume= 908: | pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogue 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=January 1987|volume= 32 |pages=181–199 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hogue set out the boundaries of the field by saying: "The narrative history of the science of entomology is not part of cultural entomology, while the influence of insects on general [[history]] would be considered cultural entomology."&lt;ref name="Hogue"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Because the term "cultural" is narrowly defined, some aspects normally included in studies of human societies are excluded."&lt;ref name="Hogue"/&gt;

Darrell Addison Posey, noting that the boundary between cultural entomology and ethnoentomology is difficult to draw, cites Hogue as limiting cultural entomology to the influence of insects on "the essence of humanity as expressed in the arts and humanities". Posey notes further that cultural anthropology is usually restricted to the study of "advanced", industrialised, and literate societies, whereas ethnoentomology studies "the entomological concerns of 'primitive' or 'noncivilized' societies". Posey states at once that the division is artificial, complete with an unjustified us/them bias.&lt;ref name=Posey/&gt; Brian Morris similarly criticises the way that anthropologists treat non-Western attitudes to nature as monadic and spiritualist, and contrast this "in [[gnostic]] fashion" with a simplistic treatment of Western, often 17th century, mechanistic attitude. Morris considers this "quite unhelpful, if not misleading", and offers instead his own research into the multiple ways that the people of [[Malawi]] relate to insects and other animals: "pragmatic, intellectual, realist, practical, aesthetic, symbolic and sacramental."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and costs==

===Insect ecosystem services===
[[File:Honeybee (Apis mellifera) pollinating Avocado cv.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pollination]], here by a bee on an [[avocado]] crop, is an [[ecosystem service]].]]

The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MEA) report 2005 defines [[ecosystem services]] as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet is that a few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, [[ant]]s, [[mosquito]]es, and [[spider]]s).  However, insects offer [[ecological goods and services]].&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and human well-being : synthesis|date=2005|publisher=Island Press|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-59726-040-1|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xerces Society]] calculates the economic impact of four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. "the importance of bugs to [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and wildlife observation, including [[bird-watching]]"), dung burial, and [[biological pest control|pest control]]. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lyman Kirst |first=Marian |title=Insect – the neglected 99% |url=http://www.hcn.org/blogs/goat/insects-the-neglected-99-percent/ |accessdate=22 July 2012 |newspaper=High Country News |date=29 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ant expert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward O. Wilson Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/edward-o-wilson-507387|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. O. Wilson]] observed: "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.O. |title=The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth |date=2006 |publisher=Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nova (TV Series)]] segment on the American [[Public Broadcasting Service]] framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives&amp;nbsp;... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Creatures Who Run the World|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2203crea.html|work=Nova|publisher=PBS Airdate: August 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated: "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the [[Asian tiger mosquito]] or the [[fire ant]], appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Adrian |title=Saving Earth From the Ground Up |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/29/AR2007062902334.html |work=June 30, 2007 |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=22 July 2012 |date=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 can be regarded as serious [[pest insect|pest]]s, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including [[pollinator]]s such as bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller G.T. |title=Sustaining the Earth |edition=6th |year=2004 |publisher=Thompson Learning |pages=211–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries launched a widespread [[war against the potato beetle]], blaming the [[Colorado potato beetle|introduction of the species]] from America on the [[CIA]], demonising the species in [[propaganda]] posters, and urging children to gather the beetles and kill them.&lt;ref name=colUWP&gt;{{cite web |last=Sindelar |first=Daisy|title=What's Orange and Black and Bugging Ukraine? |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-colorado-beetle-separatists/25365793.html |work=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty |accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;br&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/05/world/europe/kievs-reins-weaken-as-chaos-spreads.html?_r=0 Ukraine’s Reins Weaken as Chaos Spreads], [[The New York Times]] (4 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==

===As food===
{{main article|Entomophagy}}
[[File:Witchetty grub.jpg|thumb|left|[[Witchetty grub]]s were prized as food by [[Australian aborigine]]s.]]

[[Entomophagy]] is the eating of insects. Many insects are considered a culinary [[delicacy]] in some societies around the world, and Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy,  but the practice is uncommon and even taboo in other societies. Sometimes insects are considered suitable only for the poor in the third world, but in 1975 Victor Meyer-Rochow suggested that insects could help ease global future food shortages and advocated a change in western attitudes towards cultures in which insects were appreciated as a food item.&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow | first=Victor Benno | title=Can insects help to ease the problem of world food shortage? | journal= ANZAAS Journal: "Search"| date= 1975|volume= 6 |issue= 7 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston felt that the remedy for this may be marketing of insect dishes as suitably exotic and costly to make them acceptable. They also note that some societies in sub-Saharan Africa prefer [[caterpillar]]s to beef, while Chakravorty et al. (2011) &lt;ref name="Nyishi"&gt;Chakravorty, J., Ghosh, S., and V.B. Meyer-Rochow. (2011). Practices of entomophagy and entomotherapy by members of the Nyishi and Galo tribes, two ethnic groups of the state of Arunachal Pradesh (North-East India). ''Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 7(5)''&lt;/ref&gt; point out that food insects (highly appreciated in North-East India) are more expensive than meat. The economics, i.e., the costs involved collecting food insects and the money earned through the sale of such insects, have been studied in a Laotian setting by Meyer-Rochow et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Laos"&gt;Meyer-Rochow V.B., Nonaka K., Boulidam S (2008) More feared than revered: Insects and their impacts on human societies (with specific data on the importance of entomophagy in a Laotian setting. ''Entomologie Heute 20: 3–25''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, ant larvae and Corixid water boatman eggs are sought out as a form of [[caviar]] by gastronomes. In Guangdong, water beetles fetch a high enough price for these insects to be farmed. Especially high prices are fetched in Thailand for the giant water bug ''[[Lethocerus indicus]]''.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2009/&gt;

===In medicine===

{{main article|Insects in medicine}}

Insects have been used medicinally in cultures around the world, often according to the [[Doctrine of Signatures]]. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;Ramos-Elorduy de Concini, J. and J.M. Pino Moreno. (1988). The utilization of insects in the empirical medicine of ancient Mexicans. ''Journal of Ethnobiology, 8(2), 195–202.''&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine was applied in both [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) and in [[Ayurveda]]. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, [[centipede]] is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions,&lt;ref name="centipede"&gt;http://tcm.health-info.org/Herbology.Materia.Medica/wugong-properties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, ''[[Polyrhachis]] vicina'', is used as a cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1809450.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Ayurveda uses insects such as [[Termite]] for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain.

None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong enough to break human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Just Plain Weird Stories |url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/spidermyth/myths/daddyvenom.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daddy Longleg myth |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1DzkM0zqDQ |publisher=Myth Busters |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], members of the [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language family have been observed using ''Pachycondyla commutata'' ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing the sting of ''Pseudomyrmex'' spp. for fevers and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Balée]] (2000), "Antiquity of Traditional Ethnobiological Knowledge in Amazonia: a Tupí–Guaraní Family and Time" ''Ethnohistory'' 47(2):399–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The red harvester ant ''[[Pogonomyrmex californicus]]'' has been widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for hundreds of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination.  During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe.  Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness, where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Groark.

Both the symbolic form and the actual body of insects have been used to adorn humans in ancient and modern times. A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East regarded the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features.  Often referred to as the bee "goddess",  these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from [[Knossos]] (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns above her head.  In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing [[Hecate]] and [[Artemis]] – gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gough |first=Andrew |title=The Bee Part 2 Beewildered |url=http://andrewgough.co.uk/bee2_1.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beetlewing]] art is an ancient craft technique using iridescent beetle wings practiced traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Beetlewing pieces are used as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewelry. Different species of metallic wood-boring beetle wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were those from beetles belonging to the genus [[Sternocera]].  The practice comes from across Asia and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Myanmar, Japan, India and China.  In Thailand beetlewings were preferred to decorate clothing (shawls and Sabai cloth) and jewellery in former court circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Beetle-Wing Tea-Cosy |url=https://hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk/content/beetle-wing-tea-cosy |publisher=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian entomologist [[C.H. Curran]]'s 1945 book, ''Insects of the Pacific World'', noted women from India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles of the species ''[[Chrysochroa ocellata]]'' as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivers |first=Victoria |title=Beetles in Textiles |url=http://www.insects.org/ced2/beetles_tex.html |work=[[Cultural Entomology Digest]] February |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Butterflies]] have long inspired humans with their life cycle, color, and ornate patterns. The novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was also a renowned butterfly expert. He published and illustrated many butterfly species, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were games of intricate enchantment and deception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Speak, Memory |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage International |location=New York |page=129 |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the aesthetic complexity of insects that led Nabokov to reject [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahuja |first=Nitin |title=Nabokov's Case Against Natural Selection |journal=Tract |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Strong Opinions |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist Ian MacRae writes of butterflies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the animal is at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet beautiful and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as "kaleidoscopic instabilities," "oxymoron of similarities," "rebellious rainbows," "visible darkness" and "souls of stone" have much in common. They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories&amp;nbsp;... In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In the natural history of the animal, we begin to sense its literary and artistic possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacRae |first=Ian |title=Butterfly Chronicles: Imagination and Desire in Natural &amp; Literary Histories |journal=Canadian Journal of Environ Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the artist Anna Collette created over 10,000 individual ceramic insects at [[Nottingham Castle]], "Stirring the Swarm." Reviews of the exhibit offered a compelling narrative for Cultural Entomology: "the unexpected use of materials, dark overtones, and the straightforward impact of thousands of tiny multiples within the space. The exhibition was at once both exquisitely beautiful and deeply repulsive, and this strange duality was fascinating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=French |first=Anneka |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://www.a-n.co.uk/interface/reviews/single/1652788 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://download.cnet.com/Stirring-the-Swarm/3000-12511_4-75660244.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s essay ''Butterflies'' analyses the treatment of the butterfly in [[Japanese literature]], both prose and poetry. He notes that these often allude to Chinese tales, such as of the young woman that the butterflies took to be a flower.

The honey bee played a central role in the cosmology of the [[Mayan people]]. The stucco figure at the temples of Tulum known as "Ah Mucen Kab" – the Diving Bee God – bears resemblance to the insect in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus identified as a bee.  Such reliefs might have indicated towns and villages that produce honey. Modern Mayan authorities say the figure also have a connection to modern cosmology. Mayan mythology expert Migel Angel Vergara relates that the Mayans held a belief that bees came from Venus, the "Second Sun."

[[Ovo (Cirque du Soleil)|Ovo]] is an insect-themed production by the world renowned Canadian entertainment company [[Cirque du Soleil]].

The costuming was a fusion of arthropod body types blended with superhero armour. Liz Vandal, the lead costume designer, has a special affinity for the world of the insect:&lt;ref name=Cirque/&gt;

{{quote|When I was just a kid I put rocks down around the yard near the fruit trees and I lifted them regularly to watch the insects who had taken up residence underneath them.

===Hungarian Space Camp ===
====History====
The camp was founded by Aunt Magdi, the "Space Granny" in 1994. Her intent was to introduce space research and astronautics to the youth. That time the program of the camp consisted mostly of lectures presented by the best-known Hungarian scientists in the field. Later the camp had a younger leadership, leading to a shift to more active and creative programs. From 2010 the duration of the camp is one week, from Sunday to Saturday. 
The participants are students between the age of 13 and 18, all interested in sciences and space topics. About quarter of the students return next year and every fifth student becomes a regular camper. Some acknowledged space researchers started their "space career" in the Space Camp, like the present (2017) Secretary General and several Members of Board.

====Locations====
1994 - Kecskemét, 1995 - Eger, 1996 - Veszprém, 1997 - Veszprém, 1998 - Győr, 1999 - Kecskemét, 2000 - Sopron, 2001 - Debrecen, 2002 - Székesfehérvár, 2003 - Budapest, 2004 - Kiskunhalas, 2005 - Gyulaháza, 2006 - Szentlélek, 2007 - Hollóstető, 2008 - Szentlélek, 2010 - Gyomaendrőd, 2011 - Sátoraljaújhely, 2012 - Kecskemét, 2013 - Alsómocsolád, 2014 - Felsőtárkány, 2015 - Sopron, 2016 - Debrecen, 2017 - Bakonybél

====Lectures and Activities====
In the camp space researchers and astronautical experts give '''lectures'''. Topics cover a wide range, from the basics of astronomy through problems of space debris to deciding the dilemma if Pluto is a planet or not. Other '''activities''' include several practical exercises make the camp exciting, e.g. water rocketry, underwater assembly, creating stereo pictures, astronomical observation, excursions, bathing, etc.  There is a main topic every year which meets the topic of the Student Competition.

====Mentor Program====
Since 2015 private individuals and companies are invited to co-finance the ''Hungarian Space Camp'' as '''Mentors'''. HAS welcomes financial support of participation of needy students from Hungary and from the Hungarian diaspora in the surrounding countries. In the past years about one fifth of the participants was able to join the Camp by favor of a Mentor.

===Student competition===
HAS yearly announces a '''Student Competition''' for primary and secondary school students, since 1992. The topics announced around October are always different, but focus on a current aspect of space research and exploration. The topic of the Student Competition is going to be the main topic of the Space Camp of that year. E.g. title of the Competition was "Civilians in Space" in 2014, "Beyond Mars" in 2015 and "Cleaning in Space" in 2017.&lt;br /&gt;
Categories: writing essay; drawing; preparing project plan; creating video, website, Facebook page or blog. &lt;br /&gt;
Small teams of two or three students are also welcome. Applications are evaluated in two age classes: age between 11-14 and 15-18. The competition is open for visually impaired students as well. Their works are evaluated separately.&lt;br /&gt;
Prizes include participation in the Space Camp for free or for a reduced fee; science books and magazines; a visit to a selected space research institute or company; free one-year membership in the society.

===Space Academy ===
''Hungarian Astronautical Society'' in collaboration with the international ''[[Space Generation Advisory Council]]'' initiated a yearly event called '''Space Academy'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://urakademia.hu Space Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015 for university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. .&lt;ref&gt;http://spacegeneration.org/sgac-regions/europe/hungary.html  SGAC Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a four-day workshop in August where the participants outline a solution for a given task or problem together.

* 2016: Design Experiment to the International Space Station!

===Space Academy Club===
'''Space Academy Club''' is a lecture series organized by the '''Hungarian Astronautical Society''' and the Hungarian organizers of '''Space Generation Advisory Council'''. It takes place usually in February, April, September and November, during university semesters. It targets primarily university students and young professionals of the age between 18-35. The series is connected with Space Academy in their name and their target groups.

===Hungarian Space Studies Annuary (alias Space Brochure, Hun: Űrtan évkönyv)===
HAS has been publishing its Astronautical Brochure since 1961, presenting the recent activities of HAS and summarizing the globally most significant affairs of space research. Hungarian researchers working in space research and its interdisciplinary fields present their latest results.

===Space Research Day===
Space Research Day is organized yearly. It joins the International Space Week in October. It usually takes place at one of the universities of Budapest. The program consists of lectures on actual space activities and space related results and exchange of views. There are blocks for professionals, interested amateurs and students.

===Hungarian Space Research Forum (Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physics Seminar) ===
'''Hungarian Space Research Forum''' is a traditional biennial conference of researchers of the field, to be held for the 30th time in 2017. Its former title and now subtitle '''Ionosphere and Magnetosphere Physical Seminar''' expresses its original specialty which gained a broader horizon in the past decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/scostep/scostep_eng.html  Hungarian National Committee of SCOSTEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fenyi.solarobs.csfk.mta.hu/ionmagnszem/ionmagnszem.html  List of Ionospheric-Magnetopheric Seminars from 1972-2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Hungarian physicists, geophysicists, astronomers, meteorologists etc. take part in this seminar by presenting their latest researches through lectures and posters.

===School Day===
HAS is willing to provide lectures for schools in various fields related to space activities titled '''School Day'''. Every year our members give several lectures in Budapest and around the country in (mainly secondary) schools on fresh and exciting scientific topics like the last results on Mars exploration, development of equipments for spacecraft, planetary discoveries, etc.

===Radio Connection between Students and Charles Simonyi on board of ISS [2007]===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">The '''Institute of Jewish Affairs''' (IJA) was founded in February 1941 as a research institute to provide analysis of political, legal and economic issues affecting Jewish life.

==History==
The Institute of Jewish Affairs was launched and sponsored by the [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC) and the [[American Jewish Congress]]. IJA’s headquarters were situated in [[New York City]] until 1965 when the institution relocated to [[London]]. In 1994 it was reestablished in London as [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Troen, Selwyn Illan (1999) “Jewish Centers and Peripheries: Europe Between America and Israel Fifty Years After World War II,” Transaction Publishers, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute’s founder Dr [[Jacob Robinson]] argued that Jewish leaders, struggling for the interests of the Jewry after [[World War I]], “were hampered by the lack of up-to-date information on the situation of the Jews and no less by the lack of research into relevant legal and political options.”&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, Cohen (2010 a). "Dr. Jacob Robinson, the Institute of Jewish Affairs and the Elusive Jewish voice in Nuremberg," David Bankier and Dan Michman (eds.), Holocaust and Justice: representation and Historiography of the Holocaust in Post-War Trials, Yad Vashem and Berghahn Books, Jerusalem, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The IJA was established to bridge the gap. The Institute’s research focused on the analysis of the political, legal and economic aspects of Jewish life since [[World War I]]. Their reports examined a number of topics including: the situation of Jewish communities in various countries, [[anti-Semitism]], human rights related to minorities and migration, and the [[Holocaust]] and its aftermath.  The organization was also involved in formulating a postwar policy to secure Jewish rights and freedom internationally.

Dr [[Jacob Robinson]], IJA’s founder, served as its first director (1941–1947). He was succeeded by [[Nehemiah Robinson]] (1947–1964) and [[Oscar Karbach]] (1964–1973).&lt;ref name="AJA"&gt;American Jewish Archives (2002) A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982 (bulk 1940-1980). Manuscript Collection No. 361. Accessed on-line at: http://americanjewisharchives.org/collections/ms0361/ms0361.html#seriesC on 8.8.2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1940s, the organization, together with WJC’s Political Department, was engaged in the preparation of reports submitted to the [[United Nations]] and other organizations.&lt;ref name="AJA"/&gt;

'''Kurt Nikolai Zoege von Manteuffel''' (8 August 1881 – 10 January 1941) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] [[art history|art historian]].

Kurt Zoege von Manteuffel was born in present-day [[Tallinn]], Estonia (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) and spent his childhood in Estonia. His father belonged to the [[Baltic nobility]] and his mother was Danish. He studied in [[Kassel]] and [[Königsberg]] and at the universities in [[Munich]], [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[Berlin]]. In 1909 he earned his doctoral degree; his dissertation was about [[Pisanello]]. He worked 1909-10 at the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]] in [[Aachen]] and the following three years as a member of the editorial board of an art encyclopaedia. Later he worked at the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]], but volunteered to fight in [[World War I]] and was severely wounded in 1918. The following year he took up work in [[Dresden]] and in 1924 he became director of the [[Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden|Kupferstich-Kabinett]] there. He died in 1941 in [[Chojnice]].&lt;ref name="BBL"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://bbld.de/0000000110230254/query/Manteuffel-Kurt-Nikolai/|title= Zoege v.

==Identified fictional colors==
This is a '''list of fictional colors''' which were invented for a work of fiction.
*'''Actinic''' is a new use of an older word by [[Larry Niven]] in ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]'' for the human sensation of color in vision-damaging ultraviolet light – for example, as seen in welding-torch light (see [[Actinism]]). The term "actinic light" was also used in E.E. Smith's [[Lensman series|''Lensmen'' series]] to describe UV light, and in the novel ''Forlorn Hope'' to describe the effect of a military laser weapon upon a cloud of mercury droplets. '''Actinic''' was also mentioned in Ambrose Bierce's short story ''[[The Damned Thing (Short Story)]]'' published in 1898. It simply referred to a color that humans cannot see.
*'''Ultra Indigo''' was a color and plot point in an episode of the television series ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', possessing the power to decelerate other photons and distort time.
*'''Amarklor''' and '''Kalish''' are colors in the ultraviolet range seen by [[Klingon]]s in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''[[Pawns and Symbols]]'' by Majliss Larson. In this story, Klingons see amarklor between violet and kalish, but see the color red as black.
*'''[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|Garrow]]'''&amp;nbsp; and '''Infra-White'''&amp;nbsp; – colors invented in the ''[[Nebulous]]'' episode "Madness Is a Strange Colour". Both colors affect the human mind in odd ways, either destroying or creating sanity. Professor Nebulous claims that he discovered Infra-White by looking ''underneath and behind'' the visible spectrum.
*'''[[Fuligin]]'''&amp;nbsp;– both a color and a textile having that color, associated with the Guild of Torturers in [[Gene Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Shadow of the Torturer]]''. The color is defined as "the color that is darker than black" and also as "the color of soot". In comparison, see the real colors [[super black]] and [[vantablack]].
*'''[[Grue and bleen]]'''&amp;nbsp;– colors that change after an arbitrary, but fixed time; coined by philosopher Nelson Goodman to illustrate what he calls "the new [[riddle of induction]]."&lt;ref name="Goodman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Mull and glow]]'''&amp;nbsp;– an infrared and an ultraviolet color seen by futuristic humans in Victor Emmanuel's ''The Messiah of the Cylinder'' (1917).
*'''[[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hooloovoo|Hooloovoo]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a superintelligent shade of the color blue in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]]. In ''[[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]'', Adams mentions [[Agrajag]]'s lair as being painted in "the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the way."&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt by Tom Snyder of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|H2G2]], located here [http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/tomsnyder/hg-3-18.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Octarine]]'''&amp;nbsp;– the color of magic in the ''[[Discworld]]'' fantasy novels, described as resembling a fluorescent greenish-yellow purple.
*'''[[Squant]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a fourth primary color publicized by the experimental band [[Negativland]] in 1993.
*[[A Voyage to Arcturus#Names|'''Jale''', '''Ulfire''' and '''Dolm''']]&amp;nbsp;– Two new primary colors (Jale and Ulfire) and a compound color of ulfire and blue (dolm) from ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' (1920) by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]. Jale and Ulfire are described as "Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous."
*The colors [[The Stars My Destination|'''tang''' and '''burn''']] are colors in the [[infrared]] range seen by the [[albino]] [[mutant]] Olivia Presteign (whose [[Visual perception|vision]] only functions in the infrared) in the 1956 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' by [[Alfred Bester]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher, Anthony]], Editor ''A Treasury of Great Science Fiction'' Garden City, New York:1959—Doubleday Volume Two—''The Stars My Destination'' by Alfred Bester, Pages 361–522—Color reference Page 465&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Berl''', '''Crynor''', '''Nusp''', and '''Onsible''' are colors from the ''Star Wars'' universe. They are said to be somewhere in the ultraviolet spectrum, which can be seen by [[Hutts]] and [[Kaminoans]] and some others.
*'''Htun''' is a color similar to black only seen by gnomes in the book ''[[Fairest (novel)|Fairest]]'' by [[Gail Carson Levine]].
*'''Sangoire''' is a color of red 'so dark and saturated it [is] almost black', it is also described as 'the color of blood spilled in moonlight', seen in the [[Kushiel's Legacy]] Series by [[Jacqueline Carey]].
*'''Gloxym''' is a fictional color coined by [[Kibology|Kibo]] on his FAQ. He describes Gloxym as the true color of the sky.
*'''Smaudre''' is a color from the fairy world in [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[Suldrun's Garden]]''. The fairy folk find it lovely, but to the human eye, it appears colorless.
*'''Rawn''' and '''Pallow''' are colors associated with circles of magic beyond white, black, purple and green in Jack Vance's ''Green Magic''.
*'''Plaid''' is one of the colors outside of the natural human spectrum visible to large intelligent [[arachnid]]s in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]''.
*'''Shattan''' is said to be a fourth primary color for Yalia people in ''[[Wonderland Online]]''. It is said to have calming properties and appears to humans as a combination of golden and infraviolet colors.{{citation needed|reason=No mention of Shattan at the linked page.|date=July 2014}}
*'''Flange''' is "every color of the rainbow, all at once" in the book ''[[The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles]]'' by [[Julie Andrews Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-reading.me/bookreader.php/1007836/Edwards_-_The_Last_of_the_Really_Great_Whangdoodles.html|title=Book: The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles|first=Edwards Julie|last=Andrews|date=|website=www.e-reading.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is used by the Whangdoodle to impress his bride and it is stated that it is very hard to do. The Whangdoodle is also capable of turning colors such as crash pink, some of which may or may not exist.
*'''Apocyan''', '''Cosmogone''', '''Gant''', '''Irrigo''', '''Peligin''', '''Violant''', and '''Viric''', collectively known as 'the Neathbow', are colors found only in the subterranean Neath of Failbetter Games' ''[[Fallen London]]'' universe. They are impossible shades of existing colours: apocyan is a bright pale aqua, irrigo is brilliant purple, violant has been depicted multiple ways but is usually an iridescent wine-red, cosmogene is golden yellow, gant is beige with a slight reddish tinge, peligin is an extremely dark blue-gray that's almost black, and viric is emerald green. Most of them also have supernatural properties: irrigo causes forgetfulness, violant improves memory, cosmogone and viric are heavily associated with dreams. Gant is the colour that "remains when all other colours are eaten".
*'''El Gris/Gray''' is considered the "third" and an unreal color in ''[[La Historia de los Colores|La Historia de los Colores/The Story of Colors]]'' by [[Subcomandante Marcos]]. It only exists so the black and the white don't bump into each other so hard – it does so by painting the dusks and dawns.
*'''Gloze''' and '''Flush''' are infrared colors mentioned in the book ''[[Neverness]]'' by [[David Zindell]].

==Unnamed fictional colors==
*''[[The Colour Out of Space]]''&amp;nbsp;– a vaguely described alien hue, from the story of that name by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1927).
*In ''[[The Golden Key]]'', an 1867 fairy tale by [[George MacDonald]], a boy sees additional colors in a [[rainbow]] in [[Fairy]]land: "He could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before."
*In the [[Mars|Martian]] ([[Barsoom]]) novels of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the spectrum is divided into nine colors rather than the earthly seven, and the two unearthly colors are called "the eighth ray" and "the ninth ray". [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] describes the additional colors as "... two beautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless. I cannot describe them any more than you could describe red to a blind man. I only know that they were beautiful in the extreme." The eighth ray exerts an anti-gravity force and is trapped in tanks by the Red Martians to levitate and propel their flying craft. The ninth ray is processed by the great atmosphere factory to create breathable air for Barsoom.
*In the 1942 novel ''[[Perelandra]]'', [[C. S. Lewis]] describes the colors of angelic beings when they manifest themselves: "We think that when creatures of the hypersomatic kind choose to 'appear' to us, they are not in fact affecting our retina at all, but directly manipulating the relevant parts of our brain. If so, it is quite possible that they can produce there the sensations we should have if our eyes were capable of receiving those colours in the spectrum which are actually beyond their range." (Chapter 16)
*In [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] ''[[From a Buick 8]]'', the characters encounter an alien plant with an unearthly color, which the narrator describes as "corpse white".

'''Ornithology''' is a branch of [[zoology]] that concerns the study of [[birds]]. Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines, due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|author=Newton, Ian|year=1998|title=Population limitation in birds|publisher=Academic Press|page=2|isbn=978-0-12-517366-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The science of ornithology has a long history and studies on birds have helped develop several key concepts in evolution, behaviour and ecology such as the definition of [[species]], the process of [[speciation]], [[instinct]], [[learning]], [[ecological niche]]s, [[guild (ecology)|guilds]], [[island biogeography]], [[phylogeography]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]].&lt;ref name=mayr&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mayr, E.|year=1984|title=Commentary: The Contributions of Ornithology to Biology|journal=BioScience|volume=34|issue=4|pages=250–255|doi=10.2307/1309464|jstor=1309464|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early ornithology was principally concerned with descriptions and distributions of species, ornithologists today seek answers to very specific questions, often using birds as models to test hypotheses or predictions based on theories. Most modern biological theories apply across taxonomic groups, and the number of professional scientists who identify themselves as "ornithologists" has therefore declined.&lt;ref name=bibby2003/&gt; A wide range of tools and techniques is used in ornithology, both inside the laboratory and out in the field, and innovations are constantly made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutherland, W. J., Newton, Ian and Green, Rhys |year=2004|title=Bird ecology and conservation: a handbook of techniques|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-852086-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "ornithology" comes from the late 16th-century Latin ''ornithologia'' meaning "bird science" from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὄρνις ''ornis'' ("bird") and λόγος ''logos'' ("theory, science, thought").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|ornithology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of ornithology}}
The history of ornithology largely reflects the trends in the [[history of biology]], as well as many other scientific disciplines, including [[ecology]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[paleontology]], and more recently, molecular biology. Trends include the move from mere descriptions to the identification of patterns, thus towards elucidating the processes that produce these patterns.

===Early knowledge and study===
Humans have had an observational relationship with birds since [[prehistory]], with some stone-age drawings being amongst the oldest indications of an interest in birds.&lt;ref name="Gurney, JH 1921"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Gurney, JH |year=1921|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924005489558 |title=Early annals of ornithology |journal=Nature|volume=108|issue=2713|pages=268|bibcode=1921Natur.108..268.|doi=10.1038/108268a0|hdl=2027/coo.31924090299532}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bird books and bird art|author=Anker, Jean|publisher=Springer-Science|year=1979|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds were perhaps important as food sources, and bones of as many as 80 species have been found in excavations of early [[Stone Age]] settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nadel, K.

Other old writings such as the [[Vedas]] (1500–800 BC) demonstrate the careful observation of avian life histories and include the earliest reference to the habit of [[brood parasite|brood parasitism]] by the [[Asian koel]] (''Eudynamys scolopacea'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ali, S. |year=1979 |title=Bird study in India: its history and its importance |jstor=23001825|journal=India International Centre Quarterly|volume=6|issue=2 |pages=127–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like writing, the early art of China, Japan, Persia, and India also demonstrate knowledge, with examples of scientifically accurate bird illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, David (1965) Enjoying Ornithology.

The idea of swallow hibernation became so well established that even as late as in 1878, [[Elliott Coues]] could list as many as 182 contemporary publications dealing with the hibernation of swallows and little published evidence to contradict the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lincoln, Frederick C., Steven R.

The earliest record of falconry comes from the reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC) in [[Assyria]]. Falconry is thought to have made its entry to Europe only after AD 400, brought in from the east after invasions by the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]]. Starting from the eighth century, numerous Arabic works on the subject and general ornithology were written, as well as translations of the works of ancient writers from Greek and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. In the 12th and 13th centuries,  crusades and conquest had subjugated Islamic territories in southern Italy, central Spain, and the Levant under European rule, and for the first time translations into Latin of the great works of Arabic and Greek scholars were made with the help of Jewish and Muslim scholars, especially in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had fallen into Christian hands in 1085 and whose libraries had escaped destruction. [[Michael Scot]]us from Scotland made a Latin translation of Aristotle's work on animals from Arabic here around 1215, which was disseminated widely and was the first time in a millennium that this foundational text on zoology became available to Europeans. Falconry was popular in the [[Normans|Norman]] court in Sicily, and a number of works on the subject were written in [[Palermo]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] (1194–1250) learned about an falconry during his youth in Sicily and later built up a [[menagerie]] and sponsored translations of Arabic texts, among which the popular Arabic work known as the ''[[Moamyn|Liber Moaminus]]'' by an unknown author which was translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch from Syria in 1240-1241 as the ''De Scientia Venandi per Aves'', and also Michael Scotus (who had removed to Palermo) translated [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]]'s ''Kitāb al-Ḥayawān'' of 1027 for the Emperor, a commentary and scientific update of Aristotle's work which was part of Ibn Sīnā's massive ''[[The Book of Healing|Kitāb al-Šifāʾ]]''. Frederick II eventually wrote his own treatise on falconry, the ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', in which he related his ornithological observations and the results of the hunts and experiments his court enjoyed performing.&lt;ref name="egerton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Egerton, F. |year=2003 |title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 8: Fredrick II of Hohenstaufen: Amateur Avian Ecologist and Behaviorist |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=40–44|url=http://esapubs.org/bulletin/current/history_list/history_part8.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2003)84[40:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Oppenraay |first=Aafke M.I. |date=2017 |title=Avicenna's ''Liber de animalibus'' ('''Abbreviatio Avicennae''') - Preliminaries and State of Affairs |url=https://pure.knaw.nl/ws/files/6003490/Avicenna_s_Liber_de_animalibus_Abbreviatio_Avicennae_._VanOppenraay_2017.pdf |journal=Documenti e Studi Sulla Tradizione Filosofica Medievale |volume=28 |pages=401–416 |doi= |access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early German and French scholars compiled old works and conducted new research on birds. These included [[Guillaume Rondelet]], who described his observations in the Mediterranean, and [[Pierre Belon]], who described the fish and birds that he had seen in France and the Levant. Belon's ''Book of Birds'' (1555) is a folio volume with descriptions of some 200 species. His comparison of the skeleton of humans and birds is considered as a landmark in [[comparative anatomy]].&lt;ref name="miall"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miall, L.

[[William Turner (ornithologist)|William Turner]]'s ''Historia Avium'' (''History of Birds''), published at [[Cologne]] in 1544, was an early ornithological work from England. He noted the commonness of [[red kite|kite]]s in English cities where they snatched food out of the hands of children. He included folk beliefs such as those of anglers. Anglers believed that the [[osprey]] emptied their fishponds and would kill them, mixing the flesh of the osprey into their fish bait. Turner's work reflected the violent times in which he lived, and stands in contrast to later works such as [[Gilbert White]]'s ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' that were written in a tranquil era.&lt;ref name="miall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gilbertwhite"&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Gilbert |title=The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne |year= 1887 |origyear=1789 |location=London |publisher=Cassell &amp; Company| oclc=3423785 |pages=38–39 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20933/20933-h/20933-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Francis Willughby]] (1635–1672) and [[John Ray]] (1627–1705) came up with the first major system of bird classification that was based on function and morphology rather than on form or behaviour. Willughby's ''Ornithologiae libri tres'' (1676) completed by John Ray is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of scientific ornithology. Ray also worked on ''Ornithologia'', which was published posthumously in 1713 as ''Synopsis methodica avium et piscium''.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |year=1999 |title=Ornithology Collections in the Libraries at Cornell University: A Descriptive Guide |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/ornithology/guide/hillguide.htm |accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest list of British birds, ''Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum'', was written by [[Christopher Merrett]] in 1667, but authors such as John Ray considered it of little value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koinm, Albert J. |year=2000 |title=Christopher Merrett's Use of Experiment |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=23–32 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2000.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray did, however, value the expertise of the naturalist [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–82), who not only answered his queries on ornithological identification and nomenclature, but also those of Willoughby and Merrett in letter correspondence.

[[File:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'', [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], 1768]]
Towards the late 18th century, [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]] (1723–1806) and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) began new works on birds. Brisson produced a six-volume work ''Ornithologie'' in 1760 and Buffon's included nine volumes (volumes 16–24) on birds ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux'' (1770–1785) in his work on science ''Histoire naturelle générale et particulière'' (1749–1804). Jacob Temminck sponsored [[François Le Vaillant]] [1753–1824] to collect bird specimens in Southern Africa and Le Vaillant's six-volume ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d'Afrique'' (1796–1808) included many non-African birds. His other bird books produced in collaboration with the artist Barraband are considered among the most valuable illustrated guides ever produced. [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]] (1748–1831) spent 10 years studying North American birds and wrote the ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'Amerique septentrionale'' (1807–1808?). Vieillot pioneered in the use of life histories and habits in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |title=Hill Collection — 18th c.

In the early 19th century, [[Lewis and Clark]] studied and identified many birds in the western United States. [[John James Audubon]], born in 1785, observed and painted birds in France and later in the [[Ohio]] and [[Mississippi]] valleys. From 1827 to 1838, Audubon published ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]'', which was engraved by [[Havell family|Robert Havell, Sr.]] and his son Robert Havell, Jr. Containing 435 engravings, it is often regarded as the greatest ornithological work in history.

===Scientific studies===
[[File:Bird eggs.jpg|thumb|left|Early bird study focused on collectibles such as eggs and nests.]]
The emergence of ornithology as a scientific discipline began in the 18th century, when [[Mark Catesby]] published his two-volume ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands'', a landmark work which included 220 hand-painted engravings and was the basis for many of the species [[Carl Linnaeus]] described in the 1758 ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]''. Linnaeus' work revolutionised bird taxonomy by assigning every species a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]], categorising them into different genera.
However, ornithology did not emerge as a specialised science until the Victorian era—with the concept of natural history, and the collection of natural objects such as bird eggs and skins.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, David E.|year=1994|title=The naturalist in Britain: a social history|isbn=978-0691036328|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farber, Paul L.|year=1982|title=The Emergence of Ornithology as a Scientific Discipline, 1760–1850|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company, Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specialization led to the formation in Britain of the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] in 1858. In 1859, the members founded its journal ''[[The Ibis]]''. The sudden spurt in ornithology was also due in part to [[colonialism]]. At 100 years later, in 1959, [[Reginald Ernest Moreau|R. E. Moreau]] noted that ornithology in this period was preoccupied with the geographical distributions of various species of birds.&lt;ref name="ibis-history"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Kristin|year=2004|title=''The Ibis'': Transformations in a Twentieth Century British Natural History Journal|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=37|pages=515–555| doi=10.1007/s10739-004-1499-3|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|No doubt the preoccupation with widely extended geographical ornithology, was fostered by the immensity of the areas over which British rule or influence stretched during the 19th century and for some time afterwards.|Moreau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moreau, R.

The bird collectors of the Victorian era observed the variations in bird forms and habits across geographic regions, noting local specialization and variation in widespread species. The collections of museums and private collectors grew with contributions from various parts of the world. The naming of species with binomials and the organization of birds into groups based on their similarities became the main work of museum specialists. The variations in widespread birds across geographical regions caused the introduction of trinomial names.
[[File:KaupClassification.svg|thumb|Kaup's classification of the crow family]]
The search for patterns in the variations of birds was attempted by many. [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775–1854), his student [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] (1781–1826), and several others believed that a hidden and innate mathematical order existed in the forms of birds. They believed that a "natural" classification was available and superior to "artificial" ones. A particularly popular idea was the [[Quinarian system]] popularised by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] (1785–1840), [[William Sharp Macleay]] (1792–1865), [[William John Swainson|William Swainson]], and others. The idea was that nature followed a "rule of five" with five groups nested hierarchically. Some had attempted a rule of four, but [[Johann Jakob Kaup]] (1803–1873) insisted that the number five was special, noting that other natural entities such as the senses also came in fives. He followed this idea and demonstrated his view of the order within the crow family. Where he failed to find five genera, he left a blank insisting that a new genus would be found to fill these gaps. These ideas were replaced by more complex "maps" of affinities in works by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref name=ohara&gt;{{cite journal|author=O’Hara, Robert J.|year=1988|title=Diagrammatic classifications of birds, 1819–1901: views of the natural system in 19th-century British ornithology|pages=2746–2759 |journal=Acta XIX Congressus Internationalis Ornithologici|url=http://rjohara.net/cv/1988-ioc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1975|isbn=978-0-674-64485-4|author=Stresemann, Erwin|title=Ornithology.

The [[Galapagos]] [[finch]]es were especially influential in the development of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. His contemporary [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] also noted these variations and the geographical separations between different forms leading to the study of [[biogeography]]. Wallace was influenced by the work of [[Philip Lutley Sclater]] on the distribution patterns of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sclater, P.

For Darwin, the problem was how species arose from a common ancestor, but he did not attempt to find rules for delineation of species. The [[species problem]] was tackled by the ornithologist [[Ernst Mayr]], who was able to demonstrate that geographical isolation and the accumulation of genetic differences led to the splitting of species.&lt;ref name=konishi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Konishi, Masakazu |author2=Emlen, Stephen T. |author3=Ricklefs, Robert E. |author4=Wingfield, John C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989|title=Contributions of Bird Studies to Biology|journal=Science|volume=246|issue=4929|pages=465–472|doi=10.1126/science.2683069|pmid=2683069|bibcode = 1989Sci...246..465K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ornithology and the genesis of the Synthetic Theory of Evolution|last=Junker|first=Thomas|journal=Avian Science|volume=3|issue=2&amp;3|pages=65–73|year=2003|url=http://www.thomas-junker.homepage.t-online.de/pdf/03tjas.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early ornithologists were preoccupied with matters of species identification. Only systematics counted as true science and field studies were considered inferior through much of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=haffer/&gt; In 1901, [[Robert Ridgway]] wrote in the introduction to ''The Birds of North and Middle America'' that:
{{quote|There are two essentially different kinds of ornithology: systematic or scientific, and popular. The former deals with the structure and classification of birds, their synonymies, and technical descriptions. The latter treats of their habits, songs, nesting, and other facts pertaining to their life histories.}}
This early idea that the study of living birds was merely recreation held sway until ecological theories became the predominant focus of ornithological studies.&lt;ref name=mayr/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt; The study of birds in their habitats was particularly advanced in Germany with [[bird ringing]] stations established as early as 1903. By the 1920s, the ''Journal für Ornithologie'' included many papers on the behaviour, ecology, anatomy, and physiology, many written by [[Erwin Stresemann]]. Stresemann changed the editorial policy of the journal, leading both to a unification of field and laboratory studies and a shift of research from museums to universities.&lt;ref name=haffer&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archives of Natural History|volume=35|issue=1|pages=76–87|year=2008|title=The origin of modern ornithology in Europe|author=Haffer, J.|doi=10.3366/E0260954108000077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ornithology in the United States continued to be dominated by museum studies of morphological variations, species identities, and geographic distributions, until it was influenced by Stresemann's student Ernst Mayr.&lt;ref name="barrow"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barrow, Mark V.|year=1998|title=A passion for birds: American ornithology after Audubon|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691049540}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, some of the earliest ornithological works that used the word ecology appeared in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander, H. G.|year=1915|title=A Practical Study of Bird Ecology|journal=British Birds|volume=8|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ibis'', however, resisted the introduction of these new methods of study, and  no paper on ecology appeared until 1943.&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt; The work of [[David Lack]] on population ecology was pioneering. Newer quantitative approaches were introduced for the study of ecology and behaviour, and this was not readily accepted. For instance, [[Claud Ticehurst]] wrote:
{{quote|Sometimes it seems that elaborate plans and statistics are made to prove what is commonplace knowledge to the mere collector, such as that hunting parties often travel more or less in circles.|Ticehurst&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt;}}
David Lack's studies on population ecology sought to find the processes involved in the regulation of population based on the evolution of optimal clutch sizes. He concluded that population was regulated primarily by [[Density-dependent inhibition|density-dependent controls]], and also suggested that natural selection produces life-history traits that maximize the fitness of individuals. Others, such as [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards|Wynne-Edwards]], interpreted population regulation as a mechanism that aided the [[Group selection|"species" rather than individuals]]. This led to widespread and sometimes bitter debate on what constituted the "unit of selection".&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt; Lack also pioneered the use of many new tools for ornithological research, including the idea of using [[Radar ornithology|radar]] to study bird migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lack, David|year=1959|title=Watching migration by Radar|url=https://www.britishbirds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/article_files/V52/V52_N08/V52_N08_P258_267_A056.pdf|journal=British Birds|volume=52|issue=8|pages=258–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds were also widely used in studies of the niche hypothesis and [[Georgii Gause]]'s [[competitive exclusion]] principle. Work on resource partitioning and the structuring of bird communities through competition were made by [[Robert MacArthur]]. Patterns of [[biodiversity]] also became a topic of interest. Work on the relationship of the number of species to area and its application in the study of [[island biogeography]] was pioneered by [[E. O. Wilson]] and [[Robert MacArthur]].&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt; These studies led to the development of the discipline of [[landscape ecology]].

L.|year=1964|title=The evolution of diversity in avian territorial systems|journal=Wilson Bull.|volume=76|pages=160–169|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v076n02/p0160-p0169.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising interest in [[sociobiology]] also led to a spurt of bird studies in this area.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v098n02/|title=Contents of The Auk 1981 Volume 98 Number 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of imprinting behaviour in ducks and geese by [[Konrad Lorenz]] and the studies of instinct in [[European herring gull|herring gull]]s by [[Nicolaas Tinbergen]] led to the establishment of the field of [[ethology]]. The study of learning became an area of interest and the study of [[Birdsong|bird songs]] has been a model for studies in neuroethology. The study of hormones and physiology in the control of behaviour has also been aided by bird models. These have helped in finding the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate causes]] of circadian and seasonal cycles. Studies on migration have attempted to answer questions on the evolution of migration, orientation, and navigation.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;

The growth of genetics and the rise of molecular biology led to the application of the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] to explain avian phenomena. Studies on kinship and altruism, such as [[helpers at the nest|helpers]], became of particular interest. The idea of [[inclusive fitness]] was used to interpret observations on behaviour and life history, and birds were widely used models for testing hypotheses based on theories postulated by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;

The new tools of molecular biology changed the study of bird systematics, which changed from being based on [[phenotype]] to the underlying [[genotype]]. The use of techniques such as [[DNA-DNA hybridization]] to study evolutionary relationships was pioneered by [[Charles Sibley]] and [[Jon Edward Ahlquist]], resulting in what is called the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]]. These early techniques have been replaced by newer ones based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences and [[molecular phylogenetics]] approaches that make use of computational procedures for [[sequence alignment]], construction of [[phylogenetic tree]]s, and calibration of [[molecular clock]]s to infer evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Hara, Robert J.|year=1991|title=Essay review of Phylogeny and Classification of Birds: A Study in Molecular Evolution by Charles G.

===Rise to popularity===
The use of [[field glass]]es or [[telescope]]s for bird observation began in the 1820s and 1830s, with pioneers such as [[John Freeman Milward Dovaston|J. Dovaston]] (who also pioneered in the use of bird feeders), but instruction manuals did not begin to insist on the use of optical aids such as "a first-class telescope" or "field glass" until the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allen, D.

[[File:VillageBirdsFlorenceMerriam.jpg|thumb|Page from an early field guide by [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey]]]]
The rise of field guides for the identification of birds was another major innovation. The early guides such as those of [[History of British Birds|Thomas Bewick (two volumes)]] and [[History of British Birds (1843)|William Yarrell (three volumes)]] were cumbersome, and mainly focused on identifying specimens in the hand. The earliest of the new generation of field guides was prepared by [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]], sister of [[Clinton Hart Merriam]], the mammalogist. This was published in 1887 in a series ''Hints to Audubon Workers:Fifty Birds and How to Know Them'' in Grinnell's ''[[Audubon Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="barrow"/&gt; These were followed by new field guides including classics by [[Roger Tory Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunlap, Tom|title=Tom Dunlap on Early Bird Guides.

The interest in [[birdwatching]] grew in popularity in many parts of the world, and the possibility for amateurs to contribute to biological studies was soon realized. As early as 1916, [[Julian Huxley]] wrote a two-part article in ''[[The Auk]]'', noting the tensions between amateurs and professionals, and suggested the possibility that the "vast army of bird lovers and bird watchers could begin providing the data scientists needed to address the fundamental problems of biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley, J.|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science (part 1)|journal=Auk|volume=33|issue=2|pages=142–161|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n02/p0142-p0161.pdf|doi=10.2307/4072162|jstor=4072162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley, J.|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science (part 2)|journal=Auk|volume=33|issue=3|pages=256–270|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n03/p0256-p0270.pdf|doi=10.2307/4072322|jstor=4072322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations were started in many countries, and these grew rapidly in membership, most notable among them being the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) in Britain and the [[Audubon Society]] in the US, which started in 1885. Both these organizations were started with the primary objective of conservation. The RSPB, born in 1889, grew from a small group of women in [[Croydon]], who met regularly and called themselves the "Fur, Fin, and Feather Folk" and who took a pledge "to refrain from wearing the feathers of any birds not killed for the purpose of food, the ostrich only exempted." The organization did not allow men as members initially, avenging a policy of the British Ornithologists' Union to keep out women.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt; Unlike the RSPB, which was primarily conservation oriented, the British Trust for Ornithology was started in 1933 with the aim of advancing ornithological research. Members were often involved in collaborative ornithological projects. These projects have resulted in atlases which detail the distribution of bird species across Britain.&lt;ref name=bibby2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibby, C.J.|year=2003|title=Fifty years of Bird Study: Capsule Field ornithology is alive and well, and in the future can contribute much more in Britain and elsewhere|journal=Bird Study|volume=50|issue=3|pages=194–210|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bto/bird/2003/00000050/00000003/art00001|doi=10.1080/00063650309461314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Breeding Bird Surveys, conducted by the US Geological Survey, have also produced atlases with information on breeding densities and changes in the density and distribution over time. Other volunteer collaborative ornithology projects were subsequently established in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/|title=North American Breeding Bird Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
The tools and techniques of ornithology are varied, and new inventions and approaches are quickly incorporated. The techniques may be broadly dealt under the categories of those that are applicable to specimens and those that are used in the field, but the classification is rough and many analysis techniques are usable both in the laboratory and field or may require a combination of field and laboratory techniques.

===Collections===
{{main|Bird collections}}
[[File:Godwit prep.jpg|thumb|left|Bird-preservation techniques]]
The earliest approaches to modern bird study involved the collection of eggs, a practice known as [[oology]]. While collecting became a pastime for many amateurs, the labels associated with these early egg collections made them unreliable for the serious study of bird breeding. To preserve eggs, a tiny hole was made and the contents extracted. This technique became standard with the invention of the blow drill around 1830.&lt;ref name=allen /&gt; Egg collection is no longer popular; however, historic museum collections have been of value in determining the effects of [[pesticide]]s such as [[DDT]] on physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Newton, I.|year=1979|title=Population ecology of raptors|isbn=978-0856610233|publisher=T. &amp; A.

[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|Morphometric measurements of birds are important in systematics.]]
The use of bird skins to document species has been a standard part of systematic ornithology. Bird skins are prepared by retaining the key bones of the wings, legs, and skull along with the skin and feathers. In the past, they were treated with [[arsenic]] to prevent fungal and insect (mostly [[Dermestidae|dermestid]]) attack. Arsenic, being toxic, was replaced by less-toxic [[borax]]. Amateur and professional collectors became familiar with these skinning techniques and started sending in their skins to museums, some of them from distant locations. This led to the formation of huge collections of bird skins in museums in Europe and North America. Many private collections were also formed. These became references for comparison of species, and the ornithologists at these museums were able to compare species from different locations, often places that they themselves never visited. [[Morphometrics]] of these skins, particularly the lengths of the tarsus, bill, tail, and wing became important in the descriptions of bird species. These skin collections have been used in more recent times for studies on [[molecular phylogenetics]] by the extraction of [[ancient DNA]]. The importance of [[biological type|type specimens]] in the description of species make skin collections a vital resource for systematic ornithology. However, with the rise of molecular techniques,  establishing the taxonomic status of new discoveries, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (''Laniarius liberatus'', no longer a valid species) and the [[Bugun liocichla]] (''Liocichla bugunorum''), using blood, DNA and feather samples as the [[holotype]] material, has now become possible.

Other methods of preservation include the storage of specimens in spirit. Such wet specimens have special value in physiological and anatomical study, apart from providing better quality of DNA for molecular studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Livezey, Bradley C.|year=2003|title=Avian spirit collections: attitudes, importance and prospects|journal=Bull. B. O. C.|volume=123A|pages=35–51 |url=http://www.carnegiemnh.net/birds/Livezey%20(2003).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeze drying]] of specimens is another technique that has the advantage of preserving stomach contents and anatomy, although it tends to shrink, making it less reliable for morphometrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Winker, K.|year=1993|title=Specimen shrinkage in Tennessee warblers and Traill's flycatchers|journal=J.

===In the field===
The study of birds in the field was helped enormously by improvements in optics. Photography made it possible to document birds in the field with great accuracy. High-power spotting scopes today allow observers to detect minute morphological differences that were earlier possible only by examination of the specimen "in the hand".&lt;ref name="shorebirds"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hayman, Peter |author2=Marchant, John |author3=Prater, Tony  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1986|title=Shorebirds: An Identification Guide to the Waders of the World|isbn=978-0395602379|publisher=Croom Helm, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capture and marking of birds enable detailed studies of life history.

[[File:Monitoreo de Aves a Largo Plazo.jpg|thumb|A researcher measures a wild woodpecker.  The bird's right leg has a metal identification tag.]]
The bird in the hand may be examined and [[morphometrics|measurements]] can be made, including standard lengths and weights. Feather moult and skull ossification provide indications of age and health. Sex can be determined by examination of anatomy in some sexually nondimorphic species. Blood samples may be drawn to determine hormonal conditions in studies of physiology, identify DNA markers for studying genetics and kinship in studies of breeding biology and phylogeography. Blood may also be used to identify pathogens and [[arthropod-borne virus]]es. [[Ectoparasite]]s may be collected for studies of coevolution and [[zoonoses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walther, B. A.  |author2=Clayton, D.

Field-identifiable marks such as coloured bands, wing tags, or dyes enable short-term studies where individual identification is required. [[Mark and recapture]] techniques make [[demographic]] studies possible. Ringing has traditionally been used in the study of migration.

===In the laboratory===
Many aspects of bird biology are difficult to study in the field. These include the study of behavioural and physiological changes that require a long duration of access to the bird. Nondestructive samples of blood or feathers taken during field studies may be studied in the laboratory. For instance, the variation in the ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes across latitudes makes establishing the origins of migrant birds possible using [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] analysis of feather samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hobson, K.

Studies in bird behaviour include the use of tamed and trained birds in captivity. Studies on [[bird intelligence]] and [[bird vocalization#Learning|song learning]] have been largely laboratory-based. Field researchers may make use of a wide range of techniques such as the use of dummy owls to elicit mobbing behaviour, and dummy males or the use of call playback to elicit territorial behaviour and thereby to establish the boundaries of bird territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Slater, P.

The chicken has long been a [[model organism]] for studying vertebrate [[developmental biology]]. As the embryo is readily accessible, its development can be easily followed (unlike [[house mouse|mice]]). This also allows the use of [[electroporation]] for studying the effect of adding or silencing a gene. Other tools for perturbing their genetic makeup are chicken [[embryonic stem cell]]s and [[viral vector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stern CD |title=The chick; a great model system becomes even greater |journal=Dev.

Wild birds impact many human activities, while domesticated birds are important sources of eggs, meat, feathers, and other products. Applied and economic ornithology aim to reduce the ill effects of problem birds and enhance gains from beneficial species.

'''Plant–soil feedback''' is a process where plants alter the [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] qualities of [[soil]] they grow in, which then alters the ability of plants to grow in that soil in the future.&lt;ref name="bever1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bever|first1=James D.|title=Feeback between Plants and Their Soil Communities in an Old Field Community|journal=Ecology|date=1 January 1994|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1965–1977|doi=10.2307/1941601|jstor=1941601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bever|first1=James D.|last2=Westover|first2=Kristi M.|last3=Antonovics|first3=Janis|title=Incorporating the Soil Community into Plant Population Dynamics: The Utility of the Feedback Approach|journal=The Journal of Ecology|date=October 1997|volume=85|issue=5|pages=561|doi=10.2307/2960528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative plant–soil feedback occurs when plants are less able to grow in soil that was previously occupied by a member of the same species, and positive plant–soil feedback occurs when plants are more able to grow in soil that was previously occupied by a member of the same species.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  Although it was originally assumed that negative plant–soil feedback was caused by plants depleting the soil of [[nutrient]]s, recent work has suggested that a major cause of plant–soil feedback is a buildup of soil-borne [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref name="bever1994" /&gt;  [[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] and [[allelopathy]] are also thought to cause plant–soil feedback.  Studies have shown that, on average, plant–soil feedback tends to be negative;&lt;ref name="kulmatiski_et_al_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulmatiski|first1=Andrew|last2=Beard|first2=Karen H.|last3=Stevens|first3=John R.|last4=Cobbold|first4=Stephanie M.|title=Plant-soil feedbacks: a meta-analytical review|journal=Ecology Letters|date=September 2008|volume=11|issue=9|pages=980–992|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there have been many notable exceptions, such as many invasive species.&lt;ref name="Klironomos2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klironomos|first1=John N.|title=Feedback with soil biota contributes to plant rarity and invasiveness in communities|journal=Nature|date=2 May 2002|volume=417|issue=6884|pages=67–70|doi=10.1038/417067a|pmid=11986666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative plant–soil feedback is thought to be an important factor in helping plants to [[coexistence theory|coexist]].  If a plant is over-abundant, then soil pathogens and other negative factors will become common, hurting its growth.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  Similarly, if a plant becomes overly rare, then so too will its soil pathogens and other negative factors, helping its growth.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  This [[negative feedback]] will help populations to stay in the community.  Negative plant–soil feedback has been called a particular case of the [[Janzen–Connell hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Petermann_et_al_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petermann|first1=Jana S.|last2=Fergus|first2=Alexander J. F.|last3=Turnbull|first3=Lindsay A.|last4=Schmid|first4=Bernhard|title=JANZEN-CONNELL EFFECTS ARE WIDESPREAD AND STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN DIVERSITY IN GRASSLANDS|journal=Ecology|date=September 2008|volume=89|issue=9|pages=2399–2406|doi=10.1890/07-2056.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring plant–soil feedback==

Plant–soil feedback is best measured using Bever's interaction coefficient, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  This value quantifies how much each plant's growth is limited by its own soil community compared to how much it limits others.  It is for two-species comparisons.  To measure this quantity, one must measure the growth of two plants, both in soil conditioned by members of their own species (''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(home) for species ''x''), and in soil conditioned by members of the other species (''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(away) for plant species ''x'').  Then, the interaction coefficient is calculated as

: &lt;math&gt;I_s=G_x(\mbox{home})+G_y(\mbox{home})-G_x(\mbox{away})-G_y(\mbox{away}). &lt;/math&gt;

If ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is negative, it means that both species grow worse in their own site compared to their competitor's soil, and therefore plant–soil feedback helps these species to coexist.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;

Many of the world's countries, including many in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]], have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc. in some of the less fortunate countries.

==History==

Population began growing rapidly in the [[Western world]] early in the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] of the late 18th century. The reasons for the "Modern Rise of Population"&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Modern Rise of Population|last=McKeown|first=Thomas|publisher=Edward Arnold|year=1976|isbn=9780713159868|location=London, UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were particularly investigated by the British health scientist [[Thomas McKeown (physician)|Thomas McKeown]] (1912-1988). In his publications, McKeown challenged four theories about the population growth:

==Population growth rate==
The "population growth rate" is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period, expressed as a fraction of the initial population. Specifically, population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period, often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period. This can be written as the formula, valid for a sufficiently small time interval:

:&lt;math&gt;Population\ growth\ rate = \frac{ P(t_2)  -  P(t_1)} {P(t_1)(t_2-t_1)}&lt;/math&gt;

A positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing, while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing. A growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period—a growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the [[birth rate]]s, [[death rate]]s, [[immigration rate]]s, and age distribution between the two times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=61 Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522092307/http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=61 |date=2008-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related measure is the [[net reproduction rate]]. In the absence of migration, a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing, while a net reproduction rate less than one ([[sub-replacement fertility]]) indicates that the population of females is decreasing.

Most populations do not grow exponentially, rather they follow a [[Logistic function|logistic model]]. Once the population has reached its [[carrying capacity]], it will stabilize and the exponential curve will level off towards the carrying capacity, which is usually when a population has depleted most its [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa|last3=Cain|first3=Michael|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Logistic growth graph (population ecology).JPG|thumb|The logistic growth of a population.]]

===Logistic equation===

The growth of a population can often be modelled by the [[Population_dynamics#Logistic_population_growth|logistic equation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brief Applied Calculus|last=Stewart|first=James|last2=Clegg|first2=Daniel|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=kP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; = the population after time t;
* &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = time a population grows;
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; = the relative growth rate coefficient;
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = the carrying capacity of the population; defined by ecologists as the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As it is a separable differential equation, the population may be solved explicitly, producing a [[logistic function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-rt}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;A=\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population at time 0.

Many of the world's countries, including many in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]], have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc. in some of the less fortunate countries. For example, the population of [[Chad]] has ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009,&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; further straining its resources. [[Vietnam]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] are witnessing a similar growth in population.

==Growth by region==
Population growth rates vary by world region, with the highest growth rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and the lowest in Europe. For example, from 1950 to 2010, Sub-Saharan African grew over three and a half times, from about 186 million to 856 million. On the other hand, Europe only increased by 35%, from 547 million in 1950 to 738 million in 2010. As a result of these varying population growths, Sub-Saharan Africa changed from 7.4% of world population in 1950 to 12.4% in 2010, while Europe declined from 22% to 11% in the same time period.

According to the UN's 2017 revision to its population projections, world population is projected to reach 11.2 billion by 2100 compared to 7.6 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/publications.htm|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Indian economist Sanjeev Sanyal disputed the UN's figures and argued that birth rates will fall below replacement rates in the 2020s. According to his projections, population growth will be only sustained till the 2040s by rising longevity, but will peak below 9 bn by 2050.&lt;ref name="Sanjeev Sanyal"/&gt; Conversely, a 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the United Nations Population Division projected that the world's population would reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter.&lt;ref name = Science&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6325">A '''position paper''' is an essay that presents an arguable [[opinion]] about an issue – typically that of the author or some specified entity. Position papers are published in academia, in politics, in law and other domains. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that the opinion presented is valid and worth listening to. Ideas for position papers that one is considering need to be carefully examined when choosing a topic, developing an argument, and organizing the paper. 

Position papers range from the simplest format of a [[letter to the editor]], through to the most complex in the form of an academic position paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanders|Tingloo|Verhulst|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-gBH7BQqy_0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;vq=%22The+simplest+form+is+the+letter+to+the+editor%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U3rDMBciOi4ZB2l3gHAbnCLMSb0Kg 11]}}, "The simplest form is the letter to the editor... The most complex type of position paper is the academic position paper in which arguments and evidence are presented to support the writer's views."&lt;/ref&gt; Position papers are also used by large organizations to make public the official beliefs and recommendations of the group.&lt;ref&gt;An example of a position paper published by an organization: {{Citation

== In academia ==
Position papers in academia enable discussion on emerging topics without the experimentation and original research normally present in an [[academic paper]]. Commonly, such a document will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.

== In politics ==
Position papers are most useful in contexts where detailed comprehension of another entity's views is important; as such, they are commonly used by political campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steely|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZUNJPsV9i0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22The+Gentleman+from+Georgia:%22+%22The+Biography+of+Newt+Gingrich%22&amp;ei=-9mxSKLpCIPctAOFkdHaBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U30RgMIjhbEY1SMSUxGE9c2nfihkQ#PRA1-PA186,M1 186]}}, "Through the use of position papers, telephone briefings, audio and video tapes and personal appearances Newt was able to share his ideas, ... ."&lt;/ref&gt; government organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In government, a position paper lies on somewhere between a [[white paper]] and a [[green paper]] in that they affirm definite opinions and propose solutions but may not go so far as detailing specific plans for implementation.

== In law ==
In [[international law]], the term for a position paper is [[Aide-mémoire]]. An Aide-Mémoire is memorandum setting forth the minor points of a proposed discussion or disagreement, used especially in undiplomatic communications.

In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Rastrigin function''' is a non-[[convex function]] used as a performance test problem for [[optimization algorithm]]s. It is a typical example of non-linear multimodal function. It was first proposed by Rastrigin &lt;ref&gt;Rastrigin, L. A. "Systems of extremal control." Mir, Moscow (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; as a 2-dimensional function and has been generalized by Mühlenbein et al.&lt;ref&gt;H. Mühlenbein, D. Schomisch and J. Born. "The Parallel Genetic Algorithm as Function Optimizer ". Parallel Computing, 17, pages 619&amp;ndash;632, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of [[local minimum|local minima]].

On an n-dimensional domain it is defined by:
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = A n + \sum_{i=1}^n \left[x_i^2 - A\cos(2 \pi x_i)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;A=10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i\in[-5.12,5.12] &lt;/math&gt;. It has a global minimum at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[file:Edward J Routh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Edward John Routh]], 1831–1907.]]

In [[analytical mechanics]], a branch of [[theoretical physics]], '''Routhian mechanics''' is a hybrid formulation of [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] developed by [[Edward John Routh]]. Correspondingly, the '''Routhian''' is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] which replaces both the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] functions.

The Routhian, like the Hamiltonian, can be obtained from a [[Legendre transform]] of the Lagrangian, and has a similar mathematical form to the Hamiltonian, but is not exactly the same. The difference between the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Routhian functions are their variables. For a given set of [[generalized coordinates]] representing the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in the system, the Lagrangian is a function of the coordinates and velocities, while the Hamiltonian is a function of the coordinates and momenta.

The Routhian differs from these functions in that some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized velocities, the rest to have corresponding generalized momenta. This choice is arbitrary, and can be done to simplify the problem. It also has the consequence that the '''Routhian equations''' are exactly the Hamiltonian equations for some coordinates and corresponding momenta, and the Lagrangian equations for the rest of the coordinates and their velocities. In each case the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are replaced by a single function, the Routhian. The full set thus has the advantages of both sets of equations, with the convenience of splitting one set of coordinates to the Hamilton equations, and the rest to the Lagrangian equations.

Often the Routhian approach may offer no advantage, but one notable case where this is useful is when a system has [[cyclic coordinates]] (also called "ignorable coordinates"), by definition those coordinates which do not appear in the original Lagrangian. The Lagrangian equations are powerful results, used frequently in theory and practice, since the equations of motion in the coordinates are easy to set up. However, if cyclic coordinates occur there will still be equations to solve for all the coordinates, including the cyclic coordinates despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because coordinates and momenta are related together in the solutions - after solving the equations the coordinates and momenta must be eliminated from each other. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian equations are perfectly suited to cyclic coordinates because the equations in the cyclic coordinates trivially vanish, leaving only the equations in the non cyclic coordinates.

The Routhian approach has the best of both approaches, because cyclic coordinates can be split off to the Hamiltonian equations and eliminated, leaving behind the non cyclic coordinates to be solved from the Lagrangian equations. Overall fewer equations need to be solved compared to the Lagrangian approach.

As with the rest of analytical mechanics, Routhian mechanics is completely equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, all other formulations of classical mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems.

==Definitions==

In the case of Lagrangian mechanics, the [[generalized coordinates]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ... and the corresponding velocities {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dq''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ...}}, and possibly time&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The coordinates are functions of time, so the Lagrangian always has implicit time-dependence via the coordinates. If the Lagrangian changes with time irrespective of the coordinates, usually due to some time-dependent potential, then the Lagrangian is said to have "explicit" time-dependence. Similarly for the Hamiltonian and Routhian functions.&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''t''}}, enter the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt;L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1,\dot{q}_2,\ldots,t)\,, \quad \dot{q}_i = \frac{d q_i}{dt} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the overdots denote [[time derivative]]s.

In Hamiltonian mechanics, the generalized coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}} and the corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,}} and possibly time, enter the Hamiltonian,

:&lt;math&gt;H(q_1,q_2,\ldots,p_1,p_2,\ldots,t) = \sum_i \dot{q}_ip_i - L(q_1,q_2,\ldots,\dot{q}_1(p_1),\dot{q}_2(p_2),\ldots,t) \,, \quad p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equation is the definition of the generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} corresponding to the coordinate {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} ([[partial derivative]]s are denoted using {{math|∂}}). The velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are expressed as functions of their corresponding momenta by inverting their defining relation. In this context, {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is said to be the momentum "canonically conjugate" to {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The Routhian is intermediate between {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''H''}}; some coordinates {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are chosen to have corresponding generalized momenta {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the rest of the coordinates {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to have generalized velocities {{math|''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, and time may appear explicitly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where again the generalized velocity {{math|''dq''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt''}} is to be expressed as a function of generalized momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} via its defining relation. The choice of which {{math|''n''}} coordinates are to have corresponding momenta, out of the {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates, is arbitrary.

The above is used by [[course of theoretical physics|Landau and Lifshitz]], and [[Classical Mechanics (Goldstein book)|Goldstein]]. Some authors may define the Routhian to be the negative of the above definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the length of the general definition, a more compact notation is to use boldface for [[tuple]]s (or vectors) of the variables, thus {{math|'''q''' {{=}} (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''ζ''' {{=}} (''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''ζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, {{math|'''p''' {{=}} (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and {{math|''d'' '''ζ'''/''dt'' {{=}} (''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ''dζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'', ..., ''dζ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;R(\mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\zeta}, \mathbf{p}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}}, t) = \mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} - L(\mathbf{q}, \boldsymbol{\zeta}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, \dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}},t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where · is the [[dot product]] defined on the tuples, for the specific example appearing here:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\cdot\dot{{\mathbf{q}}} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Equations of motion==

For reference, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian equations]] for {{math|''s''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|''s''}} coupled second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_j} \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}, and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian equations]] for {{math|''n''}} degrees of freedom are a set of {{math|2''n''}} coupled first order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates and momenta

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Below, the Routhian equations of motion are obtained in two ways, in the process other useful derivatives are found that can be used elsewhere.

===Two degrees of freedom===

Consider the case of a system with two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''ζ''}}, with generalized velocities {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}, and the Lagrangian is time-dependent. (The generalization to any number of degrees of freedom follows exactly the same procedure as with two).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian of the system will have the form

:&lt;math&gt; L(q, \zeta, \dot{q}, \dot{\zeta}, t) &lt;/math&gt;

The [[differential of a function|differential]] of {{math|''L''}} is

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Now change variables, from the set ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''dq''/''dt''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}) to ({{math|''q''}}, {{math|''ζ''}}, {{math|''p''}}, {{math|''dζ''/''dt''}}), simply switching the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} to the momentum {{math|''p''}}. This change of variables in the differentials is the [[Legendre transformation]]. The differential of the new function to replace {{math|''L''}} will be a sum of differentials in {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}. Using the definition of generalized momentum and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate {{math|''q''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \,,\quad  \dot{p} = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; dL = \dot{p}dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + p d\dot{q} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt &lt;/math&gt;

and to replace {{math|''pd''(''dq''/''dt'')}} by {{math|(''dq''/''dt'')''dp''}}, recall the [[product rule]] for differentials,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For two functions {{math|''u''}} and {{math|''v''}}, the differential of the product is {{math|''d''(''uv'') {{=}} ''udv'' + ''vdu''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and substitute

:&lt;math&gt; pd\dot{q} = d(\dot{q} p) - \dot{q}dp &lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the differential of a new function in terms of the new set of variables:

:&lt;math&gt; d(L-p\dot{q}) = \dot{p} dq + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  - \dot{q} dp + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the Routhian

:&lt;math&gt; R(q,\zeta,p,\dot{\zeta},t) = p \dot{q}(p) - L &lt;/math&gt;

where again the velocity {{math|''dq''/''dt''}} is a function of the momentum {{math|''p''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt; dR = -\dot{p} dq - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta}d\zeta  + \dot{q}dp - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}dt\,, &lt;/math&gt;

but from the above definition, the differential of the Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt; dR = \frac{\partial R }{\partial q}dq + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \zeta}d\zeta + \frac{\partial R }{\partial p}dp + \frac{\partial R }{\partial \dot{\zeta}}d\dot{\zeta} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial t}dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the coefficients of the differentials {{math|''dq''}}, {{math|''dζ''}}, {{math|''dp''}}, {{math|''d''(''dζ''/''dt'')}}, and {{math|''dt''}}, the results are [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]] for the coordinate {{math|''q''}},

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{q} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p} \,,\quad \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Lagrange's equation]] for the coordinate {{math|''ζ''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta}  &lt;/math&gt;

which follow from

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta} \,,\quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and taking the total time derivative of the second equation and equating to the first. Notice the Routhian replaces the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions in all the equations of motion.

The remaining equation states the partial time derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} are negatives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial t}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Any number of degrees of freedom===

For {{math|''n'' + ''s''}} coordinates as defined above, with Routhian

:&lt;math&gt;R(q_1,\ldots,q_n,\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s, p_1, \ldots,p_n , \dot{\zeta}_1 , \ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dot{q}_i(p_i) - L&lt;/math&gt;

the equations of motion can be derived by a Legendre transformation of this Routhian as in the previous section, but another way is to simply take the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the coordinates {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, momenta {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, and {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, ..., ''s''}}. The derivatives are

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} = - \dot{p}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} = \dot{q}_i &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \zeta_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial t} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first two are identically the Hamiltonian equations. Equating the total time derivative of the fourth set of equations with the third (for each value of {{math|''j''}}) gives the Lagrangian equations. The fifth is just the same relation between time partial derivatives as before. To summarize&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{equation box 1
|indent = :
|background colour = white

|title = '''Routhian equations of motion''' (''n'' + ''s'' degrees of freedom)
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \dot{q}_i = \frac{\partial R}{\partial p_i} \,,\quad \dot{p}_i = -\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}  \,,  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;
}}

The total number of equations is {{math|2''n'' + ''s''}}, there are {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equations plus {{math|''s''}} Lagrange equations.

==Energy==

Since the Lagrangian has the same units as [[energy]], the units of the Routhian are also energy. In [[SI units]] this is the [[Joule]].

Taking the total time derivative of the Lagrangian leads to the general result

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = \frac{d }{d t}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If the Lagrangian is independent of time, the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, {{math|∂''L''/∂''t'' {{=}} 0}}, so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets must be a constant, it is the total energy of the system&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot{q}_i\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} - L\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(If there are external fields interacting with the constituents of the system, they can vary throughout space but not time). This expression requires the partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} with respect to ''all'' the velocities {{math|''dq&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} and {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}}. Under the same condition of {{math|''R''}} being time independent, the energy in terms of the Routhian is a little simpler, substituting the definition of {{math|''R''}} and the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}},

:&lt;math&gt;E = R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice only the partial derivatives of {{math|''R''}} with respect to the velocities {{math|''dζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt''}} are needed. In the case that {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} and the Routhian is explicitly time-independent, then {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R''}}, that is, the Routhian equals the energy of the system. The same expression for {{math|''R''}} in when {{math|''s'' {{=}} 0}} is also the Hamiltonian, so in all {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''R'' {{=}} ''H''}}.

If the Routhian has explicit time dependence, the total energy of the system is not constant. The general result is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = \dfrac{d}{dt}\left(R - \sum_{j=1}^s \dot{\zeta}_j\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} \right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which can be derived from the total time derivative of {{math|''R''}} in the same way as for {{math|''L''}}.

==Cyclic coordinates==

The Routhian formulation is useful for systems with [[cyclic coordinates]], because by definition those coordinates do not enter {{math|''L''}}, and hence {{math|''R''}}. The corresponding partial derivatives of {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} with respect to those coordinates are zero, which equates to the corresponding generalized momenta reducing to constants. To make this concrete, if the {{math|''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all cyclic coordinates, and the {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are all non cyclic, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}  = \dot{p}_i = - \frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_i = \alpha_i \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are constants. With these constants substituted into the Routhian, {{math|''R''}} is a function of only the non cyclic coordinates and velocities (and in general time also)

:&lt;math&gt;R(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i\dot{q}_i(\alpha_i) - L(\zeta_1,\ldots,\zeta_s,\dot{q}_1(\alpha_1),\ldots,\dot{q}_n(\alpha_n),\dot{\zeta}_1,\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s,t) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|2''n''}} Hamiltonian equation in the cyclic coordinates automatically vanishes,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i=\frac{\partial R}{\partial \alpha_i}=f_i( \zeta_1(t),\ldots,\zeta_s(t), \dot{\zeta}_1(t),\ldots,\dot{\zeta}_s(t), \alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n,t) \,,\quad \dot{p}_i=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_i}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''s''}} Lagrangian equations are in the non cyclic coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\zeta}_j} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \zeta_j} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the problem has been reduced to solving the Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates, with the advantage of the Hamiltonian equations cleanly removing the cyclic coordinates. Using those solutions, the equations for &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_i&lt;/math&gt;can be integrated to compute &lt;math&gt;q_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

If we are interested in how the cyclic coordinates change with time, the equations for the generalized velocities corresponding to the cyclic coordinates can be integrated.

==Examples==

The Routhian method does not guarantee the equations of motion will be simple, however it will lead to fewer equations.

=== Central potential in spherical coordinates ===

One general class of mechanical systems with cyclic coordinates are those with [[central potential]]s, because potentials of this form only have dependence on radial separations and no dependence on angles.

Consider a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} under the influence of a central potential {{math|''V''(''r'')}} in [[spherical polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2 + {r}^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2) - V(r) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice {{math|''φ''}} is cyclic, because it does not appear in the Lagrangian. The momentum conjugate to {{math|''φ''}} is the constant

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = mr^2\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant. The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r},\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi\dot{\phi} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2mr^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 - \frac{m}{2}r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + V(r) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} using Lagrange's equations, and do not need to solve for {{math|''φ''}} since it is eliminated by Hamiltonian's equations. The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad-m\ddot{r} = -\frac{p_\phi^2}{mr^3\sin^2\theta} - mr\dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -m(2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta}) = -\frac{p_\phi^2\cos\theta}{mr^2\sin^3\theta} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian approach has obtained two coupled nonlinear equations. By contrast the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations, mixing in the first and second time derivatives of {{math|''φ''}} in all of them, despite its absence from the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + mr\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi}^2 - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r^2\ddot{\theta} = r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2\,, &lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2r\dot{r}\sin^2\theta\dot{\phi} + 2r^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + r^2\sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetric mechanical systems===

====Spherical pendulum====

[[File:Spherical pendulum Lagrangian mechanics.svg|thumb|300px|Spherical pendulum: angles and velocities.]]

Consider the [[spherical pendulum]], a mass {{math|''m''}} (known as a "pendulum bob") attached to a rigid rod of length {{math|''l''}} of negligible mass, subject to a local gravitational field {{math|''g''}}. The system rotates with angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} which is ''not'' constant. The angle between the rod and vertical is {{math|''θ''}} and is ''not'' constant.

The Lagrangian is&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The potential energy is actually
:&lt;math&gt;V=mg\ell(1-\cos\theta)\,,&lt;/math&gt;
but since the first term is constant, it can be ignored in the Lagrangian (and Routhian) which only depend on derivatives of coordinates and velocities. Subtracting this from the kinetic energy means a plus sign in the Lagrangian, not minus.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\phi}) = \frac{m\ell^2}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \dot{\phi}^2) + mg\ell\cos\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''φ''}} is the cyclic coordinate for the system with constant momentum

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = m\ell^2\sin^2\theta \dot{\phi} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

which again is physically the angular momentum of the system about the vertical. The angle {{math|''θ''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}} vary with time, but the angular momentum is constant. The Routhian is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) &amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - L \\
&amp; = p_\phi \dot{\phi} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi \dot{\phi}}{2} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2  - mg\ell\cos\theta \\
&amp; = \frac{p_\phi^2 }{2m\ell^2\sin^2\theta} - \frac{m\ell^2}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - mg\ell\cos\theta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is found from the Lagrangian equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad - m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{p_\phi^2 \cos\theta}{m\ell^2\sin^3\theta} + mg\ell\sin\theta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or simplifying by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\phi^2}{m^2\ell^4}\,,\quad b = \frac{g}{\ell} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

gives

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = a\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta} - b \sin\theta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation resembles the simple nonlinear [[pendulum equation]], because it can swing through the vertical axis, with an additional term to account for the rotation about the vertical axis (the constant {{math|''a''}} is related to the angular momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}).

Applying the Lagrangian approach there are two nonlinear coupled equations to solve.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ell^2\ddot{\theta} = m\ell^2 \sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\phi}^2 -mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow\quad 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \dot{\theta}\dot{\phi} + \sin^2\theta \ddot{\phi}=0 \,. &lt;/math&gt;

====Heavy symmetrical top====

[[File:Heavy symmetric top euler angles.svg|thumb|Heavy symmetric top in terms of the Euler angles.]]

The heavy [[symmetrical top]] of mass {{math|''M''}} has Lagrangian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|2004|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\theta,\dot{\theta},\dot{\psi},\dot{\phi})=\frac{I_1}{2}(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2\theta) + \frac{I_3}{2}(\dot{\psi}^2+\dot{\phi}^2\cos^2\theta)+I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\cos\theta-Mg\ell\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ψ'', ''φ'', ''θ''}} are the [[Euler angles]], {{math|''θ''}} is the angle between the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis and the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''ψ''}} is the rotation of the top about its own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, and {{math|''φ''}} the azimuthal of the top's {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis around the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis. The principal [[moments of inertia]] are {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''x''&amp;prime;}} axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''y''&amp;prime;}} axes, and {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the top's own {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis. Since the top is symmetric about its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis, {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Here the simple relation for local [[gravitational potential energy]] {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''Mgl''cos''θ''}} is used where {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity, and the centre of mass of the top is a distance {{math|''l''}} from its tip along its {{math|''z''&amp;prime;}}-axis.

The angles {{math|''ψ'', ''φ''}} are cyclic. The constant momenta are the angular momenta of the top about its axis and its precession about the vertical, respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\psi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = I_3\dot{\psi} + I_3\dot{\phi} \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \dot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + I_3\dot{\psi}\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

From these, eliminating {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta = I_1\dot{\phi}\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\phi} = \frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and to eliminate {{math|''dφ''/''dt''}}, substitute this result into {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and solve for {{math|''dψ''/''dt''}} to find

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\psi} = \frac{p_\psi}{I_3} - \cos\theta \left(\frac{p_\phi - p_\psi\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^2\theta}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Routhian can be taken to be

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta,\dot{\theta}) = p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi} - L = \frac{1}{2}(p_\psi\dot{\psi} + p_\phi\dot{\phi}) - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

and since

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p_\phi\dot{\phi}}{2} = \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\,, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_\psi \dot{\psi}}{2} = \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta  }{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;R =  \frac{p_\psi^2}{2I_3} + \frac{p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi\cos\theta}{4I_1\sin^2\theta} - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The first term is constant, and can be ignored since only the derivatives of ''R'' will enter the equations of motion. The simplified Routhian, without loss of information, is thus

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] - \frac{I_1 \dot{\theta}^2}{2} + Mg\ell \cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of motion for {{math|''θ''}} is, by direct calculation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial \theta} \quad \Rightarrow \quad &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-I_1\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{\cos\theta}{I_1\sin^3\theta}\left[p_\psi^2 \cos^2\theta + p_\phi^2 - \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \cos\theta\right] + \frac{1}{2I_1\sin^2\theta} \left[-2 p_\psi^2 \cos\theta\sin\theta + \frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2} \sin\theta\right] -Mg\ell\sin\theta \,, &lt;/math&gt;

or by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_\psi^2}{I_1^2} \,,\quad b = \frac{p_\phi^2}{I_1^2}\,,\quad c=\frac{p_\psi p_\phi}{2 I_1^2}\,,\quad k= \frac{Mg\ell}{I_1}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

a simpler form of the equation is obtained

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta} = \frac{\cos\theta}{\sin^3\theta}( a\cos^2\theta +b -c\cos\theta ) + \frac{1}{2\sin\theta} (2 a \cos\theta - c) + k\sin\theta \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Although the equation is highly nonlinear, there is only one equation to solve for, it was obtained directly, and the cyclic coordinates are not involved.

By contrast, the Lagrangian approach leads to ''three'' nonlinear coupled equations to solve, despite the absence of the coordinates {{math|''ψ''}} and {{math|''φ''}} in the Lagrangian.

The {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow \quad I_1\ddot{\theta} = (I_1- I_3)\dot{\phi}^2\sin\theta\cos\theta -I_3\dot{\psi}\dot{\phi}\sin\theta +Mg\ell\sin\theta\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''ψ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\psi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \psi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad  \ddot{\psi} +  \ddot{\phi}\cos\theta - \dot{\phi}\dot{\theta}\sin\theta= 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''φ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \quad\Rightarrow \quad \ddot{\phi}(I_1\sin^2\theta + I_3\cos^2\theta) + \dot{\phi}(I_1 - I_3)2\sin\theta\cos\theta\dot{\theta} + I_3\ddot{\psi}\cos\theta - I_3\dot{\psi}\sin\theta\dot{\theta} =0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Velocity-dependent potentials ===

==== Classical charged particle in a uniform magnetic field ====
[[File:Charged particle in uniform B field.svg|thumb|300px|Classical charged particle in uniform '''B''' field, using cylindrical coordinates. '''Top:''' If the radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} vary, the trajectory is a helicoid with varying radius but uniform motion in the {{math|''z''}} direction. '''Bottom:''' Constant {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} means a helicoid with constant radius.]]

Consider a classical [[charged particle]] of mass {{math|''m''}} and [[electric charge]] {{math|''q''}} in a static (time-independent) uniform (constant throughout space) [[magnetic field]] {{math|'''B'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble|Berkshire|2004|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lagrangian for a charged particle in a general [[electromagnetic field]] given by the [[magnetic potential]] {{math|'''A'''}} and [[electric potential]] {{math|''φ''}} is

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{m}{2} \dot{\mathbf{r}}^2 - q \phi + q \dot{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to use [[cylindrical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'', ''z'')}}, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{v} = (v_r, v_\theta,v_z) = (\dot{r},r\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) \,, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = (B_r,B_\theta,B_z) = (0,0,B)\,. &lt;/math&gt;

In this case the electric potential is zero, {{math|''φ'' {{=}} 0}}, and we can choose the axial gauge for the magnetic potential

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{B}\times\mathbf{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{A} = (A_r,A_\theta,A_z) = (0,Br/2,0)\,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the Lagrangian is

:&lt;math&gt;L(r,\dot{r},\dot{\theta},\dot{z}) = \frac{m}{2} (\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{z}^2) + \frac{qB r^2\dot{\theta}}{2} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice this potential has an effectively cylindrical symmetry (although it also has angular velocity dependence), since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an imaginary cylinder axis.

There are two cyclic coordinates, {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}}. The canonical momenta conjugate to {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} are the constants

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\theta} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {\theta}} = mr^2\dot {\theta} + \frac{qBr^2}{2}  \,,\quad p_z = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot {z}} = m\dot{z} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

so the velocities are

:&lt;math&gt;\dot {\theta} = \frac{1}{mr^2}\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2}\right) \,,\quad \dot{z} = \frac{p_z}{m}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The angular momentum about the ''z'' axis is ''not'' {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, but the quantity {{math|''mr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''dθ''/''dt''}}, which is not conserved due to the contribution from the magnetic field. The canonical momentum {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the conserved quantity. It is still the case that {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the linear or translational momentum along the ''z'' axis, which is also conserved.

The radial component {{math|''r''}} and angular velocity {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} can vary with time, but {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant, and since {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is constant it follows {{math|''dz''/''dt''}} is constant. The Routhian can take the form

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R(r,\dot{r}) &amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - L \\
&amp; = p_{\theta}\dot{\theta}+p_z\dot{z} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 - \frac{p_\theta\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}qBr^2\dot{\theta} \\ 
&amp; =  (p_\theta - qBr^2 )\frac{\dot{\theta}}{2} - \frac{m}{2}\dot r^2 + \frac{p_z\dot{z}}{2} \\ 
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta - qBr^2 \right)\left(p_\theta - \frac{qBr^2}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2 + \frac{p_z^2}{2m} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{2mr^2} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2r^4}{2} \right) - \frac{m}{2}\dot{r}^2  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where in the last line, the {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/2''m''}} term is a constant and can be ignored without loss of continuity. The Hamiltonian equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} automatically vanish and do not need to be solved for. The Lagrangian equation in {{math|''r''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial R}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} &lt;/math&gt;

is by direct calculation

:&lt;math&gt;-m\ddot{r} = \frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{-2}{r^3} \left(p_\theta^2 - \frac{3}{2}qBr^2  + \frac{(qB)^2 r^4}{2} \right) + \frac{1}{r^2}(- 3qBr + 2(qB)^2r^3)\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which after collecting terms is

:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{r}=\frac{1}{2m}\left[\frac{2p_{\theta}^2}{r^3}-(qB)^2 r\right] \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and simplifying further by introducing the constants

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{p_{\theta}^2}{m^2} \,,\quad b = - \frac{(qB)^2}{2m^2} \,, &lt;/math&gt;

the differential equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{r} = \frac{a}{r^3} + br  &lt;/math&gt;

To see how {{math|''z''}} changes with time, integrate the momenta expression for {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} above

:&lt;math&gt; z = \frac{p_z}{m}t + c_z \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is an arbitrary constant, the initial value of {{math|''z''}} to be specified in the [[initial conditions]].

The motion of the particle in this system is [[helicoid]]al, with the axial motion uniform (constant) but the radial and angular components varying in a spiral according to the equation of motion derived above. The initial conditions on {{math|''r''}}, {{math|''dr''/''dt''}}, {{math|''θ''}}, {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}}, will determine if the trajectory of the particle has a constant {{math|''r''}} or varying {{math|''r''}}. If initially {{math|''r''}} is nonzero but {{math|''dr''/''dt'' {{=}} 0}}, while {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} are arbitrary, then the initial velocity of the particle has no radial component, {{math|''r''}} is constant, so the motion will be in a perfect helix. If ''r'' is constant, the angular velocity is also constant according to the conserved {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

With the Lagrangian approach, the equation for {{math|''r''}} would include {{math|''dθ''/''dt''}} which has to be eliminated, and there would be equations for {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''z''}} to solve for.

The {{math|''r''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{r} = mr\dot{\theta}^2 + qBr\dot{\theta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the {{math|''θ''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m(2r\dot{r}\dot {\theta} + r^2\ddot {\theta}) + qBr\dot{r} = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the {{math|''z''}} equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{z}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z} \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{z} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''z''}} equation is trivial to integrate, but the {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''θ''}} equations are not, in any case the time derivatives are mixed in all the equations and must be eliminated.

'''Self-expression values''' are part of a [[Value system|core value]] dimension in the [[modernization]] process.&lt;ref name="Inglehart97"&gt;{{cite book|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|year=1997|title=Modernization and  Postmodernization:  Cultural,  Economic,  and  Political Change  in  43  Societies|location=[[Princeton, New Jersey]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|authorlink=Ronald Inglehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-expression is a cluster of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] that include social toleration, [[life satisfaction]], [[public expression]] and an aspiration to liberty. [[Ronald Inglehart]], the [[University of Michigan]] professor who developed the theory of [[post-materialism]], has worked extensively with this concept. On the [[World Values Survey#Results|Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map]] ''self-expression values'' are contrasted with ''survival values'', illustrating the changes in values across countries and generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org|title=World Values Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the world is moving towards self-expression values  was discussed at length in an article in [[the Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/1511812 ''American Values: Living with a superpower''] January 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Self expression is to say something that you truly believe is important in a form of communication, such as art, speech and dance. It is to reveal yourself in a way that is special to yourself. 

==Emergence of self-expression values==
The emergence of the [[post-industrial society]] has brought about a wave of cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|title=The silent revolution in Europe: Intergenerational change in postindustrial societies|journal=[[American Political Science Review]]|year=1971|volume=65|pages=991–1017|authorlink=Ronald Inglehart|doi=10.2307/1953494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], and a growing share of [[East Asia]], a majority of the people are no longer employed in factories, but work in the [[service sector]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] | title = Field Listing: Labor force – by occupation | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html| accessdate = 23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a shift from a mechanical environment to one where ever more people spend their days dealing with other people, symbols, and [[information]], which means that workers in the knowledge sector must exercise their own judgment and choice.

This shift has had major consequences:
* Unprecedentedly high levels of prosperity and welfare states that make food, clothing, shelter, housing, education and health service available to almost everyone. Even in the United States, where the [[welfare state]] is relatively limited, a significant portion of the [[GDP]] is redistributed through the state. This makes physical survival, a minimum living standard, and an average life expectancy of nearly 80 years to be taken for granted by people living in the respective societies, which encourages people to focus on goals beyond immediate survival.
* Modern service jobs increasingly require use of [[cognitive skill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Florida|first=Richard|year=2002|title=The Rise of the Creative Class|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|authorlink=Richard Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers, teachers, lawyers, accountants, counselors, programmers and analysts all belong to the [[creative class]]. These workers have high autonomy in their work, even if they sometimes continue to work in hierarchical organizations. The need for cognitive skills is dramatically larger than in societies in the early stages of industrialization. To meet these needs, the labor forces of post-industrial societies increasingly pursue higher education, emphasizing creativity, imagination and intellectual independence. 
* Post-industrial societies are socially liberating compared to their predecessors. The centrally controlled, highly regimented workforces of the industrial world are gone, as are the strong [[conformity]] pressures that accompanied them. The traditional system—in which children's survival depended on their parents' providing for them, in return for which the children would take care of the parents in old age—has been undermined by the welfare state. As a result, close-knit family structures, once a necessity for survival, become increasingly a matter of choice, replacing "communities of necessity" with "elective affinities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|year=2002|chapter=Losing the Traditional: Individualization and Precarious Freedoms|title=Individualization|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|pages=1–21|authorlink=Ulrich Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destandardization of economic activities and social life diminishes social constraints in unprecedented ways. The shift in post-industrial societies is thus one of emancipation from authority.&lt;ref name="Inglehart05"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | lastauthoramp = yes | title = Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = New York | year = 2005 | ISBN = 9780521846950 | author2link=Christian Welzel}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-expression values and democracy==
[[Industrialization]] can lead to [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[theocracy]] or [[democracy]]. But post-industrial society brings socio-cultural changes that make truly effective democracy increasingly probable.

[[Knowledge society|Knowledge societies]] cannot function effectively without highly educated workers, who become articulate and accustomed to thinking for themselves. Furthermore, rising levels of economic security bring growing emphasis on self-expression values that give high priority to free choice. Mass publics become increasingly likely to want democracy, and increasingly effective in getting it. Repressing mass demands for liberalization becomes increasingly costly and detrimental to economic effectiveness. These changes link economic development with democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | title = Changing Mass Priorities: The Link between Modernization and Democracy | journal = Perspectives on Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 551–567 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1017/S1537592710001258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical measurements of self-expression values==
The most thorough assessment of self-expression values is carried out in the [[World Values Survey]]. Five "[[World Values Survey#History|waves]]" have been conducted so far, each adding additional countries to the survey.

Subsequent [[data analysis]] by Inglehart revealed that a large percentage in the variability in the data could be explained by using a set of measures that tapped just two dimensions: a traditional to secular-rational axis, and a survival to self-expression axis. The factor scores were originally based on 22 variables,&lt;ref name="Inglehart97" /&gt; but this was reduced to  only 10 (5 for each dimension) for the purposes of data availability.

The self-expression axis has the following [[factor loadings]].&lt;ref name="Inglehart05" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  Survey question
!  Factor loading
|-
|  Respondent gives priority to self-expression and quality of life over economic and physical security

|-
|  Respondent describes self as very happy

|-
|  Respondent has signed or would sign a petition
|  0.74
|-
|  Respondent does not think one has to be very careful about trusting people
|  0.46
|}

Despite comprising only five variables, the correlates for this dimension across the WV survey are very strong. Below is a partial list.&lt;ref name="Inglehart05" /&gt; Positive answers indicate survival values, the opposite of self-expression values.

'''T-vertices''' is a term used in [[computer graphics]] to describe a problem that can occur during [[Subdivision surface|mesh refinement]] or [[mesh simplification]].  The most common case occurs in naive implementations of continuous [[level of detail]], where a finer-level mesh is "sewn" together with a coarser-level mesh by simply aligning the finer vertices on the edges of the course [[polygons]].  The result is a continuous mesh, however due to the nature of the [[z-buffer]] and certain lighting [[algorithms]] such as [[Gouraud shading]], visual [[Digital artifact|artifacts]] can often be detected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr98/cs598d/lectures/alejo/ Frequent Mesh Problems, www.cs.princeton.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Example of T-vertices in Blender after applying a subdivision modifier.png|thumb|T-vertices after applying a subdivision modifier. The T-vertices result in cracks in the model because subdivision surfaces only work for meshes with correct topology.]]
Some modeling algorithms such as [[subdivision surface]]s will fail when a model contains T-vertices.

==Affiliation==
The Chicago School of Professional Psychology is an affiliate of the nonprofit TCS Education System (TCS ES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tcsedsystem.edu/our-institutions/ | publisher= TCS Education System| title= Our Institutions| accessdate= 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Chicago School of Professional Psychology was established by practicing psychologists with the goal of providing high-quality professional psychology training in a not-for-profit setting. Initial plans for the school were made in 1977 and realized in January 1979 by the nonprofit Midwestern Psychology Development Foundation. The Chicago School of Professional Psychology began its first classes at temporary quarters located at 30 West Chicago Avenue before moving to the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)|Fine Arts Building]] on Michigan Avenue in 1980. In 1986 The Chicago School moved to its next location, the historic [[Dearborn Station]] in Chicago’s South Loop. In 2004, the school found a new downtown home at 325 N. Wells Street. From its early days the school began to earn a reputation for being a leader in diversity and multicultural training.{{citation needed | date = January 2016}} Classes such as Cultural Issues in Assessment and Intercultural Psychotherapy Laboratory began to appear in the school’s bulletin in the 1980s.{{citation needed | date = August 2018}} In 1988, the school opened its first institute for diversity-related training, research, and events: the Center for Inter-Cultural Clinical Psychology. One of its original initiatives was a Cultural Impact Conference, which remains an annual fixture on campus. The center eventually evolved in 2005 to become the Center for Multicultural and Diversity Studies. The Chicago School’s innovative approach to diversity received recognition in 1998 with an Institutional Diversity Award bestowed by the [[National Council of Schools and Programs of Professional Psychology]] (NCSPP). NCSPP would again honor the school in 2005 with its Advocacy Award “in recognition of its outstanding commitment to advancing the attitude, skills, and knowledge of professional advocacy and public policy.”{{citation needed | date = January 2016}}

The school expanded to the west coast with three campuses in Southern California. The first out-of-state location was opened in downtown Los Angeles in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref name="newcampus"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2008/03/31/news/news_briefs/at02.txt | title = Psychology Campus Coming Downtown | work= Los Angeles Downtown News | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school announced a formal affiliation with the [[California Graduate Institute]] and its campuses in Westwood and Irvine in the fall of 2008.&lt;ref name="TCS-CGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechicagoschool.edu/content.cfm/detailed_news?NewsID=502940|title=The Chicago School Unites with CGI, Expands Number of Southern Cal Campuses|publisher=The Chicago School of Professional Psychology|accessdate=2008-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213090437/http://thechicagoschool.edu/content.cfm/detailed_news?NewsID=502940|archivedate=2009-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having developed from the psychoanalytically oriented clinical training at CGI, the Westwood campus maintained the psychoanalytic training model of its predecessor until it closed in the summer of 2014. CGI has now formally been incorporated into the Applied Clinical Psychology doctoral (PsyD) program where graduates obtain a specialization in psychoanalytic psychotherapy under the guidance of faculty from local psychoanalytic institutes and training clinics.&lt;ref name="TCSPP-ACP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thechicagoschool.edu/los-angeles/programs/psyd-applied-clinical-psychology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
'''East Coast'''

* '''Washington, D.C., Campus''': The Chicago School's east coast campus in Washington, D.C., opened in summer 2010 three blocks from the White House at McPherson Square.

'''South'''
* '''New Orleans, Campus''' The Chicago School at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans is located on the campus of Xavier University, a historically black university in Louisiana.

'''Midwest'''

* '''Chicago Campus''': [[File:Chicago-school-building.JPG|thumb|Downtown Chicago location]] The Chicago School’s downtown campus is located at 325 North Wells St. Chicago, IL 60654 - in Chicago’s River North neighborhood. The building itself opened in 1914 as a Chase and Sanborn Coffee warehouse and is one of the few remaining relics on the Chicago River of the city’s industrial era. The school expanded in early 2007 with new space opening across the street in the Merchandise Mart.

'''West Coast'''

* '''Irvine Campus''':In addition to Los Angeles campus, The Chicago School's affiliation with CGI&lt;ref name="TCS-CGI"/&gt; also incorporates a campus in Irvine, California. The California Graduate Institute of The Chicago School, at Irvine, is located next to UC Irvine.
* '''Los Angeles Campus''': Located at 617 W. 7th St., the L.A. Campus site is located four blocks north of the [[Staples Center]], near Pasadena, Santa Ana, and Santa Monica freeways, and one block from the 7th Street Metro Center. 
** '''Los Angeles Campus Lawsuit''':  The lawsuit, which was filed by students enrolled in the inaugural 2008 clinical psychology doctoral cohort at the Los Angeles campus, alleged that students were misled and deceived by the school into attending a doctoral program that was not accredited by the American Psychological Association. Students claim that they were offered admission to the Los Angeles campus after applying to the APA accredited Chicago campus doctoral program, while the school knowingly "downplayed" the fact that the Los Angeles campus had no clear path towards accreditation at the time that admission was offered. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-chicago-school-of-psychology-accreditation-20140723-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students subsequently filed a class-action lawsuit in 2014. In September 2016, the court found that students were not properly apprised as to the accreditation differences between the Chicago and the Los Angeles campus programs. The Chicago School settled the lawsuit for 11.2 million dollars. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bigclassaction.com/settlement/students-win-11-2m-settlement-in-chicago-school-of.php&lt;/ref&gt;The Los Angeles campus Clinical Psychology PsyD program obtained APA accreditation in 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1157">'''Toxic capacity''' can mean the [[toxicity]] of a substance, possibly in relation to a specific [[organism]] and '''toxic capacity''' can mean the capacity of an organism, organic system or [[ecosystem]] to contain a toxic substance or a selection of toxic substances (a compound) without showing signs of poisoning or dying.

==Toxic capacity among humans, children==
Generally people with less mass have a lower toxic capacity than people with larger mass.  In particular, children (who have lower mass compared to an adult) are more vulnerable to toxic effects of compounds.  The compounds do not have to be poisons but could be medications as well, which is why children's dosages are almost always less than those of an adult, and the overdose danger higher for children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18691">'''Triple accreditation''' (or '''Triple Crown accreditation''') is the combination of [[Accreditation|accreditations]] awarded to 89 business schools worldwide as of May 2018 (up from 74 in May 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.today/guide/triple-accreditation-business-schools|title=Triple accredited business schools (AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS)|publisher=MBA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the three largest and most influential business school accreditation organizations:

* [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]] - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[United States]])
* [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] - The Association of MBAs ([[United Kingdom]])
* [[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]] - EFMD Quality Improvement System ([[European Union]])

Of the 13,670 schools offering business degree programs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]. Oct 15th 2011.  [http://www.economist.com/node/21532269 "Is time running out for business schools that aren’t quite elite?"]&lt;/ref&gt; only 90 have triple accreditation as of August 2018.

A major reason for the small number of triple-accredited institutions in the world is the requirement of the [[Association of MBAs]] that AMBA-accredited business schools should only admit MBA applicants with at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/-/media/files/accreditation/mba-criteria-for-accreditation.ashx?la=en|title=MBA Accreditation Criteria 2016|author=AMBA|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts{{who|date=February 2018}} claim that most top [[United States|US]] [[business school]]s cannot meet this criterion as they sometimes (though rarely) admit applicants with only a [[bachelor]]'s degree and little or no work experience. They claim that it is why triple-crown accreditation is pursued primarily by European institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools| doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not the case when some (former) triple accredited institutes, [[City University of Hong Kong]] for example, only require applicants having "relevant work experience is desirable (though not specifically required)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/mba/admissions/requirements/|title=MBA Admissions Requirements, City University of Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences in accreditation ==

Each of the three institutions assesses a business school according to different criteria and scope:&lt;ref&gt;AACSB Standards http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/standards.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AMBA Criteria http://www.mbaworld.com/accreditationcriteria&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EQUIS Standards and Criteria http://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/equis-guides&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scope of business school accreditation for the three main global accrediting bodies AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.png|thumb|right|400px|Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA]]

*Scope of accreditation
:AACSB has the broadest scope, as it accredits management and accounting programs at the entire university (e.g. management programs at the business school and the school of engineering) and grants university-wide accreditation.
:AMBA has the most focused scope as it accredits only the business school's portfolios of [[MBA]] programs (full-time, part-time, executive, distance-learning), [[Master of Business and Management|MBM]] programs (including [[MSc]] International Management) and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] (also known as DMgt in China).
:EQUIS's scope ranks in the middle, as it accredits the business school but not the university and not specific portfolios of programs.
*Duration of the accreditation process
:AACSB: 2–7 years
:AMBA: 9–18 months
:EQUIS: 2–3 years
*Reaccreditation
:AACSB: full re-accreditation every 5 or 10 years (the 10-year accreditation is being phased out)
:AMBA: full re-accreditation every 3 or 5 years (1-year accreditation is a possible outcome of reaccreditation in exceptional circumstances)
:EQUIS: full re-accreditation every 3 or 5 years
*School audit team
:AACSB's peer review team includes deans and business school administrators.
:AMBA's assessment team includes deans, associate deans, program directors and one AMBA representative.
:EQUIS's team includes three deans and one corporate representative.
*Evaluation report content
:AACSB's report reflects compliance with the AACSB standards
:AMBA's report includes compliance with criteria, conditions and recommendations
:EQUIS's report reflects compliance with the EQUIS standards
*Criteria/Standards size
:AACSB: 77 pages for Business Accreditation; 36 pages for Accounting Accreditation
:AMBA: 24 pages (9 pages for MBA; 9 pages for MBM; 6 pages for DBA)
:EQUIS: 71 pages
*Quantitative vs Qualitative
:AACSB has more quantitative criteria (checklists)
:AMBA has more qualitative criteria
:EQUIS is in the middle (between AACSB and AMBA)
*Internationalization
:AACSB conducts the evaluation against the school's own mission, so AACSB has no internationalization requirement unless internationalization is part of the school's mission.
:AMBA has internationalization criteria for research, curriculum and student enrolment. However, these are reviewed in a regional context for less internationalized regions (e.g. Latin America and Russia).
:EQUIS has strict requirements on internationalization.
*Faculty numbers
:AACSB: prescribed faculty ratios (AQ/PQ ratio)
:AMBA: no prescribed faculty-to-students ratio
:EQUIS: prescribed minimum numbers of faculty

*Visiting faculty
:AACSB disapproves of heavy use of visiting faculty.
:AMBA allows the visiting faculty model, as long as the visiting faculty are managed by the core faculty (and as long as the quality and course content is monitored).
:EQUIS disapproves of heavy use of visiting faculty.
*Research
:AACSB requires research in line with the mission of the school.
:AMBA requires research and publications in international refereed journals or proof of impactful research at national level.
:EQUIS requires research with an international dimension.
*Program-specific criteria
*:AACSB has no program-specific standards since it evaluates the entire university.
*:AMBA has program-specific criteria such as:
** at least 3 years of full-time work experience for all admitted MBA students;
** at least 500 contact hours (scheduled class hours) for a full-time MBA curriculum and a minimum of 120 contact hours for a distance-learning MBA;
** at least 20 students enrolled in an MBA program;
*:EQUIS has some program-specific standards in the context of the evaluation of the entire business school.

== Top schools without triple accreditation ==


One reason for this is that a (small) number of top business schools choose not to allocated the work resource and incur the financial cost required for international accreditation and rely only on accreditation by their national accrediting body (usually the country's education ministry).

Another reason is that the top schools in some regions do not meet one or more of the detailed criteria of the accrediting institutions and choose not to amend their policy. Notable examples are some top US business schools: [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford GSB]], [[Columbia Business School]], [[Chicago Booth]], [http://www.tuck.edu Tuck School of Business], etc., which do not meet [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]]'s mandatory three-year student-work-experience requirement for all MBA students.

A third reason is that most of the 509 schools that have obtained AACSB accreditation in the US and Canada (either via the standard accreditation process or via the granting of accreditation based on their reputation as top schools) do not look outside of North America for further validation, such as through European or British accreditation.

The '''Faculty of Mathematics''' is one of six faculties of the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], offering over 500 courses in [[mathematics]], [[statistics]] and [[computer science]]. The Faculty also houses the [[David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science]], formerly the Faculty's computer science department.

==History==
The Faculty was founded on January 1, 1967, a successor to the University of Waterloo's Department of Mathematics, which had grown to be the largest department in the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Arts|Faculty of Arts]] under the chairmanship of [[Ralph Gordon Stanton|Ralph Stanton]] (and included such influential professors as [[W. T. Tutte]]).{{r|history}} Initially located in the Physics building, the Faculty was moved in May 1968 into the newly constructed Mathematics and Computing (MC) Building. Inspired by Stanton's famously gaudy ties, the students draped a large pink tie over the MC Building on the occasion of its opening, which later became a symbol of the Faculty.&lt;ref name=pinktie&gt;{{cite web|title=Legend of the Pink Tie|url=https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/About/pinktie.shtml|date=17 August 2011|website=Faculty of Mathematics|publisher=University of Waterloo|access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its founding, the Faculty included five departments: [[Computer science|Applied Analysis and Computer Science]], [[Applied Mathematics]], [[Combinatorics|Combinatorics and Optimization]], [[Pure Mathematics]], and [[Statistics]]. In 1975 the Department of Applied Analysis and Computer Science became simply the Department of Computer Science; in 2005 it became the [[David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science]]. The Statistics Department also was later renamed the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science.{{r|history}}

The Faculty of Mathematics finished construction of a third building, Mathematics 3 (M3), in 2011. It now houses the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science and a large lecture hall.

==Academics==
===Degrees===
The Faculty of Mathematics grants the [[Bachelor of Mathematics|BMath]] (Bachelor of Mathematics) degree for most of its undergraduate programs. Computer Science undergraduates can generally choose between graduating with a BMath or a [[Bachelor of Computer Science|BCS]] (Bachelor of Computer Science) degree. The former requires more coursework in mathematics. Specialized degrees exist for the [[Software Engineering]] program (the [[Bachelor of Software Engineering|BSE]], or Bachelor of Software Engineering) and Computing and Financial Management ([[Bachelor of Computing|BCFM]], or Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management). Postgraduate students are generally awarded an [[Master of Mathematics|MMath]] (Master of Mathematics) or [[PhD]].

===Rankings===
In the 2018 [[QS World University Rankings]], the University of Waterloo was ranked 39th globally for Mathematics (and 3rd in Canada) and 31st globally for Computer Science (and 2nd in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/mathematics|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2018: Mathematics|website=[[QS World University Rankings]]|access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/computer-science-information-systems|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2018: Computer Science &amp; Informational Systems|website=[[QS World University Rankings]]|access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University was ranked third in Canada for Mathematics and second in Canada for Computer Science in 2018 by the [[Maclean's|Maclean's University Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best mathematics universities in Canada: 2018 rankings|date=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[Maclean's]]|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-mathematics-universities-in-canada-2018-rankings/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best computer science universities in Canada: 2018 ranking|date=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[Maclean's]]|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-computer-science-universities-in-canada-2018-ranking/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
[[Image:UW-MathFaculty-PinkTie.jpg|230px|thumb|right|The Pink Tie]]
Students in the Faculty of Mathematics are represented by the Mathematics Society (MathSoc), which represents student interests to the university, operates the Math Coffee and Donut Shop, publishes the Faculty newspaper ''mathNEWS'', and runs student services including an exam bank and lounge space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MathSoc Services|url=http://mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca/Services|website=University of Waterloo Mathematics Society|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pi Day]] is celebrated by the Department in each term: on 14 March (3/14), on 22 July (22/7, [[Pi Approximation Day]]), and on 10 November (the 314th day of the year). Typical activities include throwing pie at MathSoc executives and/or popular professors, viewing mathematics-related films, competing in [[pi]] recitation contests, and eating pie (on 22/7, cake is served instead, which is approximately pie).

===Tie Guard===
A yearly tradition at the University of Waterloo, a group of senior math students volunteer for the position of Tie Guard each year, and are selected by the [[University of Waterloo Federation of Students]] representatives from the Faculty of Mathematics. It is expected that the appointed Tie Guard volunteers will be on hand 24 hours a day for the duration of the orientation week, to guard the Faculty's mascot (a 40 foot pink tie which hangs off the side of the building) and to provide [[first aid]] and information to incoming students.{{r|pinktie}}

The Tie Guard was founded in 1994 after several previous attempts on the Pink Tie resulted in both damaged mascots and injuries to students, the most notorious of which was the Tie Liberation Organization (TLO) kidnapping in 1988. In more recent years the tie guard has expanded and now several students are appointed to the Tie Guard each year. A new pink tie was draped over the Mathematics 3 Building in 2011.

These commonly used descriptive terms do not necessarily use the official or current names for features; and often these concepts of places don't have clear, rigid boundaries. For example, sometimes the same name may refer to more than one feature, and sometimes people in a locality use more than one name for the same feature. When people refer to geographical regions in a vernacular form they are commonly referred to as imprecise regions. Regions can include large areas of a country such as the American Midwest, the British Midlands, the Swiss Alps, the south east of England and southern California; or smaller areas such as Silicon Valley in northern California. Commonly used descriptions of areas of cities such as a city's downtown district, New York's Upper East Side, London's square mile or the Latin Quarter of Paris can also be viewed as imprecise regions.

==Vernacular region==
Beyond "vernacular geography," a "vernacular region" is a distinctive area where the inhabitants collectively consider themselves interconnected by a shared history, mutual interests, and a common identity. Such regions are "intellectual inventions" and a form of shorthand to identify things, people, and places. Vernacular regions reflect a "sense of place," but rarely coincide with established jurisdictional borders.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"&gt;[Scheetz, George H.] "Whence Siouxland?" ''Book Remarks'' [Sioux City Public Library], May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of vernacular regions in the United States include Tidewater, also known as [[Hampton Roads]], [[Siouxland]], and the [[Tri-Cities, Illinois|Tri-City area]] of Batavia, Geneva, and St. Charles, Illinois. Another can be the American South, since it can be non-officially considered as the confederate states of the U.S. Civil war, where the climate is warm and has limited snow, or by being below a certain latitude.

==Research==
The [[World Wide Web]] is a major source of geographical information submitted by non-specialists. The British [[Ordnance Survey]] is sponsoring research at the Universities of Cardiff and Sheffield,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the aim of which is to study the use of vernacular geography, and to investigate how information mined from the Web can be used to generate an approximate spatial boundary for an imprecise region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4512/1/CEUS2006.pdf|title=Geo-tagging for imprecise regions of different sizes|author=Pasley, R.C., Clough, P. and Sanderson, M.|year=2007|work=Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Geographical Information Retrieval. Workshop On Geographic Information Retrieval, November 09, 2007, Lisbon, Portugal.|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The existing technology for accessing geographical data is not well adapted to the unstructured, largely text-based resources of the Web. Spatial information on the Web can be categorized geographically according to the textual content, but a major problem for GIS developers wanting to use this resource is the vague and imprecise nature of place names that are commonly employed within web documents.

In pursuit of delineating vernacular regions, trigger phrases are used by the researchers to capture regular linguistic patterns, which identify relationships between geographic locations. For example, the trigger phrase ''“X is located in Y”'' can be ''"Birmingham is located in *"'' or ''"* is located in Birmingham"''. The completed trigger phrase is then submitted to a search engine. For each search, up to 100 results are retrieved. Duplicate results are then removed based on the URL, and snippet text and the search result is used to find candidate region members.

From these results, geo-references are extracted and assigned spatial coordinates. A bounding box is then applied and the bounding box is used to find coordinates of other regions and points, apparently lying outside the candidate region. Thus it is possible to compute a boundary for the imprecise region using the points inside and outside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Vitrified forts''' are stone enclosures whose walls have been subjected to [[vitrification]] through heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brigantesnation.com/VitrifiedForts/VitrifieedForts.htm |title=Vitrification of Hill Forts |accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was long thought that these structures were unique to Scotland, but they have since been identified in several other parts of western and northern Europe.

Vitrified forts are generally situated on hills offering strong defensive positions. Their form seems to have been determined by the contour of the flat summits which they enclose. The walls vary in size, a few being upwards of {{convert|12|ft}} high, and are so broad that they present the appearance of [[levee|embankments]]. Weak parts of the defence are strengthened by double or triple walls, and occasionally vast lines of [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]], composed of large blocks of unhewn and unvitrified stones, envelop the vitrified centre at some distance from it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vitrified Forts |volume=28 |pages=149–150 |first=Robert |last=Munro |authorlink=Robert Munro (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls themselves are termed vitrified ramparts.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, Timothy (2008). ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology'', 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, p. 376. {{ISBN|978-0-19-953404-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[cement]] has been found in any of these structures, all of them presenting the peculiarity of being more or less consolidated by the fusion of the rocks of which they are built. This fusion, which has been caused by the application of intense heat, is not equally complete in the various forts, or even in the walls of the same fort. In some cases the stones are only partially melted and [[calcined]]; in others their adjoining edges are fused so that they are firmly cemented together; in many instances pieces of rock are enveloped in a glassy enamel-like coating which binds them into a uniform whole; and at times, though rarely, the entire length of the wall presents one solid mass of vitreous substance.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

It is not clear why or how the walls were subjected to vitrification. Some [[antiquarian]]s have argued that it was done to strengthen the wall, but the heating actually weakens the structure. Battle damage is also unlikely to be the cause, as the walls are thought to have been subjected to carefully maintained fires to ensure they were hot enough for vitrification to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/vterms/g/vitrified_forts.htm Vitrification temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benderloch.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1139 More information and the vitrification debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most archaeologists now consider that vitrified forts are the product of deliberate destruction either following the capture of the site by an enemy force or by the occupants at the end of its active life as an act of ritual closure.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"&gt;Ralston 2006, 143-63{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process has no chronological significance and is found during both Iron Age and Early Medieval Forts in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"/&gt;

Since [[John Williams (geologist)|John Williams]], one of the earliest of British [[geologist]]s, and author of ''The Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom'', first described these singular ruins in 1777, over 70 examples have been discovered in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The most remarkable are:

For a long time it was supposed that these forts were peculiar to Scotland; but they are found also in the Isle of Man (Cronk Sumark) [[County Londonderry]] and [[County Cavan]], Ireland; in [[Upper Lusatia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Saxony]], and [[Thuringia]]; in the provinces on the [[Rhine]], especially in the neighbourhood of the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]]; in the [[Uecker|Ucker Lake]]; in Brandenburg, where the walls are formed of burnt and smelted [[brick]]s; in Hungary; in several places in France, such as Châteauvieux (near [[Pionnat]]), Péran, [[La Courbe]], [[Sainte-Suzanne, Mayenne|Sainte-Suzanne]], [[Puy de Gaudy]], and [[Thauron]]; also rarely in the north of England. [[Broborg|Barksdale]] is a vitrified hill-fort in [[Uppland]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Appearance in Media==
===''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''===
The 16 September 1980 episode of this series features a segment in which the archaeologist Ian Ralston examines the mystery of the vitrified fort Tap o' Noth and tries to recreate how it might be accomplished by piling stones and setting a massive bonfire, repeating the work of [[V. Gordon Childe]] and [[Wallace Thorneycroft]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, A. C]], Welfare, S and Fairley, J. ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''. Collins, 1980, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment produced a few partially vitrified stones, but no answers were gleaned as to how large-scale forts could have been crafted with the approach tried in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World'' ([[Yorkshire Television]] 1980; episode 3: "Ancient Wisdom" ([[Network DVD]] 7952792). Segment runs from 10:58 to 17:150&lt;/ref&gt;
