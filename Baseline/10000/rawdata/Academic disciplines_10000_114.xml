Supported by the [[Government of Bangladesh]], BIDS functions as a [[think tank]], helping formulate socio-economic policies. The institute conducts research and promotes study and education in development economics, rural development, demographics and social sciences.

==History==

The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies had its origin in Pakistan, named as the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and established in June 1957. The PIDE was moved to Dhaka in January 1971. After the emergence of independent Bangladesh in 1971, the Institute was called the Bangladesh Institute of Development Economics (BIDE). Later on, a Parliamentary Charter was awarded in 1974 and the Institute was renamed as the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) to reflect its multidisciplinary focus of development research. It was incorporated as an autonomous body, governed by a high powered Board of Trustees under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Planning, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Since 1974, through a process of national level institutional restructuring, two other institutions––the Population Study Centre and the National Foundation for Research on Human Resources Development–– were merged with BIDS in 1982 and 1983 respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Institute_of_Development_Studies|title=Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, funding for BIDS was made through regular government budgetary support. In 1983, the Government created an endowment fund to ensure a source of recurring revenue for running the Institute, thereby reducing its dependence on regular budgetary support, and enabling BIDS to enjoy more functional autonomy. In 2009, the Government provided a Research Endowment Fund of Tk. 200 million to support core institutional research of BIDS. Some donor agencies and foundations also provide resources for its activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Publications==

The Publication Section publishes books, journals, policy briefs, monographs, and other reports for promoting a wide dissemination of BIDS research activities and findings. The Section, with equipment to meet the Institute's publishing requirements, also provides sales services to its local and foreign customers and promotes BIDS publication through complimentary and exchange programs. The BIDS publications have wide circulation amongst researchers, policymakers and the general readers.

The [[Bangladesh Development Studies]](BDS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bids.org.bd/BDS_intro.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225140312/http://www.bids.org.bd/BDS_intro.php |archivedate=December 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the quarterly journal of the Institute. This is published in English. It enjoys international reputation and is currently in its 35th years of publication. The BDS carries research articles, notes, and book reviews by BIDS researchers as well as by national and international scholars.

'''Black psychology''' (also called '''African psychology''') is an African cosmological lens{{clarifyme|date=January 2013}} applied to social or psychological phenomena.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is approached from two perspectives:
*The first perspective considers these concepts and theories as universal, which means that the lens is appropriate in studying all human beings, not just those of African heritage.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt;  This approach was embodied in early efforts by black scholars to challenge the assumption that African Americans were inferior.  Over time, it grew to also incorporate the history and the experiences of African Americans, exploring it in a ways considered superior to the traditional models of White psychologists.&lt;ref name="W93"&gt;Whitten, L. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  
*The second perspective, the Afrocentric scholar approach, considers the lens as only appropriate when applied to people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt;  

Both perspectives agree that African American psychology is a science and that it is structured and organized.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt;  Both African and African American psychologies study the thoughts, behaviors, feelings, beliefs, attitudes, interactions, and well-being of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt; 

Black psychology has critiqued or rejected white psychology, developed [[afrocentric]] models of study and therapy, and intervened in the social struggle for more black and human environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/minority-groups/past_courses/Karenga_Black_Psychology.pdf Black Psychology] From Introduction to Black Studies by Maulena Karenga, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of early black psychologists is lost to many students due the minimal coverage in courses.&lt;ref name="W93"/&gt; However, research performed by early black scholars on the effects of segregation and other racial matters played an important role in American history, like the research by Kenneth Bancroft Clark that was cited in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of psychology programs in black colleges==
Following the end of the Civil War a push for education began to occur in the Black community. Moving away from secret night schools held during the time of slavery, a variety of learning centers and colleges began to open. Many of these schools were established by missionary associations and various Freedman societies. Federal government land grants such as the [[Morrill Act of 1862]]&lt;ref name="G98"&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to support these institutions and the additional aid of religious denominations allowed for the support of these schools. The years following saw the founding of Black colleges across the country including notable institutions such as the first historically black college [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] (1854),
[[Fisk University]] (1865), [[Howard University]] (1867), Morehouse College (1867) and [[Spelman College]] (1881).&lt;ref name="G98"/&gt; By 1940 there were more than one hundred Black colleges in the seventeen southern states offering a variety of degrees with many of the earned degrees in social sciences and education.

==Rise of the psychology program==
Psychology courses became both popular and integral courses in black colleges, with at least one course appearing as early as 1906. Formally trained professors (both black and white) taught courses. Although many universities had programs of great influence, the most prominent was located at Howard University. Howard's successes were due largely to the efforts of [[Francis Cecil Sumner]]. Often considered the father of black psychologists, Sumner structured the psychology program, teaching not only the ideas of [[Edward Titchener]], [[John B. Watson|John Watson]], and [[Sigmund Freud]], but a myriad of courses in topics such as learning, personality, mental hygiene, and experimental psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental focus reflected Sumner's three objectives: to provide students preparation in professional fields, stress the cultural significance of psychology, and prepare students who wish to pursue graduate study. This not only made Howard different from other Black universities, but created a strong program that carried over to graduate studies. Although Howard only offered master's degrees, it offered a strong foundation for those who went on to pursue doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998) pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Although psychology was a popular course in black colleges, only Howard and three other black colleges offered an undergraduate psychology degree by the late 1930s. Emphasis was usually on educational psychology, leaving statistics and experimental focuses by the wayside. This led to a survey conducted by [[Herman George Canady]] between 1930 and 1940 concerning the nature of undergraduate courses, research in psychology, and other areas of concern in black colleges. The survey revealed that fourteen of fifty colleges had a department in psychology and that theoretical and lab courses were rare. Psychology courses were primarily offered by departments of education, allowing the development of educational psychology and emphasizing the focus on practical applications of education.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998) p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences compared to white colleges==
Naturally, psychology was taught differently in white and black colleges due to differences in available funds and materials. Black colleges tended to focus on practical matters due to the need to train students for trades or teaching posts. Conversely, white colleges taught psychology as laboratory science that was very focused on research and instrumentation. Much of the focus in psychology in Black colleges lay in studying similarities among people instead of differences. Professors emphasized that situation and environmental circumstances, not skin color, affected intelligence. This contrasts white colleges and professionals who studied [[IQ]] scores and other [[psychometric]] methods to prove that differences between races lay in skin color. The idea that environmental factors affect intelligence not only helped to remove the stigma in Black communities, but it led to groundbreaking work by Black psychologists later in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a challenge when it comes to teaching psychology involving black students and white instructors. Particularly, in the early years, there was a mismatch  of interactional norms due to the cultural differences that underpin interactional behaviors, which include different backchanneling responses among Black and White Americans. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating Elite Talk: Language, Race, Class and Identity Among African American High Schoolers|last=Clark|first=John Taggart|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781905763214|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be demonstrated in the incidence of "hyperexplanation," wherein an instructor provides lengthy explanation without recognizing affirmative gestures that do not include vocal backchannels such as "I understand you." This can lead to offense on the part of the black student, who could view the explanation as patronizing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Graduate studies and beyond==
Between 1920 and 1970, black colleges around the nation produced more than 1,300 bachelor's degree graduates who eventually earned a doctorate in psychology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, difficulties were encountered in attempts to obtain the degree. Many black students were denied acceptance into southern white schools and looked north for educational opportunities. [[Clark University]] was the foremost in graduating black scholars at the time; its notable alumni include Sumner and J. Henry Alston.  This was not the norm for other schools. Beyond acceptance or provisions that required black students to take on an extra year of undergraduate work to prove their caliber to attending white schools, finances was the most troubling factor. Fees toward tuition, living maintenance, and other expenses caused many to delay or to give up pursuing graduate studies for dependable wages in menial positions. The combination of these factors meant that out of the 3,767 doctorates awarded in psychology between 1920 and 1966 from the ten most prestigious universities in the nation, only eight were awarded to black candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, a survey of prior studies indicates a consensus among psychologists that black psychology and black psychologists play an important role in addressing race-related issues in America aside from its significance in addressing the concept of the negro personality and the psychological issues it entails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Racism and Psychology: Towards a Reflexive History|last=Richards|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415101409|location=London|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Edward Johnson stressed in ''The Role of the Negro in American Psychology'' that "the black psychologist will regard himself more and more as an agent of social change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=E.E.|date=1969|title=Role of the Negro in American psychology|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=24|pages=757-759|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism toward African Americans==
Many of the African contributions were ignored about its origin, taken by Greek cosmologists, and used by the early pioneers of psychology, but even after that the African Americans received more racism instead of credibility.{{Vague|date=January 2017}} Most of this took place after the Civil War, when [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] emerged.&lt;ref name="Holliday, B.G. 2009. p. 318"&gt;Holliday, B.G. (2009). p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Even the Rat was White'', a book published in 1976, encouraged African American psychology. A second edition of this book was published in 1996. The author [[Robert V. Guthrie]] explains the different ways that white American scientists contributed to racists criticism against African Americans. Many of these explained that African Americans are inferior to white Americans. Many scientists did intelligence testing on African Americans and white Americans which resulted in African Americans being the inferior race.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin’s natural selection theory was published in 1859. The assumption of this theory was that only the strongest and intelligent individuals or organisms could survive. In the 20th century many studies were done to compare the differences in African Americans and white Americans. The results mainly showed that African Americans were inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Francis Galton]]’s studies in the 19th century attributed [[Race and intelligence|the racial inferiority of African Americans' intelligence]] to inheritance. Through his theory he predicted that if intelligence is inherited, then it would not be expected for lower intelligence to be improved through ability. Galton thought that through selective mating, the improvement of race could be done controlling the inferior intelligence genetically. The results showed that African Americans and other minorities were considered to be those who were unfit and inferior and white Americans as superior.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology studies were done in 18th and 19th century that compared African Americans' and White Americans' physical characteristics. Qualities such as skin color, hair texture, posture, face structure, and skull structure were assessed in favor of white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]'s theory of instinct created many racist concepts about African Americans. One of his studies characterized African Americans as easygoing, happy, and lazy. Another study was done that tested hearing, vision, taste, acuity, pain, and motor speed of African Americans. The result was that minorities, such as, African American were inferior to white Americans.

==Successes of African Americans==
In 1968, the [[Association of Black Psychologists]] was formed as a protest toward the [[American Psychological Association]]’s lack of interest in African American Psychologists.  In 1974, the Association of Black Psychologists created their official journal called ''The [[Journal of Black Psychology]]''. This journal is directed toward understanding of experiences and behavior of African American populations. It covers many issues in the African American society, such as, HIV, sickle cell disease, racial identity, African American children, and substance abuse prevention. Psychology fields that are covered in this journal are counseling, clinical, social, cognitive, educational, and organizational psychology.&lt;ref name="Holliday, B.G. 2009. p. 318"/&gt;

The '''British Accounting and Finance Association''' ('''BAFA''') is a [[learned society]] and research organisation dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of accounting, finance and financial management. It has over 750 members and edits the [[British Accounting Review]], an [[academic journal]].

The association is a UK [[registered charity]] no. 299527&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=299527&amp;subid=0 Charity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Overview==

BAFA promotes the development of innovative approaches to research and teaching in accounting and finance, and celebrates the breadth and diversity of research by UK and international researchers.

It collaborates with other organisations, such as the [[Academy of Social Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.acss.org.uk/mem-soc/&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[British Academy]], and professional accounting bodies, to promote accounting and finance as a social science that influences professional practice and affects the economy and society.

In addition to publishing the scholarly journal, the British Accounting Review, BAFA hosts an annual conference in April that attracts academics and professionals from around the world.

==History==

The Association of University Teachers of Accounting (AUTA) was formed in 1947 with Donald Cousins as its first Chairman&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bromwich|first=Michael|last2=Macve|first2=Richard|last3=Ranger|first3=Debbie|title=Will Baxter: 100 Years Young|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bar.2006.04.001|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=38|issue=2|pages=221–223|doi=10.1016/j.bar.2006.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It held its inaugural meeting in December of that year at a time when the UK’s first accounting professorships were being created and accountancy was becoming recognised as a subject for scholarly study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeff|first=Stephen A.|title=The early years of the Association of University Teachers of Accounting: 1947–1959|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0890-8389(97)80002-9|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=29|issue=1-2|pages=3–39|doi=10.1016/s0890-8389(97)80002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The AUTA followed in the footsteps of the Accounting Research Organisation, which had been established in 1936, although it had ceased activities by 1941. Harold Edey had an important role in the early years, in particular ensuring that the academic study of accounting was given value by the profession&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macve|first=Richard|date=2007-06-01|title=In Memoriam: Harold Edey|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00014788.2007.9730063|journal=Accounting and Business Research|volume=37|issue=2|pages=95–95|doi=10.1080/00014788.2007.9730063|issn=0001-4788}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

As a result of the small number of both researchers and teachers in accounting during the 1960s – Parker (1997, p.45) lists a mere 21 in the whole country – and because of a distinct lack of engagement at the time from the profession, the organisation almost disappeared. However, it was given a new lease of life later in that decade when the AUTA News Review was set up (although a Newsletter had existed on a more ad hoc basis since its first issue in 1948 with Will Baxter its Editor)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This publication was renamed the AUTA Review in 1974 and it then became the British Accounting Review in 1984&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maunders|first=Keith|title=The AUTA/BAA 1971–1996: Living in interesting times|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0890-8389(97)80004-2|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=29|issue=1-2|pages=63–79|doi=10.1016/s0890-8389(97)80004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Around the same time, a set of regional associations were also established, which allowed universities outside London to establish their own research foci in the accounting area. The Scottish Accountants Group ran their initial conference in April 1967 while the Northern Accountants Group also first met in that month with its first conference organised by Robert Parker taking place in October of the same year. By the end of the next decade, South-eastern and South-western groups had also been formed. 

Two of BAFA’s other sub-committees, the Conference of Professors of Accounting and Finance (CPAF) and the Committee of Departments of Accounting and Finance (CDAF) were both established in 1987 as the Conference of Professors of Accounting and the Committee of Heads of Accounting in Polytechnics respectively, although the latter was initially organised as a separate entity to the AUTA&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

The tradition of holding a broad-based conference in April with location moving around the United Kingdom began in 1949 in Birmingham. The organisation stopped holding conferences from 1959 to 1970 but these began again in 1971 with 62 attendees, and have been held annually since then with participant numbers growing to over 300&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=R.H.|title=Flickering at the margin of existence: The Association of University Teachers of Accounting, 1960–1971|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0890-8389(97)80003-0|journal=The British Accounting Review|volume=29|issue=1-2|pages=41–61|doi=10.1016/s0890-8389(97)80003-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The conference has included a Doctoral Colloquium since 1990. 

The AUTA became the British Accounting Association (BAA) in 1984 and the most recent chapter in the history of the organisation began in April 2012 when the BAA changed its name to the British Accounting and Finance Association (BAFA) to better match its wider remit spanning finance and financial management as well as accounting.

==Membership==

BAFA has over 750 members, comprising academics, students and accounting professionals. There are two levels of membership: ordinary and honorary.

Ordinary membership is by application and is open to anyone with an interest in research in accounting and finance.

Honorary membership is conferred by the executive committee, in recognition of services to accounting, finance and/or financial management education and research which are deemed worthy of recognition by the association.

BAFA is not a qualifying body for the purposes of practising accounting and finance.

==The British Accounting Review==

The [[British Accounting Review]] is the official journal of the British Accounting and Finance Association.  It publishes original scholarly papers covering the whole spectrum of accounting and finance.

The journal allows original research to reach academics, students, professional bodies and their members, accounting and auditing standards bodies, financial regulators and government departments.

Research contributions must demonstrate the use of rigorous and appropriate research methodologies, and use high quality data for empirical studies.

All papers published are subject to a minimum of double blind review. 

The joint editors are currently Professors Nathan Joseph and Alan Lowe.

==Groups==

===BAFA Sub-committees===

There are two BAFA sub-committees:

* '''Committee for Departments of Accounting and Finance''' ('''CDAF''')
CDAF is concerned with matters of national importance in the management of University departments of Accounting and Finance, focusing upon issues of curriculum, quality assurance, academic management, professional body links and staff development.
* '''Conference of Professors of Accounting and Finance''' ('''CPAF''')
CPAF provides a forum for the discussion of strategic matters of relevance to academics in accounting and finance. Most members are professors, but exceptionally they may be the most senior academic in an HEI without any Professors in Accounting or Finance. CPAF holds an annual conference in September.

===Regional Groups===

* Northern Area Group
* Scottish Group
* South East Area Group
* South West Area Group

Each group hosts its own local events.

===Special Interest Groups===

BAFA runs a number of groups that address specific subject areas. They are: 

* Accounting and Finance in Emerging Economies Special Interest Group
* Accounting Education Special Interest Group
* Auditing Special Interest Group (ASIG)
* Corporate Governance Special Interest Group
* Financial Accounting and Reporting Special Interest Group
* Financial Markets and Institutions Special Interest Group
* Interdisciplinary Perspectives Special Interest Group
* Public Services and Charities Special Interest Group
* Corporate Finance and Asset Pricing Special Interest Group

==BAFA Awards==

BAFA makes three awards annually:  the Distinguished Academic Award (DAA), the Lifetime Achievement Award (LAA), and the Distinguished Contribution Award (DCA). 

The DAA is presented to an individual who has made a substantial and direct contribution to UK academic accounting and finance life, while the LAA is awarded to one or more individuals who have made a substantial and direct contributions to UK academic accounting and finance over the course of their careers. 

The DCA was launched in 2016 to recognise non-academics who have made a significant contribution to the profession and to BAFA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4801">'''Cave conservation''' is the protection and restoration of [[cave]]s to prevent or minimise the effects of human activities.

Some caves have delicate features that can be disturbed by changes in light levels, humidity, temperature or air flow.  Caves that have lighting that remains on are prone to having algae grow within the cave changing the appearance and ecology.  [[Speleothems]] grow as a result of water both on cave surfaces and the humidity of the cave air. Changes to these because of a high number of visitors, changes to the cave air flow and changes to the [[hydrology]] will alter speleothem development.

Speleothems can have a slow growth rate and therefore removing them as souvenirs or breakage due to movement within the cave will be visible for a long time, often throughout several generations of human interaction.

The use of [[calcium carbide]] for lamps has led to soot marks and deposits of discarded spent carbide. Using electric lamps avoids these problems.

==Cave conservation by region==

===New Zealand===
The [[New Zealand Speleological Society]] (NZSS), a recreational caving organisation, promotes cave conservation by its members.  The [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DoC) is responsible for caves on land under its administration and has developed a management policy for caves and [[karst]]. DoC publish a "Caving care code" which is in turn based in part on the caving ethics of NZSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=38542|title=Minimising your impact - Caving care code|last=DoC|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The [[British Cave Research Association]] administers the United Kingdom Cave Conservation Emergency Fund (UKCCEF), a charitable fund for protection of caves and cave features. The aims are:
* To assist in the publication of material intended to promote the conservation of caves and features therein or the conservation of a specific site or group of caves     
* To assist with the physical protection of features within a specific cave or group of caves
* To assist in works designed to maintain access to a cave or part of a cave, but not solely to assist exploration
* To assist in the purchase of land or property where such acquisition is intended to ensure the protection of, or maintenance of access to, a cave or caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcra.org.uk/ukccef/ ukccef info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Caving Association]] has a Cave Conservation Code with the following recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caveinfo.org.uk/nca/canda/concode.htm Conservation Code&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415231401/http://www.caveinfo.org.uk/nca/canda/concode.htm |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cave with care and within your abilities
*Keep to marked routes and do not cross conservation tapes and barriers
*Protect cave wildlife and do not disturb bats
*Do not pollute the cave, leave nothing behind
*Archaeological and other remains should not be disturbed
*Do not interfere with scientific equipment
*Set a good example for others to follow
*Avoid touching or damaging formations
*Take nothing but photographs
*Comply with any access requirements
*Respect the rights and privacy of land owners

===United States===
The [[National Speleological Society]] believes:
* Caves have unique scientific, recreational, and scenic values
* These values are endangered by both carelessness and intentional vandalism
* These values, once gone, cannot be recovered
* The responsibility for protecting caves must be formed by those who study and enjoy them. 
* A common phrase on ethical caving: "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, waste nothing but time."
Also involved in cave conservation are the:
* [[Butler Cave Conservation Society]]
* [[Cave Research Foundation]]
* [http://scci.org Southeastern Cave Conservancy]

===India===

The [[National Cave Research and Protection Organization]] is formed to protect the caves and explore the caves scientifically to know them better.

[[File:Agraffe Essener Domschatz.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Burgundy|Burgundian]] [[Fibula_(brooch) | fibulae ]] in the Essen treasury. The Essen treasure contains sixteen of these rare pieces of jewelry from the 14th century.]]
A '''church treasure''' ({{lang-de|Kirchenschatz}}) is the collection of historical art treasures belonging to a [[church (building)|church]], usually a [[monastery]] ('''monastery treasure'''), [[abbey]], [[cathedral]]. Such "treasure" is usually held and displayed in the church's [[treasure chamber|treasury]] or in a [[diocesan museum]]. Historically the highlight of church treasures was often a collection of [[reliquaries]].

As a result of gifts and the desire to acquire sacred artifacts, many churches over the centuries gathered valuable and historic collections of [[altar plate]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s of liturgical or religious books, as well as [[vestments]], and other works of art or items of historical interest. Despite [[iconoclasm]], [[secularism]], looting, fire, the enforced sale of treasure in times of financial difficulty, theft and other losses, much of this treasure has survived or has even been repurchased.  Many large churches have been displaying their riches to visitors in some form for centuries.

An '''entitlement''' is a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] made in accordance with a [[law|legal framework]] of a society. Typically, entitlements are based on concepts of [[principle]] ("[[rights]]") which are themselves based in concepts of [[social equality]] or [[enfranchisement]]. In recent decades the meaning of the word has been extended to encompass informal expectations of social relationships, social conventions and [[social norms]] which are considered unreasonable or unduly prescriptive upon others{{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

== Psychology ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others,&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldberg, ''Advances in Self-Psychology'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ronningstam, ''Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or [[narcissistic injury]]; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy]] distinguished in adult life between (ethically) ''earning'' entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 109-10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The gambler may feel ''entitled'' to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis''. (London 1946) p. 372 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

An inflated sense of what is sometimes called ''psychological entitlement''&lt;ref&gt;L. Ashner, ''When is Enough, Enough?'' (1997) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; - unrealistic, [[exaggerated]], or rigidly held - is especially prominent among narcissists.  According to the [[DSM-5]], individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD) are likely to have a "sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others", typically without commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.)|location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–672|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder: Symptoms|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=18 Nov 2014|accessdate=29 Apr 2016|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/con-20025568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], the [[narcissistic]] personality attempts to protect the [[vulnerable self]] by building layers of [[grandiosity]] and a huge sense of entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Farrell, ''Acts of Trust'' (2010) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

While an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

This article gives an overview of '''[[Esotericism|esoteric movements]] in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]''' between 1880 and 1945, presenting [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]] and [[Ariosophy]], among others, against the influences of earlier European esotericism.

==Influences from before 1880==

===Knights Templar and occultism===
The original [[Knights Templar]], founded around 1119, had been a crusading military order, that, at some time, had established financial networks across the whole of Christendom. In 1307, King [[Philip IV of France]] mounted a "slanderous campaign"&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 60&lt;/ref&gt; to strip the Order of its economic and political influence. The Templars were accused of Satanic practices, perversions and blasphemy and ruthlessly suppressed; Its leaders were burned on March 18, 1314. The circumstances of their suppression gave rise to [[Knights Templar legends|legends surrounding the Knights Templar]]. In Germany, "where the growth of deviant Masonic rites was greatest,"&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt; the Templar heritage was adopted for irregular Freemasonry. ([[Freemasonry]] had been officially founded in England in 1717.)

The idea of chivalric Freemasonry first occurred ca. 1737 in France.&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 Baron Gotthelf von Hund (1722–76) founded the [[Rite of Strict Observance|Order of Strict Observance]], claiming the possession of secret Templar documents which allegedly prove that his order represented the legal Templar succession.&lt;ref name=G-C61&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rosicrucianism===
In the 17th century and 18th century, [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian ideas]] flourished in varying degrees. Rosicrucianism goes back to the beginning of the 17th century, when three works by [[Johannes Valentinus Andreae|Johann Valentin Andreae]] were printed at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 58, 59&lt;/ref&gt; One of these works, the ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|Chymische Hochzeit]]'', appears to be an [[Alchemy|alchemical]] tract, while the other two (for which the authorship of Valentin Andreae is not finally proven) announce the existence of the ''Rosicrucian Order'', which desires an "universal and general reformation of the whole world". Putatively this order was founded by Christian Rosenkreutz, who is supposed to have lived from 1378 to 1484.

In either 1747 or 1757 a quasi-masonic Rosicrucian order of the name ''Gold- und Rosenkreuz'' was founded in Berlin, having a 9-grade hierarchy based on the [[Kabbalah|cabalistic]] [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]; This organisation included King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] and [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]]&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Johann Christoph von Wöllner|Johann Christoph von Wöllner]]&lt;/ref&gt; as members.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==German occult revival, 1880–1910==

{{quote|The modern German occult revival owes its inception to the popularity of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] in the Anglo-Saxon world during the 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Theosophy===
The first German Theosophical Society was established in July 1884, under the presidency of [[Wilhelm Hübbe-Schleiden]],&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Wilhelm von Hübbe-Schleiden]]&lt;/ref&gt; a conservative German nationalist turned spiritual seeker who sought to establish Theosophy on a "scientific" basis.&lt;ref name=Treitel&gt;Corinna Treitel, ''A Science for the Soul'', {{ISBN|0-8018-7812-8}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1886 and 1895 Hübbe-Schleiden published the monthly periodical ''Die Sphinx''.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Sphinx (Zeitschrift)|Sphinx magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austheos.org.au/indices/SPHINXHU.HTM  Table of contents to the Sphinx magazine&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vienna]], a theosophical society was founded in 1887, its president was [[Friedrich Eckstein]].&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Friedrich Eckstein]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his circle at this time [[Franz Hartmann]], a leader of theosophical work who emphasized personal spiritual experience,&lt;ref name= Treitel/&gt; and the young [[Rudolf Steiner]] were members.&lt;ref name = "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"/&gt;  A ''German Theosophical Society'', as a branch of the ''International Theosophical Brotherhood'', then was established in 1896 when the American theosophists around [[William Quan Judge]], [[Katherine Tingley]], ''E. T. Hargrove'' and ''C. F. Wright'' travelled through Europe.&lt;ref name = "GC25-6"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 25, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Its president was Franz Hartmann, who also founded a theosophical lay-monastery at [[Ascona]] in 1889.&lt;ref name = "GC24-5"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;  His periodical [[Lotusblüten (magazine)|Lotusblüten]] (''Lotus Blossoms'', 1892–1900) was the first German publication to use the theosophical [[swastika]] on its cover.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;

Hartmann's example provided the impetus for [[Paul Zillmann]] to found the ''Metaphysische Rundschau'' (''Metaphysical Review'') in 1896.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;

[[Image:Lucifer-gnosis-1904.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Cover of the June 1904 edition of Lucifer-Gnosis]]

[[Rudolf Steiner]] was made general secretary of the ''German Theosophical Society'' in 1902.&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt;  Steiner, who was seeking to develop an [[esoteric]] path suitable for the modern era, and professed commitment to [[scientific method]]ology, was yet oriented towards awakening spiritual experiences in each individual rather than depending upon authorities or [[guru]]s.&lt;ref name=Treitel/&gt; He published ''Luzifer'' at Berlin from 1903 to 1908.

In Vienna, there also existed an ''Association for Occultism'', connected to a person called ''Philipp Maschlufsky''.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 28"/&gt; From 1903 he published a periodical called ''Die Gnosis'', that was later absorbed by ''Rudolf Steiner's'' periodical ''Luzifer'', and renamed ''Lucifer-Gnosis''.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Lucifer-Gnosis]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"It may have been a desire to counter Steiner's influence in the occult subculture which led Hartmann to encourage the publication of several new periodicals."&lt;ref name= "Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27&lt;/ref&gt;  A Theosophical Publishing House was established by ''Hugo Vollrath'' in [[Leipzig]] in 1906. Among the magazines published there was ''Prana'' (1909–19), initially edited by ''Karl Brandler-Pracht'' and later edited by [[Johannes Balzli]]. Before that, a publisher with the name Wilhelm Friedrich had already published the works of Hartmann and Hübbe-Schleiden, as well as translations of the English theosophists at Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27, 51, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm Friedrich had also published the occult works of Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth (1859–1916). Initially, this author had collaborated with Moritz von Egidy&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Moritz von Egidy|Moritz von Egidy]]&lt;/ref&gt; on the periodical ''Das angewande Christentum'' (''Applied Christianity''), but later he wrote volumes on "the sexual-religion of the Aryans", thus, in the opinion of Goodrick-Clarke, anticipating Ariososophy.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthroposophy===
From 1907 (at latest), tensions between [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society]] grew steadily.  In 1912, Rudolf Steiner broke away to found [[anthroposophy]].  There were two causes of the break; Steiner's [[Europe]]an and [[Christian]] orientation had long been distinct from the [[Hinduism|hinduistic]] interest of the theosophists under the leadership of [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref name= "GC25-6" /&gt; More immediately, Steiner publicly distanced himself from Besant's promotion of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as a supposed new [[messiah]]. Steiner and a group of prominent German theosophists officially founded the [[Anthroposophical Society]] in December 1913, the vast majority of the German membership of the Theosophical Society following them into the new group; the breakaways were excluded from the Theosophical Society in January 1914.

===Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels===
{{Further|Ariosophy}}
Living in Vienna, [[Guido von List|Guido (von) List]] (1848–1919) had been active as journalist and writer. After he turned to esotericism, he became the first popular author to combine [[völkisch]] ideology and occultism into the type of esoteric doctrine that is now collectively labelled [[Ariosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1903 the occult periodical ''Die Gnosis'' (see above) included an article by List, in which he, referring Sebaldt von Werth, started to articulate "a Germanic occult religion".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 41, 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade, List continued to work on this topic, also making references to the works of [[Madame Blavatsky]] and [[William Scott-Elliot]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In his concept of Armanism, the religion of the theocratic elite in his image of the ancient Germanic past, List borrowed material from Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his manuscript, proposing the research into the runes by the "means of occult insight", was rejected from the Imperial Academie of Sciences in Vienna, the supporters of List formed  a List Society (''Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft'') to finance his research. The Society was founded officially on 2 March 1908. Its members included völkisch authors as well as occultists (for example Franz Hartmann and the complete membership of the Vienna Theosophical Society). Some inner members of the List Society participated in the activities of the ''Hoher Armanen-Orden'' (''High Armanen-Order'').&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This order, however, achieved no significance as a lodge-like organisation.

[[Lanz von Liebenfels|Jörg Lanz (von Liebenfels)]] (1874–1954) had been a [[Cistercians|cistercian monk]] between 1893 and 1899. In 1903 he published a long article "Anthropozoon biblicum" in the ''Vierteljahrsschrift für Bibelkunde'', a periodical for biblical research.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 93, 275&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905 his studies in this direction had cumulated into the book ''Theozoologie'', a "strange amalgam" of traditional Judaeo-Christian sources and contemporary life-sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 94&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Lanz proposed a "frequently obscene and always radical" interpretation of the Bible, according to which it had been the purpose of the [[Old Testament]] to warn the [[Aryan race]] against interbreeding with [[Pygmies]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 94, 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Lanz also established his own magazine, [[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]. One of the few other contributors to this magazine beside Lanz himself was the theosophist Harald Grävell von Jostenoode (1856–1932), who also edited one number of [[Lotusblüten (magazine)|Lotusblüten]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrology===
Among the theosophists, [[astrology]] enjoyed a revival.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 84, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Astrological texts by Karl Brandler-Pracht, Otto Pöllner, Ernst Tiede, and Albert Knief appeared at the Theosophical Publishing House at [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 103&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karl Brandler-Pracht'' had also founded the ''First Viennese Astrological Society'' in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Jan Hanussen]], who later would become the most famous [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] in Germany and Austria, gave his first occult session with ''E.&amp;nbsp;K. Hermann'' in Vienna in 1911.&lt;ref name="TP-Hanussen"&gt;Markus Kompa (with the collaboration of Wilfried Kugel): [http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/27/27562/1.html Erik Jan Hanussen - Hokus-Pokus-Tausendsassa]; {{de icon}} [[Telepolis]], 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other developments===
The German and Vienna occult subculture was well developed before the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 27"/&gt; Aside from the developments mentioned above, there are some more of interest:

"The [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO) originated in the irregular masonic activities of [[Theodor Reuss]], [[Franz Hartmann]], and [[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Karl Kellner]] between 1895 and 1906."&lt;ref name="G-C61"/&gt; Theodor Reuss had been in contact with [[William Wynn Westcott|William Wescott]], a founding member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 59"/&gt;

[[Ernst Wachler (author)|Ernst Wachler]] was a völkisch author (he supported the ''Guido von List Society'') who had founded an open-air Germanic theatre in the [[Harz]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 43&lt;/ref&gt; This theatre, called ''Green Stage'' (''Grüne Bühne''), was closed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;German Wikipedia: [[:de:Bergtheater Thale|Bergtheater Thale]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft]], founded in 1907, is claimed by current [[Germanic Neopaganism]] groups as predecessor. It was founded and led by the painter [[Ludwig Fahrenkrog]]. Since 1908, the group used the [[swastika]] as its symbol. After 1938 the use of the swastika became prohibited and the group was no longer allowed to hold public meetings. However, unlike many other esoteric groups in Nazi Germany, the GGG was not forced to disband, partly "because of Fahrenkrog's international status as an artist."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Wolff, "Ludwig Fahrenkrog and the Germanic Faith Community: Wodan Triumphant" in [[Tyr (journal)|Tyr: Myth—Culture—Tradition]], Ultra 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interbellum (Weimar Republic)==

===Ariosophy, ''Ordo Novi Templi'', and Lumenclub===
Lanz had coined the term [[ariosophy]], meaning occult wisdom concerning the Aryans, in 1915. In the 1920s he then used this label for his doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1926 he published: ''Das Buch der Psalmen teutsch: das Gebetbuch der Ariosophen, Rassenmystiker, und Antisemiten''. (''The book of psalms, German: The book of prayer of the Ariosophists, Race mystics, and Antisemites'') This is the only book of Lanz von Liebenfels that was later found in [[Hitler]]'s personal library. (Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 198, 275)&lt;/ref&gt; Both List and Lanz greeted [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] as a [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 86 (List), 103 (Lanz)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guido von List]] wrote his research reports on the "Aryo-Germanics" (Ario-Germanen) between 1908 and 1913, but in 1917 two later articles written by him appeared in ''Prana''. He died 1919 in Berlin. The List Society was continued after his death, but not much is known of its activities.
By contrast, an organisation founded around 1907&lt;ref&gt;Lanz von Liebenfels has claimed that the founding of the ONT occurred on [[Christmas]] Day 1900, but Goodrick-Clarke does not consider this statement reliable. Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 245.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] achieved more significance: the "new Templar lodge", called ''Ordo Novi Templi'' (ONT) (German: [[:de:Neutempler-Orden|Neutempler-Orden]]).

On 11 November 1932, influenced by Ariosophy, an industrialist with the name Johann Walthari Wölfl also founded an association called the Lumenclub in Vienna, which overlapped in membership with the ONT.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 118, 119&lt;/ref&gt; The ideological sympathy of the Lumenclub to [[Nazism]] is beyond question, as it acted as growth centre for the Nazi party that was illegal in Austria since 1934.&lt;ref name=GC119&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 119&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they were later suppressed like other esoteric groups. After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in 1938, Lanz von Liebenfels had his writings banned.&lt;ref name="Bramwell 1985: 42"&gt;Bramwell 1985: 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lumenclub and the ONT were suppressed by the [[Gestapo]] in March 1942, following the party edict of December 1938 that applied to many sectarian groups.&lt;ref name=GC119/&gt;

''Werner von Bülow'' and ''Herbert Reichstein'' had applauded the advent of the third reich in their esoteric magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 192&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rune occultism====
Influenced by Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels (see: [[Ariosophy]]), a new "Aryan occultist movement"&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 155&lt;/ref&gt; was started after 1918 in Germany by [[Rudolf John Gorsleben]].

Since the esoteric importance of the runes (that first had been developed by [[Guido von List]], see [[Armanen runes]]) was central to his world-view,&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 157&lt;/ref&gt; Goodrick-Clarke speaks in this context of "rune occultism".

Here two authors stand out, as they engaged the runes in "a less explicitly [[Aryan race|Aryan racist]] context". [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]] and [[Siegfried Adolf Kummer]] focused more on the practical side of rune occultism. In 1936 Friedrich Bernhard Marby was arrested and sent to a [[concentration camp]] (''Flossenbürg'' and later [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]).&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161&lt;/ref&gt; He survived and resumed his occult research after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161; Friedrich Bernhard Marby, 1975, ''Sonne und Planeten im Tierkreis'', p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Responsible for his incarceration might have been [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], who was Himmler's counsellor on the occult. (see: [[Nazi occultism]]) Willigut was of the opinion that Marby (and also Kummer) were bringing "the holy [[Aryan]] heritage into disrepute and ridicule".&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 161; Weisthor (Willigut) to Himmler, letter dated 2 May 1934, [[Bundesarchiv]], ''Koblenz'', Himmler Nachlass 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiligut also had identified [[Irminism]] as the true ancestral religion, claiming that [[Guido von List]]'s ''Wotanism'' and runic row was a schismatic false religion, but this does seem to be unconnected to the arrest of Marby.

Other measures against esoteric groups were most probably the result of the general Nazi policy of suppressing lodge organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other developments===
In the years following the military defeat, there was a burgeoning occult movement in Germany and Austria. Significant figures in this milieu were [[Gustav Meyring]], [[Franz Spunda]] and [[Peryt Shou]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Esotericism in Nazi Germany==
{{Further|Nazism and occultism||Esoteric Nazism|religious aspects of Nazism|Ariosophy}}

===German Faith Movement===
{{main|German Faith Movement}}
The [[German Faith Movement]] led by [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]] during 1933-1945 propagated a move away from Christianity towards an "Aryan-Nordic religion", partly [[Hinduism in the West|inspired by Hinduism]].

===Suppression of Freemasonry and esotericism===
{{further|Friedrich Hielscher}}
The [[suppression of Freemasonry]] in Nazi Germany also reached the level of outright [[persecution]]. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were murdered under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="holocaust"&gt;Christopher Hodapp. 2005. Freemasons for Dummies, Wiley Publishing Inc., Indianapolis, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The lodge [[Liberté chérie]] was founded in a concentration camp. Freemasons, who were sent to concentration camps, were sent there as political prisoners, and consequently forced to wear an inverted red triangle. (see: [[Nazi concentration camp badges]])

Within the Nazi ideology it was alleged that Freemasonry was part of "the Jewish conspiracy". Since many esoteric groups emulated the lodge structure of Freemasonry, they were "caught in the National Socialist anti-Masonic law of 1935".&lt;ref name=Bramwell50&gt;Bramwell 1985: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Even "the German Order of Druids" was closed down, "protesting to the last that they were not Freemasons but good, German Druids."&lt;ref name=Bramwell50&gt;Bramwell 1985: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In her biography of [[Richard Walther Darré]], the historian Anna Bramwell also remarks that a secret society called the Skald Order "was banned by the Nazis after 1933 because of its allegedly masonic nature."&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the Skald held office in the Third Reich, including Dr [[Ludolf Haase]] (a founder member of the Skald), [[Herbert Backe]] and [[Theo Gross]]; all came under covert investigation, though Backe is said to have been cleared of disloyalty by Heydrich from his deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Nazi ideology had a special view concerning the various esoteric doctrines (aside from confusing them with Freemasonry) is not clear. Concerning [[Anthroposophy]], a book whose title denounced [[Rudolf Steiner]] as a fraud (''Schwindler'') and a false prophet had been published by Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch. 1930. ''"Doktor Steiner - ein Schwindler wie keiner"''. Ein Kapital über Anthroposophie und die geistige Arbeit der 'Falschen Propheten'. Munich. See: Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 284 (Bibliography).&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz-Bostunitsch had been an "enthusiastic Anthroposophist" from 1923, but was disaffected by 1929 and later joined the SS.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrology was officially interdicted in Nazi Germany after 1938.&lt;ref name="DLF"&gt;[http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/dasfeature/774541/ Nostradamus und die Nazis] {{de icon}} - A 'Feature' of [[Deutschlandfunk]] (German national radio) that was aired on September 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Nazis had sympathizing astrologers write favourable interpretations of [[Nostradamus]] for [[psychological warfare]],&lt;ref name="DLF"/&gt; and as late as 1936 Hitler personally sent a greetings telegram to an international astrologer's congress that was taking place in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name="DLF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://images.google.com/hosted/life/b1ed1d8761e1ae4a.html Telegram from Hitler to Dr. Korsch, President of the International Astrological Congress.] Image obtained by Life magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full focus of the state was not aimed at religious groups until 9 June 1941&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell 1985: 178.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the head of the security police, banned lodge organizations and esoteric groups in the wake of the flight to Scotland by [[Rudolf Hess]], who had been attracted and influenced by the [[Biodynamic agriculture|organic farming]] theories of [[Rudolf Steiner]] and Anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 175, 177. When organic farmers and their supporters &amp;mdash; and even [[nudist]]s &amp;mdash; were arrested, Agriculture Minister [[Richard Walther Darré]] protested to Himmler and Heydrich, "despite a letter from [[Martin Bormann|Bormann]], warning Darré that Hitler was behind the arrests" (''ibid.'', 178).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the suppression of esoteric organisations began very soon after the Nazis acquired governmental power. Dr. Anna Bramwell points out that "occultist racialists were banned as early as 1934."&lt;ref name="Bramwell 1985: 42"/&gt;

Allegedly the [[Magic (illusion)|stage magician]] and [[occult]]ist [[Franz Bardon]] had attracted the notice of Adolf Hitler ''"like other workers for the Light"'' and was incarcerated in a concentration camp for three and a half months in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Merkur Publishing: [http://www.merkurpublishing.com/franz_bardon_bio.htm Franz Bardon Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002181045/http://www.merkurpublishing.com/franz_bardon_bio.htm |date=2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move away from earlier Nazi esotericism===
The [[Thule Society]] was dissolved still in the 1920s, well before Hitler's rise to power, and the anti-Masonic legislation of 1935 closed down esoteric organisations including ''völkisch'' occultist ones.

[[Karl Maria Wiligut]], the chief occultist influence on the Nazi establishment, retired in 1939. [[Alfred Rosenberg]],  whose 1930 ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' had been important in the foundation of Nazi racist ideology, and [[Heinrich Himmler]], who added a number of occultist "design elements" to the [[Schutzstaffel]], did remain high ranking party members throughout the war. Himmler's mystic tendencies can be seen in the [[Ahnenerbe]] organization and the [[Wewelsburg]] castle.

According to their private writings,&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler's Table Talk'', page 61, translated by Norman Cameron and R.H. Stevens, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mein Kampf'', chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; the leaders of the [[Nazism|Nazi Party]] in Germany did not wish to encourage forms of paganism which did not serve to further their goals of promoting pan-Germanic ethnic consciousness.

Already in 1927, Hitler had fired the [[Gauleiter]] of [[Thuringia|Thüringen]], [[Artur Dinter]], from his post because he wanted too much to make a religion of Aryan racial purity. In 1928, Dinter was expelled from the party when he publicly attacked Hitler about this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|d/dinter_a|band=18|autor=Andreas Schulz and [[Matthias Wolfes]]|artikel=Dinter, Artur|spalten=350-360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf von Sebottendorff]] had been involved in the [[Thule Society]]. In January 1933 he published ''Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundlich aus der Frühzeit der Nationalsozialistischen Bewegung'' (Before Hitler Came: Documents from the Early Days of the National Socialist Movement). Nazi authorities  disliked the book, which was banned in the following year. Sebottendorff was arrested but managed to flee to [[Turkey]].

==After 1945==
Other than popular [[Western astrology]], there is also a school of thought regarding [[Germanic Runic Astrology]] and its usage in divination within the northern tradition of [[Odinism]].

The work of [[Friedrich Bernhard Marby]] was continued by Rudolf Arnold Spieth, who also published one of his works posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Gugenberger: [http://logo.at/artikel.dws?ffitem=435&amp;TEMPLATE=NEWS&amp;TID=DWBCDJAREGLBBQ Friedrich Bernhard Marby] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928123708/http://logo.at/artikel.dws?ffitem=435&amp;TEMPLATE=NEWS&amp;TID=DWBCDJAREGLBBQ |date=2007-09-28 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival of [[Neopaganism in German-speaking Europe|Neopaganism in Germany and Austria]] began in the 1970s.
Since the 1980s, mainstream esotericism in German-speaking Europe has been dominated by generic [[New Age]] syncretism as it developed in the [[United States]].

__NOTOC__
'''Ethnolinguistics''' (sometimes called '''cultural linguistics''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferraro |first=Gary |title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2006 |isbn=0-495-10008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a field of [[linguistics]] that studies the relationship between language and culture and how different [[ethnic group]]s perceive the world. It is the combination between [[ethnology]] and linguistics. The former refers to the way of life of an entire community: all the characteristics that distinguish one community from the other. Such characteristics make the cultural aspects of a community or a society.

Ethnolinguists study the way perception and conceptualization influences language and show how that is linked to different cultures and societies. An example is how spatial orientation is expressed in various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Heine|Heine, Bernd]] (1997) ''Cognitive Foundations of Grammar''. Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1974) ''Topophilia: A study of environmental perception, attitudes, and values.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, words for the [[cardinal direction]]s ''east'' and ''west'' are derived from terms for sunrise/sunset. The nomenclature for cardinal directions of [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] speakers of [[Greenland]], however, is based on geographical landmarks such as the river system and one's position on the coast. Similarly, the [[Yurok language|Yurok]] lack the idea of cardinal directions; they orient themselves with respect to their principal geographic feature, the [[Klamath River]].

Cultural Linguistics is a related branch of linguistics that explores the relationship between language and cultural conceptualisations.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"/&gt; Cultural Linguistics draws on and expands the theoretical and analytical advancements in cognitive science (including complexity science and distributed cognition) and anthropology. Cultural linguistics examines how various features of human languages encode cultural conceptualisations, including cultural schemas, cultural categories, and cultural metaphors.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"&gt;Sharifian, Farzad (2011). Cultural Conceptualisations and Language: Theoretical Framework and Applications. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Not a typo|Cultural Linguistics}}, language is viewed as deeply entrenched in the group-level, cultural cognition of communities of speakers. Thus far, the approach of Cultural Linguistics has been adopted in several areas of [[applied linguistic]] research, including [[intercultural communication]], [[second language learning]], Teaching English as an International Language, and [[World Englishes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, Farzad &amp; Palmer, Gary B. (eds.) (2007) Applied cultural linguistics: Implications for second language learning and intercultural communication. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Astronaut Centre''' ('''EAC''') (German: Europäisches Astronautenzentrum, French: Centre des astronautes européens), is an establishment of the [[European Space Agency]] and home of the [[European Astronaut Corps]]. It is near to [[Cologne]], [[Germany]], and is subdivided into six separate arms, these being Astronaut Training, Space Medicine, Astronaut Management&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/EAC/What_we_do|title=What we do|last=esa|newspaper=European Space Agency|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Human Exploration of the Moon as part of the Spaceship EAC initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/EAC/European_researchers_invited_to_board_Spaceship_EAC|title=European researchers invited to board Spaceship EAC|last=esa|newspaper=European Space Agency|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=European Space Agency on Youtube|title=SpaceShip EAC heading for the Moon|date=2016-02-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql566z4CNTY|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Communications. It provides training facilities for European and international partner astronauts (including a [[neutral buoyancy pool]]), particularly regarding ESA hardware for the [[International Space Station|ISS]] such as [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] and formerly the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]]. The overall European Astronaut Centre organisation is also in charge of the organisation of the training of European astronauts in the centers of other partners, such as the United States ([[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA Johnson Space Center]]), Russia ([[Star City, Russia|Star City]]), Canada ([[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]]) or Japan ([[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]]).

The Medical Operations arm (the [[Crew Medical Support Office]]) concentrates on providing health related support to the European astronauts and their families. Astronaut management supports and directs the careers and mission placements of the astronauts, and Education and PR are involved in activities related to education and outreach and the appropriate representation of the European astronauts and their space activities to the public.

==Early life and education==
Singer was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Jewish family, where his father was a jeweler and his mother a homemaker. When the Nazis invaded, the family fled, Singer leaving on a children's transport train with other Jewish children. He ended up in England, where he lived in [[Northumberland]], working for a time as a teenage optician. Several years later he emigrated to Ohio and became an American citizen in 1944.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, William Kenneth. ''The Change in the Weather''. Delta 2001, p. 245. Some of the details given by Scheuering and Stevens of Singer's flight from Vienna and the timing of it appear inconsistent. In fact Scheuering does not even mention such a flight: Scheuering does not even say that the family was Jewish. According to Scheuering the family was already in England in 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a B.E.E. in electrical engineering from [[Ohio State University]] in 1943, and an A.M. in physics from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1944. He taught physics at Princeton while he worked on his masters and his doctorate, obtaining his Ph.D. there in 1948. His doctoral thesis was titled, "''The density spectrum and latitude dependence of extensive cosmic ray air showers''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Singer, S.

==Career==

===1950: United States Navy===
After his masters, Singer joined the Armed Forces, working for the United States Navy on [[Naval mine|mine warfare]] and countermeasures from 1944 until 1946. While with the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]] he developed an arithmetic element for an electronic [[digital calculator]] that he called an "electronic brain". He was discharged in 1946 and joined the Upper Atmosphere Rocket Program at the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] in Silver Spring, Maryland, working there until 1950. He focused on [[ozone]], [[cosmic ray]]s, and the [[ionosphere]], all measured using balloons and rockets launched from [[White Sands, New Mexico]], or from ships out at sea. [[Rachel White Scheuering]] writes that for one mission to launch a rocket, he sailed with a naval operation to the [[Arctic]], and also conducted rocket launching from ships at the equator.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

From 1950 to 1953, he was attached to the U.S. Embassy in London as a scientific [[liaison officer]] with the [[Office of Naval Research]], where he studied research programs in Europe into [[cosmic radiation]] and [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Current biography yearbook'', Volume 10, H. W. Wilson Company, 1956; [http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html S. Fred Singer, Ph.D.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928135220/http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html |date=2006-09-28 }}, Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project, accessed May 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he was one of eight delegates with a background in [[guided weapons]] projects to address the Fourth International Congress of Astronautics in Zurich in August 1953, at a time when, as ''The New York Times'' reported, most scientists saw [[space flight]] as thinly disguised science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hillaby, John.

===1951: Design of early satellites===
[[File:MOUSE (Fred Singer).jpg|thumb|200px|Singer's MOUSE satellite, which he designed in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=mouse/&gt;]]

Singer was one of the first scientists to urge the launching of earth satellites for scientific observation during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=NYTJuly1962/&gt; In 1951 or 1952 he proposed the MOUSE ("Minimal Orbital Unmanned Satellite, Earth"), a {{convert|100|lb}} satellite that would contain [[Geiger counter]]s for measuring [[cosmic rays]], photo cells for scanning the Earth, [[telemetry]] electronics for sending data back to Earth, a magnetic data storage device, and rudimentary [[solar cell|solar energy cell]]s. Although MOUSE never flew, the ''Baltimore News Post'' reported in 1957 that had Singer's arguments about the need for satellites been heeded, the U.S. could have beaten Russia by launching the [[Sputnik 1|first earth satellite]].&lt;ref name=mouse&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19731670000 "Satellite, MOUSE, Concept Model"], Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, accessed May 15, 2010; for a diagram of the MOUSE and ''Baltimore News Post'' reference, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20150621055347/http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U1294093INP/diagram-of-mouse-satellite Diagram of MOUSE satellite], Corbis Images, accessed May 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed (along with R. C. Wentworth) that satellite measurement of ultraviolet backscatter could be used as a method to measure atmospheric ozone profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=S.

===1953: University of Maryland===
Singer moved back to the United States in 1953, where he took up an associate professorship in physics at the University of Maryland, and at the same time served as the director of the Center for Atmospheric and Space Physics. Scheuering writes that his work involved conducting experiments on rockets and satellites, remote sensing, [[radiation belts]], the [[magnetosphere]], and [[meteorites]]. He developed a new method of launching rockets into space: firing them from a high-flying plane, both with and without a pilot. The Navy adopted the idea and Singer supervised the project. He received a White House Special Commendation from [[President Eisenhower]] in 1954 for his work.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

He became one of 12 board members of the [[American Astronautical Society]], an organization formed in 1954 to represent the country's 300 leading scientists and engineers in the area of guided missiles—he was one of seven members of the board to resign in December 1956 after a series of disputes about the direction and control of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Schumach, Murray. [https://www.nytimes.com/1956/12/03/archives/planet-scientists-collide-break-up-7-of-12-astronautical-society.html?sq=%2522fred%2520singer%2522&amp;scp=88&amp;st=cse "Planet Scientists Collide, Break Up"], ''The New York Times'', December 3, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1957 Singer and other scientists at the university successfully designed and fired three new "Oriole" rockets off the Virginia Capes. The rockets weighed less than {{convert|25|lb}} and could be built for around $2000. Fired from a converted Navy [[Landing Ship Medium|LSM]], they could reach an altitude of {{convert|50000|ft|m}} and had a complete telemetry system to send back information on cosmic, ultraviolet and X-rays. Singer said that the firings placed "the exploration of outer space with high altitude rockets on the same basis, cost-wise and effort-wise, as low atmosphere measurements with weather balloons. From now on, we can fire thousands of these rockets all over the world with very little cost."&lt;ref&gt;"Maryland U. Fires Three New Rockets," ''The Washington Post'', November 8, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1958, when he was head of the cosmic ray group of the University of Maryland's physics department, he was congratulated in a telegram to the president of the university from President Eisenhower for his work in satellite research.&lt;ref&gt;"President Lauds Physicist Singer," ''The Washington Post'', February 4, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1958, he was appointed as a consultant to the House Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration, which was preparing to hold hearings on President Eisenhower's proposal for a new agency to handle space research, and a month later received the Ohio State University's Distinguished Alumnus Award.&lt;ref&gt;"Singer Appointed Space Consultant," ''The Washington Post'', April 6, 1958.

In a January 1960 presentation to the American Physical Society, Singer sketched out his vision of what the environment around the earth might consist of, extending up to {{convert|40000|mi|km}} into space.&lt;ref&gt;Osmundsen, John A. [https://www.nytimes.com/1960/01/30/archives/scientist-looks-40000-miles-out-believes-the-earth-may-have-two.html?sq=%2522fred%2520singer%2522&amp;scp=21&amp;st=cse "Scientist 'looks' 40,000 miles out"], ''The New York Times'', January 30, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; He became known for his early predictions about the properties of the electrical particles trapped around the earth, which were partly verified by later discoveries in satellite experiments. In December 1960, he suggested the existence of a shell of visible dust particles around the earth some 600 to {{convert|1000|mi|km}} in space, beyond which there was a layer of smaller particles, a micrometre or less in diameter, extending 2,000 to {{convert|4000|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, Robert K. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A12FB3D541A7A93CAAB1789D95F448685F9&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=%22S.%20Fred%20Singer%22&amp;st=cse "Scientists' Calculations Indicate Shell of Dust Surrounding Earth"], ''The New York Times'', December 28, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1961 Singer and another University of Maryland physicist, [[Ernst Öpik|E. J. Opik]], were given a $97,000 grant by NASA to conduct a three-year study of interplanetary gas and dust.&lt;ref&gt;"M.U. Professors get NASA grants," Associated Press, March 22, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960: Artificial Phobos hypothesis===
In a 1960 ''Astronautics'' newsletter, Singer commented on [[Iosif Shklovsky]]'s hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;I. S. Shklovsky, ''The Universe, Life, and Mind'', Academy of Sciences USSR, Moscow, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iosif S. Shklovski and Carl Sagan. ''Intelligent Life in the Universe'', San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; that the orbit of the [[Mars|Martian]] moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] suggests that it is hollow, which implies it is of artificial origin. Singer wrote: "My conclusion there is, and here I back Shklovsky, that if the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them."&lt;ref&gt;S. F. Singer, "More on the Moons of Mars", ''Astronautics'', February 1960, American Astronautical Society, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Later measurements confirmed Singer's ''big "if"'' caveat: Shklovsky overestimated Phobos' rate of altitude loss due to bad early data.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Öpik,  "News and Comments: Phobos, Nature of Acceleration".

''Time'' magazine wrote in 1969 that Singer had had a lifelong fascination with Phobos and Mars's second moon, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. He told ''Time'' it might be possible to pull Deimos into the Earth's orbit so it could be examined.&lt;ref name=Time1969/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=gL9scSG3K_gC&amp;dat=19690127&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en "Scientist Urges U.S. Seizure of a Martian Moon"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', January 27, 1969, p2&lt;/ref&gt;  During an international space symposium in May 1966, attended by space scientists from the United States and Soviet Union, he first proposed that manned [[Phobos (moon)#Future missions|landings on the Martian moons]] would be a logical step after a manned landing on the Earth's moon. He pointed out that the very small sizes of Phobos and Deimos—approximately {{convert|14|mi|km}} and {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} in diameter and sub milli-[[g-force|g]] surface gravity—would make it easier for a spacecraft to land and take off again.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Walter.

===1962: National Weather Center and University of Miami===
In 1962, on leave from the university, Singer was named as the first director of meteorological satellite services for the National Weather Satellite Center, now part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], and directed a program for using satellites to forecast the weather.&lt;ref name=NYTJuly1962&gt;''The New York Times''.

He told ''Time'' magazine in 1969 that he enjoyed moving around. "Each move gave me a completely new perspective," he said. "If I had sat still, I'd probably still be measuring [[cosmic rays]], the subject of my thesis at Princeton. That's what happens to most scientists."&lt;ref name=Time1969&gt;''Time'' magazine.

In 1964, he became the first dean of the School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences at the University of Miami in 1964, the first school of its kind in the country, dedicated to space-age research.&lt;ref&gt;Terte, Robert H. [https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/15/archives/a-dean-for-earth-and-space.html "A Dean for Earth and Space"], ''The New York Times'', March 15, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1965, ''The New York Times'' reported on a conference Singer hosted in Miami Beach during which five groups of scientists, working independently, presented research identifying what they believed was the remains of a primordial flash that occurred when the universe was born.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Walter.

===1967: Department of Interior and EPA===
In 1967 he accepted the position of deputy assistant secretary with the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]], where he was in charge of water quality and research. When the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] was created on 1970, he became its deputy assistant administrator of policy.

===1971–1994 University of Virginia===
Singer accepted a professorship in Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia in 1971, a position he held until 1994, where he taught classes on environmental issues such as ozone depletion, acid rain, climate change, population growth, and public policy issues related to oil and energy.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1987 he took up a two-year post as chief scientist at the Department of Transportation, and in 1989 joined the Institute of Space Science and Technology in Gainesville, Florida where he contributed to a paper on the results from the Interplanetary Dust Experiment using data from the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] satellite.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PSISDG002214000001000076000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes Long duration exposure facility (LDEF) interplanetary dust experiment (IDE) impact detector results]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he retired from Virginia in 1994, he became Distinguished Research Professor at the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University until 2000.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html S.

[[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik Conway]] say that Singer was involved in the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]]'s efforts to prevent regulatory action to reduce acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;Oreskes, Naomi and Erik M. Conway, "Chapter 3: Sowing the Seeds of Doubt," in Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming, New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2010: p66-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultancies===
Singer has worked as a consultant for several government agencies, including the House Select Committee on Space, NASA, the Government Accountability Office, the National Science Foundation, the United States Atomic Energy Commission, National Research Council, the Department of Defense Strategic Defense Initiative, Department of Energy Nuclear Waste Panel, and the Department of the Treasury. Other clients have included the states of Virginia, Alaska, and Pennsylvania. In the private sector he has worked for [[Mitre Corporation]], [[General Electric]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors]]; during the late 1970s Singer consulted with [[Exxon]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Unocal Corporation|Unocal Sun Oil]], and [[ARCO]]; and [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Martin Marietta|Martin–Marietta]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[ANSER]], and [[IBM]] on space research.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; He has also advised the [[Independent Institute]], the [[American Council on Science and Health]], and [[Frontiers of Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=496 S.

==Public debates==

===Writing===
Throughout his academic career Singer has written frequently in the mainstream press, including ''The New York Times'', ''The Washington Post'', and ''Wall Street Journal'', often striking up positions disputing mainstream thinking. His overall position is one of distrust of federal regulations and a strong belief in the efficacy of the [[free market]]. He believes in what Rachel White Scheuering calls "free market environmentalism": that market principles and incentives should be sufficient to lead to the protection of the environment and conservation of resources.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt; Regular themes in his articles have been energy, oil embargoes, [[OPEC]], [[Iran]], and rising prices. Throughout the 1970s, for example, he downplayed the idea of an [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis]] and said it was largely a media event.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html "S. Fred Singer Ph.D."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928135220/http://www.sepp.org/about%20sepp/bios/singer/cvsfs.html |date=2006-09-28 }}, Scientific &amp; Environmental Protection Project, accessed May 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In several papers in the 1990s and 2000s he struck up other positions against the mainstream, questioning the link between [[UV-B]] and [[melanoma]] rates, and that between [[Haloalkane#Chlorofluoro compounds (CFC, HCFC, HFC)|CFCs]] and stratospheric ozone loss.&lt;ref name="Ozone, Skin Cancer, and the SST"/&gt;

In October 1967, Singer wrote an article for ''The Washington Post'' from the perspective of 2007. His predictions included that planets had been explored but not colonized, and although rockets had become more powerful they had not replaced aircraft and ramjet vehicles. None of the fundamental laws of physics had been overturned. There was increased reliance on the electronic computer and data processor; the most exciting development was the increase in human intellect by direct electronic storage of information in the brain—the coupling of the brain to an external computer, thereby gaining direct access to an information library.&lt;ref name=SingerOct1967&gt;Singer, S. Fred. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/185635742.html?FMT=AI&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Oct+1%2C+1967&amp;author=By+S.+Fred+Singer&amp;desc=Looking+Back+From+A.D.+2007 "Looking Back From A.D. 2007"], ''The Washington Post'', October 1, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

He debated the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] on ABC's ''Nightline'', Sagan arguing that, if enough fire-fighting teams were not assembled in short order, and if many fires were left to burn over a period of months to possibly a year, the smoke might loft into the [[upper atmosphere]] and lead to massive agricultural failures over South Asia. Singer argued that it would rise to {{convert|3000|ft|m}} then be rained out after a few days.&lt;ref&gt;"First Israeli scud fatalities oil fires in Kuwait", ''Nightline'', ABC News, January 22, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, both Sagan and Singer were incorrect; smoke plumes from the oil fires rose to 10,000&amp;ndash;12,000 feet and lingered for nearly a month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/owf_ii/owf_ii_s04.htm#IV.%20AIR%20POLLUTANTS%20FROM%20OIL%20FIRES%20AND%20OTHER%20SOURCES | title = Environmental Exposure Report: Oil Well Fires | publisher = U.S. Department of Defense | date = 2 August 2000 | accessdate = 15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but despite absorbing 75&amp;ndash;80% of the sun's radiation in the Persian Gulf area the plumes had little global effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hobbs PV, Radke LF |title=Airborne studies of the smoke from the kuwait oil fires |journal=Science |volume=256 |issue=5059 |pages=987–91 | date=May 1992 |pmid=17795001 |doi=10.1126/science.256.5059.987 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17795001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public debates in which Singer has received most criticism have been about [[second-hand smoke]] and global warming. He has questioned the link between second-hand smoke and [[lung cancer]], and has been an outspoken opponent of the mainstream scientific view on [[climate change]]; he argues there is no evidence that increases in [[carbon dioxide]] produced by human beings is causing [[global warming]] and that the temperature of the earth has always varied.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; A CBC ''Fifth Estate'' documentary in 2006 linked these two debates, naming Singer as a scientist who has acted as a consultant to industry in both areas, either directly or through a public relations firm.&lt;ref name=CBCsmoking/&gt; [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway|Erik Conway]] named Singer in their book, ''[[Merchants of Doubt]]'', as one of three contrarian physicists&amp;mdash;along with [[Fred Seitz]] and [[William Nierenberg|Bill Nierenberg]]&amp;mdash;who regularly injected themselves into the public debate about contentious scientific issues, positioning themselves as skeptics, their views gaining traction because the media gives them equal time out of a sense of fairness.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Seth.

===Second-hand smoke===
According to [[David Biello]] and [[John Pavlus]] in ''[[Scientific American]]'', Singer is best known for his denial of the health risks of [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;Biello, David and Pavlus, John. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=even-skeptics-admin-global-warming-is-real-video "Even Skeptics Admit Global Warming is Real"], ''Scientific American'', March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in 1994 as writer and reviewer of a report on the issue by the [[Alexis de Tocqueville Institution]], where he was a senior fellow.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, S. Fred and Jeffreys, Kent. [http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/action/document/page?tid=ymo86b00&amp;page=18 "The EPA and the Science of Environmental Tobacco Smoke"], courtesy of the University of California, San Francisco, see page 18 for the authors, undated, accessed May 18, 2010. A prepublication draft of the report was archived in the files of Walter Woodson, Vice President-Public Affairs of the Tobacco Institute: [http://tobaccodocuments.org/lor/92756102-6120.html scan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329220215/http://tobaccodocuments.org/lor/92756102-6120.html |date=2013-03-29 }} (accessed Dec. 26 2012). When the report was released by the de Tocqueville institution as the first chapter of the report ''Science, Economics, and Environmental Policy: A Critical Examination'', Singer's credit was changed from lead author to "reviewer".
* For the final version of the report, see [http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/documentStore/d/v/r/dvr49b00/Sdvr49b00.pdf "Science, Economics, and Environmental Policy: A Critical Examination"], Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, August 11, 1994, accessed Dec. 26 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The report criticized the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for their 1993 study about the cancer risks of passive smoking, calling it "junk science". Singer told [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''The Fifth Estate'' in 2006 that he stood by the position that the EPA had "cooked the data" to show that [[second-hand smoke]] causes lung cancer. CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. "They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'" he said. "In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money. That's not my business."&lt;ref name=CBCsmoking /&gt; In December 2010 he wrote in ''[[American Thinker]]'' that he is nonsmoker who finds [[second-hand smoke]] an unpleasant irritant that cannot be healthy; he also wrote that his father, a heavy smoker, died of [[emphysema]] when relatively young. According to Singer, he serves on the advisory board of an anti-smoking organization, and has never been paid by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] or the [[Tobacco politics|tobacco lobby]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, S. Fred. [http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/12/second_hand_smoke_lung_cancer.html "Secondhand Smoke, Lung Cancer, and the Global Warming Debate"], ''American Thinker'', December 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===
In a 2003 letter to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', Singer wrote that "there is no convincing evidence that the global climate is actually warming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Climate concern is just a tax ruse |last=Singer, |first=S. |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |location=[[London]] |date=November 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the CBC's ''Fifth Estate'' named Singer as one of [[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|a small group of scientists]] who have created what the documentary called a stand-off that is undermining the political response to global warming.&lt;ref name=CBCsmoking /&gt; The following year he appeared on the British Channel 4 documentary ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Owen and Adam, David. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/22/channel4.ofcom "Watchdog's verdict on Channel 4 climate film angers scientists"], ''The Guardian'', July 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer argues there is no evidence that the increases in carbon dioxide produced by humans cause global warming, and that if temperatures do rise it will be good for humankind. He told CBC: "It was warmer a thousand years ago than it is today. Vikings settled Greenland. Is that good or bad? I think it's good. They grew wine in England, in northern England. I think that's good. At least some people think so."&lt;ref&gt;"The Denial Machine," 20:10 mins.&lt;/ref&gt; "We are certainly putting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere," he told ''The Daily Telegraph'' in 2009. "However there is no evidence that this high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is making a detectable difference. It should in principle, however the atmosphere is very complicated and one cannot simply argue that just because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a greenhouse gas it causes warming."&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; He believes that radical environmentalists are exaggerating the dangers. "The underlying effort here seems to be to use global warming as an excuse to cut down the use of energy," he said. "It's very simple: if you cut back the use of energy, then you cut back economic growth. And believe it or not, there are people in the world who believe we have gone too far in economic growth."&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

In an article in ''American Thinker'', he complains about bad arguments used by the "deniers," saying that "Climate deniers are giving us skeptics a bad name."&lt;ref&gt;S. Fred Singer, [http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/02/climate_deniers_are_giving_us_skeptics_a_bad_name.html Climate Deniers Are Giving Us Skeptics a Bad Name], ''American Thinker,'' February 29, 2012 (accessed March 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

====SEPP and funding====
In 1990 Singer set up the [[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] (SEPP) to argue against preventive measures against global warming. After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt; He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950–1980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''—with the headline that day "Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science"—that climate models are faulty. In 2007 he collaborated on a study that found tropospheric temperature trends of "Climate of the 20th Century" models differed from satellite observations by twice the model mean uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, David H.; Christy, John R.; Pearson, Benjamin D.; Singer, S. Fred. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117857349/abstract "A comparison of tropical temperature trends with model predictions"], ''International Journal of Climatology'', 28: 1693, December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel White Scheuering writes that, when SEPP began, it was affiliated with the [[Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy]], a think tank founded by [[Unification Church]] leader [[Sun Myung Moon]].&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt; A 1990 article for the [[Cato Institute]] identifies Singer as the director of the science and environmental policy project at the Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy, on leave from the University of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, S.

Singer has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Scheuering argues that his conclusions concur with the economic interests of the companies that pay him, in that the companies want to see a reduction in environmental regulation.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

In August 2007 ''Newsweek'' reported that in April 1998 a dozen people from what it called "the denial machine" met at the [[American Petroleum Institute]]'s Washington headquarters. The meeting included Singer's group, the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], and ExxonMobil. Newsweek said that, according to an eight-page memo that was leaked, the meeting proposed a $5-million campaign to convince the public that the science of global warming was controversial and uncertain. The plan was leaked to the press and never implemented.&lt;ref name=Begley&gt;Begley, Sharon. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/32482/page/3 "The Truth About Denial"], ''Newsweek'', August 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The week after the story, ''Newsweek'' published a contrary view from [[Robert Samuelson]], one of its columnists, who said the story of an industry-funded denial machine was contrived and fundamentally misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Robert. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/32312 "Greenhouse Simplicities"], ''Newsweek'', August 20–27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ABC News reported in March 2008 that Singer said he is not on the payroll of the energy industry, but he acknowledged that SEPP had received one unsolicited charitable donation of $10,000 from ExxonMobil, and that it was one percent of all donations received. Singer said that his connection to Exxon was more like being on their mailing list than holding a paid position.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Harris, Dan et al.

Congresswoman Lynn Rivers questioned Singer's credibility during a congressional hearing in 1995, saying he had not been able to publish anything in a peer-reviewed scientific journal for the previous 15 years, except for one technical comment.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michaels|first=P.

====Criticism of the IPCC====
{{Main article|Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC)}}
In 1995 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) issued [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|a report]] reflecting the scientific consensus that the balance of evidence suggests there is a discernible human influence on global climate. Singer responded with a letter to ''Science'' saying the IPCC report had presented material selectively. He wrote: "the Summary does not even mention the existence of 18 years of weather satellite data that show a slight global cooling trend, contradicting all theoretical models of climate warming."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Fred. [http://www.sepp.org/Archive/controv/ipcccont/Item07.htm "Letter to Science: Changes in the Climate Change Report"], Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project, July 3, 1996, accessed October 30, 2010. [https://www.webcitation.org/5trPqlvPc?url=http://www.sepp.org/Archive/controv/ipcccont/Item07.htm Archived] on October 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Scheuering writes that Singer acknowledges the surface thermometers from weather stations show warming, but he argues that the satellites provide better data because their measurements cover pole to pole.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;
According to Edward Parson and [[Andrew Dessler]], the satellite data did not show surface temperatures directly, but had to be adjusted using models. When adjustment was made for transient events the data showed a slight warming, and research suggested that the discrepancy between surface and satellite data was largely accounted for by problems such as instrument differences between satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Parson, Edward A., and Dessler, Andrew E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pvq4-5EdkW8C&amp;pg=PA35 ''The Science and Politics of Global Climate Change: A Guide to the Debate'']. Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer wrote the "[[Leipzig Declaration|Leipzig Declaration on Global Climate Change in the U.S.]]" in 1995, updating it in 1997 to rebut the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: "Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol—to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community—is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living."&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

Scheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned. At least 20 were television weather reporters, some did not have science degrees, and 14 were listed as professors without specifying a field. According to Scheuering, some of them later said they believed they were signing a document in favour of action against climate change.&lt;ref name = "scheuering2004" /&gt;

{{anchor|NIPCC}}Singer set up the '''Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change''' (NIPCC) after a 2004 United Nations climate conference in Milan. NIPCC organized an international climate workshop in Vienna in April 2007,&lt;ref name=nature1/&gt; to provide what they called an independent examination of the evidence for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harriette and Bast, Joseph L. [http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=23062 "Climate Change Conference Invigorates Global Warming Debate"], ''Environment News'', The Heartland Institute, May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer prepared an NIPCC report called "Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate," published in March 2008 by [[The Heartland Institute]], a conservative think tank.&lt;ref name=nature1&gt;Singer, S. Fred (ed.). [http://www.heartland.org/article.cfm?artId=22835 "Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate"], Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, March 2, 2008, accessed May 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ABC News said the same month that unnamed climate scientists from NASA, Stanford, and Princeton who spoke to ABC about the report dismissed it as "fabricated nonsense". In a letter of complaint to ABC News, Singer said their piece used "prejudicial language, distorted facts, libelous insinuations, and anonymous smears".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

On September 18, 2013, the NIPCC's fourth report, entitled ''Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science,'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://heartland.org/media-library/pdfs/CCR-II/Summary-for-Policymakers.pdf | title=Summary for Policymakers | publisher=[[The Heartland Institute]] | date=September 2013 | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with previous NIPCC reports, environmentalists criticized it upon its publication; for example, [[David Suzuki]] wrote that it was "full of long-discredited claims, including that carbon dioxide emissions are good because they stimulate life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/david-suzuki/climate-change-deniers_b_3984750.html | title=Climate Change Deniers Don't Deserve an Equal Voice | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=25 September 2013 | accessdate=14 March 2014 | author=Suzuki, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report received favorable coverage from [[Fox News Channel]]'s [[Doug McKelway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/19/new-study-says-threat-global-warming-greatly-exaggerated/ | title=New study says threat of man-made global warming greatly exaggerated | work=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=19 September 2013 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=McKelway, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt; climate scientists [[Kevin Trenberth]] and [[Michael Oppenheimer]] criticized this coverage, with Trenberth calling it "irresponsible journalism" and Oppenheimer calling it "flat out wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/09/18/fox-equates-faux-un-climate-report-with-the-rea/195947 | title=Fox Equates Faux UN Climate Report With The Real Thing | work=[[Media Matters for America]] | date=18 September 2013 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=McKelway, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climategate====
In December 2009, after the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]], Singer wrote an opinion piece for Reuters in which he said the scientists had misused [[peer review]], pressured editors to prevent publication of alternative views, and smeared opponents. He said the leaked e-mails showed that the "surface temperature data that [[IPCC]] relies on is based on distorted raw data and [[algorithm]]s that they will not share with the science community." He argued that the incident exposed a flawed process, and that the temperature trends were heading downwards even as [[greenhouse gas]]es like [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] were increasing in the [[atmosphere]]. He wrote: "This negative correlation contradicts the results of the models that IPCC relies on and indicates that [[anthropogenic global warming]] (AGW) is quite small," concluding "and now it turns out that global warming might have been 'man made' after all."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Fred S. [http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2009/12/14/climate-skeptic-we-are-winning-the-science-battle/ "Climate skeptic: We are winning the science battle"], Reuters, December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[British House of Commons]] [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] later issued a report that exonerated the scientists,&lt;ref&gt;Gillis, Justin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/science/earth/08climate.html "British Panel Clears Climate Scientists"], ''The New York Times'', July 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''frictionless plane''' is a concept from the writings of [[Galileo Galilei]]. In his 1608 ''[[Two_New_Sciences#Day_3_Naturally_accelerated_motion|The Two New Sciences]]'', Galileo presented a formula that predicted the motion of an object moving down an [[inclined plane]]. His formula was based upon his past experimentation with free-falling bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Stillman, ''Galileo’s Experimental Confirmation of Horizontal Inertia: Unpublished Manuscripts.'' ''Isis'': Vol. 64, No. 3, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his model was not based upon experimentation with objects moving down an inclined plane, but from his conceptual modeling of the forces acting upon the object. Galileo understood the mechanics of the inclined plane as the combination of horizontal and vertical [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]]; the result of [[gravity]] acting upon the object, diverted by the [[slope]] of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;Settle, T. B. "An Experiment in the History of Science", ''Science'', 1061 ''133'' 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Galileo's equations do not contemplate [[friction]], and therefore do not perfectly predict the results of an actual [[experiment]]. This is because some energy is always lost when one mass applies a non-zero [[normal force]] to another. Therefore, the observed [[speed]], [[acceleration]] and distance traveled should be less than Galileo predicts.&lt;ref&gt; Jenkin, Fleeming. ''On Friction Between Surfaces at Low Speeds.'' Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 26 p. 93–94 &lt;/ref&gt; This energy is lost in forms like sound and heat. However, from Galileo's predictions of an object moving down an inclined plane in a frictionless environment, he created the theoretical foundation for extremely fruitful real-world experimental prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, at p. 297–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Frictionless planes do not exist in the real world. However, if they did, one can be almost certain that objects on them would behave exactly as Galileo predicts. Despite their nonexistence, they have considerable value in the design of engines, motors, roadways, and even tow-truck beds, to name a few examples.&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, Alexandre ''Metaphysics and Measurement'', pp. 83–84 (1992). &lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of friction on an object moving down an inclined plane can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} = \mu_\mathrm{k} F_\mathrm{N}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_\mathrm{f} &lt;/math&gt; is the force of friction exerted by the object and the inclined plane on each other, parallel to the surface of the plane, &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normal force]] exerted by the object and the plane on each other, directed perpendicular to the plane, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of [[Friction#Kinetic_friction|kinetic friction]].&lt;ref&gt; Koyré, pp. 84–86. &lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the inclined plane is in a [[vacuum]], a (usually) small amount of [[potential energy]] is also lost to [[air drag]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5319">The '''Graduate Institute of Development Studies''' ('''GIDS''', [[French language|French]]: ''Institut universitaire d’études du développement'', '''IUED''') was a [[graduate school]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] focusing on [[development studies]]. Created in 1961 as the '''Institut Africain de Genève''' ('''African Institute of Geneva'''), GIDS's stated goal was to promote teaching and research concerning [[international development]] and to encourage students from the [[North-South divide|Global South]]. &lt;ref name=graduateinstitute&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home.html|publisher=graduateinstitute.ch|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=europaeum&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva|url=http://www.europaeum.org/europaeum/?q=node/43|publisher=europaeum.org|accessdate=1 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305194204/http://www.europaeum.org/europaeum/?q=node%2F43|archivedate=5 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=elliott-gwu&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|url=http://elliott.gwu.edu/graduate-study-abroad/geneva|publisher=elliott.gwu.edu|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=mastersportal&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva|url=http://www.mastersportal.eu/universities/661/graduate-institute-of-international-and-development-studies-geneva.html|publisher=mastersportal.eu|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GIDS trained several generations of development activists in Switzerland and in the world (including at PhD level after 1995) and was at the center of a huge international network. Very active in concrete development projects, the GIDS was also known in the francophone world for proposing an alternative and a critical view of development aid and world affairs [7], as well as for its journal, the Cahiers de l'IUED. It was also among the pioneer institutions in Europe for the intellectual development of the sustainable development perspective. Among its directors were Roy Preiswerk, Pierre Bungener, Jacques Forster (actual head of IHEID Foundation Board), Jean-Luc Maurer and Michel Carton. GIDS was attached to, but independent of, the [[University of Geneva]].

GIDS and the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] (HEI) are now integrated in a new institution, since the beginning of 2008, the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID). The new Institute combines the fields of development and [[international relations]] and offers a much wider choice of teaching and research activities. The [[Academic degree|degree]] programmes of each previous institution ([[Master's degree|master's]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in development studies, master's in international affairs, master's and Ph.D. in international studies) continue to be offered by the new combined institution.

'''Harald Lesch''' (born 28 July 1960 in [[Gießen]], [[Hessen]]) is a [[Germany|German]] physicist, astronomer, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], author, television presenter, professor of physics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] (LMU) and professor of natural philosophy at the [[Munich University of Philosophy]]. In the German speaking world, Lesch plays a similar role to that of [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]],{{cn|date=July 2017}} as a bridge between the scientific community and the public.

==Education==

After completing secondary school in 1978 at the Theo-Koch-Schule in [[Grünberg, Hesse]], Lesch studied physics at the [[University of Giessen]], then at the [[University of Bonn]], where he completed his doctoral degree in 1987 and worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy.  From 1988 to 1991 he was a research assistant at the state observatory at [[Heidelberg]]-Königstuhl.  In 1992 he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Toronto]].  In 1994 he was [[Habilitation|habilitated]] at the [[University of Bonn]].

==Work==
[[File:Harald Lesch Hannover 1.jpg|thumb|Lesch during a public lecture in 2010]]
Since 1995 Lesch has been a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the LMU Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de./people/lesch/lesch.html|title=Prof. Dr. Harald Lesch|publisher=LMU|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he teaches [[natural philosophy]] at the University for Philosophy in Munich.  His main areas of research are cosmic [[plasma physics]], [[black hole]]s, and [[neutron star]]s.  He is the expert on astrophysics in the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (DFG) (German Research Society) and a member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft (Astronomical Society). He is also a textbook author.

Lesch has made television appearances for the longstanding, self-presented production of the channel [[BR-alpha]]: alpha-Centauri, Lesch &amp; Co., Denker des Abendlandes (Thinkers of the Western World), and Alpha bis Omega (From Alpha to Omega). He also presented shorter television series.  His presentations attempt to make complex physical or philosophical issues more accessible to the public. In 2005 he was awarded the Communicator Prize by the DFG and the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Foundation for German Scholarship) for his television appearances and publications. To honor his work on making scientific findings understandable to the broad public, the Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu Emden (nature research society) awarded him an honorary membership on March 15, 2011.

==Television appearances==
For many years, Lesch has presented a number of television series for the channel BR-alpha, beginning with alpha-Centauri, in which he is to be seen since 1998. In "Lesch &amp; Co." and "Denker des Abendlandes" (thinkers of the occident), he converses with the philosophy professor [[Wilhelm Vossenkuhl]] about philosophical topics. Alpha bis Omega deals with contradiction and consistency of religion and natural science, through conversations between Lesch and the Catholic theologist Thomas Schwartz.

In celebration of the Year of Einstein 2005, BR-alpha aired the 8-part series The Physics of [[Albert Einstein]], where in each episode, one single scientific finding of Einstein was introduced by Lesch, who explained its significance. Starting in August 2007, the 16-part program The 4 Elements was aired weekly, which deals with the structure of the world, and in addition to scientific aspects, also handles cultural-historical aspects.

For the Pay-TV channel ''Syfy'' he differentiates scientifically based and fictional components of Star Trek in the series ''Star Trek – Science vs. Fiction''. From April to the end of 2007, Lesch moderated  the weekly 5-minute program sci_xpert for this channel, which dealt with viewer questions, which mostly had to do with feasibility of science fiction concepts (such as "How realistic are the huge spaceships from Independence Day?"), but which also addressed purely scientific topics (for example "What is gravity?"), which were handled in the tradition of alpha-Centauri.  There were a total of 35 episodes.

Since September 2008 Lesch has been presenting the [[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen|ZDF]] scholarly magazine ''Abenteuer Forschung'' (Adventures in Research). His predecessor was Joachim Bublath, who presented the show for many years.

At the start of the "International Year of Astronomy 2009", Lesch moderated in ZDF the 2½ hour special “How Light Was Born: the Long Night with Harald Lesch”, in which he, between short documentary films, led conversations with the cabaret artist and hobby-philosopher [[Christoph Süß]], the physics professor Günther Hasinger, and the theology professor Thomas Schwartz.

Since 2010, Lesch presents the show "Lesch's Kosmos", a 15-minute programme on the German documentary channel ZDFneo that deals with issues from various scientific fields.

Researchers in HII take on many tasks, including helping to design [[information systems]] from a biological perspective that conform to the requirements of different segments of society, along with other behaviour intended to improve interaction between humans and information systems.

'''iCivics, inc.''' (formerly Our Courts) is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] in the United States that provides [[Educational game|educational online games]] and lesson plans to promote [[civics]] education and encourage students to become active citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; iCivics was founded in 2008 by retired [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. iCivics’s stated mission is to “ensure every student receives a high-quality civic education, and becomes engaged in – and beyond – the classroom.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

iCivics, inc. is supported by private donations and grants and had annual expenses of $2.2 million in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among the top contributors were the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] and the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;iCivics, Inc. (2016). ''iCivics Annual Report 2015''.

==History==
Justice O’Connor developed the Our Courts project in partnership with [[Georgetown University Law School]] and [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icivics.org/news/icivics-celebrates-gaming-milestone|title=iCivics Celebrates Gaming Milestone|last=Curley|first=Jeffrey|publisher=iCivics|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cabengo.com/projects/our-courts/|title=Cabengo  » Our Courts|website=cabengo.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Justice O'Connor went on [[The Daily Show]] with [[Jon Stewart]] to promote Our Courts and civics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=220242&amp;title=sandra-day-o-connor-pt--1|title=Justice O'Connor Interview|last=The Daily Show|publisher=The Daily Show|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/03/04/justice-oconnor-not-only-smart-and-moderate-but-funny/|title=Justice O'Connor: Not Only Smart and Moderate...But Funny!|last=Jones|first=Ashby|date=4 March 2009|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Courts added ''Supreme Decision'' and ''Do I Have A Right?'' to the website in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/08/20/01civics.h29.html&amp;destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/08/20/01civics.h29.html&amp;levelId=2100|title=Celebrities Lend Weight to Promote Civics Education|date=August 20, 2009 (updated August 25, 2009)|work=[[Education Week]]|publisher=Education Week|author=Zehr, Mary Ann|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated as iCivics, inc. in May 2010 as the variety of content and users began to expand more rapidly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icivics.org/news/introducing-our-new-site|title=Introducing our new site {{!}} iCivics|website=www.icivics.org|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive website was launched, supplementing the gaming modules with classroom lessons on the branches of government.

[[Above the Law (blog)|Above The Law]] sponsored a ''Do I Have A Right?'' challenge in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/the-atl-do-i-have-a-right-challengecongratulations-from-justice-oconnor/|title=The ATL ‘Do I Have A Right?’ Challenge: Congratulations from Justice O’Connor|last=Lat|first=David|publisher=Above The Law|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice O'Connor was the keynote speaker at [[Games for Change]] in 2010, and iCivics was featured at the Games for Change conference in New York in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-tsai/al-gore-games-social-good_b_881017.html|title=Al Gore: 'Games Are the New Normal'|last=Tsai|first=Charles|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Washington Post]] Editorial Board highlighted the shortcomings of traditional civics education, and the efforts of iCivics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-history-and-civics-a-priority/2011/06/17/AGb1tYZH_story.html|title=Making History and Civics a Priority|last=Editorial Board|date=17 June 2011|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the website added seven games and 16 lesson plans, and had over 700,000 unique visitors.&lt;ref&gt;iCivics, Inc. (2012). ''Annual Report 2011''. Retrieved from www.guidestar.org/ViewEdoc.aspx?eDocId=2772999&amp;approved=True&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 it was the most widely adopted civics curriculum in America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Currently, the governing board of iCivics includes O’Connor as well as current Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the Honorable Robert Henry, president of Oklahoma City University. The executive director of iCivics is Louise Dubé, previously Managing Director of Digital Learning at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icivics.org/our-team|title=Our Team {{!}} iCivics|website=www.icivics.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Justice O’Connor initially envisioned Our Courts as a response to a perceived misunderstanding of the justice system in America.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As keynote speaker at the [[National Council for the Social Studies|NCSS]] annual conference in 2007, she noted “that while two-thirds of Americans know at least two judges on FOX Television’s ‘American Idol’ reality program, less than one in 10 can name the Chief Justice of the United States.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_matters_home/oconnor.html|title=Law Matters Winter 2008 {{!}} Justice O'Connor Addresses NCSS Conference|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, ourcourts.org maintains this mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourcourts.org/our-approach/|title=Our Approach - Our Courts America|website=ourcourts.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but iCivics has a broader mission incorporating education on the legislative and executive branches of government as well as civics at a local level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=www.guidestar.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25|quote=Self-reported}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization focuses on broadly improving civics education but also on closing the civics [[Achievement gap in the United States|education gap]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; O'Connor saw the state of civics education as a result of the failure of traditional education methods, as well as funding cuts and lower graduation requirements imposed by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/home/38146.htm|title=Courting Kids|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Courts collaborator [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], a professor of literacy at Arizona State University, convinced her that educational games were the key to civics education, due to their capacity to teach problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/technology/sandra-day-oconnor-supreme-court-video-games.html|title=A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games|last=Singer|first=Natasha|date=2016-03-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iCivics games have been evaluated for their educational effectiveness in a handful of research studies. ''Branches of Power'' was shown to be both engaging and educational for a majority of students in a test group.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Carrie, Jason Lancaster, Wilhelmina Savenye, and Nancy Haas. "A Formative Evaluation of the Balance of Power Game and Curriculum." ''The Journal of Applied Instructional Design'' 3, no. 3 (December 2013): 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of students also play the games again at home, greatly increasing absorption of concepts and improving test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trevorowens.org/portfolio/owens_Effects%20of%20learning%20from%20a%20civics%20video%20game.doc|title=Effects of learning from a civics video game|last=Owens|first=Trevor|date=December 2010|website=Trevor Owens|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general iCivics curriculum has been shown to be an effective mechanism for education on civics topics as measured by scores on the US citizenship test. It was particularly effective among younger students in grades 4-6 and less effective among high school seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeCompte|first=Karen|last2=Moore|first2=Brandon|last3=Blevins|first3=Brooke|date=Fall 2011|title=The Impact of iCivics on Students’ Core Civic Knowledge|url=|journal=Research in the Schools|volume=18|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive writing exercise Drafting Board also improved [[persuasive writing]] skills among 8th graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WP_76_KawashimaGinsberg.pdf|title=Summary of Findings from the Evaluation of iCivics’ Drafting Board Intervention|last=Kawashima-Ginsberg|first=Kei|date=December 2012|website=CIRCLE|publisher=THE CENTER FOR INFORMATION &amp; RESEARCH ON CIVIC LEARNING &amp; ENGAGEMENT|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is currently working on extending its curriculum to high school and reaching more high school educators. It currently serves one in four high school government and history teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/profile/38-3796793|title=iCivics - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lazzat Un Nisa''''' (from {{lang-ar|'''لذّتُ النّسا'''}} '''''The Pleasure of Woman''''') is an erotic Indian anecdote&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/07/10/stories/2003071000390100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfine"&gt;''Lazzat Un Nisa'',translated by Jane Fine, 2002, Classex Books Private Limited, {{ISBN|81-7858-003-9}}, 121 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/07/10/stories/2003071000390100.htm The Hindu's article about Lazzat Un Nisa] retrieved Dec 06, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lazzat un-niso'' Nur publisher, 1991 {{ISBN|5-640-01094-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Persian language]]. It depicts the art of sex through the role of jewellery and perfume in [[lovemaking]], erotic writing as literature, and [[pornography]] as [[aphrodisiac]]. The Book was hand-illustrated and hand-copied in Urdu and Persian in 1850 by writer Mohammed Abdul Latif Muzdar Mehdune.

==History==
The original manuscript dates back to the [[Qutb Shahi]] period. In the fifteenth century, the court of [[Bidar]] patronized such erotic works as the [[Bhog bal]], [[Thadkirat al-Shahawat]] (List of aphrodisiacs) and [[Srngaramanjari]] (erotic Bouquets). Lizzat Un Nisa is one of the few surviving erotics works from the period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/019579334X/ Scent in the Islamic Garden: A Study of Deccani Urdu Literary Sources] {{ISBN|0-19-579334-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another Kitab ul-Laddhat un-nisa which was written for a certain vizir Kukapondat by the same content and translated from Parsi into Russian. Actually the book itself has no pornographic or explicit sexual bias. It gives instructions how to classify women from their outer aspect starting from their apparel and ending with some parts of their body. In the Middle Ages Central Asia was the most important urbanized complex of cities and the area thrived of scientific research especially in the medical and terapeutic sciences (Avicenna and Rhazes were born there) and therefore it is very interesting to read which, maybe for a man living in these frantic cities, unexpected defaults could show up in the sexual life when making acquaintance with ladies and how he/she could recur to be treated by a doctor and by which special medical recipes. Lately this book became available in Italian with historical comments as per attached bibliography.

==Story==
The main subject of the story is a man named Harichand, who under orders of a king, embarks on a journey to collect exotic gifts and beautiful women for the pleasures of the king. The manuscript provides advice on various [[sexual techniques]].  It has a section on how to arouse a woman and observations based on sizes of a woman's vagina &lt;ref name="jfine"/&gt; and also a brief list of lengths of the phallus.

{{History of war}}

'''Military organization''' or '''military organisation''' is the structuring of the armed forces of a [[State (polity)|state]] so as to offer such [[military capability]] as a [[national defense policy]] may require. In some countries [[paramilitary]] forces are included in a nation's armed forces, though not considered military{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}. Armed forces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, such as [[Insurgency|insurgent]] forces, often [[mimic]] military organizations, or use ''[[ad hoc]]'' structures, while formal military organization tends to use [[hierarchical]] forms.

== History ==
{{sectstub|date=July 2018}}
The use of formalized [[Military rank#Roman ranks|ranks]] in a hierarchical structure came into widespread use with the [[Roman Army]].

In modern times, executive control, management and administration of military organization is typically undertaken by governments through a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] within the structure of [[public administration]], often known as a [[Ministry of Defense]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], or [[Department of War]]. These in turn manage [[Armed Services]] that themselves command formations and units specialising in combat, [[combat support]] and [[combat service support | combat-service support]].

==Executive control, management and administration==
The usually civilian or partly civilian executive control over the national military organization is exercised in [[democracy|democracies]] by an elected political leader as a member of the government's [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], usually known as a Minister of Defense. (In presidential systems, such as the United States, the president is the commander-in-chief, and the cabinet-level defense minister is second in command.) Subordinated to that position are often Secretaries for specific major operational divisions of the armed forces as a whole, such as those that provide general support services to the Armed Services, including their dependants.

Then there are the heads of specific departmental agencies responsible for the provision and management of specific skill- and knowledge-based service such as [[Strategy]] advice, [[Military capability|Capability Development]] assessment, or [[Military science|Defense Science]] provision of research, and design and development of technologies. Within each departmental agency will be found administrative branches responsible for further agency [[business|business specialization]] work.

==Armed services==

In most countries the ''armed forces'' are divided into three or four [[Armed services]] (also: ''service, military service, or military branch''): [[army]], [[navy]], and [[air force]].

Many countries have a variation on the standard model of three or four basic [[Armed Services]]. Some nations also organize their [[Marines (military)|marines]], [[special forces]] or [[ballistic missile|strategic missile]] forces as independent armed services. A nation's [[coast guard]] may also be an independent [[military branch]] of its military, although in many nations the coast guard is a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or civil agency. A number of countries have no navy, for geographical reasons. Some other variations include:

In larger armed forces the culture between the different [[Armed Services]] of the armed forces can be quite different.

Most smaller countries have a single organization that encompasses all armed forces employed by the country in question. Third-world armies tend to consist primarily of infantry, while first-world armies tend to have larger units manning expensive equipment and only a fraction of personnel in infantry units.

It is worthwhile to make mention of the term ''[[Joint warfare|joint]]''.  In western militaries, a [[joint warfare|joint force]] is defined as a unit or formation comprising representation of combat power from two or more branches of the military.

===Internal security forces===
[[Gendarmerie]]s, including equivalents such as [[Internal Troops]], [[Paramilitary|Paramilitary Forces]] and similar, are an internal security service common in most of the world, but uncommon in Anglo-Saxon countries where civil police are employed to enforce the law, and there are tight restrictions on how the armed forces may be used to assist.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States it is a common misunderstanding that their armed forces are totally prohibited from doing so by the [[Posse Comitatus Act]]. This Act, which reserves to Congress the power to employ Federal military force to enforce law and order, refers specifically only to the [[US Army]] and [[US Air Force]]. The [[US Marines]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] are separately regulated, and the [[US Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] has a clear law enforcement role in its peacetime status. The state-controlled [[Army National Guard]] (technically a branch of the US Army) is also excluded from the Posse Comitatus Act. The [[Insurrection Act]] specifically permits the President to use Federal military force to restore public order in extreme emergency situations: this Act was implemented during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|"Rodney King Riots"]] in Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Commands.2C_formations.2C_and_units}}

==Commands, formations and units==
{{Redirect|Military formation|the arrangement or deployment of moving military forces|Tactical formation}}

It is common, at least in the European and North American militaries, to refer to the building blocks of a military as commands, formations and units.

In a military context, a [[Command (military formation)|command]] is a collection of units and formations under the control of a single officer. Although during the [[Second World War]] a Command was also a name given to a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the [[US Army]], in general it is an administrative and executive [[military strategy|strategic]] [[headquarters]] which is responsible to the national government or the national military headquarters. It is not uncommon for a nation's services to each consist of their own command (such as Land Component, Air Component, Naval Component, and Medical Component in the [[Belgian Army]]), but this does not preclude the existence of commands which are not service-based.

{{Anchor|Formation}}A formation is defined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] as "two or more aircraft, ships, or units proceeding together under a commander".&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Defense]], [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html DOD Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223235143/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html |date=2008-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formin in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] emphasised its combined-arms nature: "Formations are those military organisations which are formed from different speciality Arms and Services troop units to create a balanced, combined combat force. The formations only differ in their ability to achieve different scales of application of force to achieve different strategic, operational and tactical goals and mission objectives."&lt;ref&gt;Fomin, N.N., Great Soviet Encyclopaedia ({{lang-ru|Большая Советская Энциклопедия}}), Moscow, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; It is a composite military organization that includes a mixture of integrated and operationally attached sub-units, and is usually combat-capable. Example of formations include: [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, [[battalion]]s, [[Wing (air force unit)|wings]], etc. Formation may also refer to [[tactical formation]], the physical arrangement or disposition of troops and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formation in such usage include: [[pakfront]], [[panzerkeil]], [[testudo formation]], etc.

A typical unit is a homogeneous military organization (either combat, [[Combat support|combat-support]] or non-combat in capability) that includes service personnel predominantly from a single arm of service, or a branch of service, and its administrative and command functions are self-contained. Any unit subordinate to another unit is considered its sub-unit or minor unit. It is not uncommon for unit and formation to be used synonymously in the United States. In Commonwealth practice, formation is not used for smaller organizations like battalions which are instead called "units", and their constituent [[platoon]]s or [[Company (military unit)|companies]] are referred to as sub-units. In the Commonwealth, formations are [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, etc.

Different [[armed forces]], and even different branches of service of the armed forces, may use the same name to denote different types of organizations. An example is the "squadron". In most navies a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] is a formation of several ships; in most air forces it is a unit; in the U.S. Army it is a battalion-sized [[cavalry]] unit; and in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armies a squadron is a company-sized sub-unit.

==Table of organization and equipment==
A [[table of organization and equipment]] (TOE or TO&amp;E) is a document published by the U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency that prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of Corps and Armies.

It also provides information on the mission and capabilities of a unit as well as the unit's current status. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as infantry) follow the same structural guidelines.

==Modern hierarchy==
Main article: ''[[Command hierarchy]]''
{{Military units}}

=== Army hierarchy ===
{{Army units}}

The following table gives an overview of some of the terms used to describe army hierarchy in armed forces across the world. Whilst it is recognized that there are differences between armies of different nations, many are modeled on the [[British Army|British]] or [[United States Armed Forces|American]] models, or both. However, many military units and formations go back in history for a long time, and were devised by various military thinkers throughout European history.

For example, the modern ''Corps'' was first introduced in France about 1805 by Napoleon as a more flexible tactical grouping of two or more divisions during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

They have become part of the organization of most armies around the world.

Rungs may be skipped in this ladder: for example, typically NATO forces skip from battalion to brigade. Likewise, only large military powers may have organizations at the top levels and different armies and countries may also use traditional names, creating considerable confusion: for example, a British or Canadian armored regiment (battalion) is divided into [[Squadron (army)|squadron]]s (companies) and [[troop]]s (platoons), whereas an American cavalry squadron (battalion) is divided into troops (companies) and platoons.

[[Army]], [[army group]], [[region]], and [[theater (military)|theatre]] are all large formations that vary significantly between armed forces in size and hierarchy position.  While [[Division (military)|division]]s were the traditional level at which support elements (field artillery, hospital, logistics and maintenance, etc.) were added to the unit structure, since World War II, many brigades now have such support units, and since the 1980s, regiments also have been receiving support elements.  A regiment with such support elements is called a [[regimental combat team]] in US military parlance, or a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the UK and other forces.

During [[World War II]] the [[Red Army]] used the same basic organizational structure.  However, in the beginning many units were greatly underpowered and their size was actually one level below on the ladder that is usually used elsewhere; for example, a division in the early-WWII Red Army would have been about the size of most nations' regiments or brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armor.kiev.ua/army/hist/doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |title=Доклад НКО август 1939. doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |publisher=Armor.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=121&amp;sid=92105 |script-title=ru:Центральный государственный архив Советской армии (с июня 1992 г.

Путеводитель. 1993 |language=ru |publisher=Guides.rusarchives.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the ladder, what other nations would call an army group, the Red Army called a [[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]. By contrast, during the same period the German [[Wehrmacht]] Army Groups, particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], such as [[Army Group Centre]] significantly exceeded the above numbers, and were more cognate with the Soviet [[Strategic Direction]]s.

=== Naval hierarchy ===
Naval organization at the flotilla level and higher is less commonly abided by, as ships operate in smaller or larger groups in various situations that may change at a moment's notice.  However, there is some common terminology used throughout navies to communicate the general concept of how many vessels might be in a unit.

Navies are generally organized into groups for a specific purpose, usually strategic, and these organizational groupings appear and disappear frequently based on the conditions and demands placed upon a navy.  This contrasts with army organization where units remain static, with the same men and equipment, over long periods of time.

The five-star ranks of Admiral of the Fleet and Fleet Admiral have largely been out of regular use since the 1990s, with the exception of ceremonial or honorary appointments. Currently, all major navies are commanded by an admiral (four-star rank) or vice-admiral (three-star rank) depending on relative size. Smaller naval forces, such as the RNZN, or those navies that are effectively coastguards, are commanded by a rear-admiral (two-star rank), commodore (one-star rank) or even a captain.

Aircraft carriers are typically commanded by a captain. Submarines and destroyers are typically commanded by a captain or commander.  Some destroyers, particularly smaller destroyers such as [[frigate]]s (formerly known as [[destroyer escort]]s) are usually commanded by officers with the rank of commander.  [[Corvette]]s, the smallest class of warship, are commanded by officers with the rank of commander or lieutenant-commander. Auxiliary ships, including [[gunboat]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], [[patrol boat]]s, military [[riverboat|riverine craft]], [[Ship's tender|tenders]] and [[torpedo boat]]s are usually commanded by lieutenants, sub-lieutenants or warrant officers.  Usually, the smaller the vessel, the lower the rank of the ship's commander.  For example, patrol boats are often commanded by [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]s, while frigates are rarely commanded by an officer below the rank of commander.

Historical navies were far more rigid in structure.  Ships were collected in divisions, which in turn were collected in numbered squadrons, which comprised a numbered fleet.  Permission for a vessel to leave one unit and join another would have to be approved on paper.

The modern U.S. Navy is primarily based on a number of standard groupings of vessels, including the [[carrier strike group]] and the [[Expeditionary Strike Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/ US Navy]. GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 2009-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Naval organization continues aboard a single ship. The complement forms three or four departments (such as tactical and engineering), each of which has a number of divisions, followed by work centers.

=== Air Force hierarchy ===
The organizational structures of air forces vary between nations: some air forces (such as the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]) are divided into commands, groups and squadrons; others (such as the [[Soviet Air Force]]) have an Army-style organizational structure.  The modern [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] uses [[Air Division (disambiguation)|Air Division]] as the formation between wings and the entire air command.  Like the RAF, Canadian wings consist of squadrons.

==Task force==
A [[task force]] is a unit or formation created as a temporary grouping for a specific operational purpose.  Aside from administrative hierarchical forms of organization that have evolved since the early 17th century in Europe, fighting forces have been grouped for specific operational purposes into mission-related organizations such as the German [[Kampfgruppe]] or the U.S. Combat Team (Army) and Task Force (Navy) during the Second World War, or the Soviet [[Operational manoeuvre group]] during the Cold War. In the British and Commonwealth armies the [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] became the usual grouping of companies during the [[Second World War]] and the Cold War.

Within NATO, a [[Joint Task Force]] (JTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one armed service, a Combined Task Force (CTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one nation, and a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements of more than one armed service and more than one nation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73586">'''Mormon studies''' is the [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[list of academic disciplines|academic]] study of the [[beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|beliefs, practices]], [[Latter Day Saint movement#History|history]] and [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]] of those known by the term ''[[Mormon]]'' and [[list of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations]] belonging to the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] whose members do not generally go by the term "Mormon". The Latter Day Saint movement includes not only [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) but also the [[Community of Christ]] (CoC) and other groups, as well as those falling under the umbrella of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].

Before 1903, writings about Mormons were mostly orthodox documentary histories or [[Anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] material. The first dissertations on Mormons, published in the 1900s, had a naturalistic style that approached [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormon history]] from economic, psychological, and philosophical theories. While their position within Mormon studies is debated, Mormon [[apologetics]] have a tradition dating back to [[Parley P. Pratt]]'s response to an anti-Mormon book in 1838.

The amount of scholarship in Mormon studies increased after World War II. From 1972–1982, while [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington]] was a [[Church Historian and Recorder|Church Historian]] in the history department, the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]] were open to Mormon and non-Mormon researchers. Researchers wrote detached accounts for Mormon intellectuals in the "New Mormon history" style. Many new publications started to publish history in this style, including [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], ''[[BYU Studies Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''. Some [[General authority|general authorities]] in the church did not like the New Mormon history style, and Arrington and his remaining staff were transferred to [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) in 1982, where they worked in the [[Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History]]. The institute continued to support scholarship in Mormon history until 2005, when the institute closed and employees transferred to the LDS Church Office Building. In the late 1980s and 1990s, several other incidents made BYU faculty reluctant to voice unorthodox ideas about church history. Around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]''. Two historians were [[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|excommunicated]] in 1993, probably for their published unorthodox views. ''BYU Studies'' and other LDS church-sponsored publishers published more "faithful" scholarship at this time. Presses outside of Utah started to publish more books in Mormon studies. 

Mormon scholars engaging in Mormon studies still feel they must be careful about what they write, especially if they work with material from the Church History Library archives. Non-Mormon scholars are often suspicious of Mormon scholars' work. This is gradually changing as Mormon scholars find employment outside of church-sponsored institutions. Universities without affiliation to the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies. Emerging trends in "Newer" Mormon History are an increase in interdisciplinary work and women's history. The LDS Church History Department hired a women's history specialist in 2011 and has recently published books focusing on women's history. Blogs focusing on Mormon history have helped make Mormon history more accessible and provided a safe space for unorthodox ideas, although they may be superficial at times. 

==Pre-1903 writings about Mormons==
Before World War II, church histories were mostly either orthodox Mormon or anti-Mormon and written by faithful Mormons or hostile non-Mormons, respectively.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=504}} A few writers in the first era of church history (1830–1905) wrote about Mormons as a curiosity and focused on their peculiar ways.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=16}}

===Anti-Mormon literature===
Non-Mormons wrote for a non-Mormon public about how "primitive and dangerous" Mormons were in "extreme terms."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}}  [[Eber D. Howe]] published ''[[Mormonism Unvailed|Mormonism Unvailed, or a Faithful Account of that Singular Imposition and Delusion]]'' in 1834, which claimed that [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the original author of the [[Book of Mormon]] and that [[Joseph Smith]] was a "vile wretch." Howe included affidavits from people who knew Joseph Smith collected by ex-Mormon [[Doctor Philastus Hurlbut|Philastus Hurlbut]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=53–54}} The book influenced future anti-Mormon literature. (by La Roy Sunderland, [[John C. Bennett|John Bennett]], and John A. Clark).{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=55}} Origen Bacheler examined the Book of Mormon itself in ''Mormonism Exposed Internally and Externally'', arguing that the book was inconsistent with the Bible and was written by Joseph Smith himself.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=56–57}}

In the 1960s, ex-Mormons [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] continued that anti-Mormon tradition by reprinting anti-Mormon works in the [[public domain]] as well as important but unflattering documents from LDS history through Utah Light House Ministry. They published their own criticisms of the LDS church as well, which, unlike early anti-Mormon works, cite historical documents.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=60–62}} [[Ed Decker]], an excommunicated Mormon, made two anti-Mormon films: ''[[The God Makers]]'' (1982) and ''[[The God Makers II]]'' (1993). The films described Mormons as being a [[cult]], abusing women and children, manipulating news outlets, and practicing [[Satanism]]. ''The God Makers II'' received criticism from other anti-Mormons, including Jerald and Sandra Tanner, who stated it contained inaccuracies.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=62–63}}

===Official church records and early histories===
[[File:Andrew Jenson.jpg|thumb|Andrew Jenson wrote the LDS Biographical Encyclopedia]]
Official recorders have existed since Joseph Smith organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] on April 6, 1830. Church records continue to the present and are kept in the LDS church archives. The first official church history was published in 1842, when Smith and his associates began writing ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of Joseph Smith]]'' as an official diary of Joseph Smith. This history was published in [[Times and Seasons]] in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], and then in [[Deseret News]] and Latter-day Saints' [[Millennial Star]] up until 1863. ''History of Joseph Smith'' was followed by ''History of Brigham Young'', which was also published in Deseret News and Millennial Star over the next two years. Church Historians and their assistants edited the material, which was published in official publications.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} [[Andrew Jenson]] made sizable contributions to documentary church history with the [[Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia]] (1901–36), Encyclopedic History of the Church (1941), and an unpublished "Journal History of the Church" containing over 1,500 scrapbooks filled with published and unpublished records of daily activities in the church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=1–2}} Jenson made a special report on the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]], and parts of the report were not openly used until [[Massacre at Mountain Meadows|''Massacre at Mountain Meadows'']] (2008) by [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard E. Turley]], [[Ronald W. Walker]], and [[Glen M. Leonard]].{{sfn|Walker|2008|p=25}}

The first historian to attempt to summarize Mormon history on a large scale was [[Edward Tullidge]], who wrote ''Life of Brigham Young: or Utah and Her Founders'' (1876), ''History of Salt Lake City'' (1886), and History of Northern Utah and Southern Idaho (1889). [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Hubert How Bancroft]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1889) with the help of the Historian's Office.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} Bancroft's history of Utah portrayed Mormons favorably. Critics say that he wasn't objective since he allowed LDS Church authorities to read the book before publication. Perhaps his favorable treatment was how he obtained access to the church records.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=144–145}} Expanding on Bancroft's history, [[Orson F. Whitney]] wrote ''History of Utah'' (1898–1904) in four volumes. [[Joseph Fielding Smith]] wrote ''Essentials of Church History'' in 1922. Most of these accounts combined various testimonies into a single narrative without questioning the validity of the eyewitnesses or other observers, especially those of church authorities.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}}

Mormons wrote accounts for other Mormons, often published in church-sponsored venues like ''[[Juvenile Instructor|The Juvenile Instructor]]'' and in church-published lesson manuals. These writings were written for a Mormon audience in order to support their existing beliefs. [[B. H. Roberts|Brigham H. Roberts]] was an associate editor of the ''Salt Lake Herald'' and while on a mission to England, was the editor of the ''[[Millennial Star|Millenial Star]]''. Upon returning to Utah, he became a [[General Authority]]. After an invitation from ''Americana'', Brigham H. Roberts wrote a chapter each month from 1909 to 1915 in what later became the ''[[Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]: Century One''.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|pp=199–200}} The history had some of the first historical analysis of events in church history.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=140}} It was serialized in Americana 1909–1915.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|p=3}} 

From 1830-1930, women were victims or symbols in historical accounts.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=1}} Church historians mentioned their suffering, but rarely mentioned them by name. Anti-polygamy tracts also described Mormon women in general terms, describing them as deluded or miserable.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} In an effort to combat the way anti-polygamists portrayed Mormon women, Edward Tullidge and Eliza R. Snow compiled ''The Women of Mormondom'' (1877), a book that portrayed Mormon women as hardworking and independent in a combined history, biography, and theology. ''Heroines of Mormondom'' (1884) highlighted faithful Mormon women's lives. Women wrote short biographies of other women and recorded them in [[Woman's Exponent|''Women's Exponent'']] and through publications from the [[Daughters of the Utah Pioneers]].{{sfn|Erekson|2017|pp=3–4}}

==Early Mormon studies==
[[File:Great Basin Desert 3 by Earth's beauty site.jpg|thumb|Great Basin Desert]]
Early academic writers on Mormon topics had a "naturalistic" approach to history, using theory from economics, psychology, and philosophy to guide their study.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=155}} Richard Ely contributed to the professionalization of Mormon studies with his early dissertation "Economic Aspects of Mormonism" (1903). In the work, he praised Mormon irrigation and communalism as a good model of economic development.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=146–147}} He influenced [[Leonard J. Arrington|Leonard Arrington']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s interest in economics and Mormons.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=160}} Andrew Love Neff wrote "The Mormon Migration to Utah," which he finished in 1918 but had started over ten years earlier. He was interested in how Mormons helped colonize the West.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=19}} Mormon [[E. E. Ericksen|Ephraim Edward Ericksen]] wrote "The Psychological and Ethical Aspects of Mormonism" (1922) while studying at the University of Chicago. His dissertation, influenced by functionalist theory, argued that Mormonism was a product of conflicts with non-Mormons and harsh environments.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=147–148}} Lowry Nelson, also a Mormon, studied at the University of Wisconsin in the 1920s. He worked in agriculture and was dean of BYU's College of Applied Science and director of the Utah Agriculture Experiment stations. He wrote articles about how the Mormon village was designed to promote unity and sociability, which allowed Mormon settlers to colonize the Great Basin Desert. He left Utah in 1937.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=149–150}} [[Nels Anderson]] studied at the University of Chicago, and studied hobos in Utah, where he converted to Mormonism. His book ''Desert Saints'' (1944) recounted the history of saints in the St. George, Utah area.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=150–151}} Other scholars publishing on Mormonism from this time period include I. Woodbridge Riley, [[Walter Franklin Prince|Walter F. Prince]], Franklin D. Daines, Hamilton Gardner, Joseph Geddes, [[Feramorz Y. Fox|Feramorz Fox]], Arden Beal Olsen, William McNiff, [[Kimball Young]], [[Austin E. and Alta S. Fife|Austin Fife and Alta Fife]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=151–154}}

In the 1950s after World War II, an increasing number of Mormons studied history professionally and wrote dissertations about Mormon history. Non-Mormon sociologist Thomas F. O'Dea wrote a dissertation entitled "Mormon Values: The Significance of a Religious Outlook for Social Action" after living in a rural Mormon farming village in New Mexico for six months and subsequently teaching at Utah State University.{{sfn|Arrington|1966|p=22}} This study of Mormon culture "stunned Mormon readers with its objectivity and sympathetic insight," according to Mormon scholar [[Richard Bushman]].{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} [[Bernard DeVoto]], [[Dale Morgan|Dale L. Morgan]], [[Fawn M. Brodie|Fawn McKay Brodie]], Stuart Ferguson, and [[Juanita Brooks]] did not have graduate degrees in history, but made significant contributions to the foundations of Mormonism's "New History" movement.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}}{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=151–154}} Brodie wrote [[No Man Knows My History|''No Man Knows My History'']] (1945), which contemporary reviews praised as definitive and scholarly. Other LDS scholars, notably [[Hugh Nibley]], criticized Brodie's biography.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=499–500}} In 1950, Juanita Brooks, an educated Mormon housewife, published a scholarly book on the Mountain Meadows Massacre, which is well-researched and balanced even by contemporary standards. Brooks's Mormon neighbors did not like "the frankness" of her book.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=202}}

==Apologetics and polemics==
{{anchor|Apologetics}}
&lt;!--Please don't edit text within above anchor template. Thanks.--&gt;
{{see also|Apologetics#Mormonism|Criticism of Mormonism}}

Mormon scholars are divided on whether apologetics should be considered part of Mormon studies or not. Brian D. Birch argues that it should be a part of Mormon studies, as long as apologetic authors concede that their arguments are objective and subject to academic debate.{{sfn|Birch|2014}} Apologists write defensively, and view their polemical responses to criticism as a battle for their faith.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|pp=518–519}} [[Parley P. Pratt]] responded to ''Mormonism Unveiled'' in detail in his 1838 pamphlet ''Mormonism Unveiled: Zion's Watchman Unmasked and Its Editor Mr. L.R. Sunderland Exposed, Truth Vindicated, the Devil Mad, and Priestcraft in Danger!'' Pratt argued against Sunderland's character, quoting Hurlbut, who stated that Sunderland has a "notorious character."{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=69}}

Hugh Nibley's ''No Ma'am, That's Not History'' set a standard for apologetics to use academic language, and criticized Brodie's use of sources in her controversial biography of Joseph Smith, ''No Man Knows My History''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} The [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS) aimed to support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon and respond to criticism, and used Nibley's style{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} to counter research that contradicted the Book of Mormon's ancient origins.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=517}} FARMS collaborated with [[Deseret Book Company|Deseret Book]] to publish the complete works of Hugh Nibley starting in 1984.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 1997, LDS church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] invited FARMS to be officially affiliated at BYU, and in 2006 it was subsumed by the [[Neal A. Maxwell Institute of Religious Scholarship]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=70–72}} In 2012, Daniel C. Petersen, the editor of ''[[FARMS Review]]'', started publishing a new journal called [[Interpreter (journal)|''Interpreter'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Peterson|first=Daniel C.|title=The Role of Apologetics in Mormon Studies|date=December 14, 2012|url=http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/the-role-of-apologetics-in-mormon-studies/|work=Mormoninterpreter.com|accessdate=2013-09-04|authorlink=Daniel C. Peterson}} — Note: this is a reprint of Peterson's August 2012 FAIR speech "Of 'Mormon Studies' and Apologetics".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FairMormon|Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research]] (FAIR), a group including both laypeople and academics, attempts to answer criticisms of the Mormon faith.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=517}} in 2013, it changed its name to [[FairMormon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/about|title=About FairMormon – FairMormon|work=FairMormon|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some other Mormon "insiders" countered the Book of Mormon's ancient origins through the Smith-Pettit Foundation in Salt Lake City and George Smith's [[Signature Books]] publishing company. Signature Books published ''New Approaches to the Book of Mormon'' by Brent Metcalfe and ''American Apocrypha'' by Dan Vogel and Metcalfe.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=73–74}} These insider views of the Book of Mormon's origins were diverse. ''American Apocrypha'' described the Book of Mormon as a work of fiction reflecting its environment. Ostler argued that the Book of Mormon was partially inspired.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=75}} FARMS's responses were at times patronizing, and even descending into veiled name-calling in William Hamblin's 1994 critique of a Metcalfe essay.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=76–77}}

===Counter-apologetics===
{{see also|Counter-apologetics}}
In the 1990s and 2000s, [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] Carl Mosser and Paul Owen encouraged other Evangelicals to respond to Mormon apologetics. Evangelical [[Craig Blomberg|Craig L. Blomberg]] discussed whether or not Mormons were Christian with Mormon [[Stephen E. Robinson]] in ''How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and Evangelical in Conversation''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=79}} Richard Bushman encouraged fellow Mormon historians to be less defensive and more open to criticism, and also to do research on Mormon history from a consciously Mormon point of view.{{sfn|Bushman|2007|p=521}}

==New Mormon history==
In the 1960s, a new generation of Mormon scholars emerged. The publication of [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'']], the newly-established Mormon History Association, and the professionalization of LDS and RLDS history departments provided spaces for historians to do new research in Mormon topics.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=498–499}} RLDS scholars founded the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] in 1972.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 1974, [[Claudia Bushman]] and [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]] founded the magazine ''[[Woman's Exponent|Exponent II]]''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} The first issue of [[BYU Studies Quarterly|''BYU Studies'']] was published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard|title=An Economic Interpretation of the "Word of Wisdom"|journal=BYU Studies|date=1959|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/economic-interpretation-word-wisdom|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonard Arrington 1950s.jpeg|thumb|Leonard Arrington]]
Also in 1972, the LDS Church hired Leonard Arrington as their historian.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=501}} During Arrington's time as historian, Mormon and non-Mormon historians were allowed to access the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]]. Much of the research in the 1970s used these newly-available sources to examine church history, sometimes in great detail.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=502}} Leonard Arrington influenced important scholars of Mormon history, including [[Richard L. Jensen|Richard Jensen]], [[William G. Hartley|William Hartley]], and [[Ronald W. Walker|Ronald Walker]].{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=164}} In 1969, Jewish historian [[Moses Rischin]] named the increasing amount of Mormon scholarship "the New Mormon history."{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=203}} The "New Mormon History" movement included non-Mormons Thomas F. O'Dea, P.A.M. Taylor, [[Mario De Pillis]], Lawrence Foster, Community of Christ member Robert Flanders, and Mormon scholar Klaus Hansen.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}}{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

[[Maureen Ursenbach Beecher]] was a leading researcher in women's studies.{{sfn|Whittaker|2013}}{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=102}} In the 1970s women's biographies were published, but not integrated into larger narratives.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=2}} Other women hired by the Church Historical Department included Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Edyth Romney. Journals dedicated special issues to Mormon women, and the increased interest in Mormon women led to more publications focused on them. Scholars published biographies of Emma Smith, Eliza Snow, Emmeline B. Wells, and Amy Brown Lyman.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=5}} 

Some writers looked at Mormon women's history with the goal of restructuring historical narratives. Mormon feminist articles on Mormon history started with the special Summer 1971 issue of ''Dialogue'' on women's issues and continued in publications like ''Exponent II'' (starting in 1974), and ''Mormon Sisters: Women in Early Utah'' (1976), edited by [[Claudia Bushman]]. Beecher and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich edited another volume about Mormon women's history in ''Sisters in Sprit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective'' (1987). ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism'' (1992) was another milestone in feminist publications, and it encouraged Mormon women to be empowered by their history and "reclaim lost opportunities."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=6}}

Most New Mormon historians were LDS.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=6}} Their audience was Mormon intellectuals{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=5}} and non-Mormons.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} They maintained their respect for the Mormon faith, admitted to flaws in people and policies, and avoided taking a defensive stance,{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} a tone which non-Mormon historian [[Jan Shipps]] wrote "made them seem more secular than they actually were."{{sfn|Shipps|2007|pp=504–505}} Mormon history by non-Mormons at this time had a similar detached tone.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=204}} New Mormon historians often published with the [[University of Illinois Press]] in order to publish for an academic audience independent of the church.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=206}} Charles S. Peterson argued in ''The Great Basin Kingdom Revisited'' that Arrington took an exceptionalist view of Mormon history, which he then taught to other New Mormon Historians. This exceptionalist view was that they could believe in both secular history and orthodox Mormon views of the restoration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=234–235}}

==LDS church reaffirms orthodoxy and New Mormon Faith Historians==
The LDS church stopped funding so much research and limited access to the church archives.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Apostle [[Ezra Taft Benson]] warned employees in the [[Church Educational System]] against New Mormon History in a 1976 speech. He said that writing history in a neutral style undermined "prophetic history."  [[Boyd K. Packer]]'s 1981 article, "The Mantle is Far, Far Greater than the Intellect" was published in ''BYU Studies.'' He wrote that contemporary historians were too eager to focus on the faults of church leaders and dismiss spiritual inspiration.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=215}} In 1982, historians from Arrington's department were transferred to Brigham Young University, where they were assigned to teach in the history department and worked in the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History.{{sfn|Anderson|2005}}

[[File:Carol C. Madsen (41596667191).jpg|thumb|Carol Cornwall Madsen]]
After Arrington's death in 1999, [[Ronald K. Esplin]] and [[Jill Mulvay Derr]] led the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History at BYU. [[Carol Cornwall Madsen]] led research in the Women's History Initiative at the institute, where she wrote an important biographical study of [[Emmeline B. Wells]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} In 2001,{{sfn|Bushman|2009|137}} [[Richard Bushman]] retired from full-time teaching at [[Columbia University]] and was a research director at the Smith Institute.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=513}} [[Dean C. Jessee]] started editing Joseph Smith's papers in ''The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith''. The Smith Institute closed in 2005, and institute staff along with the Smith papers project moved to the [[Church Office Building]].{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=512}} The [[The Joseph Smith Papers|Joseph Smith Papers]] project, started by the LDS church in 2001, aimed to publish Joseph Smith's papers with rigorous accuracy, and was validated by the National Historic Public Records Commission.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=205}} 

[[Jan Shipps]] asserts that this reluctance to support new Mormon history was a response to the [[Mark Hofmann]] document forgeries. Also, some church authorities disliked the books and articles produced by the history department, which noted flaws as well as strengths of people in church history.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Shipps states that the increase in new converts to the LDS Church led General Authorities to emphasize the need for "palatable" versions of church history in museums and historic sites rather than in-depth articles in church-sponsored publications.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=511}} Mormon sociologist [[Armand Mauss]] argued that Mormonism was a struggle between remaining distinctive and assimilating to accepted American cultural practices; scholar Ronald Helfrich speculates that the change in General Authority's reception to Arrington's research was because they feared assimilating too much.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=218}} General interest in Mormon studies continued during the 1980s, with over 2,000 books, articles, and other material published on Mormon history during that decade.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} 

''BYU Studies'' and Deseret Books published more "New Mormon Faith Historians" after General Authority pushback against New Mormon History. One of these New Mormon Faith Historians was [[Louis C. Midgley|Louis Midgely]], who argued that from a relativist, postmodern theory, the Mormon view that the LDS Church had divine origins was just as valuable and valid as others. New Mormon Faith Historians said that the New Mormon scholars left faith out of their analyses.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} Many were members of FARMS, and often saw writers of New Mormon History as the same as other anti-Mormons, even though most writers of New Mormon History were Mormon.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=221–222}} The difference between the New Mormon Faith Historians and New Mormon scholars was hard to define.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=219–220}} 

Along with Arrington's transfer and a subsequent increase in restrictions in the LDS Church Archives, several other incidents led to an intellectual chilling of Mormon history by Mormons in the 1990s.{{sfn|Schuessler|2012}} In 1992, Arrington wrote that "the church cannot afford to place its official stamp of approval on any 'private' interpretation of its past," and this kind of history must be not sponsored by the LDS Church.{{sfn|Arrington|1992|pp=4–5}} In September 1993, the LDS church excommunicated the [[September Six]], which included two historians: [[Lavina Fielding Anderson]] and [[D. Michael Quinn]]. These excommunications served as a warning to other Mormon historians.{{sfn|Shipps|2007|p=510}} Quinn's excommunication was perhaps tied to his idea that Mormon women had been given the priesthood in 1843, which he published in an essay in ''Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism''.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=224–225}} In 2003, he was scheduled to give a speech at a conference at Yale which was co-sponsored by BYU, and BYU stated they would withdraw their funding if Quinn presented his paper. That same year, Quinn applied to work as a professor at the University of Utah and Arizona State University. He was not hired as a professor, possibly because of fears that LDS people in power would retaliate against the university.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|pp=227–228}} In 1986, administrators were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or present at the [[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]] symposium; around 1990, BYU professors were asked not to contribute to ''Dialogue'' or ''Sunstone''.{{sfn|Hansen|2010|pp=40–41}} [[Eugene England]], one of the founders of ''Dialogue'' and then a professor at BYU, spoke out against these prohibitions. He was asked not to write for the ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'' in 1990, and in 1998 he was asked to retire from BYU without justification. England saw this as stemming from his publicly anti-war stance, and for his attention to Mormon racism and sexism. He viewed his differences as a potential source of learning for himself and others. After retiring from BYU, he started one of the first Mormon studies programs at [[Utah Valley University|Utah Valley State College]]. According to a 1997 report by the [[American Association of University Professors]] on academic freedom at BYU, Alan Wilkins was questioned about his motives for contributing to ''Dialogue'' and ''Sunstone'' in a tenure review. The report also mentioned other incidents where BYU administration criticized speakers and articles for criticism of the church, among other complaints.{{sfn|Pratt|1997|p=63}} 

In 1997, [[Joanna Brooks]] argued that the goal of Mormon studies was to critically examine Mormonism, not to determine religious truths.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=135}} She postulated that Mormon studies done as a type of cultural studies will help scholars in the field feel less defensive and more productive.{{sfn|Brooks|1997|p=138}} Outside of Brigham Young University and Utah, the [[University of North Carolina Press]], [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], and the [[University of Oklahoma Press]] published books on Mormonism.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In the 2000s, Jan Shipps was a large influence on news articles about Mormons; often she is the only expert cited for an entire article.{{sfn|Barlow|2004}} In 2005, the National Endowment for the Humanities held a seminar at Brigham Young University on the bicentennial of Joseph Smith's birth.{{sfn|Bushman|2013a|p=197}}  [[Terryl Givens]], a comparative literature scholar, analyzed discourse about the Book of Mormon in ''By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion'' in 2002. {{sfn|McLemee|2002}}

Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated in general histories. Arrington and Davis Bitton discussed women's issues in two chapters on marriage and sisterhood in ''The Mormon Experience'' (1992). ''The Story of the Latter-day Saints'' (1992) by James Allen and Glen Leonard mentioned women in the context of auxiliaries like Relief Society and Primary, plural marriage, suffrage, and the ERA. ''The Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History'' (2000) contained 435 entries about men, but only 64 about women, with three-quarters of the women receiving less than a page of description. Church publication ''Our Heritage'' (1996) only mentioned a few women. Women's history remained in a "separate sphere."{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=7–8}} ''Daughters in My Kingdom'' (2011), an official history of the Relief Society, is mostly used in women's meetings. Outside of Mormon history specialists, Mormon women are rarely mentioned.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=9}}

==Newer Mormon history==
Non-Mormon scholars are still often suspicious of LDS scholars' work.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=3}} That is gradually changing as non-Mormon scholars increase and universities not affiliated with the LDS Church have endowed chairs for Mormon studies.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} [[Kathleen Flake]] is the first Richard L. Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies at [[University of Virginia]], and [[Patrick Q. Mason|Patrick Mason]] is the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California.{{sfn|Walker|2013}}

[[File:Church History Library in Salt Lake City.jpg|thumb|Church History Library in Salt Lake City]]
The Church History Library still restricts access to certain documents for most scholars. Scholars may self-censor their research for fear of losing access to documents from the Church History Library. Previous excommunications of Mormon historians give Mormon researchers the sense that they are being watched.{{sfn|Newell|2013|p=4}} Scholars from various disciplines see the "New Mormon History" movement as ending, bring replaced by "Post New Mormon History" or "Newer Mormon History." This emerging movement is interdisciplinary and endeavors to place Mormon studies in a broader historical context, further eroding boundaries between disciplines.{{sfn|Newell|2013|pp=6–7}} Mormon women's history has not been well-integrated with other Mormon studies topics.{{sfn|Coles|2018}} Contemporary historians like [[R. Marie Griffith]], [[Grant Wacker]], and [[Robert Orsi]] encourage the use of interdisciplinary tools in Mormon studies.{{sfn|Cope|2012|p=100}}

Included in these interdisciplinary tools are oral histories. In 1972, an the Charles Redd Center for Western Studies was established at BYU, where Jessie L. Embry directed an extensive oral history project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=John |last2=Ainsworth |first2=GlendaLynn |last3=Casper |first3=Zann |last4=Balif |first4=Elizabeth |title=Charles Redd Center for Western Studies oral history project records|url=https://findingaid.lib.byu.edu/viewItem/MSS%207752 |website=findingaid.lib.byu.edu |publisher=L.

Tom Perry Special Collections |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church History Department started their own oral history project in 2009.{{sfn|Erekson|2017|p=6}} Claudia L. Bushman and her students started the Claremont Oral History collection in 2009, and papers using the oral history data were published in ''Mormon Women Have Their Say: Essays from the Claremont Oral History Collection''.{{sfn|Bushman|Kline|2013b}}

The LDS Church History Department hired a specialist in women's history in 2011, Kate Holbrook. She co-authored ''The First Fifty Years of Relief Society: Key Documents in Latter-Day Saint Women's History'' with Jill Mulvay Derr, Carol Cornwall Madsen, and Matthew J. Grow. Laurel Thatcher Ulrich said the book was "the most important work to emerge from a Mormon Press in the last 50 years." Jenny Reeder, specializing in 19th century women's history, was hired in 2013. Brittany Chapman Nash and Lisa Tait also specialize in women's history and work in the LDS Church history department. Nash works in public services and helps researchers to be aware of women's sources the archive offers. She co-authored ''Women of Faith in the Latter Days'' with [[Richard E. Turley Jr.|Richard Turley]]. Tait works on the web team, helping to add a "Women of Conviction" section to church history website.{{sfn|Walch|2016}} In 2017, Reeder and Holbrook edited a compilation of women's speeches called ''At the Pulpit: 185 Years of Discourses by Latter-day Saint Women.'' {{sfn|Walch|2017}}

==Blogs and Mormon studies==
The [[Mormon blogosphere]] influences Mormon studies. In 2011, Patrick Mason surveyed 113 Mormon blog readers who were also graduate students.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=13}} Most respondents viewed blogs as a way to democratize Mormon studies. Since blogs are independent from Church institutions, many felt that blogs were a safe space to test more unorthodox ideas.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=17}} A few observed that men's voices are more prominent in the blogging community, though a few prominent blogs have all-women authors.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=18}} Other respondents felt that blogs made Mormon studies "more of an echo chamber," and were "superficial," and "glorified navel-gazing."{{sfn|Mason|2012|pp=18–19}}  One of the most popular blogs, By Common Consent, had over two million page visitors in 2011. It and other blogs are influential on Mormon studies.{{sfn|Mason|2012|p=20}}

== Archives ==
Archives with significant Mormon collections include the [[L. Tom Perry Special Collections]] at BYU, the Church Archives in Salt Lake, the J. Willard Marriott Library at the [[University of Utah]] in Salt Lake, Utah State University Libraries, and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut.{{sfn|Helfrich|2011|p=165}}

== Awards ==
Awards for writing or service in the field of Mormon studies are presented annually by scholarly societies.  The [[Mormon History Association]] (MHA) and the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] (JWHA) each present annual awards for various categories within Mormon history, such as books, biographies, documentary history, journal articles, and lifetime achievement.&lt;ref name=mha_awards&gt;{{cite web | title=MHA Awards | work=mormonhistoryassociation.org | publisher=Mormon History Association | url=https://www.mormonhistoryassociation.org/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Awards | work=jwha.info | publisher=John Whitmer Historical Association | url=http://www.jwha.info/awards | accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The MHA also gives awards for theses and student papers.&lt;ref name=mha_awards/&gt;  The [[Utah State Historical Society]] (USHS), which frequently engages Mormon history, also presents awards for books, articles, and student papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NEWS: Utah State History Announces 2013 Annual Awards | date=September 17, 2013 | work=Utah Cultural Alliance: Unifying Utah's Cultural Community | url=http://ut-cultural-alliance.blogspot.com/2013/09/news-utah-state-history-announces-2013.html

== Academic programs ==
Several universities have programs in the study of Mormonism, with professors named to oversee coursework, research, and events on Mormon studies.  While independent academic programs have emerged in recent years, devotional religious education programs have existed far longer.  Additional colleges have also taught courses on Mormonism without having institutionally sponsored programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Series: Mormon Studies in the Classroom | author=Benjamin Park | date=April 21, 2014 | work=Juvenile Instructor | url=http://juvenileinstructor.org/new-series-mormon-studies-in-the-classroom/ | accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not included in the list below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5131">The '''National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center''' (NARAC) is located at the University of California's [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. It is a national support and resource center for planning, real-time assessment, emergency response, and detailed studies of incidents involving a wide variety of hazards, including nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological, and natural emissions.

NARAC provides tools and services to federal, state and local governments, that map the probable spread of hazardous material accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere.

NARAC provides [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric plume predictions]] in time for an emergency manager to decide if protective action is necessary to protect the health and safety of people in affected areas.

== The NARAC facility includes ==

* Scientific and technical staff who provide support and training for NARAC tools, as well as quality assurance and detailed analysis of atmospheric releases.
* 24 hour x 7 day on-duty or on-call staff.
* Training facility.
* An Operations Center with uninterruptible power, backup power generators, and robust computer systems.
* Links to over 100 emergency operations centers on the U.S.
* A team of research and operational staff with expertise in atmospheric research, operational meteorology, numerical modeling, computer science, software engineering, geographical information systems, computer graphics, hazardous material (radiological, chemical, biological) properties and effects.

==The Emergency Response System: Real time dispersion modeling==

The NARAC emergency response central modeling system consists of an integrated suite of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The meteorological [[data assimilation]] model, ADAPT, constructs fields of such variables as the mean [[wind]]s, [[pressure]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature]], and [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;Sugiyama, G., and S. T. Chan  (1998), ''A New Meteorological Data Assimilation Model for Real-Time Emergency Response'', 10th Joint Conference on the Applications of Air Pollution Meteorology, Phoenix, Arizona, January, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-divergent wind fields are produced by a procedure based on the variational principle and a [[finite element method|finite-element discretization]]. The dispersion model, LODI, solves the 3-D advection-diffusion equation using a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian]] [[stochastic]], [[Monte Carlo method]].&lt;ref&gt;Ermak, D.L., and J.S. Nasstrom (2000), ''A Lagrangian Stochastic Diffusion Method for Inhomogeneous Turbulence'', Atmospheric Environment, 34, 7, 1059-1068.&lt;/ref&gt;  LODI includes methods for simulating the processes of mean wind advection, turbulent diffusion, radioactive decay and production, bio-agent degradation, first-order chemical reactions, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet deposition]], gravitational settling, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|dry deposition]], and [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|buoyant]]/momentum plume rise.

The models are coupled to NARAC databases providing topography, geographical data, chemical-biological-nuclear agent properties and health risk levels, real-time meteorological observational data, and global and mesoscale forecast model predictions. The NARAC modeling system also includes an in-house version of the Naval Research Laboratory's mesoscale weather forecast model COAMPS.&lt;ref&gt;Hodur, R. M. (1997), ''The Navel Research Laboratory's Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS)'', Mon. Wea. Rev., 125, 1414-1430.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11933">'''Novim''' is a non-profit group at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] that organizes teams for objective scientific study of global issues and identification options for addressing the concerns, based upon an collaborative problem-solving approach used in the field of physics.

== Overview ==
The group was formed at the University of California campus in Santa Barbara to create a collaborative problem-solving approach to address widespread and complicated problems, modeled after approaches at the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (KITP). Novim organizes study teams of scientists, researchers, and area experts to evaluate issues like [[climate engineering]], [[global surface temperature]]s, and [[Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing in the United States|methane leakage]]s in [[natural gas]] production. Their criteria for issue selection is that it must be "highly complex, controversial and global." They partner with governmental organizations, like the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and [[Office of Science]], to engage them in the process, share findings and discuss potential actions.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/article/011410_undersecretary_of_science_talks_sustainability_at_ucsb/|title= Undersecretary for Science Talks Sustainability at UCSB|date=2010-01-14|accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.noozhawk.com/article/090609_novim_global_issues/|title= Novim Aims to Close Information Gap on Pressing Global Issues|date=2009-09-06|accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoengineering Study===
They first studied the changes in the Earth's average surface temperature and published their findings in 2009 in the ''Climate Engineering Study Group'' report.{{#tag:ref|The [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis| International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)]] announced Novim's first report in August 2009.&lt;ref name="IIASA" /&gt;|group="nb"}} They found that there was a need to use [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] to lower the Earth's average temperature and suggested adopting the principles of short wave climate engineering (SWCE) to introduce aerosols into the stratosphere. Much like the sulfur particles released by large volcanic eruptions, the aerosols would reflect shortwave solar radiation back into space to cool the air and land below.&lt;ref name="IIASA"&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/INF/PR/2009/2009-08-03.html Climate intervention: what we need to know to respond to a climate emergency]&lt;/ref&gt; Although SWCE may help reverse global warming, the technique remains untested and potential adverse effects are unknown, and therefore could not be mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Tirone, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ah33HPW4.Jr8 "Geo-Engineering Risks Weigh on Hopes to Reverse Global Warming"], [https://www.bloomberg.com/ ''Bloomberg''], Published 3 August 2009, Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have stated that the core causes are not addressed, only the symptoms, and that SWCE would damage the ozone.&lt;ref&gt;Hands Off Mother Earth, [http://www.handsoffmotherearth.org/learn-more/what-is-geoengineering/sulphate-aerosols-artificial-volcanoes/ "Sulphate Aerosols &amp; Artificial volcanoes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methane Leakage ===
Methane Leakage - Novim has assembled a team of scientific and technical experts to analyze existing studies of the emissions profile of natural gas during the production and distribution phases, with a focus on determining a range of actual methane leakage rates. Probable causes for the leakage will be included, and proposed solutions will be examined, along with associated costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phase I Meta Study of Methane Leakage|url=http://www.novim.org/projects/natural-gas|publisher=Novim|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6294">'''Pathosformel''' or "pathos formula" (German plural: ''pathosformeln'') is a term coined by the German art historian and cultural theorist [[Aby Warburg]] (1866–1929) in his research on the afterlife of antiquity (''das Nachleben der Antike''). It is described as "the primitive words of passionate gesture language"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sliwinski |first1=Sharon |title=New York Transfixed |journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies |date=14 June 2008 |volume=30 |pages=246–247 |url=http://www.torontophotographyseminar.org/sites/default/files/uploads/Sliwinski_New_York_Transfixed.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "emotionally charged visual trope[s]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Colleen|title=Aby Warburg's Pathosformel as methodological paradigm|journal=Journal of Art Historiography|date=2013|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; that recur throughout images in Western Europe. While the term is associated with [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], Warburg restricts the concept to cultural-psychological themes, as he held "an honest disgust of aestheticizing art history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its name, pathosformel does not provide a calculable formula to identify visual links among images. Instead, it calls on collective and individual imagination to find such links apart from those based on age, type, size, or origin. In historian Kurt Forster's words, "it exerts its control over existing figurations in a way that endows them with new, 'sign-giving' qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]], described pathosformel as "the primeval reaction of man to the universal hardships of his existence [that] underlies all his attempts at mental orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=Ernst Hans|title=Aby Warburg: An Intellectual Biography|date=1986|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0714824275|page=223|url=https://books.google.fr/books/about/Aby_Warburg.html?id=agfqAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg's early work on paintings by [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] as well as his later work on the reappearance of astrological symbols in artwork and popular ephemera employ the concept of pathosformel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation, completed in 1893 presents an early formulation of the concept in comparing Botticelli's [[The Birth of Venus|Birth of Venus]] with [[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]] by looking at the ''bewegtes Beiwerk'' or "animated incident" that appears among them. To Warburg, this incident is the depiction of wind that animates the paintings. In the former, it is seen in Venus's flowing hair, while in the latter, it is seen in the flowing dress of the nymph Flora on the far right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rampley|first1=Mathew|title=From Symbol to Allegory: Aby Warburg's Theory of Art|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=1997|volume=79|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Botticelli-primavera.jpg|thumb|left|Botticelli's ''Primavera'' c. 1482.]]

In 1905, Warburg presented a lecture on Dürer and Italian Antiquity, in which he used pathosformel to approach images by [[Dürer]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], Antonio Pollaiuolo and others from the point of view of a historical psychology of human expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|last3=Warburg|first3=Aby|title=The Renewal of Pagan Antiquity: Contributions to the Cultural History of the European Renaissance|date=1999|publisher=Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities|isbn=978-0892365371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg's unfinished montage, the Mnemosyne Atlas provides another example of the pathosformel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rampley|first1=Mathew|title=From Symbol to Allegory: Aby Warburg's Theory of Art|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=1997|volume=79|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forster|first1=Kurt|last2=Britt|first2=David|title=Aby Warbug: His Study of Ritual and Art on Two Continents|journal=The MIT Press|date=1996|volume=77|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Warburg pairs a [[Dürer]] engraving from [[Apocalypse (Dürer)|Apocalypse with Pictures]] (1498) with an image featured in a popular tarot illustrated by the same artist  (1494/5). While the image of the chariot links these works compositionally, the chariot itself signifies for Warburg the need to control a potentially disastrous conflict, thus linking similar psychological dynamics in different works regardless of their high or low cultural origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Colleen|title=Aby Warburg's Pathosformel as methodological paradigm|journal=Journal of Art Historiography|date=2013|page=11|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warburg acknowledged, however, that the  persistence of a motif does not necessarily carry with it the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posècq|first1=Avigdor|title=Left and Right Orientation of a Pathosformel in Dürer|journal=Notes in the History of Art|date=1996|volume=16|issue=1|pages=7–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathosformel is closely related to, albeit distinct from  [[Robert Vischer]]'s notion of [[empathy]] (Einfühlung), which Warburg refers to as the "force active in the generation of style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rampley|first1=Mathew|title=From Symbol to Allegory: Aby Warburg's Theory of Art|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=1997|volume=79|issue=1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia''' is being pursued at local and state/territory level rather than nationally, with [[plastic bag]] bans implemented or pending in all [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]] except [[New South Wales]]. Environmental groups have expressed their concern that [[Australia]] was lagging other countries in the [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]], including Botswana, Somalia and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="cormack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Australia falling behind third world on global map of plastic bag bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/australia-falling-behind-third-world-on-global-map-of-plastic-bag-bans-20160407-go18ec.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was estimated that of the 5 billion plastic bags used annually by Australians, 150 million ended up as litter.&lt;ref name="cormack" /&gt;

In 2003 the [[Tasmania]]n town of [[Coles Bay, Tasmania|Coles Bay]] was the first location in Australia to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 2008 the then-Environment Minister [[Peter Garrett]] announced the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]]'s goal of a nationwide plastic bag ban by year's end, he later abandoned the initiative due to [[cost of living]] concerns and disagreement about the policy among state and territory governments.&lt;ref name="abc-2008-garrett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garrett calls time on plastic bags|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-10/garrett-calls-time-on-plastic-bags/1008452|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 January 2008|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feneley|first1=Rick|title=Battle to bag the plastic goes on|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/battle-to-bag-the-plastic-goes-on-20081226-75l4.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to states and territories pursuing their own approaches.&lt;ref name="2010-tas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darby|first1=Andrew|title=Ban on plastic bags spreads to Tasmania|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/ban-on-plastic-bags-spreads-to-tasmania-20101111-17pgm.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to the first statewide lightweight bag ban being introduced in October 2008. It is estimated that this move has saved 400 million bags annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent jurisdiction to announce a ban on plastic bags is [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to commence on a date to be announced in early 2018.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban" /&gt;

Since 2018, the country's two largest supermarket chains, [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]], voluntarily removed free lightweight plastic bags from their stores and began charging for reusable bags instead.&lt;ref name="coles-woolies"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out single-use plastic bags|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/14/woolworths-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-bags-over-12-months|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reusable bags are sold at 15 cents in both chains.

==Background==
In [[Australia]], 6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] HDPE bags were used in 2002.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/waste/plastic-bags/index.html|title=Plastic bags|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage reduced to 5.6 billion in 2004&lt;ref name="bag problems"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecorecycle.sustainability.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/Plastic_Bag_Free_Challenge_-_Factsheet.pdf| title=Plastic Bag Fact Sheet | date=9 November 2005| publisher=Sustainability Victoria| accessdate=1 July 2012|format= pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt; According to [[Keep Australia Beautiful]]'s 2015-16 National Litter Index, plastic bags made up 1% of the country's litter.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thornton |first1=Trevor |title=In banning plastic bags we need to make sure we're not creating new problems |url=https://theconversation.com/in-banning-plastic-bags-we-need-to-make-sure-were-not-creating-new-problems-81253 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Conversation |date=21 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notreadysbs"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Christian |first1=Natasha |title=Why Australia may not be ready to ban plastic bags |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-australia-may-not-be-ready-to-ban-plastic-bags |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=SBS News |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and [[Clean Up Australia]] launched a [[Change.org]] petition for the premiers of the three states without plastic bag bans - Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia - to "ban the bag".&lt;ref name="banthebag-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Waleed Aly calls for nationwide ban|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/ban-the-bag-waleed-aly-calls-on-three-australian-premiers-to-ban-plastic-bags/news-story/7d8b5b5944bf7ec77fc6791380f15531|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=News.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a segment on ''The Project'' about the petition, #BanTheBag became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="banthebag-news" /&gt; In February 2018, a motion was put in the Australian Federal Parliament calling for a nationwide ban of lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/genpdf/chamber/hansardr/8f8fb221-5f56-4e53-b69a-e109f7156d20/0473/hansard_frag.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf|title=Plastic bag ban motion in Federal Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senate inquiries into recycling and marine plastic pollution also led to tripartisan recommendations by the Liberal, Labor and Greens parties to ban all single-use plastics in the country by 2023 and for all states and territories to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref name="zhou-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zhou |first1=Naaman |title=All single-use plastics should be banned by 2023 Senate inquiry recommends |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cormack-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cormack |first1=Lucy |title=Plastic bag ban among recommendations by marine plastic senate inquiry |url=https://www.smh.com.au/environment/plastic-bag-ban-among-recommendations-by-marine-plastic-senate-inquiry-20160420-gob2lb.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 April 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Australia===
The ''Plastic Shopping Bags (Waste Avoidance) Bill'' passed the [[Parliament of South Australia]] on 13 November 2008, with a transitional period of 1 January to 4 May 2009.&lt;ref name="GLM-SA"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macfarlane|first1=Melanie|title=South Australia bans plastic shopping bags|url=http://www.greenlifestylemag.com.au/news/427/south-australia-bans-plastic-shopping-bags|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=G-Online|publisher=Green Lifestyle Magazine|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an official start date of 4 May 2009, South Australia was the first state or territory in Australia to ban plastic bags at the checkout, with retailers facing fines of up to $5,000 for distributing banned bags and retailer suppliers fined up to $20,000.&lt;ref name="sa20k"&gt;{{cite news|title=$20,000 for the wrong shopping bag|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/for-the-wrong-shopping-bag/news-story/1cc21937d58709af7c2870cdc4031c8d|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=News.Com.Au|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban does not extend to heavier plastic bags or fruit and vegetable bags.&lt;ref name="sa20k"/&gt;

Two attempts by the [[City of Fremantle]] in 2013 and 2015 to introduce a citywide plastic bag ban were blocked through disallowance motions moved in the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kagi|first1=Jacon|title=Fremantle plastic bag ban binned again in WA Parliament|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-14/fremantle-plastic-bag-bag-blocked-by-state-parliament-again/6852518|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 October 2015|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the Western Australian Government announced it would commence a statewide plastic bag ban on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="abc-wa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trigger|first1=Rebecca|title=How will WA's plastic bag ban work?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-12/plastic-bag-ban-announced-in-wa-but-how-will-it-work/8895770|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=12 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wa-toban"&gt;{{cite news|title=WA to ban plastic bags next year|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/environment/wa-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year-ng-s-1772065|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The West Australian|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
In mid-2017, Victoria's state government expressed its preference for a national ban, while confirming it would be open to a state-level ban in future.&lt;ref name="vic-fed-alone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, [[Daniel Andrews]] stated that Victoria would introduce a ban on plastic bags, with the start date to be announced in early 2018 after consultation with industry and the community.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preiss|first1=Benjamin|title=Lightweight plastic bags to be banned in Victoria|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lightweight-plastic-bags-to-be-banned-in-victoria-20171017-gz2s4i.html|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Age|agency=Fairfax Media|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation-vic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornton|first1=Trevor|title=Victoria's plastic bag ban: a good start, but we can do more|url=http://theconversation.com/victorias-plastic-bag-ban-a-good-start-but-we-can-do-more-86149|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Conversation|date=25 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government subsequently announced the plastic bag ban would commence by late 2019.&lt;ref name="theage-vic2019date"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cunningham |first1=Melissa |last2=Preiss |first2=Benjamin |title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags by next year |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-by-next-year-20180627-p4znxv.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=27 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The New South Wales Government currently has no plans to introduce a ban. In 2017 Premier [[Gladys Berejiklian]] stated that no regulation was needed because retailers responsible for 80% of plastic bags in the state (Coles, Woolworths and [[Harris Farm Markets|Harris Farm]]) would voluntarily stop providing free plastic bags themselves.&lt;ref name="nsw-not-needed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Plastic bag ban across NSW not needed if supermarkets act themselves: Premier|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/plastic-bag-ban-across-nsw-not-needed-if-supermarkets-act-themselves-premier-20170724-gxhfbx.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aldi]] has never offered free plastic bags to customers since opening its first Australian store in 2001.&lt;ref name="aldi-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heffernan |first1=Madeleine |title=Aldi reignites debate over plastic bag ban |url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/aldi-reignites-debate-over-plastic-bag-ban-20170320-gv1zgs.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=21 March 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are charged 15 cents for a thick plastic bag and more for fabric or cooler bags.&lt;ref name="aldi-2017" /&gt; In 2009 [[Target Australia]] announced it would stop giving out free bags in its stores, instead charging 10 cents per bag.&lt;ref name="target-2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sharp |first1=Rosemary Anne |title=Target's plastic bag backdown a loss for the silent majority |url=https://theconversation.com/targets-plastic-bag-backdown-a-loss-for-the-silent-majority-18794 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Conversation |date=3 October 2013 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Target again providing free bags, stating that it had received about 500 formal customer complaints per year about the lack of free bags.&lt;ref name="target-2013" /&gt; Target and its sister chain [[Kmart Australia]] plan to withdraw single use plastic bags nationwide in 2019.&lt;ref name="kmart-target"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brook |first1=Benedict |title=Big Australian retailers are refusing to axe plastic bags |url=https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/conservation/big-australian-retailers-are-refusing-to-axe-plastic-bags/news-story/7445f8b2e213cec79fc331fd0ec4a022 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=News.com.au |publisher=News Corp Australia |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo-kmart-target"&gt;{{cite news |title=The retail chains that haven't banned single-use plastic bags |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/retail-chains-havent-banned-single-use-plastic-bags-073928812.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=Yahoo News |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bunnings Warehouse]] has charged 10 cents for plastic bags since 2003, while [[IKEA]] stopped offering free bags in 2013.&lt;ref name="windfall"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mortimer |first1=Gary |title=Getting rid of plastic bags: a windfall for supermarkets but it won't do much for the environment |url=https://theconversation.com/getting-rid-of-plastic-bags-a-windfall-for-supermarkets-but-it-wont-do-much-for-the-environment-81083 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Conversation |date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoowar"&gt;{{cite news |title=Retailers' war on plastic bags |url=https://nz.finance.yahoo.com/news/retailers-war-plastic-bags-044309024.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |date=14 July 2017 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the country's largest supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles, announced that they would stop providing free plastic bags to customers nationwide in 2018, and would sell thicker plastic bags for 15 cents each.&lt;ref name="ww-coles-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dulaney |first1=Michael |title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out plastic bags around the country |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-14/woolworths-to-phase-out-plastic-bags-around-the-country/8709336 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 July 2017 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing free bags is expected to save the retailers $170 million per year in reduced packaging costs while creating a revenue stream from selling thicker plastic bags.&lt;ref name="windfall" /&gt; 

The move was criticised by conservative commentators including [[Andrew Bolt]]&lt;ref name="alcorn2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alcorn |first1=Gay |title=The plastic bag ban is not going to kill us.

==Alternatives to plastic bags==
A side-effect of the plastic bag ban observed in South Australia was the increased use of [[bin bag|bin liners]], which have a greater environmental impact than plastic bags as they do not break down well in modern landfills.&lt;ref name="binliner2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Frank|title=Plastic bag ban: 'You don't actually need a plastic bin liner to put your rubbish out'|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/plastic-bag-ban-you-dont-actually-need-a-plastic-bin-liner-to-put-your-rubbish-out/news-story/629abba62ae7d5174208ca36d43615f2|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=News.com.au|agency=NewsCorp Australia|date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentally-friendly alternatives suggested instead of bin liners include [[composting]] food scraps and using free [[community newspaper]]s as liners instead.&lt;ref name="binliner2017" /&gt;

A 2007 report into shopping bag alternatives&lt;ref name=2007report&gt;{{cite report | last= Dili | first= Rae | date = 18 April 2007 | title = Comparison of existing life cycle analysis of shopping bag alternatives: Final Report | url = http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/upload/resources/publications/plastic-bag-phase-out/LCA_shopping_bags_full_report%5B2%5D_2.pdf | publisher = Sustainability Victoria | format = PDF | access-date = 23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that paper bags were less environmentally friendly than plastic bags due to a higher [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="wired-adler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Ben|title=Banning Plastic Bags Is Great for the World, Right?

Concern has been expressed about potential unintended adverse health outcomes associated with the plastic bag ban rollout due to the lack of care by consumers in maintaining alternative shopping bags in a clean and healthy condition.  Overseas experiences in locations such as [[San Francisco]], where increased illness and even deaths were reported in the aftermath of similar bans to those in Australian states, suggest that this is a real concern.&lt;ref name="health-outcomes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Study links plastic bag ban with increase in food-related deaths|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/study-links-plastic-bag-ban-with-increase-in-foodrelated-deaths-20130208-2e2zf.html|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Canberra Times|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piquerism''' (from the French ''piquer'' - "to prick") is a sexual interest in penetrating the skin of another person with sharp objects (such as pins, razors, knives, etc). Sometimes, this is serious enough to cause extreme injuries or even death.&lt;ref name = Davis&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = MS | title = The concise dictionary of crime and justice | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7619-2176-1 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=SJDW9iDS_a0C&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 196] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Piquerism is a [[paraphilia]] as well as a form of [[Sadism &amp; Masochism|sadism]]. The most frequently targeted areas of the body are the breasts, buttocks, or groin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201501/life-knife-edge|title=Life On A Knife Edge|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Andrei Chikatilo===
Soviet serial killer [[Andrei Chikatilo]] was [[impotent]] and could only achieve sexual arousal through stabbing and cutting people with a knife.

===Jack the Ripper===
Dr. [[Robert D. Keppel]] and his colleagues concluded in an analysis of [[London]]'s [[Jack the Ripper]] murders of 1888 that "the injuries sustained by the victims displayed the signature characteristic of picquerism."

===Albert Fish===
[[Image:Pelvis of Albert Fish (X-ray).jpg|right|thumb|[[X-Ray]] of pelvis of [[Albert Fish]] showing over a dozen needles inserted.]]
Notorious [[serial killer]] [[Albert Fish]] has been said to have engaged in piquerism upon his victims and his own body, [[flagellation|flagellating]] himself constantly with a nail-studded board. After his arrest and subsequent jailing for the murder of Grace Budd, an [[X-Ray]] revealed at least 29 [[Sewing needle|needles]] that were inserted into his groin and pelvic region.

=== Frank Ranieri ===
A 25-year old American was arrested in June 2007 for bribing multiple young females with large sums of money in exchange for poking their buttocks with sharp objects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Disability activism ==
'''Unlocked Central posts for doctors with disability'''

The disabled fighter fought for not only his but other disabled doctor’s rights. He also brought into open the discrimination by UPSC which disallowed doctors with disability to apply for various Central Health Services (CHS) posts. He himself was rejected in 2014 but fought and was later allowed to appear for the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M.S.J.E. doesn’t consider disabled doctors fit for teaching jobs|url=http://www.dnis.org/news.php?issue_id=5&amp;volume_id=8&amp;news_id=1142&amp;i=6|newspaper=D.N.I.S|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPSC discriminating against me, alleges differently-abled doctor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/upsc-discriminating-against-me-alleges-differentlyabled-doctor/article5334572.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, his application was again rejected when he highlighted that the same discrimination was also present for the other posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rejected by UPSC twice, physically challenged doctor battles for justice|url=http://www.indiamedicaltimes.com/2013/11/08/rejected-by-upsc-twice-physically-challenged-doctor-battles-for-justice/|date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed to apply in a quick intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Success for Dr Singh, but other physically challenged doctors still in lurch|url=http://www.indiamedicaltimes.com/2013/11/14/success-for-dr-singh-but-other-physically-challenged-doctors-still-in-lurch/|newspaper=India Medical Times|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His RTI revealed that doctors with disabilities are not considered eligible for specialist CHS posts in teaching, non-teaching as well as public health specialist cadres. Undeterred, he complained again and requested the health ministry to allow all eligible doctors with disability to apply for these posts. His single handed relentless fight for justice over four years ultimately forced Health Ministry to unlock 1,674 specialist central posts for disabled doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One man’s crusade opens up CHS jobs for disabled doctors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/One-mans-crusade-opens-up-CHS-jobs-for-disabled-doctors/articleshow/47661044.cms|publisher=The Times of India|date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Challenged unfair guidelines of [[Medical Council of India]]'''

He filed writ petition in the [[Supreme Court of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Medical Council of India’s new guidelines on admission of persons with specified disabilities: Unfair, discriminatory and unlawful |journal=Indian Journal of Medical Ethics |date=25 Aug 2018 |doi=10.20529/IJME.2018.064 |url=http://ijme.in/articles/medical-council-of-indias-new-guidelines-on-admission-of-persons-with-specified-disabilities-unfair-discriminatory-and-unlawful/?galley=html}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; lead successful advocacy of doctors with disabilities to the Central Government to bring amendments in the controversial MCI guidelines lifting the bar on admission of candidates with specified disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Medical Council of India’s guidelines for pupils with disabilities amended by Union Health Ministry |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-medical-council-of-india-s-guidelines-for-pupils-with-disabilities-amended-by-union-health-ministry-2653437 |agency=DNA |date=23 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Accessibility]] of all the medical institutions in India'''

On his petition the Court of the [[Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities]], under [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Government of India]] instructed [[Medical Council of India]] to issue directives to all the medical institutions in India to be disabled-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MCI asks all medical institutions to be 'accessible'|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mci-asks-all-medical-institutions-to-be-accessible/article4628862.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Demand for barrier-free buildings|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-26/delhi/37308686_1_access-audit-barrier-chief-commissioner|newspaper=The Times of India|date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hope in India as Mandatory Access For People with Disability Takes Shape|url=http://www.indiaamericatoday.com/article/hope-india-mandatory-access-people-disability-takes-shape|newspaper=India America Today|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these efforts, most medical institutions have yet to comply with the directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospitals waking up to the disabled's needs, but slowly|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/340497/hospitals-waking-up-disabled039s-needs.html|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AIIMS plans access to disabled, others silent|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-08-12/delhi/41331636_1_medical-colleges-aiims-mci|newspaper=The Times of India|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most medical colleges ignore directive on facilities for disabled|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/most-medical-colleges-ignore-directive-on-facilities-for-disabled/article5014252.ece?textsize=large&amp;test=1|newspaper=The Hindu|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His black armband protest on the [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities]] in 2012 led authorities to construct ramps outside all the hostels at his medical college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black armband silent protest against GTB hospital|url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/NewsContent.aspx?NID=14990|newspaper=Millennium Post|date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disabled friendly polling booths'''

He played an integral role of whistleblower to raise the issue of problems faced by voters with disability before and during the [[Delhi legislative assembly elections, 2013]] through [[Right to Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Not a disabled friendly electoral system|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/not-a-disabled-friendly-electoral-system/article5424837.ece|newspaper=The Hindu.|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=मतदान केन्द्रो पर विकलांगो के लिए जरूरी सुविधाओ का अभाव|newspaper=हिंदुस्तान|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raw deal for physically challenged voters|newspaper=The Statesman, page 2.|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote to the election commission as well as the Chief Justice of India to allow disabled voters to vote again before declaration of final results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi election 2013: Disabled voters rip apart system on web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Delhi-assembly-polls-Disabled-voters-rip-apart-system-on-web/articleshow/26922114.cms|newspaper=The Times of India|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His RTI on fourth [[National Voters' Day]] revealed how [[Election Commission of India]] was caught unprepared to enfranchise electors with disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polls near, but no data of voters with disabilities|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-27/india/46683677_1_national-voters-disabilities-electoral-participation|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed violation of Supreme Court orders of 2004 to empower voters with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=विकलांगों के लिए गंभीर नहीं चुनाव आयोग|url=http://www.punjabkesari.in/news/article-210889|newspaper=Punjab Kesari|date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the expose Chief Electoral Office, Delhi involved him in making elections in Delhi disabled-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Call for inclusive elections|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/call-for-inclusive-elections/article5807757.ece|newspaper=Hindu|date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did he sensitise the election officers on how to help electors with disability but he also helped in setting up a disability registration helpline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Voters with disability can register online|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/specials/lok-sabha-elections-2014/news/Voters-with-disability-can-register-online/articleshow/32751952.cms|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sustained efforts led to making election booths across the capital accessible to disabled and elderly voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lok Sabha Polls.

'''Filed first case under the new Disability Law against a cabinet Minister'''

He filed the first ever case under the new [[Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016]], which has strict punishment for contravention of provisions of Act, against [[Satyadev Pachauri]] for publicly ridiculing a disabled employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi University doctor stands up for UP government employee’s rights|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/new-disability-law-du-doc-stands-up-for-up-govt-employees-rights/articleshow/58321074.cms|publisher=Times of India|date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If convicted, Pachauri who is minister of khadi and village industries in the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]], will faces a six month to five-year prison term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UP Minister Could Become First to Be Tried Under New Disability Law|url=https://thewire.in/126598/satyadev-pachauri-persons-with-disabilities-act-uttar-pradesh/|publisher=The Wire|date=21 Apr 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Withdrawal of [[Union Public Service Commission]] and'''  '''[[Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination|Indian]] Institutes of Technology Joint Entrance Examinations ‘discriminatory proforma’'''

Dr Singh challenged [[Union Public Service Commission]]’s format whereby disabled applicants were asked to paste photographs showing their disability as a proof. The Court of [[Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities]] directed the UPSC to refrain from asking disabled candidates to submit photographs showing their disabilities and to consider the ‘permanent disability certificate’ issued from a government hospital as a valid proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPSC asked to withdraw proforma which demands photographs showing disability from applicants |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/upsc-asked-to-withdraw-proforma-which-demands-photographs-showing-disability-from-applicants/506055-3.html|newspaper=IBN Live.|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His advocacy led to the withdrawal of similar prOforma by IITJEE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iits-asked-to-stop-using-disability-photos-in-applications/story-ooKM1jGog3BJ8ZFNPvJ9oK.html|title = IITs asked to stop using disability photos in applications|last = |first = |date = 3 November 2015|work = |access-date = 17 February 2016|via = Hindustan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disabled-friendly websites of Delhi Government hospitals'''

His judicial activism led to the [[web accessibility]] of all the hospitals under [[Government of Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://deliver2030.org/?p=6648|title = What do the SDGs mean for India’s disabled citizens?|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policy change in duty concession for drivers with disability'''
Central Government provides excise duty concession to disabled customers however [[Maruti Suzuki]] denied him the concession on the pretext of right leg disability which was not only discriminatory but illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Only left is right: Why disabled drivers miss discount trip|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Only-left-is-right-Why-disabled-drivers-miss-discount-trip/articleshow/51675645.cms|publisher=Times of India|date=4 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His relentless fight led the [[Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises]] to amend the rules and quashing manufacturer's certificate and allowing RTO's certificate only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Centre amends duty concession for disabled|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Centre-amends-duty-concession-for-disabled/articleshow/52440917.cms|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dignified screening of people with disabilities at airports'''

After being harassed by security personnel at the Hyderabad airport because of his orthosis, Dr Singh approached [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]] (DGCA) and [[Bureau of Civil Aviation Security]] (BCAS) to amend rustic screening procedures and modify guidelines taking [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DU professor with disability harassed at Hyderabad airport|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DU-professor-with-disability-harassed-at-Hyderabad-airport/articleshow/30971043.cms|agency=Times of India|date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disability watchdog has directed both DGCA and BCAS to make sure people with disabilities are not being harassed or humiliated at airports and that security personnel have been sensitized towards them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Civil Aviation Misses Court of CCPD Notice Deadline On Frisking|url=http://www.reducedmobility.eu/20141003506/The-News/india-civil-aviation-misses-court-of-ccpd-notice-deadline-on-frisking.html|publisher=Reduced Mobility|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DGCA given 30 days to prove disabled not harassed|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/DGCA-given-30-days-to-prove-disabled-not-harassed/articleshow/42479388.cms|publisher=Times of India|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corrected wrong celebration of Salk's birthday on World Polio Day'''

[[Rotary International]] established World Polio Day (24 October) to commemorate the birthday of virologist [[Jonas Salk]] who developed polio vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO World Polio Day|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2013/polioday/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This erroneous observance was first challenged by Dr Singh in his publication in the official journal of the Edward Jenner Society's [[Vaccine (journal)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=S|title=It's time to correct the literature.|journal=Vaccine|date=11 January 2013|volume=31|issue=4|pages=591|pmid=23219693|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Google dedicated a doodle on Salk's 100th birthday to confirm 28 October as his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google doodle celebrates 100th birthday of Jonas Salk, who developed polio vaccine|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Google-doodle-celebrates-100th-birthday-of-Jonas-Salk-who-developed-polio-vaccine/articleshow/44955622.cms|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotary still celebrates the day on 24 October despite media reporting on the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Observing polio day on the wrong date?|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/observing-polio-day-on-the-wrong-date/article6543230.ece|publisher=Hindu|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School Enterprise Challenge''' is an international competition for schools to establish profitable student-led businesses. 

It aims to develop young people’s business and soft skills to better prepare them for the world of work and to develop their capacities as socially responsible entrepreneurs. The income generated from these businesses moreover can provide a useful additional source of funds for less well-resourced schools in developing countries, or can be used to support social projects in the community by better resourced schools.

The competition since its launch in 2011 has benefited over 80,000 young people directly from over 90 countries and has been recognized internationally for its positive social impact, including as one of the [[World_Innovation_Summit_for_Education|WISE]] Awards 2014 finalists.

The term '''''scotobiology''''' describes the study of [[biology]] as directly and specifically affected by [[darkness]], as opposed to [[photobiology]], which describes the biological effects of [[light]].

==Overview==
The science of scotobiology gathers together under a single descriptive heading a wide range of approaches to the study of the biology of darkness.  This includes work on the effects of darkness on the behavior and [[metabolism]] of animals, plants, and [[microorganism|microbe]]s.  Some of this work has been going on for over a century, and lays the foundation for understanding the importance of dark [[night skies]], not only for humans but for all biological species.

The great majority of biological systems have evolved in a world of alternating day and night and have become irrevocably adapted to and dependent on the daily and seasonally changing patterns of light and darkness. Light is essential for many biological activities such as [[visual perception|sight]] and [[photosynthesis]].  These are the focus of the science of photobiology. But the presence of uninterrupted periods of darkness, as well as their alternation with light, is just as important to biological behaviour. Scotobiology studies the positive responses of [[systems biology|biological systems]] to the presence of darkness, and not merely the negative effects caused by the absence of light.

==Effects of darkness==
Many of the biological and behavioural activities of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s (including [[bird]]s and [[amphibian]]s), [[insect]]s, and [[microorganism]]s are either adversely affected by [[light pollution]] at night or can only function effectively either during or as the consequence of nightly darkness. Such activities include [[foraging]], [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] and [[social behavior]] in higher animals, amphibians, and insects, which are all affected in various ways if light pollution occurs in their environment.&lt;ref name="goering"/&gt; These are not merely photobiological phenomena; light pollution acts by interrupting critical dark-requiring processes. 
 
But perhaps the most important scotobiological phenomena relate to the regular periodic alternation of light and darkness. These include breeding behavior in a range of animals, the control of [[flower]]ing and the induction of winter [[dormancy]] in many plants, and the operational control of the human [[immune system]]. In many of these biological processes the critical point is the length of the dark period rather than that of the light. For example, "short-day" and "long-day" plants are, in fact, "long-night" and "short-night" respectively. That is to say, plants do not measure the length of the light period, but of the dark period.&lt;ref name="bidwell"&gt;Bidwell, R.G.S. 1979. Plant Physiology, MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One consequence of artificial light pollution &lt;ref name="rich"&gt;"Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting", edited by Catherine Rich and Travis Longcore, Published by Island Press, 2006, 458pp, {{ISBN|1-55963-129-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is that even brief periods of relatively bright light during the night may prevent plants or animals (including humans) from measuring the length of the dark period, and therefore from behaving in a normal or required manner. This is a critical aspect of scotobiology, and one of the major areas in the study of the responses of biological systems to darkness.

In discussing scotobiology, it is important to remember that darkness (the absence of light) is seldom absolute. An important aspect of any scotobiological phenomenon is the level and quality ([[wavelength]]) of light that is below the threshold of detection for that phenomenon and in any specific organism. This important variable in scotobiological studies is not always properly noted or examined. There are substantial levels of natural light pollution at night, of which [[moonlight]] is usually the strongest.  For example, plants that rely on night length to program their behaviour have the capacity to ignore full moonlight during an otherwise dark night. If this ability had not evolved, plants would not be able to respond to changing night-length for such behavioural programs as the initiation of flowering and the onset of dormancy. On the other hand, some animal behavioural patterns are strongly responsive to moonlight. It is thus most important in any scotobiological study to determine the threshold level of light that may be required to interfere with or negate the normal pattern of [[nocturnality|dark-night activity]].

==Etymology==
In 2003, at a symposium on the [[Ecology]] of the Night held in [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]], [[Canada]], discussion centered around the many effects of night-time [[light pollution]] on the [[biology]] of a wide range of organisms, but it went far beyond this in describing darkness as a biological imperative for the functioning of biological systems.&lt;ref name="goering"&gt;The Ecology of the Night. An International Symposium: Darkness as a Biological Imperative. Muskoka, Canada, 22–24 September 2003; Chair, Peter L.E. Goering. Proceedings are available online at www.muskokaheritage.org/ecology-night/&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations focused on the absolute requirement of darkness for many aspects of normal behaviour and metabolism of many organisms and for the normal progression of their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s. Because there was no suitable term to describe the Symposium's main focus, the term ''scotobiology'' was introduced.  The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''scotos'', σκότος, "dark," and relates to [[photobiology]], which describes the biological effects of light (φῶς, ''phos''; root: φωτ-, ''phot-''). The term scotobiology appears not to have been used previously, although related terms such as [[phototropism|skototropism]]&lt;ref name="strong"&gt;Strong, D.R. and Ray, T.S. (1975). Science 190, #4216, pp 804-806.&lt;/ref&gt; and scotophyle&lt;ref name="bunning"&gt;Work of E. Bunning reported in (4), also of K.C. Hamner, reviewed in Evans, L.T. (1963).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">The use of '''space mirrors as an anti-global warming measure''' is a proposed technology for climate change mitigation by deflection of sunlight.  It was one of a series of proposals for controlling [[global warming]] made to the [[United States]] government in 2001.

At the "Response Options to Rapid or Severe Climate Change" round-table meeting organized by the President's [[U.S. Climate Change Technology Program|Climate Change Technology Program]] in September 2001 to gather ideas for averting climate change, one of the proposals was to station one or more wire-mesh "mirrors" in orbit to deflect sunlight back into space or to filter it. The idea was proposed by [[Lowell Wood]], a senior staff scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], who calculated that deflecting 1% of sunlight would restore climatic stability, and that that would require either a single mirror {{convert|600000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} in area or several smaller ones. Wood had been researching the idea for more than ten years but considered it so infeasible that it should only be a back-up plan for solving the global warming problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2005-06/how-earth-scale-engineering-can-save-planet "How Earth-Scale Engineering Can Save the Planet,"] ''[[Popular Science]]'' June 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the US government was recommending that research on sunlight deflection, including space mirrors, be continued as "insurance" and that the next [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|United Nations Report on Climate Change]] advocate such a strategy.&lt;ref name=Adam&gt;David Adam, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/27/usnews.frontpagenews "US answer to global warming: smoke and giant space mirrors,"] ''[[The Guardian]]'' January 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2007/01/26/USGReview_pp6_7.pdf U.S. Government Review of the Second Order Draft of WGIII Contribution "Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change,"] pdf at ''The Guardian''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s website: "Modifying solar radiance may be an important strategy if mitigation of emissions fails for one reason or another."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the space mirror, suggested sunlight-reducing techniques included launching thousands of highly reflective balloons and pumping sulphate droplets into the upper atmosphere to emulate volcanic emissions.&lt;ref name=Adam/&gt;&lt;ref name=TRev&gt;Mark Williams, [http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/18175/ "Cooling the Planet,"] ''[[Technology Review]]'' February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Space mirrors were first considered in the 1980s as a way to cool the climate of [[Venus (planet)|Venus]]. [[James Early]], also at Livermore, in 1989 proposed using a "space shade" 2,000 kilometers in diameter orbiting at [[Lagrangian point|Lagrangian Point L1]]. He estimated the cost at between one and ten trillion [[US dollars]] and suggested manufacturing it on the moon using moon rock.&lt;ref name=TRev/&gt; 

Using space mirrors as a [[space sunshade]] to reduce the impact of sunlight falls into the category of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]]: deliberately modifying the earth's climate. At a conference on the topic organized by [[Daniel P. Schrag|Daniel Schrag]] of [[Harvard University]]  and [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]] of the [[University of Calgary]] in November 2007, the consensus was that it was worth studying such ideas further despite their high cost, the doubtful feasibility of some including the space mirror, and the risk of their distracting attention from [[Emissions_reduction|reduction]] of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Martin LaMonica, [http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9819173-54.html "'Geoengineering': Space mirror over Greenland?,"] [[CNET.com]] - Greentech News November 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eli Kintisch]], [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2007/11/giving-climate-change-kick "Giving Climate Change a Kick,"] ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' November 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spirit possession''' is a term for the belief that [[animism|animas]], [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[demon]]s, [[Deity|gods]], or [[spirit]]s can take control of a [[human body]]. The concept of spirit possession exists in many religions, including [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name=new1&gt;Mark 5:9, Luke 8:30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]], [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Wicca]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n traditions. In a 1969 study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, spirit possession beliefs were found to exist in 74 percent of a sample of 488 societies in all parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourguignon|first1=Erika|last2=Ucko|first2=Lenora|title=Cross-Cultural Study of Dissociational States|date=1969|publisher=The Ohio State University Research Foundation with National Institute of Mental Health grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the cultural context in which it is found, possession may be considered voluntary or involuntary and may be considered to have beneficial or detrimental effects on the host. Within possession cults, the belief that one is possessed by spirits is more common among women than men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;1981 Kehoe, Alice B., and Giletti, Dody H., Women's Preponderance in Possession Cults: The Calcium Deficiency Hypothesis Extended, American Anthropologist, New Series,. 83(3): 549–561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Lewis, I.M. 1966 Spirit Possession and Deprivation Cults. Man, New Series: 1 (3): 307–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Egyptians ==
According to [[Augustin Calmet]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Egyptians believed that when the spirit of an animal is separated from its body by violence, it does not go to a distance, but remains near it. It is the same with the soul of a man who has died a violent death; it remains near the body—nothing can make it go away; it is retained there by sympathy; several have been seen sighing near their bodies which were interred. The magicians abuse their power over such in their incantations; they force them to obey, when they are masters of the dead body, or even part of it. Frequent experience taught them that there is a secret virtue in the body, which draws towards it the spirit which has once inhabited it; wherefore those who wish to receive or become the receptacles of the spirits of such animals as know the future, eat the principle parts of them, as the hearts of crows, moles, or hawks. The spirit of these creatures enters into them at the moment they eat this food, and makes them give out oracles like divinities.''.&lt;ref&gt;Calmet (1751), pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; ''Porphyry, when consulted by Anebo, an Egyptian priest, if those who foretell the future and perform prodigies have more powerful souls, or whether they receive power from some strange spirit, replies that, according to appearance, all these things are done by means of certain evil spirits that are naturally knavish, and take all sorts of shapes, and do everything that one sees happen, whether good or evil; but that in the end they never lead men to what is truly good.''&lt;ref&gt;Calmet (1751),  p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; - [[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==African traditions==

===Zār cult===
In [[Sudan]] and certain East African cultures the [[Zār]] cult conducts ethnomedical healing ceremonies involving possession, typically of Muslim women by a Zār spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janice Boddy]], "Wombs and Alien Spirits: Women, Men and the Zar Cult in Northern Sudan (New Directions in Anthropological Writing) University of Wisconsin Press (30 November 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; This is also found in [[North Africa]].

=====Gurage people=====
Among the [[Gurage people]] of Ethiopia, spirit possession is a common belief. Wiliam A. Shack postulated that it is caused by Gurage cultural attitudes about food and hunger, while they have a plentiful food supply, cultural pressures that force the Gurage to either share it to meet social obligations, or hoard it and eat it secretly cause feelings of anxiety. Distinctions are drawn between spirits that strictly possess men, spirits that possess women, and spirits that possess victims of either sex. A ritual illness that only affects men is believed to be caused by a spirit called ''awre''. This affliction presents itself by loss of appetite, nausea, and attacks from severe stomach pains. If it persists the victim may enter a trancelike stupor, in which he sometimes regains consciousness long enough to take food and water. Breathing is often labored. Seizures and trembling overcome the patient, and in extreme cases, partial paralysis of the extremities.&lt;ref name="Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43"&gt;Hunger, Anxiety, and Ritual: Deprivation and Spirit Possession Among the Gurage of Ethiopia Author(s): William A. Shack Source: Man, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Mar., 1971), pp. 30–43&lt;/ref&gt;

If the victim does not recover naturally, a traditional healer, or ''sagwara'', is summoned. Once the sagwara has determined the spirit's name through the use of divination, he prescribes a routine formula to exorcise the spirit. This is not a permanent cure, however, it is believed to allow the victim to form a relationship with the spirit. Nevertheless, the victim is subject to chronic repossession, which is treated by repeating the formula. This formula involves the preparation and consumption of a dish of [[ensete]], butter, and red pepper. During this ritual, the victim's head is covered with a drape, and he eats the ensete ravenously while other ritual participants participate by chanting. The ritual ends when the possessing spirit announces that it is satisfied. Shack notes that the victims are overwhelmingly poor men, and that women are not as food-deprived as men are due to ritual activities that involve food redistribution and consumption. Shack postulates that the ''awre'' serves to bring the possessed man to the center of social attention, and to relieve his anxieties over his inability to gain prestige from redistributing food, which is the primary way in which Gurage men gain status in their society.&lt;ref name="Hunger, Anxiety 1971 pp. 30-43"/&gt;

=====Sidama people=====
The belief in spirit possession is part of their native culture of the [[Sidama people]] of southwest [[Ethiopia]]. Anthropologists Irene and John Hamer postulated that it is a form of compensation for being deprived within Sidama society, although they do not draw from I.M. Lewis (see Cultural anthropology section under Scientific views). The majority of the possessed are women whose spirits demand luxury goods to alleviate their condition, but men can be possessed as well. Possessed individuals of both sexes can become healers due to their condition. Hamer and Hamer suggest that this is a form of compensation among deprived men in the deeply competitive society of the Sidama, for if a man cannot gain prestige as an orator, warrior, or farmer, he may still gain prestige as a spirit healer. Women are sometimes accused of faking possession, but men never are.&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, John and Irene Hamer 1966  Spirit Possession and Its Socio-Psychological Implications among the Sidamo Of Southwest Ethiopia.  Ethnology 5 (4): 392–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Africa===

====Kenya====

=====Digo people=====
The [[Digo people]] of [[Kenya]] refer to the spirits that supposedly possess them as  ''shaitani''. These ''shaitani'' typically demand luxury items to make the patient well again. Despite the fact that men sometimes accuse women of faking the possessions in order to get luxury items, attention, and sympathy, they do generally regard spirit possession as a genuine condition, and view victims of it as being ill through no fault of their own. However, men sometimes suspect women of actively colluding with spirits in order to be possessed.&lt;ref&gt;Gomm, Roger 1975 Bargaining from Weakness: Spirit Possession on the South Kenya Coast Man, New Series: 10 (4):530–543&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mayotte====
In [[Mayotte]], approximately 25 percent of the adult population, and five times as many women as men, enter trance states in which they are supposedly possessed by certain identifiable spirits who maintain stable and coherent identities from one possession to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lambek, Michael 1988 Spirit Possession/Spirit Succession: Aspects of Social Continuity among Malagasy Speakers in Mayotte. American Ethnologist: 15 (4): 710–731&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mozambique====
In [[Mozambique]], a new belief in spirit possession appeared after the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. These spirits, called ''gamba'', are said to be identified as dead soldiers, and allegedly overwhelmingly possess women. Prior to the war, spirit possession was limited to certain families and was less common.&lt;ref&gt;Igreja, Victor, Beatrice Dias-Lambranca, and Annemiek Richters 2008. Gamba spirits, gender relations, and healing in post-civil war Gorongosa, Mozambique. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 14: 353-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uganda====
In [[Uganda]], a woman named [[Alice Auma]] was reportedly possessed by the spirit of a male Italian soldier named Lakwena, meaning messenger. She had ultimately led a failed insurrection against governmental forces.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Tim 1991 Understanding Alice: Uganda's Holy Spirit Movement in Context.  Africa: Journal of the International African Institute. 61 (3): 370–399&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Africa===

====South Africa====
A belief in spirit possession appears among the [[Xesibe]], a [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] speaking people from [[Transkei]], [[South Africa]]. The majority of the supposedly possessed are married women. The condition of spirit possession among them is called ''inwatso''. Those who develop the condition of ''inwatso'' are regarded as having a special calling to divine the future. They are first treated with sympathy, and then with respect as they allegedly develop their abilities to foretell the future.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, M.C. 1982 Spirit Possession and Role Stress among the Xesibe of Eastern Transkei  Ethnology, 21 (1):  21–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Zanzibar=====
A now extinct spirit possession cult existed among the [[Hadimu]] women of [[Zanzibar]], revering a spirit called ''kitimiri''. This cult described in an 1869 account by a French missionary. The cult faded by the 1920s and was virtually unknown by the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, Edward A. 1984 "Ordinary Household Chores": Ritual and Power in a 19th-Century Swahili Women's Spirit Possession Cult The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 17, No. 4 (1984), pp. 677–702&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Africa===
See [[Hausa animism]]

==African diasporic traditions==

===Haitian Vodou===
In [[Haitian Vodou]] and [[Afro-American religion|related African diaspora traditions]], one way that those who participate or practice can have a spiritual experience is by being possessed by the ''[[Loa]]'' (or ''lwa''). When the ''loa'' descends upon a practitioner, the practitioner's body is being used by the spirit, according to the tradition. Some spirits are believed to be able to give prophecies of upcoming events or situations pertaining to the possessed one, also called ''Chwal'' or the "Horse of the Spirit." Practitioners describe this as a beautiful but very tiring experience. Most people who are possessed by the spirit describe the onset as a feeling of blackness or energy flowing through their body as if they were being electrocuted. According to Vodou believers, when this occurs, it is a sign that a possession is about to take place.

According to tradition, the practitioner has no recollection of the possession and in fact when the possessing spirit leaves the body, the possessed one is tired and wonders what has happened during the possession. It is also believed that there are those who feign possessions because they want attention or a feeling of importance, because those who are possessed carry a high importance in ceremony. Often, a ''chwal'' will undergo some form of trial or testing to make sure that the possession is allegedly genuine. As an example, someone possessed by one of the [[Guédé]] spirits may be offered ''piment'', a [[liqueur]] made by steeping twenty-one [[chili pepper]]s in ''kleren'', a potent [[alcoholic beverage]]. If the chwal consumes the piment without showing any evidence of pain or discomfort, the possession is regarded as genuine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Umbanda===
The concept of spirit possession is also found in [[Umbanda]], an Afro-Brazilian folk religion. According to tradition, one such possessing spirit is [[Pomba Gira]], who possesses both women and effeminate males.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Kelly E. 2008. Wicked Women and Femmes Fatales: Gender, Power, and Pomba Gira in Brazil. History of Religions. 48 (1): 1–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian traditions==

===Buddhism===
According to the Indian medical literature and [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhist]] scriptures, most of the "seizers," or those that threaten the lives of young children, appear in animal form: cow, lion, fox, monkey, horse, dog, pig, cat, crow, pheasant, owl, and snake. But apart from these "nightmare shapes," it is believed the impersonation or incarnation of animals could in some circumstances also be highly beneficial, according to Michel Strickmann.&lt;ref name="Strickmann 2002, p. 251"&gt;Michel Strickmann (2002), ''Chinese Magical Medicine'', edited by Bernard Faure, Stanford University Press, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ch'i Chung-fu, a Chinese gynecologist writing early in the thirteenth century, wrote that in addition to five sorts of falling frenzy classified according to their causative factors, there were also four types of other frenzies distinguished by the sounds and movements given off by the victim during his seizure: cow, horse, pig, and dog frenzies.&lt;ref name="Strickmann 2002, p. 251"/&gt;

====Rajasthan====
The concept of spirit possession exists in the culture of modern [[Rajasthan]]. Some of the spirits allegedly possessing Rajasthanis are seen as good and beneficial, while others are seen as malevolent. The good spirits are said to include murdered royalty, the underworld god [[Bhaironji]], and [[Muslim]] saints &amp; fakirs. Bad spirits are believed to include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists. The supposedly possessed individual is referred to as a ''ghorala'', or "mount". Possession, even if by a benign spirit, is regarded as undesirable, as it is seen to entail loss of self-control, and violent emotional outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;Imitation Is Far More than the Sincerest of Flattery: The Mimetic Power of Spirit Possession in Rajasthan, India Jeffrey G.

===Indonesian traditions===

====Bali====
The animist traditions of the island of [[Bali]] ([[Indonesia]]) include a practice called ''[[sanghyang]]'', induction of voluntary possession trance states for specific purposes. Roughly similar to voluntary possession in Vaudon (Voodoo), ''sanghyang'' is considered a sacred state in which [[hyang]]s (deities) or helpful spirits temporarily inhabit the bodies of participants. The purpose of sanghyang is believed to be to cleanse people and places of evil influences and restore spiritual balance. Thus, it is often referred to as an exorcism ceremony.

====Sulawesi====
The women of the [[Bonerate people]] of [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia practice a possession-trance ritual in which they smother glowing embers with their bare feet at the climax.

See [[Misaki#Spirit possession|Misaki]]

===Malaysian traditions===
Female workers in [[Malaysia]]n factories have allegedly become possessed by spirits, and factory owners generally regard it as [[mass hysteria]] and an intrusion of irrational and archaic beliefs into a modern setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Ong, Aihwa 1988 The Production of Possession: Spirits and the Multinational Corporation in Malaysia American Ethnologist 15 (1): 28–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropologist Aihwa Ong noted that spirit possession beliefs in Malaysia were typically held by older, married women, whereas the female factory workers are typically young and unmarried. She connects this to the rapid industrialization and modernization of Malaysia. Ong argued that spirit possession is a traditional way of rebelling against authority without punishment, and suggests that it is a means of protesting the untenable working conditions and sexual harassment that the women were compelled to endure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Sri Lankan traditions===
The [[Coast Veddas]], a social group within the minority group of [[Sri Lankan Tamil people]] in [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka]], enter trances during religious festivals in which they are regarded as being possessed by a spirit. Although they speak a dialect of [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialect|Tamil]], during trances they will sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the [[Vedda language]].&lt;ref name=JonDart83&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanic traditions==

===Melanesia===
The [[Urapmin people]] of the [[New Guinea Highlands]] practice a form of group possession known as the "spirit disco" ([[Tok Pisin]]: ''spirit disko'').&lt;ref name="r1998_310-311"&gt;{{cite journal

===Micronesia===
The concept of spirit possession appears in [[Chuuk State]], one of the four states of [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Although Chuuk is an overwhelmingly Christian society, traditional beliefs in spirit possession by the dead still exist, usually held by women, and "events" are usually brought on by family conflicts. The supposed spirits, speaking through the women, typically admonish family members to treat each other better.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel, Francis X. 1993 Spirit Possession in Chuuk: Socio-Cultural Interpretation. Micronesian Counselor 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Baptism with the Holy Spirit|Holy laughter|Demonic possession}}
[[Roman Catholic doctrine]] states that [[angel]]s are non-corporeal, spiritual beings&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the [[Catholic Church]], paragraph 328.&lt;/ref&gt; with intelligence and [[Will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 330.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fallen angel]]s, or [[demon]]s, are able to "[[demonic possession|demonically possess]]" individuals without the victim's knowledge or consent, leaving them morally blameless.&lt;ref&gt;p. 33, An Exorcist Tells his Story by Gabriele Amorth translated by Nicoletta V. MacKenzie; Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Spirit possession appears in [[Islamic theology]] and tradition. [[Jinn#Islam|Jinn]] are said to be creatures with [[Predestination in Islam|free will]], made from smokeless fire by [[God in Islam|God]] (Arabic: Allah) with the ability to possess humans. Since they are, unlike the [[shaitan|demons]] (''shayāṭīn''), are morally ambivalent, spirit possession is not necessarily harmful. According to Morrocan belief, a jinn-possessed may acquire supernatural powers. Other jinn may possess humans with no harmfull intents, but because they fell in love with an individual. In this case, it is tried to appease the jinn. At an intented possession, the covenant with the jinn must be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad Maʻrūf ''Jinn Eviction as a Discourse of Power: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Modern Morrocan Magical Beliefs and Practices'' BRILL 2007 {{ISBN|9789004160996}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to traditional beliefs, the possessed person speaks differently and acts in a strange and sometimes violent manner. One verse in the [[Quran]] describes that on judgment day, the behavior of those who earn high interest on loans "as if they were possessed or controlled by a satan". Exorcism and removal of jinn from possessed people is done by a religious person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|55|14|end=15|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة البقرة, Al-Baqara, Chapter #2, Verse #275)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة إبراهيم, Ibrahim, Chapter #14, Verse #11 and Verse #22)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة الحجر, Al-Hijr, Chapter #15, Verse #42)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(  سورة النحل, An-Nahl, Chapter #16, Verse #99–100)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search truth|url=http://www.searchtruth.com|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Although forbidden in the [[Hebrew Bible]], magic was widely practiced in the late [[Second Temple Period]] and well documented in the period following the destruction of the Temple into the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Bohak ''Ancient Jewish magic: a history'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Wahlen ''Jesus and the impurity of spirits in the Synoptic Gospels'' 2004 p. 19 "The Jewish magical papyri and incantation bowls may also shed light on our investigation.79 However, the fact that all of these sources are generally dated from the third to fifth centuries and beyond requires us to exercise particular ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jewish folklore]], a [[dybbuk]] is a disembodied [[spirit]] that wanders restlessly until it inhabits the body of a living person. The [[Baal Shem]] could expel the harmful dybbuk through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| contribution=Dybbuk| contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174964/dybbuk| title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| url=http://www.britannica.com/| accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jewish magical papyri]] were inscriptions on [[amulets]], [[ostraca]] and [[incantation bowls]] used in Jewish magical practices against [[shedim]] and other [[unclean spirit]]s.

==Shamanism==
{{Main article|Shamanism}}

==Wicca==
[[Wicca]]ns believe in voluntary possession by the [[Goddess]], connected with the sacred ceremony of [[Drawing Down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]]. The high priestess solicits the Goddess to possess her and speak through her.&lt;ref&gt;Margo Adler, ''Drawing Down the Moon''. Penguin, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific views==

===Cultural anthropology===
The anthropologist I.M. Lewis noted that women are more likely to be involved in spirit possession cults than men are, and postulated that such cults act as a means of compensation for their exclusion from other spheres within their respective cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Physical anthropology===
Anthropologists Alice B. Kehoe and Dody H. Giletti argued that the reason that women are more commonly seen in [[Afro-Eurasia]]n spirit possession cults is because of deficiencies in [[thiamine]], [[tryptophan]]-[[niacin]], [[calcium]], and [[vitamin D]]. They argued that a combination of poverty and food taboos cause this problem, and that it is exacerbated by the strains of pregnancy and lactation. They postulated that the involuntary symptoms of these deficiencies affecting their nervous systems have been institutionalized as spirit possession.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Psychology===
Spirit possession is not recognized as a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] or medical diagnosis by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] or the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD-10]]. People alleged to be possessed by spirits sometimes exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with [[mental illness]]es such as [[psychosis]], [[hysteria]], [[mania]], [[Tourette's syndrome]], [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], or [[dissociative identity disorder]],&lt;ref name="How Exorcism Works"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/exorcism5.htm|title=How Exorcism Works|date=8 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/dspace/handle/1794/1530 J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Supercritical hydrolysis''' is a [[chemical engineering]] process in which water in the supercritical state can be employed to achieve a variety of reactions within seconds. To cope with the extremely short times of reaction on an industrial scale, the process should be continuous. This continuity enables the ratio of the amount of water to the other reactant to be less than unity which minimizes the energy needed to heat the water above 374 C, the critical point. Application of the process to biomass provides simple sugars in near quantitative yield by supercritical hydrolysis of the constituent polysaccharides. The phenolic polymer components of the biomass, usually exemplified by lignins, are converted into a water-insoluble liquid mixture of low molecular phenols.

A private company, Renmatix, based in King of Prussia, PA, has developed a supercritical hydrolysis technology to convert a range of non-food biomass feedstocks into cellulosic sugars for application in biochemicals and biofuels. It has a demonstration facility in Georgia, currently capable of processing three dry tons of hardwood biomass into cellulosic sugar daily. In Australia, a government-sponsored entity called Licella, is similarly transforming sawdust. Both processes require high ratios of water to the amount of feedstock. This energy profligacy can be avoided by the use of a plastic-type extruder through which the solid, but wet, biomass is conveyed to a small inductively heated reaction zone as shown by Xtrudx Technologies Inc of Seattle.

Supercritical hydrolysis can be considered a broadly applicable green chemistry process that utilizes water simultaneously as a heat transfer agent, a solvent, a reactant, a source of hydrogen and as a char-reduction component.

==History==
Synap was developed by James Gupta and Omair Vaiyani, two medical students at [[Leeds School of Medicine|Leeds Medical School]], with an interest in neuroscience and memory. Having used [[spaced repetition]] software such as [[anki (software)|Anki]] in the past, they created a website that allowed students to write [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] quizzes in a [[multiple choice|Multiple Choice Question]] (MCQ) format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Synap had no revenues, but the founders were exploring adding a premium version for paying users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/synaps-app-students-edtech-oxford-lse-1st-quiz-exams-2015-10 "Here's the new app Oxford medics and LSE business students are using to help them get a 1st"], Business Insider, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===MyCQs===

The first incarnation of Synap operated under the name 'MyCQs', which was released as a native iOS application and website in 2012, and initially gained popularity amongst UK medical students&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/university-of-leeds-students-aiming-to-get-top-marks-for-smartphone-app-1-5058922 "University of Leeds students aiming to get top marks for smartphone app"], Yorkshire Evening Post, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://time.leeds.ac.uk/time/time_osce.php "Student Generated Resources"], Technology in Medical Education (University of Leeds), retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, CEO James Gupta was recruited as the Chief Technology Officer for [[JumpIn]], a student-focused taxi booking and sharing app.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lec.leeds.ac.uk/casestudies/sam-ryan-and-barney-williams-jumpin/ "Leeds University case studies: JumpIn"], Leeds University Careers, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; The company was acquired by taxi firm [[Addison Lee]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jackwills.com/young-brits-story-far/ "Young brits: the winner's stories so far"], Jack Wills Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cab4now.co.uk/blog/rideshare/rideshare/ "2015: Year of the rideshare?"], Cab4Now, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; after which James returned to focus on MyCQs.

In 2014, MyCQs received funding and mentoring from [[Jisc]], an education technology charity,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/summer-of-student-innovation-2014  "Jisc Summer of Student Innovation 2014"], Jisc, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; and received a scholarship from The University of Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/forstaff/news/article/4610/university_bootcamp_puts_fledgling_entrepreneurs_through_their_paces "University bootcamp puts fledgling entrepreneurs through their paces"], University of Leeds, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synap===
In 2015, the team shifted focus by integrating more algorithms based on [[educational psychology]] research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aistartups.org/2016/01/interview-with-james-gupta-ceofounder.html "Interview with James Gupta, CEO &amp; Founder of Synap"], AIStartups.org, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; and started to describe itself as a 'personalised learning' platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/james-gupta/the-death-of-the-universi_b_8173492.html "The death of the university lecture"], Huffington Post, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to the company being renamed Synap&lt;ref&gt;[https://synap.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207106445-What-Is-Synap- "Synap FAQ: What is Synap?"], Synap, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowdfunding===
In August 2015, Synap launched an [[equity crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Crowdcube]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crowdcube.com/investment/synap-19333 "Crowdcube official pitch page for Synap"], Crowdcube, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/news/725346-edtech-entrepreneurs-launch-180-000-crowdfunding-campaign.html "Edtech entrepreneurs launch £180,000 crowdfunding campaign"], Business Desk, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Synap uses the concept of spaced repetition to send new content to users based on what they need to practice the most. In this sense, Synap is similar to existing spaced repetition platforms such as [[Anki (software)|Anki]] and [[Supermemo|SuperMemo]], though notably it does not support the creation of flashcards, which are more commonly associated with spaced repetition.

==Infrastructure==
Synap was originally developed on Facebook's [[Parse (company)|Parse]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://synap.ac/blog/developing-an-effective-technology-stack "Developing an effective technology stack"], Synap Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24/&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Facebook announced that Parse would be closing down, and advised developers to migrate their apps to other services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/ "Moving On"], Parse Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, Synap has been hosted on [[Amazon Web Services]], using the newly open-sourced [https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server Parse Server], which itself uses [[Node.js]]. The website is developed in [[Ember.js]], and uses a MongoDB database, making Synap an example of [[MEAN (software bundle)|full stack JavaScript]] development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackshare.io/synap-ac/synap-ac "Synap.ac's technology stack"], StackShare, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==
Synap has been featured in The Oxford Public Health Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/oxfordpublichealth/docs/oxph_magazine_issue_4_apr2016 "Oxford Public Health Magazine Issue 4: Innovation and social entrepreneurship (p32-33"], Oxford Public Health Magazine, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Synap was listed as one of 10 British AI companies to look out for, by Business Insider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/10-british-ai-companies-to-look-out-for-in-2016-2015-12 "10 British AI companies to look out for in 2016"], Business Insider, retrieved 2016-24-04&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">The '''Test of Understanding in College Economics''' or '''TUCE''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use at the undergraduate level, primarily targeting introductory or principles-level coursework in economics.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e. [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Knowledge]] (TEK) and [[Test of Economic Literacy]] (TEL)) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TUCE is in its fourth edition (2007) and is available, along with an examiner’s manual, for instructors, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The latest revision process, a joint effort between the NCEE and the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]], included a national norming consisting of 70 institutions across the United States spanning the four largest categories of the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]].  The TUCE has two forms, one covering [[microeconomics]] and one covering [[macroeconomics]], each with thirty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items.  Each form includes three items covering [[international economics]].

'''Thatching''' is the craft of building a [[roof]] with dry vegetation such as [[straw]], [[Phragmites|water reed]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] (''[[Cladium mariscus]]''), [[Juncus|rushes]], [[Calluna|heather]], or [[palm branch]]es, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed—trapping air—thatching also functions as insulation. It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both [[tropical]] and [[temperate climates]]. Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries, usually with low-cost local vegetation. By contrast, in some developed countries it is  the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home, would like a more ecologically friendly roof, or who have purchased an originally thatched abode.

==History==
Thatching methods have traditionally been passed down from generation to generation, and numerous descriptions of the materials and methods used in [[Europe]] over the past three centuries survive in archives and early publications.
[[File:Thatch C8248 Stretton on Fosse.jpg|thumb|Thatched roof, England]]
In some equatorial countries, thatch is the prevalent local material for [[roof]]s, and often [[wall]]s. There are diverse building techniques from the [[ancient Hawaiian]] ''hale'' shelter made from the local [[Cordyline fruticosa|ti leaves]] (''Cordyline fruticosa''), [[lauhala]] (''Pandanus tectorius'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Lex AJ | last1 = Thomson | first2 = Lois | last2 = Englberger | first3 = Luigi | last3 = Guarino | first4 = RR | last4 = Thaman | first5 = Craig R | last5 = Elevitch | year = 2006 | chapter = Pandanus tectorius (''Pandanus'') | edition = 1.1 | editor-first = Craig R | editor-last = Elevitch | title = Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry | publisher = Permanent Agriculture Resources (PAR) | location = Hōlualoa, [[Hawai‘i|HI]] | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021015441/http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Heteropogon contortus|pili grass]] (''Heteropogon contortus'').
[[File:PrayerAtBesakih.jpg|thumb|right|The multi-tiered [[Meru tower]]s of [[Besakih]] temple, [[Bali]], uses black ''[[Arenga pinnata|ijuk]]'' fibres.]]
Palm leaves are also often used. For example, in Na Bure, [[Fiji]], thatchers combine fan palm leave roofs with layered reed walls. Feathered palm leaf roofs are used in Dominica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140201101759/http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperata cylindrica|Alang-alang]] (''Imperata cylindrica'') thatched roofs are used in Hawaii and [[Bali]]. In Southeast Asia, mangrove [[Nypa fruticans|nipa palm]] leaves are used as thatched roof material known as [[attap dwelling]]. In Bali, [[Indonesia]], the black fibres of [[Arenga pinnata]] called ''ijuk'' is also used as thatched roof materials, usually used in [[Balinese temple]] roof and meru towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Indonesian Town Revisited, Volume 1 of Southeast Asian dynamics | author = Peter J.

Wild vegetation such as water reed (''Phragmites australis''), bulrush/cat tail (''Typha'' spp.), broom (''Cytisus scoparius''), heather (''Calluna vulgaris''), and rushes (''Juncus'' spp. and ''Schoenoplectus lacustris'') was probably used to cover shelters and primitive dwellings in Europe in the late Palaeolithic period, but so far no direct archaeological evidence for this has been recovered. People probably began to use straw in the Neolithic period when they first grew cereals—but once again, no direct archaeological evidence of straw for thatching in Europe prior to the early medieval period survives.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}

Many [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] people of the Americas, such as the former Maya civilization, Mesoamerica, the Inca empire, and the Triple Alliance (Aztec), lived in thatched buildings. It is common to spot thatched buildings in rural areas of the Yucatán Peninsula as well as many settlements in other parts of Latin America, which closely resemble the method of construction from distant ancestors. After the collapse of most extant American societies due to diseases introduced by Europeans, wars, enslavement, and genocide, the first Americans encountered by Europeans lived in structures roofed with bark or skin set in panels that could be added or removed for ventilation, heating, and cooling.  Evidence of the many complex buildings with fiber-based roofing material was not rediscovered until the early 2000s. French and British settlers built temporary thatched dwellings with local vegetation as soon as they arrived in New France and New England, but covered more permanent houses with wooden shingles.

[[File:Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016).jpg|thumb|Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016)]]

In most of England, thatch remained the only roofing material available to the bulk of the population in the countryside, in many towns and villages, until the late 1800s.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Moir | first2 = John | last2 = Letts | title = Thatch: Thatching in England 1790–1940 | publisher = English Heritage | journal = Research Transactions | volume = 5 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Slate industry in Wales|Commercial production of Welsh slate]] began in 1820, and the mobility provided by [[canals]] and then [[railways]] made other materials readily available. Still, the number of thatched properties actually increased in the UK during the mid-1800s as agriculture expanded, but then declined again at the end of the 19th century because of agricultural recession and rural depopulation.  
[[File:Thatch stanton c 8333.jpg|thumb|Cottage with thatched roof in Stanton, a village in the Cotswolds, England]]
Gradually, thatch became a mark of poverty, and the number of thatched properties gradually declined, as did the number of professional thatchers. Thatch has become much more popular in the UK over the past 30 years, and is now a symbol of wealth rather than poverty. There are approximately 1,000 full-time thatchers at work in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | edition = unpublished | title = Survey | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thatching is becoming popular again because of the renewed interest in preserving historic buildings and using more sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|title=Magical thatched homes that will enchant you|author=|date=|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402035458/http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|archivedate=2 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although thatch is popular in Germany, The Netherlands, Denmark, parts of France, Sicily, Belgium and Ireland, there are more thatched roofs in the [[United Kingdom]] than in any other European country.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2014}} Good quality straw thatch can last for more than 50 years when applied by a skilled thatcher. Traditionally, a new layer of straw was simply applied over the weathered surface, and this "spar coating" tradition has created accumulations of thatch over 7’ (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) thick on very old buildings. The straw is bundled into "yelms" before it is taken up to the roof and then is attached using staples, known as "spars", made from twisted hazel sticks. Over 250 roofs in Southern England have base coats of thatch that were applied over 500 years ago, providing direct evidence of the types of materials that were used for thatching in the medieval period.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}  Almost all of these roofs are thatched with wheat, rye, or a "maslin" mixture of both.  Medieval wheat grew to almost {{convert |6|ft}} tall in very poor soils and produced durable straw for the roof and grain for baking bread.

Technological change in the [[farming]] [[industry]] significantly affected the popularity of thatching. The availability of good quality thatching straw declined in England after the introduction of the combine harvester in the late 1930s and 1940s, and the release of short-stemmed wheat varieties. Increasing use of nitrogen fertiliser in the 1960s–70s also weakened straw and reduced its longevity. Since the 1980s, however, there has been a big increase in straw quality as specialist growers have returned to growing older, tall-stemmed, "heritage" varieties of wheat such as Squareheads Master (1880), N59 (1959), Rampton Rivet (1937), Victor (1910) and April Bearded (early 1800s)] in low input/organic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | year = 2007 | title = Growing Straw for Thatching: a guide | publisher = The COHT (Conservation of Historic Thatch Committee}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK it is illegal under the [[Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964]] (with many amendments) for an individual or organisation to give, trade or sell seed of an older variety of wheat (or any other agricultural crop) to a third party for growing purposes, subject to a significant fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Legislation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | year = 1964 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111202021/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this legislation, thatchers in the UK can no longer obtain top quality thatching straw grown from traditional, tall-stemmed varieties of wheat.

All evidence indicates that water reed was rarely used for thatching outside of East Anglia.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"/&gt; It has traditionally been a "one coat" material applied in a similar way to how it is used in continental Europe. Weathered reed is usually stripped and replaced by a new layer. It takes 4–5 acres of well-managed reed bed to produce enough reed to thatch an average house, and large reed beds have been uncommon in most of England since the Anglo-Saxon period. Over 80% of the water reed used in the UK is now imported from [[Turkey]], [[Eastern Europe]], China and South Africa. Though water reed might last for 50 years or more on a steep roof in a dry climate, modern imported water reed on an average roof in England does not last any longer than good quality wheat straw. The lifespan of a thatched roof also depends on the skill of the thatcher, but other factors must be considered—such as [[climate]], quality of materials, and the roof pitch.

In areas where [[Arecaceae|palms]] are abundant, palm leaves are used to thatch walls and roofs. Many species of palm trees are called "[[thatch palm]]", or have "thatch" as part of their common names. In the [[southeastern United States]], Native and pioneer houses were often constructed of [[Arecaceae|palmetto]]-leaf thatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last = Andrews | editor1-first = Charles Mclean | editor2-last = Andrews | editor2-first = Evangeline Walker | origyear = 1945 | title = Jonathan Dickinson's Journal or, God's Protecting Providence.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 1.jpg|The creativity that comes with mud housing in rural areas is largely in the art of its roofing, of crafting thatch. As poor areas develop, newer ways of doing things have arrived: faster, more reliable, more durable ways. Houses are now being raised with modern materials, and even the ones standing still in traditional clay and thatch are being refurbished with the fashionable cement blocks/metal roofing sheets. This progression has no doubt brought about a decline in the practice of traditional crafts such as thatching.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 2.jpg|Mr. Bassey Ekpenyong, an indigene of Ito community in Cross-River state, Nigeria, calls me his friend in that manner that, as a stranger serving in his community under the National Youth Service Corp, makes me feel safe. He invites me to his shop during evening hours, and as he offers me roasted nuts, he makes a new promise to take me on his bike to the beach when the rains have stopped and the roads are accessible again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 3.jpg|It is on my return to Ito after a couple of weeks away that I first see him seated in the shade outside of his shop, palm leaves littered all over. He sees the excitement register on my face as I pass on my bike and signals that I return, as if to say, "I have been waiting for you." And truly, he has.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 4.jpg|He is making a new roof for his shop, he tells me. He wants me to make pictures. There are palm leaves all over, some tied up in a bunch, some lying underneath the sun, others thatched already and staked up in a pile. In his hands are two long, thinly carved sticks that would function as the skeletal frame for a pair of thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 5.jpg|He begins a new pair and laughs as he talks; a satisfaction comes with the knowledge that he is creating for me yet another experience to take home when service is over. He makes a joke of it.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 6.jpg|He folds a leaf in half neatly across both sticks. He does the same for another leaf, lapping it with the previous; then, using another tiny stick which he breaks afterwards, pins the leaves firmly in place.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 7.jpg|The process continues until the sticks are fully covered in green palm leaves. He completes a pair of thatch in minutes and begins another.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 8.jpg|Mr. Bassey is a conversationalist. He talks about the need for this change, a practice he does every five years as this is the durability period for the thatch. "Nfok nkaya," he says in Efik, pointing to his shop behind: mud house with mat (thatch). He points to other houses around, including the ones made of clay but with metal roofing sheets, and calls them "Ikanga": zinc dey up.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 9.jpg|On other days, Mr Bassey is joined by his friends. They sit for long hours underneath the tree on their return from their various farms. They chat as they thatch, switching on occasion from Efik to English.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 10.jpg|They craft at the same pace, with the same measure of skill, but what intrigues me the most is their fellowship in that shared space, a communion of banter and silence. How silence descends on them as they craft, only to be broken yet again with a thought, a story, a sigh—childhood friends who had all grown up in this same space and carried within themselves different experiences as they each sorted life out; some leaving only to return yet again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 11.jpg|Childhood friends thatching through time, memories into their palms, pinning them into that place of recollection, of regret, of conquests. Pinning them with the same laughter and voices that survived time.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 12.jpg|When asked how and when they had learnt thatching, the story is the same for everyone. They throw back to a time when they were just kids, when Ito was only made of the traditional mud houses.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 13.jpg|As kids, they had been taken along with other kids by the contractor, an older member of the community who dealt in sales of thatch, to the beach. There, they had each been assigned to a bunch of palm leaves, and had made dozens of thatch. This contractor in return had provided their meal for the day and bought them treats. Afterwards, he had also paid their mothers for the children's work; money meant for their upkeep.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 14.jpg|"We just sabi," Mr. Bassey tells me, explaining to me how he couldn't really pinpoint exactly how he had learnt. In a society where almost everything used was hand-crafted, most of these skills children grew into, got used to just by seeing them done on a daily basis, just by being a part of the home/society.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 15.jpg|"Those wen no sabi wen we go beach go just sidon look those wen sabi, or, watch contractor do am and dem go sabi."

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 16.jpg|To Mr. Bassey this is more. It carries sentiments enough for him to brag about the metal roofing sheets he's kept lying waste in his house for years. When the few thatched houses left have been broken down and then raised up in modern fashion, he still sits outside of his shop underneath the tree every five years, matting green leaves into thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 17.jpg|His shop, once his home, carries for him memories of events: of childhood adventures; of leaving and returning; of his late wife, of loss. Memories that make him. And thatching, this craft, this practice of maintenance is, in a fast-paced world, for him the very means through which he holds time in his hands. The very means to which he laps these memories into a place of remembrance. The very means in which he shelters them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Maintenance in temperate climates==
[[File:Old-sanrizuka-goryou-farm,old-house-for-honored-guests,narita-city,japan.JPG|thumb|Thatched roof in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]], [[Japan]].]]
Good thatch does not require frequent maintenance. In England a ridge normally lasts 8–14 years, and re-ridging is required several times during the lifespan of a thatch. Experts no longer recommend covering thatch with wire netting, as this slows evaporation and reduces longevity. [[Moss]] can be a problem if very thick, but is not usually detrimental, and many species of moss are actually protective. {{Citation | title = The Thatcher's Craft | year = 1960}}, remains the most widely used reference book on the techniques used for thatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | publisher = HCT | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | title = Thatch | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111063005/http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of a layer of thatch decreases over time as the surface gradually turns to compost and is blown off the roof by wind and rain. Thatched roofs generally needs replacement when the horizontal wooden 'sways' and hair-pin 'spars', also known as 'gads' (twisted hazel staples) that fix each course become visible near the surface. It is not total depth of the thatch within a new layer applied to a new roof that determines its longevity, but rather how much weathering thatch covers the fixings of each overlapping course. “A roof is as good as the amount of correctly laid thatch covering the fixings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | title = The Thatch &amp; Thatching | publisher = The East Anglia Master Thatchers Association | place = UK | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101444/http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | archivedate = 2011-08-31 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flammability ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Image:House river kwai.jpg|thumb|right|River houses on the [[Khwae Noi River|River Kwai]].]]
Thatch is not as flammable as many people believe. It burns slowly, "like a closed book," thatchers say. The vast majority of fires are linked to the use of wood burners and faulty chimneys with degraded or poorly installed or maintained flues. Sparks from paper or burned rubbish can ignite dry thatch on the surface around a chimney. Fires can also begin when sparks or flames work their way through a degraded chimney and ignite the surrounding semi-charred thatch. This can be avoided by ensuring that the chimney is in good condition, which may involve stripping thatch immediately surrounding the chimney to the full depth of the stack. This can easily be done without stripping thatch over the entire roof. Insurance premiums on thatched houses are higher than average in part because of the perception that thatched roofs are a fire hazard, but also because a thatch fire can cause extensive smoke damage and a thatched roof is more expensive to replace than a standard tiled or slate roof. Workmen should never use open flame near thatch, and nothing should be burnt that could fly up the chimney and ignite the surface of the thatch. [[Spark arrestor]]s usually cause more harm than good, as they are easily blocked and reduce air flow. All thatched roofs should have smoke detectors in the roof space. Spray-on fire retardant or pressure impregnated fire retardants can reduce the spread of flame and radiated heat output.

On new buildings, a solid fire retardant barrier over the rafters can make the thatch sacrificial in case of fire. If fireboards are used, they require a ventilation gap between boarding and thatch so that the roof can breathe, as condensation can be a significant problem in thin, single layer thatch. Condensation is much less of a problem on thick straw roofs, which also provide much better insulation since they do not need to be ventilated.

==Performance==
[[Image:Kodaiji-2002-0098.jpg|thumb|Ihōan, a tea house at [[Kōdai-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].]]
The performance of thatch depends on roof shape and design, pitch of roof, position—its [[geography]] and [[topography]]—the quality of material and the expertise of the thatcher.

Thatch has some natural properties that are advantageous to its performance. It is naturally weather-resistant, and when properly maintained does not absorb a lot of water. There should not be a significant increase to roof weight due to water retention. A roof pitch of at least 50 degrees allows precipitation to travel quickly down slope so that it runs off the roof before it can penetrate the structure.

Thatch is also a natural insulator, and air pockets within straw thatch insulate a building in both warm and cold weather. A thatched roof ensures that a building is cool in summer and warm in winter.

Thatch also has very good resistance to wind damage when applied correctly.

===Advantages===
Thatching materials range from plains grasses to waterproof leaves found in equatorial regions. It is the most common roofing material in the world, because the materials are readily available.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
[[Image:Partially thatched roof.jpg|thumb|right|Farm-house in the [[Netherlands]] near [[Alkmaar]]. The combination of thatch and [[roof tiles]] is quite common in that area.]]
Because thatch is lighter, less timber is required in the roof that supports it.

Thatch is a versatile material when it comes to covering irregular roof structures. This fact lends itself to the use of second-hand, [[recycled]] and natural materials that are not only more [[sustainable]], but need not fit exact standard dimensions to perform well.

===Disadvantages===
Thatched houses are harder to insure because of the perceived fire risk, and because thatching is labor-intensive, it is much more expensive to thatch a roof than to cover it with slate or tiles. Birds can damage a roof while they are foraging for grubs, and rodents are attracted by residual grain in straw.

[[Image:Lucy in the sky.jpg|thumb|right|Thatched hut in [[Lesotho]].]]
Thatch has fallen out of favor in much of the industrialized world not because of fire, but because thatching has become very expensive and alternative 'hard' materials are cheaper—but this situation is slowly changing. There are about 60,000 thatched roofs in the UK, of which 50–80 suffer a serious fire each year, most of these being completely destroyed. The cost to the Fire Brigade is £1.3m per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more thatched roofs are being built every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

New thatched roofs were forbidden in London in 1212 following a major fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html|title=Florilegium urbanum - Physical fabric - Regulations for building construction and fire safety |date=|website=users.trytel.com|accessdate=6 May 2018 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026234132/http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html |archivedate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing roofs had to have their surfaces plastered to reduce the risk of fire. The modern [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] is one of the few thatched buildings in London (others can be found in the suburb of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]]), but the Globe's modern, water reed thatch is purely for decorative purpose and actually lies over a fully waterproofed roof built with modern materials. The Globe Theatre, opened in 1997, was modelled on the Rose, which was destroyed by a fire on a dry June night in 1613 when a burning wad of cloth ejected from a special effects cannon during a performance set light to the surface of the thatch. The original Rose Theatre was actually thatched with cereal straw, a sample of which was recovered by Museum of London archaeologists during the excavation of the site in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Letts | title = Unpublished photos and sample records}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim thatch cannot cope with regular snowfall but, as with all roofing materials, this depends on the strength of the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in [[Massachusetts]] outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around {{convert|7|lb/sqft|abbr=on}}, so the roof supporting it does not need to be so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates on a lightly constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45–55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as [[Minka#Roofing|parts of Japan]], the pitch is increased further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|title=Winter Japan at its Best|publisher=Addicted to Travel|accessdate=7 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328175612/http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thatched roofs in the UK are extremely old and preserve evidence of traditional materials and methods that have long since been lost. In northern Britain this evidence is often preserved beneath corrugated sheet materials and frequently come to light during the development of smaller rural properties. [[Historic Scotland]] have funded several research projects into thatching techniques and these have revealed a wide range of materials including broom, heather, rushes, cereals, bracken, turf and clay and highlighted significant regional variation &lt;ref&gt;Walker, B, McGregor, C.&amp; Stark, G  1996  Thatches and Thatching Techniques: A guide to conserving Scottish Thatching Traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5329">The '''two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method''' is a method for combining a number of related types of information into a single, immediately meaningful, index that allows comparisons to be made across different locations. Its importance lies in the improvement over considering the individual sources of information separately, where none on its own provides an adequate summary.

==Background==

The two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is a special case of a [[gravity model]] of [[Spatial analysis#Spatial interaction|spatial interaction]] that was developed to measure spatial accessibility to [[primary care physician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Wang 2003a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LWb"&gt;Luo and Wang 2003b&lt;/ref&gt; 2SFCA can also be used to measure other accessibility such as accessibility to jobs, to [[cancer care]] facilities, etc. It was inspired by the spatial decomposition idea first proposed by Radke and Mu (2000).

The 2SFCA method not only has most of the advantages of a gravity model, but is also intuitive to interpret, as it uses essentially a special form of physician-to-population ratio. It is easy to implement in a [[Geographic information system|GIS]] environment.&lt;ref name="LWb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Luo, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 2006: 80-95&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the 2SFCA method measures spatial accessibility as a ratio of primary-care physicians to population, combining two steps:
#it first assesses “physician availability” at the physicians' (supply) locations as the ratio of physicians to their surrounding population (i.e., within a threshold travel time from the physicians)
#it sums up the ratios (i.e., physician availability derived in the first step) around (i.e., within the same threshold travel time from) each residential (demand) location.

It has been recently enhanced by considering [[distance decay]] within catchments&lt;ref&gt;Luo and Qi, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and called the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method.

Furthermore, the use of capping certain services according to nearby population size,can improve the accuracy when analyzing across areas of different environments&lt;ref&gt;McGrail and Humphreys, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. rural and urban).

The method has been applied to other related public health issues, such as access to healthy food retailers&lt;ref&gt;Chen, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Urban sociology''' is the [[sociology|sociological]] study of life and human interaction in [[metropolitan area]]s. It is a [[normative]] discipline of sociology seeking to study the structures, environmental processes, changes and problems of an [[urban area]] and by doing so provide inputs for [[urban planning]] and policy making. In other words, it is the sociological study of cities and their role in the development of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/urban+sociology Dictionary reference]&lt;/ref&gt;
Like most areas of sociology, urban sociologists use statistical analysis, observation, social theory, interviews, and other methods to study a range of topics, including migration and demographic trends, economics, poverty, race relations and economic trends&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, H.J., 2017. Urban Sociology in Trump's America and Beyond. City &amp; Community, 16(2), pp.127-130.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The philosophical foundations of modern urban sociology originate from the work of sociologists such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]] who studied and theorized the economic, social and cultural processes of [[urbanization]] and its effects on [[social alienation]], class formation, and the production or destruction of collective and individual identities.

These theoretical foundations were further expanded upon and analyzed by a group of sociologists and researchers who worked at the University of Chicago in the early twentieth century. In what became known as the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of sociology]] the work of [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]], [[Louis Wirth]] and [[Ernest Burgess]] on the inner city of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] revolutionized the purpose of urban research in sociology but also the development of [[human geography]] through its use of quantitative and ethnographic research methods. The importance of the theories developed by the Chicago School within urban sociology have been critically sustained and critiqued but still remain one of the most significant historical advancements in understanding [[urbanization]] and the city within the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;Martin, D.G., "Chicago School" in D. Gregory, R. Johnston, G. Pratt, M. Watts and S. Whatmore, eds., ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', London: Blackwell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and rise of urban sociology==
{{further|Chicago school (sociology)}}

Urban sociology rose to prominence within the academy in North America through a group of sociologists and theorists at the University of Chicago from 1915 to 1940 in what became known as the Chicago School of Sociology. The Chicago School of Sociology combined sociological and anthropological theory with ethnographic fieldwork in order to understand how individuals interact within urban social systems.&lt;ref name=Flanagan&gt;Flanagan, W., ''Contemporary Urban Sociology'' Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wirth&gt;Wirth, L., ''Urbanism as a Way of Life'' The American Journal of Sociology: Volume 44, Number 1, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the primarily macro-based sociology that had marked earlier subfields, members of the Chicago School placed greater emphasis on micro-scale social interactions that sought to provide subjective meaning to how humans interact under structural, cultural and social conditions. The theory of symbolic interaction, the basis through which many methodologically-groundbreaking ethnographies were framed in this period, took primitive shape alongside urban sociology and shaped its early methodological leanings. Symbolic interaction was forged out of the writings of early micro-sociologists [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]] and [[Max Weber]], and sought to frame how individuals interpret symbols in everyday interactions. With early urban sociologists framing the city as a 'superorganism', the concept of [[symbolic interaction]] aided in parsing out how individual communities contribute to the seamless functioning of the city itself.&lt;ref name=Trepl&gt;Trepl, L., ''City and Ecology'' Capitalism Nature Socialism: Volume 7, Number 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of the Chicago School originally sought to answer a single question: how did an increase in urbanism during the time of the Industrial Revolution contribute to the magnification of contemporary social problems? Sociologists centered on [[Chicago]] due to its '[[tabula rasa]]' state, having expanded from a small town of 10,000 in 1860 to an urban metropolis of over two million in the next half-century. Along with this expansion came many of the era's emerging social problems - ranging from issues with concentrated homelessness and harsh living conditions to the low wages and long hours that characterized the work of the many newly arrived European immigrants. Furthermore, unlike many other metropolitan areas, Chicago did not expand outward at the edges as predicted by early expansionist theorists, but instead 'reformatted' the space available in a concentric ring pattern.&lt;ref name= Burgess&gt;Burgess, E., "The growth of the city: an introduction to a research project," in Park, R.E. (ed) ''The City'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 47-62, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many modern cities the business district occupied the city center and was surrounded by slum and blighted neighborhoods, which were further surrounded by workingmens' homes and the early forms of the modern suburbs. Urban theorists suggested that these spatially distinct regions helped to solidify and isolate class relations within the modern city, moving the middle class away from the urban core and into the privatized environment of the outer suburbs.&lt;ref name=Sassen&gt;Sassen, S., ''New frontiers facing urban sociology at the millennium'' The British Journal of Sociology: Volume 51, Number 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the high concentration of first-generation immigrant families in the inner city of Chicago during the early 20th century, many prominent early studies in urban sociology focused upon the transmission of immigrants' native culture [[roles]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] into new and developing environments. Political participation and the rise in inter-community organizations were also frequently covered in this period, with many metropolitan areas adopting census techniques that allowed for information to be stored and easily accessed by participating institutions such as the University of Chicago. Park, Burgess and McKenzie, professors at the University of Chicago and three of the earliest proponents of urban sociology, developed the [[Subculture Theories]], which helped to explain the often-positive role of local institutions on the formation of community acceptance and social ties.&lt;ref name=Park&gt;Park, R., ''The City: Suggestions for Investigation of Human Behavior in the Urban Environment'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; When race relations break down and expansion renders one's community members anonymous, as was proposed to be occurring in this period, the inner city becomes marked by high levels of social disorganization that prevent local ties from being established and maintained in local political arenas.

The rise of urban sociology coincided with the expansion of [[statistical inference]] in the [[behavioural sciences]], which helped ease its transition and acceptance in educational institutions along with other burgeoning social sciences. [[Microsociology|Micro-sociology]] courses at the University of Chicago were among the earliest and most prominent courses on urban sociological research in the United States.

==Evolution of urban sociology==

The evolution and transition of sociological theory from the Chicago School began to emerge in the 1970s with the publication of [[Claude Fischer]]'s (1975) "Toward a Theory of Subculture Urbanism" which incorporated [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu's]] theories on [[social capital]] and [[symbolic capital]] within the invasion and succession framework of the Chicago School in explaining how cultural groups form, expand and solidify a neighbourhood. The theme of transition by subcultures and groups within the city was further expanded by [[Barry Wellman]]'s (1979) "The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers" which determined the function and position of the individual, institution and community in the urban landscape in relation to their community. Wellman's categorization and incorporation of community focused theories as "Community Lost", "Community Saved", and "Community Liberated" which center around the structure of the urban community in shaping interactions between individuals and facilitating active participation in the local community are explained in detail below:

'''Community lost:''' The earliest of the three theories, this concept was developed in the late 19th century to account for the rapid development of industrial patterns that seemingly caused rifts between the individual and their local community. Urbanites were claimed to hold networks that were “impersonal, transitory and segmental”, maintaining ties in multiple social networks while at the same time lacking the strong ties that bound them to any specific group. This disorganization in turn caused members of urban communities to subsist almost solely on secondary affiliations with others, and rarely allowed them to rely on other members of the community for assistance with their needs.

'''Community saved:''' A critical response to the community lost theory that developed during the 1960s, the community saved argument suggests that multistranded ties often emerge in sparsely-knit communities as time goes on, and that urban communities often possess these strong ties, albeit in different forms. Especially among low-income communities, individuals have a tendency to adapt to their environment and pool resources in order to protect themselves collectively against structural changes. Over time urban communities have tendencies to become “urban villages”, where individuals possess strong ties with only a few individuals that connect them to an intricate web of other urbanities within the same local environment.

'''Community liberated:''' A cross-section of the community lost and community saved arguments, the community liberated theory suggests that the separation of workplace, residence and familial kinship groups has caused urbanites to maintain weak ties in multiple community groups that are further weakened by high rates of residential mobility. However, the concentrated number of environments present in the city for interaction increase the likelihood of individuals developing secondary ties, even if they simultaneously maintain distance from tightly-knit communities. Primary ties that offer the individual assistance in everyday life form out of sparsely-knit and spatially dispersed interactions, with the individual's access to resources dependent on the quality of the ties they maintain within their community.&lt;ref name=Wellman&gt;Wellman, B., ''The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers'' American Journal of Sociology: Volume 84, Number 4, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the development of these theories, urban sociologists have increasingly begun to study the differences between the urban, rural and suburban environment within the last half-century. Consistent with the community liberated argument, researchers have in large part found that urban residents tend to maintain more spatially-dispersed networks of ties than rural or suburban residents. Among lower-income urban residents, the lack of mobility and communal space within the city often disrupts the formation of social ties and lends itself to creating an unintegrated and distant community space. While the high density of networks within the city weakens relations between individuals, it increases the likelihood that at least one individual within a network can provide the primary support found among smaller and more tightly-knit networks.
Since the 1970s, research into social networks has focused primarily on the types of ties developed within residential environments. Bonding ties, common of tightly-knit neighborhoods, consist of connections that provide an individual with primary support, such as access to income or upward mobility among a neighborhood organization. Bridging ties, in contrast, are the ties that weakly connect strong networks of individuals together. A group of communities concerned about the placement of a nearby highway may only be connected through a few individuals that represent their views at a community board meeting, for instance.&lt;ref name=Granovetter&gt;Granovetter, M., "The Strength of Weak Ties", ''American Journal of Sociology'',78(6), 1360-1380, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as theory surrounding social networks has developed, sociologists such as [[Alejandro Portes]] and the [[Wisconsin model| Wisconsin model of sociological research]] began placing increased leverage on the importance of these weak ties.&lt;ref name="Portes and Sensenbrenner" &gt;Portes, A., and Sensenbrenner, J.,"Embeddedness and immigration: notes on the social determinants of economic action," ''American Journal of Sociology'', 98, pp. 1320-1350, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; While strong ties are necessary for providing residents with primary services and a sense of community, weak ties bring together elements of different cultural and economic landscapes in solving problems affecting a great number of individuals. As theorist Eric Oliver notes, neighborhoods with vast social networks are also those that most commonly rely on heterogeneous support in problem solving, and are also the most politically active.&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;Oliver, E., ''Democracy in Suburbia'' Connecticut: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the suburban landscape developed during the 20th century and the outer city became a refuge for the wealthy and, later, the burgeoning middle class, sociologists and [[urban geography|urban geographers]] such as [[Harvey Molotov]], [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] began to study the structure and revitalization of the most impoverished areas of the inner city. In their research, impoverished neighborhoods, which often rely on tightly-knit local ties for economic and social support, were found to be targeted by developers for [[gentrification]] which displaced residents living within these communities.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, N., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EMM2xowSlEgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The New Urban Frontier: Gentrification and the Revanchist City]'', London: Routledge, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Political experimentation in providing these residents with semi-permanent housing and structural support - ranging from Section 8 housing to [[Community Development Block Grant]] programs- have in many cases eased the transition of low-income residents into stable housing and employment. Yet research covering the social impact of forced movement among these residents has noted the difficulties individuals often have with maintaining a level of economic comfort, which is spurred by rising land values and inter-urban competition between cities in as a means to attract capital investment.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, D., ""From Managerialism to Entrepreneurialism: The Transformation in Urban Governance in Late Capitalism". ''Geografiska Annaler. Series B, Human Geography'', 71, pp. 3-17, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;	&lt;ref name=Molotch&gt;Molotch, H., "The City as a Growth Machine: Toward a Political Economy of Place". ''American Journal of Sociology'', 82(2), pp. 309–332, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between inner-city dwellers and middle class passersby in such settings has also been a topic of study for urban sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duneier |first=Mitchell |title=Sidewalk|year=2001|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0374527259|edition=1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dromi|first=Shai M.|title=Penny for your Thoughts: Beggars and the Exercise of Morality in Daily Life|journal=Sociological Forum|date=December 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=847–871|doi=10.1111/j.1573-7861.2012.01359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many theories in urban sociology have been criticized, most prominently directed toward the ethnocentric approaches taken by many early theorists that lay groundwork for [[urban studies]] throughout the 20th century. Early theories that sought to frame the city as an adaptable “superorganism” often disregarded the intricate roles of social ties within local communities, suggesting that the urban environment itself rather than the individuals living within it controlled the spread and shape of the city. For impoverished inner-city residents, the role of highway planning policies and other government-spurred initiatives instituted by the planner [[Robert Moses]] and others have been criticized as unsightly and unresponsive to residential needs. The slow development of empirically-based urban research reflects the failure of local urban governments to adapt and ease the transition of local residents to the short-lived industrialization of the city.&lt;ref name=Caro&gt;[[Robert Caro|Caro, R.]], ''[[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'' Vintage: New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern social theorists have also been critical toward the apparent shortsightedness that urban sociologists have shown toward the role of culture in the inner city. [[William Julius Wilson]] has criticized theory developed throughout the middle of the twentieth century as relying primarily on structural roles of institutions, and not how culture itself affects common aspects of inner-city life such as poverty. The distance shown toward this topic, he argues, presents an incomplete picture of inner-city life.The urban sociological theory is viewed as one important aspect of sociology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15049">{{redirect|Vague}}
In [[philosophy]], '''vagueness''' refers to an important problem in [[semantics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophical logic]]. Definitions of this problem vary. A predicate is sometimes said to be vague if the bound of its extension is indeterminate, or appears to be so. The predicate "is tall" is vague because there seems to be no particular height at which someone becomes tall. Relatedly, a predicate is sometimes said to be vague if there are borderline cases of its application, such that in these cases competent speakers of the language may faultlessly disagree over whether the predicate applies. The disagreement over whether a hotdog is a sandwich suggests that “sandwich” is vague. 

Vagueness is commonly introduced by the Sorites paradox. A standard form of this paradox features a 2000 man sequence of progressively taller men, starting with a paradigm case of a short man at one extreme, say George Costanza, and at the other extreme, a paradigm case of a tall one, say Kramer. 

* Base step: Man 1 (George Costanza) is short.
* Induction step: If man ''n'' is short, then man ''n + 1'' is short.
* Conclusion: Man 2000 (Kramer) is short. 

Sorites paradoxes exploit the intuition that some vague predicates are ''tolerant'' with respect to small enough differences on a dimension decisive of their application. This principle may seem to hold on the basis that (for example) no particular height is more justified than others in its vicinity as a cut-off for shortness. This intuition has been called the ''No Sharp Boundaries'' thesis about vague predicates and plays a prominent role in theories of vagueness. 

The Sorites paradox dates to the fourth century BCE and is attributed to [[Eubulides|Eubulides of Melitus]]. It has received a resurgence of attention since 1975, when three papers published in ''Synthese'' effectively conceived the contemporary study of vagueness.  

The problem posed by vagueness is to explain its particular kind of indeterminacy. Does vagueness render large portions of ordinary language meaningless? Likely not, since we frequently use vague language to great effect in ordinary discourse. If not, what ''is'' vagueness, at the level of predicate logic? How is it to be modeled without contradiction, and without sacrificing too much of classical logic? Is vagueness semantic, metaphysical or epistemic? 

Vagueness has in its own right reaped the attention of an extensive literature. In addition, vagueness is a topic that touches many other questions in philosophy, linguistics and cognitive science, not to mention ordinary conversation. 

== Importance ==
Vagueness is philosophically important. Suppose one wants to come up with a definition of "right" in the moral sense. One wants a definition to cover actions that are clearly right and exclude actions that are clearly wrong, but what does one do with the borderline cases? Surely, there are such cases. Some philosophers say that one should try to come up with a definition that is itself unclear on just those cases. Others say that one has an interest in making his or her definitions more precise than ordinary language, or his or her ordinary concepts, themselves allow; they recommend one advances [[precising definition]]s.&lt;ref name="Williamson.1994"&gt;[[Timothy Williamson|Williamson, T]]. 1994. ''Vagueness'', {{page needed|date=April 2017}}. London: Routledge. &lt;br /&gt;The history of the problem of vagueness is traced, from the first [[Sorites Paradox]] to contemporary attempts to deal with higher-order vagueness such as [[many-valued logic]], [[supervaluationism]], and [[fuzzy logic]]. Technicalities are kept to a minimum to favour a clear account, extremely useful to both students and researchers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=Specific claims regarding the usefulness of a source to readers of this article.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vagueness is also a problem which arises in law, and in some cases judges have to arbitrate regarding whether a borderline case does, or does not, satisfy a given vague concept.  Examples include disability (how much loss of vision is required before one is legally blind?), human life (at what point from conception to birth is one a legal human being, protected for instance by laws against murder?), adulthood (most familiarly reflected in legal ages for driving, drinking, voting, consensual sex, etc.), race (how to classify someone of mixed racial heritage), etc.  Even such apparently unambiguous concepts such as gender can be subject to vagueness problems, not just from [[transsexual]]s' gender transitions but also from certain genetic conditions which can give an individual mixed male and female biological traits (see [[intersex]]).

Many scientific concepts are of necessity vague, for instance [[species]] in biology cannot be precisely defined, owing to unclear cases such as [[ring species]].  Nonetheless, the concept of species can be clearly applied in the vast majority of cases.  As this example illustrates, to say that a definition is "vague" is not necessarily a criticism. Consider those animals in Alaska that are the result of breeding [[Husky|huskies]] and [[wolf|wolves]]: are they [[dog]]s? It is not clear: they are borderline cases of dogs. This means one's ordinary concept of doghood is not clear enough to let us rule conclusively in this case.

== Approaches ==
The philosophical question of what the best theoretical treatment of vagueness is - which is closely related to the problem of the [[paradox of the heap]], a.k.a. sorites paradox - has been the subject of much philosophical debate.

=== Fuzzy logic ===
[[File:Fuzzy logic temperature en.svg|thumb|In fuzzy logic, e.g. the predicates ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' apply gradually (vertical axis, 0 and 1 meaning ''certainly not'' and ''certainly'', respectively) to a given temperature (horizontal axis).]]
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
One theoretical approach is that of fuzzy logic, developed by American mathematician [[Lotfi Zadeh]]. Fuzzy logic proposes a gradual transition between "perfect falsity", for example, the statement "[[Bill Clinton]] is bald", to "perfect truth", for, say, "[[Patrick Stewart]] is bald". In ordinary logics, there are only two [[truth-value]]s: "true" and "false". The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing ''an infinite number of truth-values'' along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity. Perfect truth may be represented by "1", and perfect falsity by "0". Borderline cases are thought of as having a "truth-value" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6). Advocates of the fuzzy logic approach have included K. F. Machina (1976) &lt;ref&gt;Machina, K.F. 1976. "Truth, belief and vagueness", in ''[[Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' Vol. 5. pp. 47-78&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy Edgington]] (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Edgington, D.| title=Vagueness by degrees| year=1997| pages=294–316| publisher=MIT Press| editor=Keefe, R. |editor2=Smith, P.| url=http://www.jo_syp.republika.pl/media/vbd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervaluationism ===
{{main|Supervaluationism}}
Another theoretical approach is known as "supervaluationism". This approach has been defended by [[Kit Fine]] and Rosanna Keefe. Fine argues that borderline applications of vague predicates are neither true nor false, but rather are instances of "[[truth value]] gaps". He defends an interesting and sophisticated system of vague semantics, based on the notion that a vague predicate might be "made precise" in many alternative ways. This system has the consequence that borderline cases of vague terms yield statements that are neither true, nor false.&lt;ref&gt;Kit Fine, ''The Limits of Abstraction'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a supervaluationist semantics, one can define the predicate 'supertrue' as meaning "true on all precisifications".  This predicate will not change the semantics of atomic statements (e.g. 'Frank is bald', where Frank is a borderline case of baldness), but does have consequences for logically complex statements. In particular, the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of sentential logic, such as 'Frank is bald or Frank is not bald', will turn out to be supertrue, since on any precisification of baldness, either 'Frank is bald' or 'Frank is not bald' will be true.  Since the presence of borderline cases seems to threaten principles like this one (excluded middle), the fact that supervaluationism can "rescue" them is seen as a virtue.

=== Subvaluationism ===
{{main|Dialetheism}}
Subvaluationism is the logical dual of supervaluationism, and has been defended by Dominic Hyde (2008) and Pablo Cobreros (2011). Whereas the supervaluationist characterises truth as 'supertruth', the subvaluationist characterises truth as 'subtruth', or "true on at least some precisifications".&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Cobreros, (2011) "Paraconsistent Vagueness: A Positive Argument" ''Synthese'' 183(2): 211–227&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subvaluationism proposes that borderline applications of vague terms are both true and false. It thus has 'truth-value gluts'. According to this theory, a vague statement is true if it is true on at least one precisification and false if it is false under at least one precisification. If a vague statement comes out true under one precisification and false under another, it is both true and false. Subvaluationism ultimately amounts to the claim that vagueness is a truly contradictory phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Hyde and Mark Colyvan (2008) “Paraconsistent Vagueness: Why Not?” ''Australasian Journal of Logic'' 6: 107–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Of a borderline case of 'bald man' it would be both true and false to say that he is bald, and both true and false to say that he is not bald.

=== The epistemicist view ===
{{main|Epistemicism}}
A fourth approach, known as the "epistemicist view", has been defended by [[Timothy Williamson]] (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, T. 1994. ''Vagueness'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Sorensen|R. A. Sorensen]] (1988) &lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, R.A. 1988. ''Blindspots''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Sorensen, Roy| title=Vagueness and Contradiction| year=2001| publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicholas Rescher]] (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, N.]] 2009. ''Unknowability''. Lexington Books. &lt;br&gt; Uses [[vagrant predicate]]s to elucidate the problem.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that vague predicates do, in fact, draw sharp boundaries, but that one cannot know where these boundaries lie. One's confusion about whether some vague word does or does not apply in a borderline case is explained as being due to one's ignorance. For example, on the epistemicist view, there is a fact of the matter, for every person, about whether that person is old or not old. It is just that one may sometimes be ignorant of this fact.

===As a property of objects===

One possibility is that one's words and concepts are perfectly precise, but that objects themselves are vague.  Consider [[Peter Unger]]'s example of a [[cloud]] (from his famous 1980 paper, "The Problem of the Many"):  it's not clear where the boundary of a cloud lies; for any given bit of water vapor, one can ask whether it's part of the cloud or not, and for many such bits, one won't know how to answer.  So perhaps one's term 'cloud' denotes a vague object precisely.  This strategy has been poorly received, in part due to [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans's]] short paper "Can There Be Vague Objects?" (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Evans, G.| title=Can There Be Vague Objects?| journal=Analysis| year=1978| volume=38| pages=208–| doi=10.1093/analys/38.4.208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans's argument appears to show that there can be no vague identities (e.g. "Princeton = Princeton Borough"), but as Lewis (1988) makes clear, Evans takes for granted that there are in fact vague identities, and that any proof to the contrary cannot be right.  Since the proof Evans produces relies on the assumption that terms precisely denote vague objects, the implication is that the assumption is false, and so the vague-objects view is wrong.

Still by, for instance, proposing alternative deduction rules involving [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's law]] or other rules for validity some philosophers are willing to defend vagueness as some kind of metaphysical phenomenon. One has, for example, [[Peter van Inwagen]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter. 1990 ''Material Beings''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Trenton Merricks and Terence Parsons (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Terence. 2000. ''Indeterminate Identity - Metaphysics and Semantics'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal principle== &lt;!--- courtesy under WP:LINK, [[Albert Haddock]] links here]] --&gt;
In the common law system, vagueness is a possible legal defence against by-laws and other regulations.  The legal principle is that delegated power cannot be used more broadly than the delegator intended. Therefore, a regulation may not be so vague as to regulate areas beyond what the law allows. Any such regulation would be "void for vagueness" and unenforceable.  This principle is sometimes used to strike down municipal by-laws that forbid "explicit" or "objectionable" contents from being sold in a certain city; courts often find such expressions to be too vague, giving municipal inspectors discretion beyond what the law allows. In the US this is known as the [[vagueness doctrine]] and in Europe as the [[principle of legal certainty]].

'''Vermicompost''' ('''vermi-compost''', '''vermiculture''') is the product of the [[composting]] process using various species of [[worm]]s, usually [[Eisenia foetida|red wigglers]], [[Enchytraeus buchholzi|white worms]], and other [[earthworm]]s, to create a mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding materials, and vermicast. 

Vermicast (also called worm castings, worm humus, worm manure, or worm feces) is the end-product of the breakdown of [[organic matter]] by earthworms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwoodsforestgardens.blogspot.com/2009/01/paper-on-invasive-european-worms.html |title=Paper on Invasive European Worms |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These castings have been shown to contain reduced levels of contaminants and a higher saturation of nutrients than the organic materials before vermicomposting.&lt;ref name="Effects of stocking density and feeding rate on vermicomposting of biosolids"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ndegwa, P.M. |author2=Thompson, S.A. |author3=Das, K.C. | title = Effects of stocking density and feeding rate on vermicomposting of biosolids | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 5–12 | year = 1998 | pmid = | doi =10.1016/S0960-8524(99)00055-3 | url = http://www.earthworm.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/effect-of-stocking-density-feeding-rate-on-vermicomposting-of-biosolids.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermicompost contains water-soluble nutrients and  is an excellent, nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Kelly and Erik Knutzen.

==Overview==
[[File:African Night Crawler.jpg|thumb|[[Eudrilus eugeniae|African Night Crawler]] (a type of earthworm) as decomposer]]
Vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because, as compared with conventional composting, it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly. It also generates products that have lower [[salinity]] levels that are therefore more beneficial to plant mediums.&lt;ref name="Lacanzo, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lazcano, Cristina |author2=Gómez-Brandón, María |author3=Domínguez, Jorge | title = Comparison of the effectiveness of composting and vermicomposting for the biological stabilization of cattle manure | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1013–1019 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18511100| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.04.016| url = http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compost_with_worms.jpg|thumb|right|Food waste with worms]]
The earthworm species (or composting worms) most often used are red wigglers (''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' or ''[[Eisenia andrei]]''), though European nightcrawlers (''[[Eisenia hortensis]]'' or ''[[Eisenia hortensis|Dendrobaena veneta]]'') could also be used. Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including ''dendrobaenas'', ''dendras'', Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers.

Containing water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Kelly and Erik Knutzen. ''The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City.'' Port Townsend: Process Self Reliance Series, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a "living" soil environment for plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=C.A.|title=Earthworm Ecology|date=1998|publisher=CRC Press LLC|isbn=1-884015-74-3|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the [[Drilosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Organic Phosphorus in the Environment, Turner, ''et al.'', Page 91. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design considerations==
===Suitable worm species===
One of the species most often used for composting is the red wiggler or tiger worm (''Eisenia fetida'' or ''Eisenia andrei''); ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'' (a.k.a. red earthworm or dilong (China)) is another breed of worm that can be used, but it does not adapt as well to the shallow compost bin as does ''Eisenia fetida''. European nightcrawlers (''Eisenia hortensis'') may also be used. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, and Belgian nightcrawlers.  African Nightcrawlers (''[[Eudrilus eugeniae]]'') are another set of popular composters. ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' (a.k.a. Canadian nightcrawlers (US) or common earthworm (UK)) are not recommended, since they burrow deeper than most compost bins can accommodate.&lt;ref name="thf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://herronfarms.webs.com/ | title=Composting with earthworms| publisher=Herron Farms Dawsonville Ga. | accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blueworms (''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'') may be used in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/HG-46.pdf |title=Composting Worms for Hawaii |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout Europe and North America and live in rotting [[vegetation]], compost, and [[manure]] piles. They may be an [[invasive species]] in some areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrri.umn.edu/worms/ |title=Great Lakes Worm Watch |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil, they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin.

Composting worms are available to order online, from nursery mail-order suppliers or [[angling]] shops where they are sold as [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]]. They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water.

===Large scale===
Large-scale vermicomposting is practiced in Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krepublishers4-1-059-08-1636-%20Aalok-A/JHE-24-1-059-08-1636-%20Aalok-A-Tt.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: A Better Option for Organic Solid Waste Management |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leaffin.com/compost-tea/ | title=Compost Tea|accessdate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vermicompost may be used for farming, landscaping, to create [[compost tea]], or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting.

There are two main methods of large-scale vermiculture. Some systems use a [[windrow]], which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.

The [[Windrow composting|windrow method]] and compost windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Windrow composting systems can be {{sic|nolink=y|feasable}}, cost effective (Research Brief #20) {{!}} Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems|url = http://www.cias.wisc.edu/windrow-composting-systems-can-be-feasable-cost-effective/|website = www.cias.wisc.edu|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Worm bed wave.svg|thumb|350px|Movement of castings through a worm bed]]

The second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of "worm chow" across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed.

Because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.

===Small scale===
[[File:Wormbin.sample.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration home scale worm bin at a community garden site (painted [[plywood]])]]
[[File:Wormbin.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a household-scale worm composting bin]]
For vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, [[Styrofoam]], or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.

Some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Worm Compost Bins - What To Look For and What To Avoid|url = http://www.best-organic-fertilizer.com/worm-compost-bins.html|website = www.best-organic-fertilizer.com|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Cedrus|cedars]], [[Yellow cedar]], and [[Coast Redwood|Redwood]] contain resinous oils that may harm worms,&lt;ref name=raising&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/35/34577.pdf |title=Raising Earthworms Successfully |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Western Red Cedar]] has excellent longevity in composting conditions. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampalandscaping.org/red-wiggler-compost-worm-bin.png] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724023034/http://vermontworms.com/red-wiggler-compost-worm-bin/|date=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bins need holes or mesh for aeration. Some people add a spout or holes in the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Build your own Worm Farm|url = http://andreas-heeschen.co.uk/2016/02/02/build-your-own-worm-farm/|website = Growing Organic|access-date = 2016-02-21|last = Andreasheeschen|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213203115/http://andreas-heeschen.co.uk/2016/02/02/build-your-own-worm-farm/|archive-date = 2016-02-13|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common materials used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vermiculture|url = http://www.worm-farm.co.za/vermiculture.html|website = www.worm-farm.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced.

Small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality [[soil amendment]]s, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that [[composting|bin composting]] requires.

Composting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler ''Eisenia fetidae'', are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as ''Lumbricus terrestris'' are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Worm Dictionary and Vermiculture Reference Center|url=http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|publisher=Working Worms|accessdate=3 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028160939/http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|archive-date=28 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other soil species that contribute include [[insect]]s, other worms and [[mold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trautmann |first=Nancy |url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/invertebrates.html |title=Invertebrates of the Compost Pile |publisher=Cornell Center for the Environment |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and temperature===
There may be differences in vermicomposting methods depending on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/vermicomposting/hot-climate-vermiculture.htm|title=High Heat And Worm Bins – Tips For Vermicomposting When It's Hot|website=Gardening Know How|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high [[Heat capacity|heat-retentive]] properties), as the raw materials or [[feedstock]]s used can [[compost]], heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms.

The most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (''[[Eisenia foetida]],'' ''[[Eisenia andrei]],'' and ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'') feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25&amp;nbsp;°C (59-77&amp;nbsp;°F). They can survive at 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F). Temperatures above 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F) may harm them.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature range means that indoor vermicomposting with redworms is possible in all but tropical climates. Other worms like [[Perionyx excavatus]] are suitable for warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; If a worm bin is kept outside, it should be placed in a sheltered position away from direct sunlight and insulated against frost in winter.

==Feedstock==
There are few food wastes that vermicomposting cannot compost, although meat waste and dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract [[vermin]]. [[Green waste]] should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bin.

===Small-scale or home systems===
Such systems usually use kitchen and garden waste, using "earthworms and other [[microorganisms]]
to digest organic wastes, such as kitchen scraps".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Piper |last=Selden |first2=Michael |last2=DuPonte |first3=Brent |last3=Sipes |first4=Kelly |last4=Dinges |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/HG-45.pdf |title=Small-Scale Vermicomposting |format=PDF |journal=Home Garden |volume=45 |publisher=University of Hawai'i |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvesting==
[[File:Worm.bin.jpg|right|thumb|Worms in a bin being harvested]]

Vermicompost is ready for harvest when it contains few-to-no scraps of uneaten food or bedding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are several methods of harvesting from small-scale systems: "dump and hand sort", "let the worms do the sorting", "alternate containers" and "divide and dump."&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, pp. 79-86&lt;/ref&gt; These differ on the amount of time and labor involved and whether the vermicomposter wants to save as many worms as possible from being trapped in the harvested compost.

The pyramid method of harvesting worm compost is commonly used in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Harvesting - MMSB - Multi-Materials Stewardship Board|url = http://www.mmsb.nl.ca/composting/vermicomposting/harvesting/|website = MMSB - Multi-Materials Stewardship Board|access-date = 2016-02-21|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151028062058/http://www.mmsb.nl.ca/composting/vermicomposting/harvesting/|archive-date = 2015-10-28|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which the rest of the process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow to the bottom of the pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.

While harvesting, it's also a good idea to try to pick out as many eggs/cocoons as possible and return them to the bin. Cocoons are small, lemon-shaped yellowish objects that can usually be seen pretty easily with the naked eye and picked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://vermontworms.com/tag/red-wiggler-compost-worm-eggs/ |title=Red-wiggler Compost Worm eggs |access-date=2018-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318163515/https://vermontworms.com/tag/red-wiggler-compost-worm-eggs/ |archive-date=2018-03-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cocoons can hold up to 20 worms (though 2-3 is most common). Cocoons can lay dormant for as long as two years if conditions are not conducive for hatching. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cals.arizona.edu/yavapai/anr/hort/byg/archive/redwormbiology.html|title=Red Worm Biology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Vermicompost has been shown to be richer in many [[nutrient]]s than compost produced by other composting methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickerson |first=George W. |url=http://www.cahe.nmsu.edu/pubs/_h/h-164.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: Guide H-164 |publisher=New Mexico State University |format=PDF |date=June 2001 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also outperformed a commercial plant medium with nutrients added, but levels of [[magnesium]] required adjustment, as did pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherman |first=Rhonda |url=http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/topic/vermicomposting/vermiculture/castings.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117155144/http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/topic/vermicomposting/vermiculture/castings.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-01-17 |title=Earthworm Castings as Plant Growth Media |publisher=Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at NCSU |accessdate=2012-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in one study it has been found that homemade backyard vermicompost was lower in microbial biomass, soil microbial activity, and yield of a species of [[ryegrass]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; than municipal compost.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazcano|first=Cristina|author2=Gómez-Brandón, María |author3=Domínguez, Jorge |title=Comparison of the effectiveness of composting and vermicomposting for the biological stabilization of cattle manure|journal=Chemosphere|date=July 2008|volume=72|issue=7|pages=1013–1019|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.04.016 |url=http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=18511100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rich in microbial life which converts nutrients already present in the soil into plant-available forms.

Unlike other compost, worm castings also contain [[mucus|worm mucus]] which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil.&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998).

Increases in the total nitrogen content in vermicompost, an increase in available nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as the increased removal of heavy metals from sludge and soil have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparative Study on Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Sludge Vermicomposted by Eisenia Fetida|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029612005968|journal = Procedia Environmental Sciences|date = 2012-01-01|pages = 418–423|volume = 16|series = The Seventh International Conference on Waste Management and Technology (ICWMT 7)|doi = 10.1016/j.proenv.2012.10.058|first = Fei|last = Liu|first2 = Pengfei|last2 = Zhu|first3 = Jianping|last3 = Xue}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in the bioavailability of heavy metals has been observed in a number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heavy metal and nutrient changes during vermicomposting animal manure spiked with mushroom residues|journal = Waste Management (New York, N.Y.)|date = 2014-11-01|issn = 1879-2456|pmid = 25128918|pages = 1977–1983|volume = 34|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2014.07.013|first = Xiuchao|last = Song|first2 = Manqiang|last2 = Liu|first3 = Di|last3 = Wu|first4 = Lin|last4 = Qi|first5 = Chenglong|last5 = Ye|first6 = Jiaguo|last6 = Jiao|first7 = Feng|last7 = Hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Microbial biodegradation of waste materials for nutrients enrichment and heavy metals removal: An integrated composting-vermicomposting process|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262194513_Microbial_biodegradation_of_waste_materials_for_nutrients_enrichment_and_heavy_metals_removal_An_integrated_composting-vermicomposting_process|journal = International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation|pages = 41–48|volume = 92|doi = 10.1016/j.ibiod.2014.04.011|first = Seyede Maryam|last = Kharrazi|first2 = Habibollah|last2 = Younesi|first3 = Javad|last3 = Abedini-Torghabeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
'''Soil'''
* Improves soil aeration
* Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding [[enzymes]] such as [[phosphatase]] and [[cellulase]])
* Microbial activity in worm castings is 10 to 20 times higher than in the soil and organic matter that the worm ingests &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Gene|title=Worldwide progress in vermicomposting|journal=BioCycle|date=October 1994|volume=35|issue=10|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=3324953|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attracts deep-burrowing earthworms already present in the soil
* Improves water holding capacity&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant growth'''
* Enhances germination, plant growth, and crop yield
* Improves root growth and structure
* Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding [[plant hormone]]s such as [[auxins]] and [[gibberellic acid]]){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Economic'''
* Biowastes conversion reduces waste flow to [[landfill]]s
* Elimination of biowastes from the waste stream reduces contamination of other recyclables collected in a single bin (a common problem in communities practicing [[Single-stream recycling]])
* Creates low-skill jobs at local level
* Low capital investment and relatively simple technologies make vermicomposting practical for less-developed agricultural regions

'''Environmental'''
* Helps to close the "[[metabolic rift|metabolic gap]]" through recycling waste on-site
* Large systems often use temperature control and mechanized harvesting, however other equipment is relatively simple and does not wear out quickly{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* Production reduces [[greenhouse gas]] emissions such as [[methane]] and [[nitric oxide]] (produced in landfills or [[incinerator]]s when not composted or through [[methane harvest]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19459535/ |title=Waste Management to tap landfill methane |publisher=MSNBC |date=June 27, 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Wormbin.bedding.jpg|thumb|right|Mid-scale worm bin (1&amp;nbsp;m X 2.5&amp;nbsp;m up to 1&amp;nbsp;m deep), freshly refilled with bedding]]

=== Soil conditioner ===
Vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil.

The dark brown waste liquid, or [[leachate]], that drains into the bottom of some vermicomposting systems as water-rich foods break down, is best applied back to the bin when added moisture is needed due to the possibility of [[phytotoxin]] content and organic acids that may be toxic to plants.&lt;ref name=raising/&gt;

The pH, nutrient, and microbial content of these fertilizers varies upon the inputs fed to worms. Pulverized limestone, or calcium carbonate can be added to the system to raise the pH.

==Operation and maintenance==
[[File:Worms and fruit fly eggs.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Worms and fruit fly pupas under the lid of a home worm bin.]]

===Smells===
When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, it should have little smell—if any smell is present, it is earthy.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Worms require gaseous oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen can be provided by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of [[ammonia]].

===Moisture===
Moisture must be maintained above 50%, as lower moisture content will not support worm respiration and can increase worm mortality. Operating moisture-content range should be between 70-90%, with a suggested content of 70-80% for vermicomposting-oriented vermiculture operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/agriculture/oacc/en/soil/Vermiculture_FarmersManual_gm.pdf|title=Manual of On-Farm Vermicomposting and Vermiculture|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=14|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If decomposition has become anaerobic, to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying, excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level. To do this, first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second, add fresh, dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin, mixing it in well.&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rmtZ91zbxLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Worm+Book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h7KFpfKigc&amp;sig=r_L-YXzDAst_-lmjRkLuXcX3vqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DChsUNS2Oei40gHJvIH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Worm Book: The Complete Guide to Gardening and Composting with Worms''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318062343/https://books.google.com/books?id=rmtZ91zbxLMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Worm+Book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h7KFpfKigc&amp;sig=r_L-YXzDAst_-lmjRkLuXcX3vqo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DChsUNS2Oei40gHJvIH4CQ&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=March 18, 2015}} Ten Speed Press. p. 70. {{ISBN|978-0-89815-994-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pest species===
Pests such as rodents and flies are attracted by certain materials and odors, usually from large amounts of kitchen waste, particularly meat. Eliminating the use of meat or dairy product in a worm bin decreases the possibility of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/agriculture/oacc/en/soil/Vermiculture_FarmersManual_gm.pdf|title=Manual of On-Farm Vermicomposting and Vermiculture|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=8|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory ants can be a problem in African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David Watako, Koslengar Mougabe, and Thomas Heathfirst=|year=April 2016|title=Tiger worm toilets: lessons learned from constructing household vermicomposting toilets in Liberia|url=|journal=Waterlines|volume=35| issue =  2|pages=136–147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In warm weather, fruit and vinegar flies breed in the bins if fruit and vegetable waste is not thoroughly covered with bedding. This problem can be avoided by thoroughly covering the waste by at least {{convert|5|cm|in}} of bedding. Maintaining the correct pH (close to neutral) and water content of the bin (just enough water where squeezed bedding drips a couple of drops) can help avoid these pests as well.

===Worms escaping===
Worms generally stay in the bin, but may try to leave the bin when first introduced, or often after a rainstorm when outside humidity is high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vermontworms.com/compost-worm-escape/ Compost Worm Escape]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldclimategarden.com/en/can-you-do-vermicomposting-in-an-apartment/ Can you do vermicomposting in an apartment?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005065728/http://www.coldclimategarden.com/en/can-you-do-vermicomposting-in-an-apartment/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrient levels===
Commercial vermicomposters test, and may amend their products to produce consistent quality and results. Because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks, the nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent. NPK testing may be helpful before the vermicompost or tea is applied to the garden.

In order to avoid over-fertilization issues, such as [[nitrogen burn]], vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water, or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with [[potting soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Tim|last2=Littlejohn|first2=Gail|title=Teaching Green, The Middle Years |year=2004|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island, B.C.|isbn=978-0-86571-501-1 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v46QjUMYuxkC&amp;pg=PT114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the mucous layer created by worms which surrounds their castings allows for a "time release" effect, meaning not all nutrients are released at once. This also reduces the risk of burning the plants, as is common with the use and overuse of commercial fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigredworms.com/compost-or-worm-castings/ |title=Compost or Worm Castings? |publisher=Big Red Worms |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application examples==

Vermicomposting (also known as vermiculture) is widely used in North America for on-site institutional processing of food scraps, such as in hospitals, universities, shopping malls, and correctional facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Clive A.|title=Vermiculture Technology|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0987-7|pages=392–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling, such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls. It is selected either as a more environmentally friendly choice than conventional disposal, or to reduce the cost of commercial waste removal.

Researchers from the [[Pondicherry University]] discovered that worm composts can also be used to clean up heavy metals. The researchers found substantial reductions in heavy metals when the worms were released into the garbage and they are effective at removing [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[copper]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56774">In the early 1960s, an interest in women and their connection with the environment was sparked, largely by a book written by [[Esther Boserup]] entitled ''Woman's Role in Economic Development''.&lt;ref name=Tiondi&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Tiondi, T.|year=2001|title= Women, environment and development: Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America|type=Theses and Dissertations|id=Paper 1549|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, policy makers and governments became more mindful of the connection between the environment and gender issues.&lt;ref name=GDRC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Development Research Center|url=http://www.gdrc.org/|accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes began to be made regarding natural resource and environmental management with the specific role of women in mind.  According to the World Bank in 1991, "Women play an essential role in the management of natural resources, including soil, water, forests and energy...and often have a profound traditional and contemporary knowledge of the natural world around them".&lt;ref name=WorldBanK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/gender/gender-envi.html|title=Gender and the Environment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas women were previously neglected or ignored, there was increasing attention paid to the impact of women on the natural environment and, in return, the effects the environment has on the health and well-being of women. The gender-environment relations have valuable ramifications in regard to the understanding of nature between men and women, the management and distribution of resources and responsibilities and the day-to-day life and well being of people.&lt;ref name=Env&amp;Planning&gt;Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 2011, volume 29, pages 237-253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's connection with the environment==

===Women, environment and development (WED) debate===

Different discourses have shaped the way that sustainable development is approached, and as time goes on women have become more integrated in shaping these ideas. The definition of sustainable development is highly debated itself, but is defined by Harcourt as a way to "establish equity between generations" and to take into account "social, economic, and environmental needs to conserve non-renewable resources" and decrease the amount of waste produced by industrialization.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harcourt|first1=Wendy|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sustainable Development.|date=1994|publisher=International Society for Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first discourse that emerged in relation to women was Women in Development (WID), the perspective that advocated for women's status to be improved in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if all people mattered|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0415537490|location=New York|pages=1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then transformed into Women, Environment, and Development (WED). Critiques for WID included its place in a larger western mindset, perpetuating a colonial and liberal discourse that was not compatible with supporting the global population of women. WID placed women as central actors in household, rural and market economies and looked to the hierarchical institution of western development to fix the issues that arise because of this.&lt;ref name=harcourt /&gt;

The next shift in discourse took place in the early 1970s, where people began to critique the roots of development and start to look at alternative ways to go about interacting with the global community and developing countries, with women and the environment as central actors. This was defined as Women, Environment, Development (WED).&lt;ref name=braid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title=Women, the Environment, and Sustainable Development|date=1994|publisher=Zed Books in association with INSTRAW}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schultz et al., "The women, environment and development debate (WED-debate) is anchored in a critical view of development policies where the link between modernization/industrialization and technology on the one hand and environmental deterioration on the other is focused".&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz et al.|first1=Irmgard|title=Research on Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development|journal=Institut für sozial-ökologische|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; WED discourse is centralized around the synthesis of different ideologies, one of which being ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leach|first1=Melissa|title=. Earth Mother Myths and Other Ecofeminist Fables: How a Strategic Notion Rose and Fell.|journal=Development and Change|date=January 31, 2007|volume=38|issue=1|page=67-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminism may be seen as a root ideology for WED, whereas women are viewed with a biological connection to nature that enables them to have a deeper connection and stewardship of it. This ideology was transformed into the political sphere where it took a new shape as women having a socially constructed connection to nature through our global systems.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

Programs started in the 1990s based on the WED discourse and were instituted by the United Nations International Research Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). These programs were in response to the relation between gender and environmental violences such as waste disposal, pesticide use nuclear testing and other detrimental environmental practices.&lt;ref name=braid /&gt;

The outcome of many of these programs did not produce the desired impacts on women.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt; The WED discourse placed emphasis on women as solution holders to environmental issues but policies were not directed at empowering women, rather the sectors that women are involved in, such as agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=February 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leach argues that the overall impact of politicizing the role of women and the environment through the WED discourse appropriated women's labor without providing proper resources or capacity to succeed.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

=== Farming and agriculture ===
{{See also|Feminization of agriculture}}

In a majority of the world, women are responsible for farm work and related domestic food production.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|date=Spring 1992|title=The gender and environment debate: lessons from India|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=3178217|doi=10.2307/3178217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764296_The_Gender_and_Environment_Debate_Lessons_from_India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Disinherited peasants, disadvantaged workers: a gender perspective on land and livelihood|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=33|number=13 (Mar. 26 – Apr. 3, 1998)|pp=A2–A1|jstor=4406578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiggins&gt;{{cite book|author=Jiggins, J. |year=2004|title=Changing the boundaries: Women-centered perspectives on population &amp; the environment|location= Covelo, Ca|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel&gt;{{cite book|author=Lastarria-Cornhiel, S.|year=2006|title=Feminization of Agriculture: Trends and Driving Forces|location=Santiago|publisher= RIMISP}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of women are taking over and expanding their involvement in [[agricultural]] tasks but this has not changed the gender division of labor with regard to reproductive work.&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel /&gt;  Esther Boserup looked into the farming systems of men and women in [[Africa]] and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Boserup&gt;Boserup, E. (1970). Woman's Role in Economic Development.  Male and female farming systems  (15-65).&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz ''et al.'' (2001), found that "90% of women in the developing world, where most of the planet's biological wealth is found, depend on their land for survival. Women head 30% of the households in developing countries, 80% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa is done by women, 60% in [[Asia]] and 50% in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Even though women are largely responsible for the actual agricultural work performed, men, generally own the land, therefore controlling women's labor upon the land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

====Africa====
Esther Boserup examined the farming systems of men and women in Africa and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; In Botswana, men typically have greater access to advanced technologies and plowing abilities.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Zambia also has a high percentage of women farmers yet they are not explicitly recognize and often neglected entirely.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Consistent lack of access to credit, mobility, technological advancements, and land ownership further complicate women's agricultural roles. A group of women in Kenya began farming trees way before climate change was prioritized because they had seen what happens to lands that are depleted of its nutrients and the adverse effects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steady|first=Filomina Chioma|date=2014|title=Women, Climate Change, and Liberation in Africa|url=http://libproxy.sdsu.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690372156?accountid=13758|journal=Race, Gender &amp; Class|volume=21|pages=312-333|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Latin American and Caribbean====
In Peru, women often participate in food production and family farming yet they do not generally benefit directly from their labor.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Their work is not considered as valuable as men's.  Women in the Caribbean have always been associated with agriculture and do have access to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; However, women still do not have the same access to technology as men and generally have smaller plots of land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

The dependence on nature and the environment for survival is common among Third World women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; It has been argued by environmental feminists&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; that this dependence creates a deeply rooted connection between women and their surroundings.  The dependency women have on natural resources, based on their responsibilities, creates a specific interest that may be different from the interests of men.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Jiggins et al. suggests that the views women have on nature are unique in that they connect the land to immediate survival and concern for future generations rather than simply looking at the land as a resource with monetary value.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; With the development of newer technologies since the 1940s, there has been a shift to more non-farm activities, however, men more than women are the ones participating in the shift, leaving women behind.&lt;ref name=Boserup /&gt; It has been projected that the continuation of men shifting to urban livelihoods, more and more women will be depended on to maintain the household by farming.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;Especially during the neoliberal policy regime in Latin America, with the increasing use of exports, women were ideal for their ‘gendered skills,’ they were paid less for their farming labor and not likely to organize, coining the term ‘feminization of responsibility.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if All People Mattered|last='Beneria'; 'Berik'; 'Floro'|first='Lourdes'; 'Gunseli'; 'Maria'|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues such as climate change could have a greater impact on women because the land they farm will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

====Asia and Pacific Islands====
In the Asian and Pacific Island regions, 58% of women involved in the economy are found in the agriculture sector. This involves work in own-account farms, labor in small enterprises for processing fruits, vegetables and fish, paid and unpaid work on other peoples land, and collecting forest products.&lt;ref name=ESCAP&gt;{{cite book|last1=United Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|title=Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|date=2017|publisher=United Nations ESCAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Out of all the women working in this sector, 10–20% have been found to have tenure to the land they work on.  Reasons for this number include economic and legal barriers. For example, in terms of loans women are found to get fewer and less loans to acquire land then men.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

One other factor that plays into women’s land rights for agriculture is the cultural norms of the area.  In the Asian and the Pacific women’s societal rolls have been defined by patriarchal norms of the larger global society, where men are viewed as breadwinners and women are viewed as caretakers. This can be expressed through the number of hours women spend doing unpaid care work per day. In developing countries in total, women spend 4 hours and 30 minutes of care work a day versus the 1 hour and 2 minutes that men spend.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

===Land ownership and property management===

In many parts of the world, specifically developing countries, there is a great deal of inequality when it comes to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Traditional practices and bureaucratic factors often prevent women's access to natural resource development and management.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Frequently, women do not have the right to own land and/or property, but they often are the ones who tend to the land. [[Bina Agarwal]], has written a great deal about gender and land rights in Third World countries and according to her, "Hence, insofar as there is a gender and class-based division of labor and distribution of property and power, gender and class structure people's interactions with nature and so structure the effects of environmental change on people and their responses to it."&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Women's access to control of natural resources, land ownership and property management is a developing issue and is the subject of continuous debate in both the environmental realm and women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Women's property status and the likelihood of violence===
"World wide, physical violence by husbands against wives is estimated to range between 10% and 50% (p824)".&lt;ref name=P&amp;A&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panda, P.|author2=Agarwal, B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title= Marital violence, human development and women's property status in India|journal=World Development|volume=33|issue=5|pp=823–850|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of marital violence but economic dependence is widely acknowledged as one of the main sources. Land or property ownership provides women who may be experiencing marital violence with a credible exit option.  Land ownership creates a means of production of both income and power.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry&gt;{{cite web|author=Chowdhry, P.|year=2011|title= Reduction of Violence Against Women: Property Ownership &amp; Economic Independence in Rural Haryana|publisher=UN Women|url=http://www.unwomensouthasia.org/assets/Violence-Property-Rights2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed in Kerala, India examined the effects of property status and the likelihood of violence against women.  Close to 500 women were surveyed about a number of happenings in the household such as the amount of longterm and current violence that occurred, women's ownership of the land or house, and other sociodemographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The violence that occurs can be physical, such as hitting or kicking or psychological, such as threats or belittlement. Long-term violence, or violence that had been occurring throughout the entirety of the marriage, was experienced by 41% of women in rural households, while 27% of urban household women reported violence in various forms. Current violence, or violence occurring within 12 months of the time of survey was experienced by 29% in a physical capacity and 49% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt;

Of all the women surveyed, 35% did not own any property and of that 35%, 49% experienced physical violence while 84% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The amount of violence was significantly lower in households where women owned land or property.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; According to this particular study, women's access to land and property ownership reduces the risk of spousal abuse by enhancing the livelihood of women as well as providing an escape route and means for survival if abuse begins.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; In many developing countries, where marital violence is prominent, barriers such as unequal laws and social and administrative bias&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; keep women from owning land and property.  A vast number of women are left out of owning immovable property (land or house) furthering their likelihood of experiencing marital violence.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry /&gt; (Chowdhry). It can also be argued that land rights greatly shape an individuals relationship with nature and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

===Relationship between violence of nature and women===

The WED debate has examined the correlation between the degradation of the environment and the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; [[Carolyn Merchant]] and [[Vandana Shiva]] wrote that there is a connection between dominance of women and dominance of nature. Shiva said, "The rupture within nature and between man and nature, and its associated transformation from a life-force that sustains to an exploitable resource characterizes the Cartesian view which has displaced more ecological world-views and created a development paradigm which cripples nature and woman simultaneously".&lt;ref name=Shiva&gt;Shiva, V. (1988). Staying Alive, London: Zed.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women's labor as well as the abuse of natural environment are connected as they are both marginalized within the economy. Both the environment and women have been viewed as exploitable resources that are significantly undervalued.&lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt; This argument supports ecofeminism in that women in developing countries rely on nature to survive, therefore, destruction of the environment results in elimination of women's method to survival.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; According to Jiggins, environmental degradation effects women the most, furthering the inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; One study showed that new developments in technology and developments in land access are denied to women, furthering their subordination and inequality.&lt;ref name=Nightingale&gt;}{{cite journal|author1=Nightingale, A.|year=2006|title=The nature of gender: work, gender, and environment|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=24|issue=2|pp= 165–185|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/rgroves/nightingalepub1.pdf|doi=10.1068/d01k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Ecofeminism===
[[Ecofeminism]] says that women are closer to nature than men are. This closeness, therefore, makes women more nurturing and caring towards their environment.  Ecofeminism encompasses a variety of views but has a focus of patriarchal oppression and the social constructions relating to women and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Some indicate the biology of women as the reason behind the closeness, while others credit culture and historical factors.&lt;ref name=Agarwal2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=2000|title= Conceptualising environmental collective action: why gender matters|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=24|issue=3|pp=283–310|doi=10.1093/cje/24.3.283|url=http://binaagarwal.com/downloads/apapers/conceptualizing_environmental_collective_action.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ecofeminist believes in a direct connection between oppression of nature and the subordination of women. Vandana Shiva, is credited with bringing ecofeminism into public consciousness by her reports of the [[Chipko]] movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;
The Chipko movement also led to the formation of anti alcoholism.

===Environmental or ecological feminism===

Environmental or ecological feminism differs from ecofeminism in that it is more focused on the actual, specific interactions with the environment. Connections between environment and gender can be made by looking at the gender division of labor and environmental roles rather than an inherent connection with nature.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; The gender division of labor requires a more nurturing and caring role for women, therefore that caring nature places women closer with the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; The knowledge of nature is shaped by the experiences an individual has.  Women have a distinct knowledge of the land, yet are excluded from policy decisions of development on that land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; This is prominent in many developing countries where the responsibility of collecting fuel and fodder is placed upon the women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Both the resources and the meanings are taken into consideration with environmental feminism. There is a challenge to not only focus on the gender division of labor but also the actual appropriation methods of the resources.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; In other words, there is not simply an inherent connection between women and nature, rather there are material realities that exist.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; Bina Agarwal&lt;ref name=Agarwal1997&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Gender and environment management in South Asia: can romanticized pasts help model desirable futures?|journal=Macalester International|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&amp;context=macintl}} Article 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes ecofeminism and outlines three problematic elements which are:
*Historical characterization of the situation of women and nature
*Linking of the emancipation of women with that of nature
*Assumptions about women's agency

====Criticism====
[[Bina Agarwal]] has critiqued the ideas of environmental feminism. She proposes problems with welfare, efficiency, and source of land. 
*Welfare

Due to gender differences in income-spending patterns, women are at a higher risk of living in poverty. For this reason, access to land is of special importance. Land access allows for a number of production advantages such as growing trees, fodder and/or crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www-fulcrum-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/concern/monographs/bg257f65x|title=A Field of One's Own|last=Agarwal|first=Bina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0521418682|location=Cambridge, England|pages=pg. 32 &amp; pp.37-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, land access also allows for increased credit, bargaining power and strengthens aggregate real wages rates.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even the smallest amount of land can have huge impacts on welfare directly as well as increasing entitlement to family welfare.&lt;ref name=Chada&gt;Chadha, G K (1992). Non-farm Sector in India's Rural Economy: Policy, Performance and Growth Prospects, mimeo, Centre for Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi (1992), showed that households that owned land earned markedly more than landless households.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Efficiency
#Incentive effect: If women are given secure land rights, there will be a greater incentive for higher production rates.  Women will be motivated to use the best technologies, increase cultivation, and make long-term investments. Environmentally sound use of the land resource and reduced out-migration to cities by women and their dependents are other benefits of women’s secure land rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Credit and input access effect: "Titles would enhance women's ability to raise production by improving their access to agricultural credit, as well as by increasing women's independent access to output, savings and cash flow for reinvestment".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;
#Efficiency of resource use effect: Studies have shown the possibility that women use resources more efficiently than men.  This could mean anything from making a more productive use of loans of money earned to the ability of women to achieve higher values of output based on cropping patterns.
#Gender specific knowledge and talent pool effect: Many women have specific and often greater knowledge about certain crops and planting patterns.  If women are included as farm managers, a more diverse and talented informed pool will be created.
#Bargaining power and empowerment effect: Providing women with the opportunity to own land will increase their sense of empowerment and could help women to assert themselves more in various situations such as policy creation other government schemes.

*Source of land
Because public land available for distribution is now quite limited, most of the land will need to come from private sectors.  "To get a share of land, therefore, it is critical for women to stake a claim in privatised land".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

===Feminist political ecology ===
Feminist political ecology builds from [[ecofeminism]] and environmental feminism and lays out three essential factors which are: 
# [[wiktionary:gendered knowledge|Gendered knowledge]], or the ways in which access to scientific and ecological knowledge is structured by gender (this is considered part of [[gender feminism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |subscription=yes |jstor=40435825|title=Public Affairs Quarterly Vol. 6, No. 4 |date=October 1992 |pages=435–456 |chapter=Multiculturalism and Epistemology |first=Steven |last=Yates |quote=Feminists offer their distinctive twist to this approach by saying that all knowledge and cognition are "gendered"; hence the term gender feminism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
# Gendered environmental rights and responsibilities, including differential access by men and women to various legal and de facto claims to land and resources.
#Gendered politics and grassroots activism, including an examination of women within and as leaders of environmental movements.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

Feminist political ecology seeks to discover the role and place of women in environmental development on a political scale.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

==In developed nations==

===Sweden===
Sweden has historically had a political culture that inherently protects the environment. Sweden is one of the highest-ranking countries when assessing gender equality, but the government does agree there is room for improvement. Women in Sweden have been empowered to protect the environment through the government and policies, a lot like other developed nations. In Sweden, the majority of local government workers are women at 64% and since the 2010 election, 45% of Swedish parliament is made up of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in Sweden|url=https://sweden.se/society/gender-equality-in-sweden/|website=Government of Sweden|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has recognized that women are the most affected by climate change and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denton|first=Fatma|date=July 2002|title=Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts, and Adaptation: Why Does Gender Matter?|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/stable/4030569?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Gender and Development|volume=10|pages=10-20|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this recognition they have committed to contribute to increasing the participation for women in decisions and policy debates surrounding climate change and other environmental issues. They also have committed to increasing resources for women in civil society who present issues about the environment, hoping to increase accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government offices of Sweden|title=Policy for Environmental and Climate Issues in Swedish Development Cooperation|url=http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/15/64/98/24249736.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson and Merchant draw on the idea that the women's environmental movement in Sweden was based on both symbolic and political perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson &amp; Merchant|title='Peace with the Earth:' Women and the Environmental Movement in Sweden|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=1986|issue=9.5–6|pages=465–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the environmental movement and women’s movement in Sweden, women were very aware that changes had to be made both within society and ideologies, then enacted politically to create a cohesive collective society.

Elin Wagner (1882–1949) presented herself as a radical feminist in early movements. She was a writer, journalist, environmentalist, ecologist and pacifist. She was a large inspiration for the environmental and feminist movements. She saw a large flaw in the popular ideology after World War II: that men had the ability to control and conserve nature for the entire global community or all of mankind. With a place in both politics and writing, she was inspired to write her novel, ''Alarm Clock''. Her novel was barely noticed when released in 1941, but during Sweden's women's movement in the 1970s, her messages became a driving force behind the movement. She believed that there should be a large presence of intellectuals in social movements. Wagner and other key Swedish feminist scholars and intellectuals of that time shaped the parameters of Swedish thinking and both the environmental and women's movements. Throughout her life, Wagner stressed the importance of nature and the environment, an idea we see through the identity of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=A|title=Elin wägner and radical environmentalism in Sweden: The good earthworm|journal=Environmental History Review|date=1994|volume=18|issue=3|pages=59–74|jstor=3984710|doi=10.2307/3984710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has it ingrained in both their identity and traditions to have a deep sense of nature, which has played a huge role in shaping the overall consensus of the country to protect the environment, especially for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breiting &amp; Wickenberg|title=The progressive development of environmental education in Sweden and Denmark|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the transformation of the opinion and ideologies of the Swedish people, it became much easier to entrench environmental policies. Women working within institutions protected the global environment by pushing for bans on nuclear energy or industry degrading local environment. In 1980, there was a national referendum on nuclear power in Sweden. The voting patterns revealed that 43% of women were against nuclear power, while only 21% of men opposed it.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merchant|first1=C|title=Earthcare: Women and the Environment|date=1996|location=New York|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden and the women of the country have demonstrated that environmental protection can be achieved through transitioning ideologies followed by institutional change.

==Women's attitude and the environment==
The deep connection between women and men comes from the daily interaction between them.{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}} In recent decades, environmental movements have increased as the movements for women's rights have also increased.&lt;ref name = "Mellor"&gt;Mellor, Mary.(1997). Feminism &amp; Ecology. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's union of nature preservation with [[women's rights]] and [[Women's liberation|liberation]] has stemmed from invasion of their rights in the past.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"/&gt;

In developing areas of the world, women are considered the primary users of [[natural resources]] (Land, forest, and water), because they are the ones who are responsible for gathering food, fuel, and fodder.&lt;ref name= "Abzug"&gt;Abzug, Bella. (1995). Women and the Environment. International Authors Series. New York: The Department of Public Information.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in these countries, women mostly can't own the land and farms outright, they are the ones who spend most of their time working on the farms to feed the [[household]]. Shouldering this responsibility leads them to learn more about soil, plants, and trees and not misuse them. Although, technological inputs increase male involvement with land, many of them leave the farm to go to cities to find jobs; so women become increasingly responsible for an increasing portion of farm tasks.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"&gt;Jiggins, Janice. (1994). Changing the Boundaries: Women-Centered Perspectives on population and the Environment. New York: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These rural women tend to have a closer relationship with land and other natural resources, which promotes a new culture of respectful use and preservation of natural resources and the environment, ensuring that the following generations can meet their needs.&lt;ref name = "Silent"&gt;From Silent Spring to vocal vanguard. (1997, January). United Nations Chronicle, 34(3), 35-38. Retrieved December 13, 2006, from ProQuest database.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides considering how to achieve appropriate [[agricultural]] production and human nutrition, women want to secure access to the land.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Women's perspectives and values for the environment are somewhat different from men's. Women give greater priority to protection of and improving the capacity of nature, maintaining farming lands, and caring for nature and environment's future.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Repeated studies have shown that women have a stake in environment, and this stake is reflected in the degree to which they care about natural resources. [[Ecofeminism]] refers to women's and feminist perspectives on the environment – where the domination and exploitation of women, of poorly resourced peoples and of nature is at the heart of the ecofeminist movement.

==Climate change and women==
Many of the environmental effects of climate change have disproportionately placed women in more vulnerable circumstances. Environmental occurrences that affect the activities women are found to be mainly responsible for in developing countries include increase in storm frequency and intensity, increase in floods, droughts, and fires. The Indian Government's National Action Plan on Climate Change said "The impacts of climate change could prove particularly severe for women. With climate change there would be increasing scarcity of water, reductions in yields of forest biomass, and increased risks to human health with children, women and the elderly in a household becoming the most vulnerable. ...special attention should be paid to the aspects of gender."&lt;ref name=arora&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonsson-Arora|first1=Seema|title=Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=744–751|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Asia women are strongly engaged in subsistence fishing as well as collection of food in local habitats. These habitats, such as [[mangroves]], [[seagrass]] beds, and [[lagoons]] are all being negatively influenced by a changing climate, creating barriers in the direct work of women which then ripple out to their community.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

The subsequent response to the connection between women and climate change has evoked multiple responses in the policy realm.  Policy makers have shifted policy to reflect gender sensitive frameworks to address climate change.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt;
Arora-Jonsson argues that by focusing on the vulnerability of women in relation to climate change, it places more responsibility on women and shifts the narrative to ignore the root causes of the issue, power relations and institutional inequality.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt; The outcome of UN movements and policies for promoting women in areas impacted by climate change such as agriculture have not been scientifically proven to have any beneficial results on women communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=2002|volume=37|issue=8|page=679-680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and perception of the environment==
Given the environmental degradation caused while men have had dominance over women, and women's large investment in [[environmental sustainability]], some have theorized that women would protect the Earth better than men if in power. Although there is no evidence for this hypothesis, recent movements have shown that women are more sensitive to the earth and its problems. They have created a special [[value system]] about environmental issues. People's approaches to environmental issues may depend on their relationship with nature. Both women and nature have been considered as subordinates entities by men throughout history, which conveys a close affiliation between them.&lt;ref&gt;Wenz, Peter S. (2001). Environmental Ethics Today. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the perception of the natural environment between men and women differs: women tend to perceive natural resources in means of necessity, while men perceive it in means of "commercial entities or income generating tools." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academicresearchjournals.org/IJPSD/PDF/2016/April/Aditya.pdf|title=Role of Women in Environmental Conservation|last=Aditya|first=Sandeep Kumar|date=April 2016|website=Academic Research Journals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, rural Indian women collect the dead branches which are cut by storm for fuel wood to use rather than cutting the live trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, Annabel. (1991). Women and the Environment. New Jersey: Zed Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Since African, Asian, and Latin American women use the land to produce food for their family, they acquire the knowledge of the land/soil conditions, water, and other environmental features.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt; Any changes in the environment on these areas, like deforestation, have the most effect on women of that area, and cause them to suffer until they can cope with these changes. One of the good examples would be the Nepali women whose grandmothers had to climb to the mountain to be able to bring in wood and fodder.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt;

An example of female prominence in the defense of natural forests comes from India in 1906.  As forest clearing was expanding conflict between loggers and government and peasant communities increased. To thwart resistance to the forest clearing, the men were diverted from their villages to a fictional payment compensation site and loggers were sent to the forests. The women left in the villages, however, protested by physically hugging themselves to the trees to prevent their being cut down, giving rise to what is now called the [[Chipko movement]], an environmentalist movement initiated by these Indian women (which also is where the term tree-huggers originated).&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998"&gt;Breton, Mary J. (1998). Women pioneers for the environment. Boston: Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict started because men wanted to cut the trees to use them for industrial purposes while women wanted to keep them since it was their food resource and deforestation was a survival matter for local people.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

Gender-based commitments and movements such as [[feminism]] have reached to a new approach through the combination of feminism and [[environmentalism]] called [[Ecofeminism]]. Ecofeminists believe on the interconnection between the domination of women and nature. According to ecofeminism the superior power treats all subordinates the same. So, ecofeminism takes into account women subordination and nature degradation.&lt;ref name = "Mellor" /&gt; Remarking all these different reactions, one can see that however, most policy decision makers are men.

=== Maria Cherkasova ===
[[Maria Cherkasova]] (b. 1938) is a [[Russia]]n journalist, ecologist, and director of [[Centre for Independent Ecological Programmers]] (CIEP). She is known for coordinating a 4-year campaign to stop construction of hydro-electric dam on the [[Katun River]]. After Cherkasova's involvement in the student movement on environmental protection in the 1960s, she began to work for the [[Red Data Book]] for the Department of Environmental Protection Institute. She researched and preserved rare species until she became the editor of [[USSR]] Red Data Book. She co-founded the [[Socio-Ecological Union]], which has become the largest ecological NGO in the former Soviet Union. In 1990, she became director of CIEP, which arrange and drives activities in an extensive range of ecologically related areas on both domestic and international fronts. Cherkasova recently has shifted her focus on protecting [[children's rights]] to live in a healthy environment and speaks for them both inside and outside Russia.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

===Rachel Carson===
[[Rachel Carson]] (1907–1964) was an [[United States|American]] scientist, writer, and [[ecologist]]. Rachel Carson went to the Pennsylvania College for Women, majoring in English, but she was inspired by her [[biology]] teacher so she switched her major to biology. She became more interested and focused on the sea while she was working at the [[Marine Biological Laboratories in Massachusetts]]. Her eloquent prose let to the publication of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind|Under the Sea-Wind: a Naturalists' Picture of Ocean Life]]'', in 1941. In 1949 she became chief editor of the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS). Her second book, ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', won the [[National Book Award]] and sold more than 200,000 copies. After that she retired from FWS and became a full-time writer. After her third and final book about the sea, ''The Edge of the Sea'', Carson focused on effects of chemicals and pesticides on the environment. That is when she wrote her book about environment, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book was about what man has done to the nature and eventually to himself, and started a modern environmental movement. Carson believed that humanity and nature are mutually dependent on each other. She argued that industrial activities such as [[pesticides]] use can damages the earth [[ecosystem]] and will have far-reaching ecological consequences such as future human health problems. Today, scientific studies have demonstrated these consequences.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

=== Jane Goodall ===
[[Jane Goodall]] (b. 1934) is a female environmentalist most well known for her chimpanzee study, in which she lived among the primates. She became interested in animals as a young child and spent her early adulthood saving money to fund her dream of taking a trip to Africa. Her position as secretary to Louis Leakey led to her participation in several anthropological digs and animal studies, and eventually she was selected to study chimpanzee behavior in Tanzania. She made several discoveries about the behavior of chimpanzees on these studies and is credited with discovering the chimpanzee behavior of eating meet and creating tools. She published a book about the study entitled ''In the Shadow of Man''. She is also known for her activism, promoting the preservation of wild chimpanzee environments and opposing the use of animals in research. She has received numerous awards for her achievements and owns the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research, Education, and Conservation, a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-goodall-9542363#accomplishments|title=Jane Goodall|last=|first=|date=|website=biography.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological movements initiated by women==

===Chipko movement===
One of the first environmentalist movement which was inspired by women was the [[Chipko movement]] (Women tree-huggers in India). "Its name comes from a Hindi word meaning "to stick" (as in glue). The movement was an act of defiance against the state government's permission given to a corporation for commercial logging. Women of the villages resisted, embracing trees to prevent their felling to safeguard their lifestyles which were dependent on the forests. Deforestation could qualitatively alter the lives of all village residents but it was the women who agitated for saving [End Page 163] the forests. Organized by a non-governmental organization that Chandi Prasad Bhatt led, the Chipko movement adopted the slogan "ecology is permanent economy". The women embracing the trees did not tag their action as feminist activism; however, as a movement that demonstrated resistance against oppression, it had all the markings of such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grewal, Jyoti|title=Theorizing Activism, Activizing Theory: Feminist Academics in Indian Punjabi Society|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=20|number=1|pages=161–183|date=Spring 2008|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v020/20.1.grewal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began when [[Maharajah]] of [[Jodhpur]] wanted to build a new palace in [[Rajasthan]], which is India's [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills. While the [[Lumberjack|axemen]] were cutting the trees, martyr [[Amrita Devi]] hugged one of the trees. This is because in Jodhpur, each child had a tree that could talk to it. The axmen ignored Devi, and after taking her off the tree, cut it down. Her daughters are environmentalists like [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]] and Sunderlal Bahuguna.

===Green Belt movement===
Another movement, which is one of the biggest in women and environmental history, is the [http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/ Green Belt movement]. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]] founded this movement on the [[World Environment Day]] in June 1977.  The starting ceremony was very simple: a few women planted seven trees in Maathai's backyard. By 2005, 30 million trees had been planted by participants in the Green Belt movement on public and private lands. The Green Belt movement aims to bring environmental restoration along with society's economic growth. This movement led by Maathai focused on restoration of [[Kenya]]'s rapidly diminishing forests as well as empowering the rural women through environmental preservation, with a special emphasis on planting indigenous trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Belt Movement|date=2006|accessdate=November 15, 2006|url= http://www.wangarimaathai.or.ke/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muthuki|first=Janet|date=2006-01-01|title=Challenging patriarchal structures: Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement in Kenya|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233277225_Challenging_patriarchal_structures_Wangari_Maathai_and_the_Green_Belt_Movement_in_Kenya|journal=Agenda|volume=20|pages=83–91|doi=10.1080/10130950.2006.9674752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navdanya Movement===
[[Navdanya]] also known as the 'Nine Seeds Movement' seeks to empower local Indian farmers to move away from growing any [[genetically modified organism]] (GMOs) on their land and return to organic, [[chemical-free]] practices. This movement has reached over 5,000,000 Indian farmers and created over 65 seed banks around India.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya fights to eliminate the [[commercialization of indigenous knowledge]] also known as 'Biopiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamey, Gavin|title=The Bittersweet Sounds of the Modern Food Chain|journal=PLOS Biology|date=February 2006|volume=4|issue=2|pp=0165–0166|accessdate=March 5, 2012|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040047|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya addresses multiple other international issues including climate change, food security, misapplication of technology, food sovereignty, fair trade, and many others.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; This movement also created a learning center entitled Bija Vidyapeeth. Bija Vidyapeeth, in collaboration with Schumacher College in the United Kingdom, seeks to educate participants in sustainability and ecological principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/earth-university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenyan land takeover===
In Kenya, starting in the mid-1980s, women protested against the elites and big foreign corporations who were coercing and controlling the production of the land.  Rather than allowing food to be grown for survival, women were pressured by both their husbands and the government to cultivate coffee for foreign profit. Protests continued and gained strength over the next couple of decades.  The protests eventually ended in a Kenyan power shift enforcing democratic national elections which resulted in redistribution of land possible.&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Perkins, E.|author2=Kuiper, E.|author3=Quiroga-Martínez, R.|author4=Turner, T.
