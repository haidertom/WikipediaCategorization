      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5831">[[File:Alfeñiques or sugar fugures.jpg|250px|thumb|Assortment of alfeñiques for ''[[Día de Muertos]].]]

An '''alfeñique''' is a [[confection]] molded from sugar paste. The design and construction of these figures can vary from region to region. Today, alfeñique figures, especially [[calavera]]s (known in the US as Sugar Skulls), are widely created in [[Mexico]] for the [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations in November.

==History==
[[File:Borregos de dulce..JPG|thumb|Alfeñiques at the ''[[Alfeñique fair|Feria del Alfeñique]]'' in [[Toluca]].]]
Alfeñique are folk art objects made from a sugar paste, originating in Italy where figurines were made from sugar for religious decorations. They became popular in Spain, wherefrom they were eventually brought to Mexico with Catholicism, where they became a part of Day of the Dead celebrations, starting around the 17th or 18th century.&lt;ref name="cite2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.celebrate-day-of-the-dead.com/mexican-sugar-skull.html |title=Mexican Sugar Skull |publisher=Thaneeya LLC |year=2010–2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfeñique, whose name is from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was used to replace the Aztec tradition of making figurines of [[amaranth]] for altars.  The Spanish [[conquistador]]s brought sugar cane, which became the main ingredient in the making of these figurines which continues to this day.&lt;ref name="pomar"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[María Teresa Pomar]] |year=2004 |title=Alfeñique  |location= México |language=Spanish |publisher=CONACULTA |isbn=970-35-0578-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the colonial period, figures of sheep made with this were popular.&lt;ref name="gmasters"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Cándida |editor1-last= Fernández de Calderón |title= Great Masters of Mexican Folk Art: From the collection of Fomento Cultural Banamex  |edition=2 |year=2003 |publisher= Fomento Cultural Banamex, A.C.   |location=Mexico City |isbn=968 5234 09 4  |page=503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the main production center for alfenique figures are [[Toluca]], [[San Miguel de Allende]] and [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]. Today, the paste is used to form hundreds of types of shapes which include rabbits, lions, ducks, doves, cows, bulls, donkeys, pigs, frogs, horses, deer, angels, skulls and coffins.&lt;ref name="gmasters"/&gt;  The art form has taken on more elaborate sculptures that involve more sophisticated and modern techniques that there are now encyclopedic volumes on how to create them for all different occasions, apart from Day of the Dead celebrations.&lt;ref name="mcgraw"&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Arte Mexicano del Azúcar: Enciclopedia Ilustrado  |location= Ciudad de México |publisher=McGraw Hill |language=Spanish |editor1-first=Marithé  |editor1-last=de Alvarado |isbn=970-10-3596-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are regional fairs and events that celebrate this art form, including [[Alfeñique fair|ones in Toluca, Mexico State]]  and in Leon, Guanajuato.&lt;ref name="cite5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonguanajuato.com/galerias/alfenique.php |title=Feria Artesanal del Alfeñique, Mexico |publisher=Government of [[León, Guanajuato]] |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303160813/http://leonguanajuato.com/galerias/alfenique.php |archive-date=2009-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cite6"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/d9cff78f9e4c88e6e0efd703f4ea180e |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419011526/http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/d9cff78f9e4c88e6e0efd703f4ea180e |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 19, 2013 |title=Detallan actividades de la Feria del Alfeñique de Toluca |publisher=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=September 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Calaveritas de dulce.jpg|thumb|Small alfeñique skulls]]
The paste is prepared by mixing powdered sugar with chautle, a vegetable adhesive and lemon. Egg whites are beaten separately then folded into the sugar. Vegetable dyes are added for color. The unworked portion is covered with a damp cloth to keep it from hardening. Molds are prepared by carefully cleaning them, then dusting them with flour so the sugar mixture does not stick. The sugar paste is flattened into thin circles which are pressed into the molds, then left to dry for 24 hours&lt;ref name="gmasters"/&gt;

The two halves of the figure are then taken from the molds and joined together with more sugar paste, slightly thinned with water. This is left to dry again before decoration. Decorative elements can include cotton balls, sequins, sugar paste which is shaped and attached, plastic jewels and many other items&lt;ref name="gmasters"/&gt;

==Variations==
The different regions make their alfeñique figures according to local traditions and ingredients.  Many families have been involved in making figurines for generations and some use molds that go back just as far. Apart from their popularity during Day of the Dead celebrations, many families display the objects, particularly the skulls, in their homes.&lt;ref name="pomar"/&gt; In [[Oaxaca]], they commonly take the shape of skulls, crowns, crucifixes, the dead and are made from crystallized sugar with honey in the center. In the [[State of Mexico]], the most common objects are coffins, hearses, deer, sheep, angels, fruit, and skulls made of white sugar paste.&lt;ref name="pomar"/&gt; In [[Puebla]], the most common objects are skulls and coffins and the main ingredients include almonds, peanuts and pumpkin seeds mixed with sugar and egg, in the style of an almond paste.&lt;ref name="peques"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.peques.com.mx/el_alfenique.htm |title=El alfeñique|publisher=CAD SA de CV |year=2010–2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Armenian cochineal''' (''Porphyrophora hamelii'' &lt;small&gt;(Brandt)&lt;/small&gt;), also known as the '''Ararat cochineal''' or '''Ararat scale''', is a [[scale insect]] indigenous to the [[Ararat plain]] and [[Aras River|Aras (Araks) River valley]] in the [[Armenian Highlands]].

At the time of the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, ''Porphyrophora'' insects were so valuable that in [[Constantinople]] during the 1430s, {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=off|spell=in}} of ''Porphyrophora hamelii'' insects was worth more than {{convert|5|g|oz|abbr=off}} of [[gold]].&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardon_2000"&gt;{{Citation |last= Cardon |first= Dominique |date= 2000 |contribution=Du verme cremexe au veluto chremesino: une filierè vénitienne du cramoisi au XVe siécle |language=French |editor-last=Molà | editor-first=L. |editor2-last= Mueller |editor2-first=R.C. |editor3-last= Zanier |editor3-first=C. | title= ''La Seta in Italia dal Medioevo al Seicento'' |location=Venice, Italy |publisher= Fondazione Giorgio Cini |pages= 63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007_note2"&gt;Some articles improperly cite Cardon to suggest, incorrectly, that Armenian cochineal insects were more valuable, by weight, than gold (i.e., one gram of insects was worth several grams of gold) during this era.  Cardon (2007) does, however, note that according to the records of a [[Venice|Venetian]] merchant trading in Constantinople during the 1430s, even the cheapest Armenian cochineal insects were still worth more, pound-for-pound, than some live [[Slavery|slaves]] ([[Circassians|Circassian]] women and adolescents) that he had bought.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[crimson]] ''Porphyrophora''-based dyes were especially prized in Europe for dyeing [[silk]], as the [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] dye [[Kermes (dye)|kermes]] was more plentiful, cheaper, and more effective for dyeing [[wool]]en textiles, which are heavier than silk and require more dye.&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007" /&gt;  It has been estimated that on the order of a half million dried ''Porphyrophora hamelii'' insects were required to dye {{convert|1|kg|lb|spell=in}} of silk crimson during this period.&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007_note3"&gt;400,000 to 560,000 dried ''P. hamelii'' insects were required to dye 1&amp;nbsp;kg of silk according to the figures of Cardon (2007):  1,000&amp;nbsp;g to 1,400&amp;nbsp;g of dried insects per 100&amp;nbsp;g of silk, with 40 adult females per gram of dried insects.  Note that Virey (1840) reports 18,000–23,000 insects per 360-gram troy pound (50–64 insects per gram; not stated whether they were dried).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the comparison between Armenian and Polish cochineal, the author of a 15th-century treatise on silks in [[Florence]] wrote that "two pounds of the large {{Square bracket open|1}}Armenian cochineal insects{{Square bracket close|1}} will dye as much {{Square bracket open|1}}silk{{Square bracket close|1}} as one pound of small {{Square bracket open|1}}Polish cochineal insects{{Square bracket close|1}}; it is true that it gives a more noble and brighter colour than the small, but it gives less dye."&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gargiolli_1868_ed"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Gargiolli |editor-first=Girolamo |date=1868 |title=L'arte della seta in Firenze.

Around the end of the 16th century the [[Old World]] ''Porphyrophora'' dyes were supplanted by dyes of the [[cochineal|''Dactylopius coccus'' cochineal]] species from the Americas, which could be harvested several times per year and yielded a much more concentrated dye.&lt;ref name=Phipps_2010 /&gt;

The [[carmine]] dyestuff of ''Porphyrophora hamelii'' owes its red color almost entirely to [[carminic acid]], making it difficult to distinguish chemically from the dyestuff of [[cochineal]] from the Americas.&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson_1969" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohmer_and_Thompson_1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Phipps_2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wouters_and_Verhecken_1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wouters |first=Jan |last2=Verhecken |first2=André |date=1989 |title=The Coccid Insect Dyes: HPLC and Computerized Diode-Array Analysis of Dyed Yarns |jstor=1506286 |journal=Studies in Conservation |publisher=Maney Publishing |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=189–200 |doi=10.1179/sic.1989.34.4.189}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The dyestuff of ''Porphyrophora polonica'' can be distinguished by its small admixture of kermesic acid, which is the major constituent of [[Kermes (dye)|kermes]] from ''Kermes vermilio''.

'''''Behemoth''''', full title '''''Behemoth: the history of the causes of the civil wars of England, and of the counsels and artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1660''''', also known as '''''The Long Parliament''''', is a book written by [[Thomas Hobbes]] discussing the [[English Civil War]]. Published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1681, it was written in 1668, but remained unpublished at the request of [[Charles II of England]].

==Background==
''Behemoth'' was written in 1668 as a follow-up to a previous and scandalous political work, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651).  ''Leviathan'' is a representation of an ideal political world, and ''Behemoth'' has been considered to be a contrasting treatise on what happens when the very worst abuses of government come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Martinich. ''Hobbes: A Biography''. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 323.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes applied his understanding of the science of human nature to explain why the English Civil War came to pass.  He was able to do this because he "did not make an impassable gulf between his rational understanding on the one hand and the particular events which he witnessed, remembered, or heard about on the other".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Peters. ''Hobbes''. (London: Penguin Books, 1967), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is written in the form of a discourse between two men.  The first speaker, called only "A", is an eyewitness and possible insider to the events of the English Civil War.  The second speaker, referred to as "B", is a student aiming to understand the breakdown in the government of England at that time.  

Hobbes was refused permission by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to publish ''Behemoth''. While the king recognised the correctness of the account of events and issues, he was concerned that the book would not be well received.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Malcolm]], ed. ''Thomas Hobbes: The Correspondence''. Vol. 2 1660–1679. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), 771.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles withheld his permission to publish, in the hope that Hobbes would avoid further scandal, and perhaps see his reputation as a thinker restored.

The manuscript for ''Behemoth'' was pirated and printed in unauthorised editions in Europe during the 1670s and in a letter to his friend [[John Aubrey]], Hobbes stated his disappointment with this turn of events.&lt;ref name="Malcolm, 772"&gt;Malcolm, 772&lt;/ref&gt; An official edition was released three years after Hobbes' death in 1679, by his literary agent William Crooke. According to [[Aloysius Martinich]], "after its initial success the book was relatively unread and unstudied until there was a resurgence of interest in it in the last quarter of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Martinich, 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Behemoth'' is not entirely factual, accurate or literal in retelling of the events of the English Civil War but still has value for students of the history of thought or revolution. As Royce MacGillivray puts it:

{{cquote|
"It is noteworthy, however, for the brilliance of the interpretation, the excellence of the prose, the revelation of what it was possible for a profoundly rationalist thinker to conclude about the religious issues of the war, and the interest of seeing this daring and powerful thinker, more fully than he had done elsewhere, apply his philosophy to the state of the catastrophe of the war."&lt;ref&gt;Royce Macgillivray.  "Thomas Hobbes' History of the English Civil War – A Study of ''Behemoth''", &lt;u&gt;''Journal of the History of Ideas''&lt;/u&gt;, Vol. 31, No.2, (Apr.-Jun. 1970), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Hobbes instead is drawing on his memories of the events and on two other possible sources, both written by [[James Heath (historian)|James Heath]] around 1663.&lt;ref&gt;MacGillivray, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; These are ''A Brief Chronicle of all the Chief Actions'' and the expanded ''A Brief Chronicle of the Late Intestine Warr''. It is possible they were simply used as prompts for Hobbes, already 80 years old when he wrote ''Behemoth''. According to MacGillivray very little material from these sources found its way directly into the text.

''The summation below is just that, a summation, and is only the most basic part of each section. No effort is made to correct any inconsistencies introduced into the discussion between the master and the student so that the information may be presented as it was written by Thomas Hobbes.''

== Preface: The Bookseller to the reader ==
The 1682 edition of the book begins with a note from William Crooke in answer to why he was publishing this edition.  Hobbes had made Crooke the caretaker of his literary estate in July 1679.&lt;ref name="Malcolm, 772"/&gt; Crooke knew of the editions of ''Behemoth'' published in Europe and he reasoned that these editions did not show the work in the best possible light due to the many textual errors and omissions.  It would therefore be best to publish an authorized edition to correct these errors and show the work as Hobbes wanted it to be read.  Crooke had as his source a manuscript copy of the text given to him by Thomas Hobbes around 1670.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. ''Behemoth: The History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England, and of the Counsels and Artifices by Which They Were Carried on from the Year 1640 to the Year 1660''. (New York: Burt Franklin, 1963), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part One: Behemoth, or the Epitome of the Civil Wars of England ==
This is the longest section of the book and roughly covers the period 1640–1642.

The dialogue opens with the student asking the master how it was that a monarch as strong as Charles I should ever have had to face a rebellion.  The master relates that a growing opposition to the crown was promoted by seven factions, each of them for their own ends and not in concert, who stoked the fires of rebellion.  These factions were: Papists, Presbyterians, Independents including other sects of religious faith, those who were corrupted by their reading of the Latin and Greek classics, centres of commerce and trade such as London, those with no means of support who saw the war as a way to profit, and the lack of understanding as to the important role played by the monarchy in society.

The motivations of each of these groups and how they contributed to the Civil War is discussed by the master and the student throughout the first part of the book.  This section has been considered anti-clerical in its leanings as none of the actions of the religious groups involved are shown in any sort of positive light.

The Papists wanted to condemn any ruler who did not offer compliance to the will of Rome.  As Charles I was officially a Protestant, this was not popular.  There were not many Papists in England at this time but they still had a voice that could be heard by their own adherents.   

Presbyterian ministers did not like a king whose queen was a known and practising Catholic.  This translated itself into speeches calling for the exile of the queen and other Papists.  As Catholicism was already severely proscribed against in the late 17th century these calls for expulsion are not unexpected or difficult to understand.

The Independents and the other sects of the Protestant reformation were advocates of liberty and freedom in certain instances especially in the matter of religious choice.  Provided an individual did not want to follow the Roman church their religious views would be tolerated by most of the Protestant groups.

The issue of an absolute monarchy was a crucial cause of the Civil War according to Hobbes.  Many members of the House of Parliament who wanted a monarchy did not want it to be an absolute one.  Instead they desired that it act in consultation with the house before taking action.  Charles I did not see the powers of the crown as being answerable to any but God.  Parliament then acted to withhold required funds from the King in his quest to defeat the rebellious Scots.  The Scots, Hobbes tells us, were in arms over the practice of [[episcopacy]]. This weakened the power of the crown but Charles I drew on the nobility to supply the needed funds for the war. When this source ran out Charles turned to Parliament to raise the [[Ship Money]], a percentage of customs revenue given to the King for the upkeep of the navy, so that he could use these funds to continue the war against the Scots. Parliament declared that illegal and took the crown to court over the issue.

The universities are brought into the discussion at this point. They existed as places where one could learn the classics and supposedly sharpen their minds by doing so. Instead they did not have the wit to read the classics critically and took them at their face value. This translated into certain scholars advocating an idealised form of republic to their students. However they did not teach the many virtues of the monarch to their students who came to see the crown as irresponsible.

Hobbes reminds his student that obedience is all that is required to live a good and peaceful life. This obedience should extend to the crown as it does to God and one's parents but this is not what was preached by the Protestant clergy. Instead they advised disobedience of royal edicts such as the raising privately of funds for the king's use. When this directive for disobedience was coupled with the teachings of ancient rebellions as a way to remove so called despotic domains it left a fertile ground for revolution in England.

== Part Two: Both Sides Prepare for War==
The second section picks up the conversation on the following day and discusses how those who sought rebellion now began to make preparations for it to come to pass.

The people of England had become accustomed to hear from those whom they trusted, namely the bishops and the members of Parliament, how corrupted the crown had become.  Now the discussion turned to a supposed plot by the King and Queen to return the realm to the church of Rome.  The king responded by banishing some who had written pamphlets and sermons suggesting this return to Catholicism.  Parliament had three of them released and they were received triumphantly in London upon their return.

In an effort to further weaken the King Parliament sought to have removed those members who were supporters of the monarchy.  To this end the house impeached the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Lord of Strafford]] for treason to Parliament and had him beheaded. Next Parliament arrested and executed the [[William Laud|Archbishop of Canterbury]] for his preaching of the introduction of arbitrary government ruled in consultation of the bishops. This was opposed by many in Parliament but mainly by the Scots.

After this discussion Hobbes' master provides a history of the house of commons and its role in the governance of the realm. He reminds his student that the Parliament had always been an institution of counsel and not control over the monarchy. The present Parliament oversteps the ancient bounds imposed on it by its appointed role as representative of the people before the king.

The rising in Ireland of an army of Papist sympathies who busied themselves harassing and slaughtering Protestants becomes an issue before the Parliament. A truce is made with the king to arrange a militia to combat this uprising in Ireland. Charles I dismissed the charges of high treason but would not identify his informant in the commons. The solicitor general is accused of being an informer on the house and he flees to France to avoid the wrath of the Parliament.

Parliament next took control of the militia from the crown and insisted that no adherents of the Roman church be allowed to command the army being sent to Ireland. Parliament raised funds for this expedition by selling shares of land in the Irish [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. A small share, three pence on every acre, was reserved for the crown with the balance of the funds being set aside for Parliament. The king did not assent to this. Relations between the two sides once again broke down and the king issued a declaration that Parliament needed to be obedient to the established laws of the kingdom.

Both sides began to gather material and men for possible war. The Parliament sent a message to the king, a humble petition, with 19 propositions to prevent conflict. The nineteen points are:

# Ministers serving on the King's Privy Council must be approved by the House of Commons and Lords.
# Matters that concern the public must be debated only by Parliament.
# A number of high offices, those dealing with finances and laws of the kingdom, must be chosen with the consent of both houses of Parliament.
# The King's children's education and raising should be committed to those approved of by Parliament.
# Parliament shall approve of the marriage of the King's children to any person, from home or abroad.
#All laws against Papists must be strictly enforced.
#The vote of Papists in the Lords shall be taken away, and the children of Papists must receive a Protestant education.
#A reformation of the Church government must be made in a manner advised by both houses.
#The King will accept the ordering of the militia by Parliament.
#Members of Parliament that have recently been removed from the house must be allowed to return.
# Councilors and judges must take an oath to maintain certain Parliamentary statutes.
# All judges and officers approved of by Parliament shall hold their posts on condition of good behaviour.
# The justice of Parliament shall apply to all law-breakers, whether they are inside the country or have fled.
# The King's pardon must be granted, unless both houses of Parliament object.
# Parliament must approve the King's appointees for commanders of the forts and castles of the kingdom.
# The unnecessary military attachment guarding the King must be discharged.
# The Kingdom will formalise its alliance with the Protestant States of the United Provinces (the Dutch) to defend them against the Pope   and his followers.
# The King must clear the six members of Parliament of any wrongdoing.
# New peers of the House of Lords must be voted in by both Houses of Parliament.

These nineteen points were rejected by the king as they would further weaken the authority of the crown.  This left both Parliament and the king no choice but to go to war.

''See the related article [[Nineteen Propositions]] for a further discussion of this aspect of the English Civil War.

== Part Three: The English Civil War, Rise of Cromwell, and Execution of Charles I==
The discussion again continues after a break and now turns to the matter of the Civil war itself.  The student is concerned about what he sees as the inability of Charles I to stand up to the Parliament due to his overall lack of resources [[power of the purse|as Parliament has taken control of much of the necessary material]] to fight a war. The master reminds the student that the officers on the side of the crown were all well experienced men and that this was an advantage that the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] did not have. As for money, neither side had much on hand. Some of the forces supporting the king took future credit while those supporting the Parliament were funded by an appeal to the cities and by the placing of levies on the towns.

As the wars continued [[turncoats|men on both side of the struggle changed side]]. This at first was to the detriment of the Parliamentary forces but in time some of those loyal to the king began to support the cause of the Parliament. This was despite the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|king's ancient right]] to [[Commission of Array|call for arms]] in times of conflict from all land owners and high born people. The Parliamentarians had already abandoned most of the laws and so this most ancient call to arms for the king was largely ignored.

The progress of the wars showed that early on the victory was mainly had by the king's [[cavaliers]] over Parliament's forces. Mainly in the north and the west of the country Charles I had his successes. Scotland came into the war on the side of Parliament and this put some pressure on the crowns forces. This pressure was used by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1644 to win the [[Battle of Marston Moor]]. This marks the rise of Oliver Cromwell in the Parliamentary army and he would use these successes to eventually take over the control of the commonwealth as [[Lord Protector]].

In 1645 Cromwell reorganised Parliaments forces into the [[New Model Army]]. This was a more disciplined and better trained group of soldiers and with this the tide began to turn against the royalist cause. In 1646 the besieged Charles I received from Parliament the same nineteen points that had brought both sides to conflict. Charles again did not give assent to them. Instead an arrangement was brokered between Parliament and the king that would see him surrender himself to them and thus end the war. By the end of 1646 the great seal of the king was broken and power over England was now available to be taken.

1647 and 1648 saw the contention for control over the realm between Oliver Cromwell, with his [[New Model Army]], and the Parliament as the king was held prisoner and not permitted to govern. Cromwell controlled 55 members of the parliament and used them to gain further support for his control over the government. Cromwell made overtures to the king to gain those members who had supported the royalist cause. London tried to stand against Cromwell but was quickly put down. He continued to consolidate his power and eventually had control over the parliament. He did not turn control back to the king as he said he would.

Charles I was as unwilling to work with Parliament under the control of Cromwell and the generals as he had been before the Civil War. [[Pride's Purge|Cromwell removed opposition in the house]], leaving what became known as the [[Rump Parliament]], and began a charge against the king for his part in bringing about the war.

The king was brought before Parliament, [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the charges read]], and the king denied the authority of Parliament to charge him. This occurred three times and each time [[List of regicides of Charles I|Parliament]] asserted that they did have the necessary authority. Charles was found guilty of tyranny and executed at the gates of Whitehall on 30 January 1649.

== Part Four: The Protectorship of Oliver Cromwell, Failure of Richard Cromwell, Restoration of the Stuarts==
The Rump Parliament became an [[Oligarchy]] after the execution of Charles I. A [[English Council of State|forty-person council of state]], whose job was to carry out the directives of the [[Rump Parliament]], was established. The Parliament took the name ''Custodes Libertatis Angliae'' (Custodians of English Liberty) for use in legal matters. Hobbes saw this as being foolish as they did not have a good idea of what [[liberty]] actually meant.

Cromwell, not yet the sole head of the government, went with the army to [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Ireland]] and in a year subdued the entire country. In Scotland the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]] failed to get the people behind a rising against the Parliament and was executed. Cromwell's rival, [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|General Fairfax]], resigned instead of taking an army into Scotland to fight fellow [[Covenanters|Presbyterian]]s. Cromwell was now made general of the entire army.

[[Charles II of England|Charles II]] went to Scotland, after agreeing to the demands of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scots Parliament]] and sat as king. Hostilities between England and Scotland recommenced. Cromwell and the army invaded Scotland to capture the young king. Charles II, after failing to hold [[Edinburgh]] or [[Stirling]], was able to [[Escape of Charles II|escape to the Continent]].

The Rump responded to an altercation with the Dutch and it began the [[First Anglo–Dutch War]] in 1652. Cromwell continued to fight the enemies of England while he solidified his hold over the Parliament. Cromwell was able to dissolve Parliament on 23 April 1653. A [[Barebone's Parliament|new parliament]] was composed of 142 of Cromwell's staunchest supporters from the army and the old Parliament. He gave them supreme power, and they in return appointed him [[The Protectorate|Protector of England]]. The Dutch were [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|defeated]] by the English, and Cromwell now had control of all of England.

In 1657 Cromwell was offered the title of king but refused it due to the opposition of the army, his source of power, to the idea. Parliament began to descend into disorder as factionalism again crept into its proceedings. Cromwell managed to keep the various factions in line.

After Cromwell's death the Parliament fell into disarray. [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]] saw that the only solution to the troubles was not to have [[Richard Cromwell]] succeed his father but to restore the monarchy. Monck occupied London with the army and forced parliament to offer the crown to Charles II. The monarchy was then [[English Restoration|restored]] when Charles II accepted the offer of the Parliament.

== Criticism of Hobbes' views on rebellion ==
[[Immanuel Kant]], one of the leading intellects of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], had a different view on the nature of rebellions from Hobbes. Howard Williams, of the [[University of Wales]], in 2003 wrote a study comparing the views of the two great thinkers on the subject of revolution amongst other things. Hobbes saw all revolution as something that should be avoided at all costs. Hobbes expressed society as a combination of the people, as the body of the society, and the monarchy, as the soul of the society, making a healthy commonwealth. Without the soul the body dies and so it is with society for Hobbes. Civil war should be avoided because it is "the process of a society losing its soul".&lt;ref&gt;Howard Williams. "Kant's Critique of Hobbes: Sovereignty and Cosmopolitanism", (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this book Williams describes Hobbes writing of ''Behemoth'' as an attempt to "capture the spirit of those awful times and to suggest emphatically that they should not be repeated".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes did not believe that anything positive came out of the civil war.

Kant, according to Williams, shares the same basic attitude to the resistance of sovereign power but does not think that all outcomes of Rebellion are necessarily negative.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant is writing about the [[French Revolution]], not the English Civil War, in his book ''The Conflict of the Faculties''. Written more than 100 years after Hobbes wrote ''Behemoth'', it has as its focus the idea that rebellions arouse sympathy in other countries for the people caught up in them. Kant says that this is due to a "moral disposition within the human race".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 34&lt;/ref&gt; Going further Kant, according to Williams, implies that uprisings are the wrong solution to a problem with governance but that there can still be something positive in the results of that uprising.

Hobbes does not think that there is any sort of innate morality in society and that rebellion is either "an unwise or failed experiment as a complete blunder arising from ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, according to Williams, Hobbes has sympathy not for the common people caught up in the rebellion but instead for those who were the victims of the rebellion. This is in keeping with the royalist stance taken by Hobbes in ''Behemoth''.
''
The French Revolution was not the only source for Kant's views on rebellion. He took into account the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the English Civil war as well as the views of classical thinking on the nature of republics.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes, of course, could not do this. Kant as well was more of an observer than a participant in the events of these revolutions. Hobbes was deeply affected by the Civil war and believed that rebellion would not be a solution. Instead "only an absolute sovereign power could teach 'the science of just and unjust', fixing meanings in a stable way and thus inducing social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;David Norbrook, "''The English Revolution and English Historiography''" in &lt;u&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Writing of the English Revolution&lt;/u&gt;, Ed. N.H. Keeble, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes then is a supporter of an "absolute sovereignty, embodied in a monarch or corporate body of individuals; Kant is a supporter of popular sovereignty, embodied in the law-making powers of a group of the people's representatives".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another key difference between the two philosophers is the way that the laws of the land should be administered.  An absolute monarch, for Hobbes, implies that the authority of that monarch "must be beyond question, whereas for Kant the sovereign's authority is best safeguarded through the possibility of public debate and criticism".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  These fundamental differences in thinking are perhaps more to do with the differences in the eras the two philosophers lived in.  Hobbes lived a hundred years before Kant.  Additionally Hobbes experienced rebellion first hand, even to the point of fleeing England for fear of his personal safety, whereas Kant did not directly suffer during the rebellions that occurred in his lifetime.  Another consideration was that in the course of a century much more had been written on the subject of the rights of the people and of liberty and this too must have been an influence on Kant's point of view.  This does not negate Hobbes' views on rebellion but does illuminate a probable cause for his position on them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3521">'''Bernhard Alexander''' (1850–1927) was a Hungarian writer of Jewish background, and a professor of philosophy and [[esthetics]].

==Life and career==
Bernhard (Bernát) Alexander was born '''Alexander Márkus''' in [[Budapest|Pest]]&lt;ref&gt;The cities of Buda and Pest and the town of Óbuda were merged as the city of Budapest in the fall of 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; on 13 April 1850, and educated in his native city, later attending German universities, where he pursued studies in the fields of [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]] and [[pedagogy]]. On his return to Hungary he was appointed to a teaching post in a ''[[Realschule]]'' (scientifically oriented high school) in Budapest, and in 1878 was admitted as a docent into the faculty of philosophy at the [[University of Budapest]], where he became a full professor in 1895. From 1892, he also lectured on [[dramaturgy]] and esthetics at the National Theater Academy, and on the latter subject and on the history of civilization at the Francis Joseph Polytechnic. He was a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] and a member of the [[Kisfaludy Society]], a major force in Hungarian literature. He was the father of [[Franz Alexander]], a Hungarian-American psychoanalyst and physician, who is considered one of the founders of psychosomatic medicine and psychoanalytic criminology, and maternal grandfather of [[Alfréd Rényi]], a Hungarian mathematician who made contributions in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory but mostly in probability theory.

==Works==
Alexander's chief works are ''A philosophia történetének eszméje, tekintettel a történetre általában'' (The idea of the history of philosophy, in consideration of history in general, 1878); ''[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Élete, fejlődése és philosophiája'' (Life, development and philosophy, 1881); ''A XIX. század pesszimizmusa: [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] és [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|Hartmann]]'' (The pessimism of the 19th century: Schopenhauer and Hartmann, Budapest, 1884, prize essay). Alexander, together with Professor Józef Bánóczi, later edited a seminal series of books on philosophers, the ''Filosofiai Irók Tára'', for which he did translations and annotations of [[René Descartes]], [[David Hume]], and the ''[[Prolegomena]]'' to [[Immanuel Kant]]. Jointly with Bánóczi, he translated Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''. He was an active writer on matters of education, editing the pedagogical journal ''Magyar Tanügy'' from 1882 to 1886.

==Exile and death==
However, Alexander became pariah in the nationalistic, anti-Semitic environment of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|post-1919 Hungary]] and [[Miklós Horthy|Miklós Horthy's government]], and spent four years abroad. He died in Budapest in 23 October 1927.

The '''Biedermeier''' period refers to an era in Central Europe between 1815 and 1848, during which the middle class grew in number and arts appealed to common sensibilities. It began with the time of the [[Congress of Vienna]] at the end of the Napoleonic Wars and ended with the onset of the European [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Although the term itself is a historical reference, it is used mostly to denote the artistic styles that flourished in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts and interior design.

== Background ==
[[File:Prince Metternich by Lawrence.jpeg|thumb|The [[Concert of Europe]] ensured by the Austrian chancellor [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] enabled the period of peace in which Biedermeier sensibilities developed.]]
The Biedermeier period does not refer to the era as a whole, but to a particular mood and set of trends that grew out of the unique underpinnings of the time in [[Central Europe]]. There were two driving forces for the development of the period. One was the growing urbanization and industrialization leading to a new urban middle class, which created a new kind of audience for the arts. The other was the political stability prevalent under [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Christopher John Murray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXnMs-YDEF4C&amp;pg=PA89 Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850, Volume 1] p 89, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was for artists and society in general to concentrate on the domestic and (at least in public) the non-political. Writers, painters, and musicians began to stay in safer territory, and the emphasis on home life for the growing middle-class meant a blossoming of furniture design and interior decorating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biedermeier.us/biedermeier.htm |title=Biedermeier - Elegant, Simple Interior Design |publisher=Biedermeier.us |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The term "Biedermeier" appeared first in literary circles in the form of a pseudonym, Gottlieb Biedermaier, used by the country doctor [[Adolf Kussmaul]] and lawyer [[Ludwig Eichrodt]] in poems that the duo had published in the [[Munich]] journal ''[[Fliegende Blätter]]''. The verses parodied the people of the era, namely [[Samuel Friedrich Sauter]], a primary teacher and sort of amateurish poet, as depoliticized and [[petite bourgeoisie|petit-bourgeois]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Eichrodt 1827-1892 Renate Begemann Verlag der Badischen Landesbibliothek, 1992, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; The name was constructed from the titles of two poems—"Biedermanns Abendgemütlichkeit" (Biedermann's Evening Comfort) and "Bummelmaiers Klage" (Bummelmaier's Complaint)—which [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] had published in 1848 in the same magazine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} As a label for the epoch, the term has been used since around 1900.

Due to the strict control of publication and official censorship, Biedermeier writers primarily concerned themselves with non-political subjects, like historical fiction and country life. Political discussion was usually confined to the home, in the presence of close friends.

Typical Biedermeier poets are [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso]], [[Friedrich Halm]], [[Eduard Mörike]], and [[Wilhelm Müller]], the last two of whom have well-known musical settings by [[Hugo Wolf]] and [[Franz Schubert]] respectively.  [[Adalbert Stifter]] is a novelist and short story writer whose work also reflects the concerns of the Biedermeier movement, particularly with his novel, ''[[Der Nachsommer]]''.  As historian [[Carl Schorske]] puts it, "To illustrate and propagate his concept of Bildung, compounded of Benedictine world piety, German humanism, and Biedermeier conventionality, Stifter gave to the world his novel ''Der Nachsommer''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==As a personality type==
A “Biedermann” is characterized as a conservative unimaginative middle-class personality, content but vulnerable to upset when disturbed by unfavorable social or economic conditions.&lt;ref name=NYT122915&gt;{{cite news|author1=Anna Sauerbrey|title=The New Face of Racism in Germany|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/opinion/the-new-face-of-racism-in-germany.html|accessdate=30 December 2015|work=The New York Times|date=29 December 2015|quote=He is, by all accounts, a typical German, an upright middle-class citizen — what we call a “Biedermann.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture design and interior decorating==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Zimmerbild 83.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Zimmerbild]]'' (chamber painting) of a Biedermeier interior in Berlin: fitted carpets, unified window and pier-mirror draperies, and framed engravings in a restrained classicising style, c. 1825, by Leopold Zielcke (1791–1861)]]

Biedermeier was an influential German style of furniture design that evolved during the years 1815–1848. The period extended into Scandinavia, as disruptions due to numerous states that made up the German nation were not unified by rule from Berlin until 1871. {{clarify|date=January 2016}}These post-Biedermeier struggles, influenced by historicism, created their own styles.  Throughout the period, emphasis was kept upon clean lines and minimal ornamentation consistent with Biedermeier's basis in utilitarian principles. As the period progressed, however, the style moved from the early rebellion against Romantic-era fussiness to increasingly ornate commissions by a rising middle class, eager to show their newfound wealth.  The idea of clean lines and utilitarian postures would resurface in the 20th century, continuing into the present day.  Middle- to late-Biedermeier furniture design represents a heralding towards historicism and revival eras long sought for.  Social forces originating in France would change the artisan-patron system that achieved this period of design, first in the Germanic states and, then, into Scandinavia. The middle class growth originated in the English industrial revolution and many Biedermeier designs owe their simplicity to Georgian lines of the 19th century, as the proliferation of design publications reached the loose Germanic states and the Austro-Hungarian empire.

The Biedermeier style was a simplified interpretation of the influential French Empire Style of Napoleon I, which introduced the romance of ancient Roman Empire styles, adapting these to modern early 19th-century households. Biedermeier furniture used locally available materials such as cherry, ash and oak woods rather than the expensive timbers such as fully imported mahogany. Whilst this timber was available near trading ports such as [[Antwerp]], Hamburg and [[Stockholm]], it was taxed heavily whenever it passed through another principality. This made mahogany very expensive to use and much local cherry and pearwood was stained to imitate the more expensive timbers. Stylistically, the furniture was simple and elegant. Its construction utilised the ideal of truth through material, something that later influenced the Bauhaus and Art Deco periods.

Many unique designs were created in Vienna, primarily because a young apprentice was examined on his use of material, construction, originality of design, and quality of cabinet work, before being admitted to the league of approved master cabinetmakers. Furniture from the earlier period (1815–1830) was the most severe and neoclassical in inspiration. It also supplied the most fantastic forms which the second half of the period (1830–1848) lacked, being influenced by the many style publications from England. Biedermeier furniture was the first style in the world that emanated from the growing middle class. It preceded Victoriana and influenced mainly Germanic-speaking countries. In Sweden, Marshal [[Folke Bernadotte|Bernadotte]], whom Napoleon appointed as ambassador to Sweden to sideline his ambitions, abandoned his support for Napoleon in a shrewd political move. Later, after being adopted by the king of Sweden (who was childless), he became Sweden's new king [[Karl Johan]]. The Swedish Karl Johan style, similar to Biedermeier, retained its elegant and blatantly Napoleonic style throughout the 19th century.

Biedermeier furniture and lifestyle was a focus on exhibitions at the Vienna applied arts museum in 1896. The many visitors to this exhibition were so influenced by this fantasy style and its elegance that a new resurgence or revival period became popular amongst European cabinetmakers. This revival period lasted up until the Art Deco style was taken up. Biedermeier also influenced the various Bauhaus styles through their truth in material philosophy.

The original Biedermeier period changed with the political unrests of 1845–1848 (its end date). With the revolutions in European [[historicism (art)|historicism]], furniture of the later years of the period took on a distinct Wilhelminian or Victorian style.

The term Biedermeier is also used to refer to a style of clock made in Vienna in the early nineteenth century.  The clean and simple lines included a light and airy aesthetic, especially in Viennese regulators of the Lanterndluhr and Dachluhr styles.

== Architecture==
[[File:Florastoeckl Baden.jpg|220x220px|thumb|House style]]
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
Biedermeier architecture is marked by simplicity and elegance, exemplified by the paintings of [[Jakob Alt]] and [[Carl Spitzweg]].  One of the most elegant surviving Biedermeier buildings is the [[Stadttempel]] in Vienna.  Through the unity of simplicity, mobility and functionality the Biedermeier [[Neoclassical architecture]] created tendencies of crucial influence for the [[Jugendstil]]—[[Art Nouveau]], the [[Bauhaus]], and the 20th-century architecture.

==Visual arts==
[[File:Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller 002.jpg|thumb|''Am Fronleichnamsmorgen''  by [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]] (1857) is an example of Biedermeier paintings evoking harmony, belief and tradition]] 
[[File:Emilie Feustell.jpg|thumb|''Emilie Feustell'', by {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Christian Ludwig Tunica|de|3=Christian Tunica}}]]

Austrian painting during this era is characterized by the commitment to portray a sentimental and pious view of the world in a realistic way. Biedermeier themes reinforced feelings of security, ''[[Gemütlichkeit]]'', traditional pieties and simplicity, eschewing political and social commentary during the epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belvedere.at/jart/prj3/belvedere/main.jart?rel=en&amp;content-id=1169655781722&amp;reserve-mode=active#m Biedermeier-era paintings in the Belvedere, Vienna] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204231536/http://www.belvedere.at/jart/prj3/belvedere/main.jart?rel=en&amp;content-id=1169655781722&amp;reserve-mode=active#m |date=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the techniques, while classic in nature were of the utmost importance to reach a realistic rendering. Regarding the thematic, the technique was seen not only as a narrative medium to tell the past in anecdotal vignettes, but also to represent the present. This formed an aesthetic unity most evidenced in the portraits (e.g., ''Portrait of the Arthaber Family'', 1837, by Friedrich von Amerling), landscapes (e.g. see Waldmüller or Gauermann landscapes) and contemporary-reporting [[genre]] scenes (e.g., ''Controversy of the Coachmen'', 1828, by Michael Neder).

Key painters of the Biedermeier movement are [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–1885), [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]] (1793 Wien – 1865),  [[Josip Tominc]] (Gorizia 1780–1866), [[Friedrich von Amerling]] (1803 Wien – 1887), [[Friedrich Gauermann]] (1807 Miesenbach, Niederösterreich – 1862), [[Johann Baptist Reiter]] (1813 Linz – 1890), [[Peter Fendi]] (1796 Wien – 1842), {{Interlanguage link multi|Michael Neder|de|3=Johann Michael Neder}} (1807 Wien – 1882), [[Josef Danhauser]] (1805 Wien – 1845), [[Edmund Wodick]] (1806  Markt Alvensleben – 1886) among others.&lt;ref name="bieder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belvedere.at/en/sammlungen/belvedere/klassizismus-romantik-biedermeier/biedermeier |title=Biedermeier &amp;#124; Belvedere |publisher=Belvedere.at |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest collection of Viennese Biedermeier paintings in the world is currently hosted by the [[Belvedere Palace]] Museum in Vienna.&lt;ref name="bieder" /&gt;

In [[Denmark]], the Biedermeier period corresponds with the "[[Danish Golden Age]]" a time of creative production in [[Denmark]], which encompasses the paintings of [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]] and his students, including [[Wilhelm Bendz]], [[Christen Købke]], [[Martinus Rørbye]], [[Constantin Hansen]], and [[Wilhelm Marstrand]] as well as the [[neoclassical sculpture]] inspired by the example set by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. The period also saw the development of [[Architecture of Denmark|Danish architecture]] in the  [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]. Copenhagen, in particular, acquired a new look, with buildings designed by [[Christian Frederik Hansen]] and by [[Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Music==
Biedermeier in music is most evident in the numerous publications for in-home music making. Published arrangements of operatic excerpts, German [[Lied]]er, and some symphonic works that could be performed at the piano without professional musical training, illustrate the broadened reach of music in this period.

==Czech Lands==

The Biedermeier period coincides with the Czech National Revival movement in the [[Czech Lands|Czech-speaking lands]]. The most famous writers of the period were [[Božena Němcová]], [[Karel Hynek Mácha]], [[František Ladislav Čelakovský]], [[Václav Kliment Klicpera]], [[Josef Kajetán Tyl]]. Key painters of the Czech Biedermeier were [[Josef Navrátil]], [[Antonín Machek]] and [[Antonín Mánes]]. Landscapes, still lifes, courtyards, family scenes and portraits were very popular. [[Václav Tomášek]] composed lyric piano pieces and songs to the patriotic lyrics of Czech authors. Biedermeier was also reflected in the applied arts - glass and porcelain, fashion, jewellery and, of course, the art of furniture.

== Current usage ==

Terms like [[Bionade-Biedermeier]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Henning Sußebach |title=Bionade-Biedermeier|url = http://www.zeit.de/2007/46/D18-PrenzlauerBerg-46 |access-date=2015-09-26 |work=Zeit Online |date=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Generation Biedermeier'' have been coined to describe parallels between the historical Biedermeier and the German present. The underlying allusion is being used as well in related wordings like ''Bionade-Bourgeoisie'', [[Bionade-Biedermeier]], and ''Generation Biedermeier.''  The 2010 ''Shell Jugendstudie'' used the term ''Generation Biedermeier'' for the mainstream of the younger generation in 2010. Security and private happiness then was more important than political engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Von Thomas Fischermann |title=Gibt es einen German Dream?|url = http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2012-08/german-dream-gruenewald |access-date=2015-09-27 |work=Zeit Online |date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BlindArt''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] charity which was established in 2004 to educate the public about the needs of people who are [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] and to promote the idea that lack of sight need not be a barrier to the creation and enjoyment of works of art. BlindArt exhibitions typically contain paintings, sculptures, installations and other works of art which have been designed to engage all the senses. BlindArt pieces are created both by sighted artists or by artists who are blind or partially sighted.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/03/arts.artsnews2|title= Donning gloves, visually impaired exhibition-goers get to grips with art|publisher= The Guardian|first= Maev|last= Kennedy|date= 3 March 2005|accessdate= 19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BlindArt was founded in 2004 by the [[Iran]]ian born artist Sheri Khayami, who has been visually impaired since childhood. The charity gained national attention in the United Kingdom following its 2005 ''Sense and Sensuality'' exhibition at the [[Royal College of Art]] in [[London]]. The exhibition was made up of pieces created by the finalists of the UK's first annual competition to create pieces of artwork that can be appreciated by visually impaired people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4304571.stm|title= First 'blind' art exhibition opens|publisher= BBC News|first= Geoff|last= Adams-Spink|date= 2 March 2005|accessdate= 19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual competitions have been held since, with pieces of artwork from the exhibition for sale and proceeds used to create a National BlindArt Collection.

'''BookCon''' is an annual [[fan convention]] established in 2014 in [[New York City]]. Taking the name format from other fan conventions such as [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]], BookCon was established to combine pop culture and the book industry. Many authors, celebrities and publishing professionals attend BookCon.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.thebookcon.com/about/FAQs|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartman|first1=Liz|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bea/article/62020-bea-2014-bookcon-s-debut.html/|title=BEA 2014: BookCon’s Debut|date=April 25, 2015|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Burin-Parts.jpg|thumb|A diagram of a burin showing its component parts: the handle, shaft, cutting tip and face&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://porcuprints.com/printmaking/ |title=Porcuprints-Printmaking |accessdate=2011-08-06 |author= Alexia Rostow |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[engraving]], a '''burin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|juː|r|ɪ|n}}, from the [[French language|French]] ''burin'', also used for "cold [[chisel]]s") is a [[steel]] cutting tool which is the essential tool of the form.

== Design ==

The burin consists of a rounded handle shaped like a mushroom, and a tempered steel shaft, coming from the handle at an angle, and ending in a very sharp cutting face.

Burins typically have a square or lozenge shape face, though several other types are used. A tint burin consists of a square face with teeth, enabling the creation of many fine, closely spaced lines. A stipple tool allows for the creation of  fine dots. A flat burin consists of a rectangular face, and is used for cutting away large portions of material at a time.

== Uses ==
[[file:Goltzius's right Hand.jpg|thumb|The malformed hand of [[Hendrik Goltzius]], which was especially suited to the use of a burin]]

An engraving burin is used predominantly by [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] engravers, but also by [[Relief printing|relief]] [[printmaker]]s in making [[wood engraving]]s. Its older English name, still often used, is ''graver''.  Usually an engraver will have several tools, of different sizes and shapes of cutting face.

In use, it is typically held at approximately a 30-degree angle to the surface. The index and middle finger typically guide the shaft, while the handle is cradled in the palm. Of note is the 16th-century Flemish engraver [[Hendrik Goltzius]], whose malformed hand was ideally suited for the cradling and guiding of a burin.

'''''Butcher's Shop''''' is the title of two paintings by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] painter [[Annibale Carracci]], both dating from the early 1580s. They are now in the collections of [[Christ Church Picture Gallery]], [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/gallery/the-collection/paintings/carracci-butchers-shop# |title=Christ Church Picture Gallery |access-date=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704224604/http://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/gallery/the-collection/paintings/carracci-butchers-shop# |archive-date=2011-07-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kimbell Art Museum]] in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kimbellart.org/collection-object/butchers-shop Kimbell Art Museum, ''Butchers Shop'' a film by Philip Haas]&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:'The Butcher's Shop', oil on canvas painting by Annibale Carracci.jpg|thumb|right|[[Annibale Carracci]], ''The Butcher's Shop'', early 1580s, [[Kimbell Art Museum]], 23 1/2 × 27 15/16 in. (59.7 × 71 cm)]]
The paintings are connected to the contemporary ''[[Beaneater (Annibale Carracci)|Beaneater]]'' ([[Palazzo Colonna|Galleria Colonna]]), as they are very early examples of Italian [[genre painting]]. The large size of the Christ Church painting is exceptional for such a subject at this date, and it has been suggested they were commissioned by a butcher's [[guild]], or for use as a sign. Carracci was influenced in his depiction of everyday life subjects by [[Vincenzo Campi]] and [[Bartolomeo Passarotti]], whom the ''Butcher's Shop'' was originally attributed to. Carracci's ability to adapt his style is demonstrated, making it "lower" when concerning "lower", quasi-satirical subjects like the ''Mangiafagioli'' and the ''Butcher's Shop'', while in his more academic works (such as the roughly contemporary ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Carracci)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'') he was able to use a more finished manner with the same ease.

It is claimed{{By whom|date=July 2016}} that members of the painter's family were used as models.  Significant alterations to some figures are revealed by X-rays, and the hand on the edge of the table, now apparently belonging to the old woman, though not in proportion with the rest of her, may have originally belonged to the butcher to the right of her.

The Christ Church painting was in the collections of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] [[Dukes of Mantua]] and [[Charles I of England]]; after reaching Christ church it was for long hung in the college kitchen, before being recognised for what it was in the 20th century.

[[File:Mapa escriptures paleohispàniques-ang.jpg|thumb|250px|The Celtiberian script (light green) among other [[Paleohispanic scripts]].]]
[[File:Un signari celtibèric occidental.jpg|thumb|250px|A western Celtiberian signary (Based on Ferrer i Jané 2005)]]
[[File:Un signari celtibèric oriental.jpg|thumb|250px|An eastern Celtiberian signary]]

The '''Celtiberian script''' is a [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic script]] that was the main [[writing system]] of the [[Celtiberian language]], an extinct [[Continental Celtic]] language, which was also occasionally written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. This script is a direct adaptation of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the most frequently used of the [[Iberian scripts]].

==Origins==
All the [[Paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic values for the [[stop consonant]]s, and monophonemic values for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. They are thus to be classed as neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]]; rather, they are mixed scripts normally identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. There is no agreement about how the [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]] originated; some researchers conclude that they derive only from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] was also involved.

==Tipology and variants==
The basic Celtiberian signary contains 26 [[sign (linguistics)|signs]] rather than the 28 signs of the original model, the [[northeastern Iberian script]], since the [[Celtiberians]] omitted one of the two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] and one of the three [[Nasal consonant|nasals]]. The remaining 26 signs comprised 5 [[vowel]]s, 15 syllabic signs and 6 consonants (one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], two [[sibilants]], one rhotic and two nasals). The sign equivalent to Iberian ''s'' is transcribed as ''z'' in Celtiberian, because it is assumed that it sometimes expresses the fricative result of an ancient dental stop (''d''), while the Iberian sign ''ś'' is transcribed as ''s''. As for the use of the nasal signs, there are two variants of the Celtiberian script: In the eastern variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''ḿ'', while in the western variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''m''. This is interpreted as evidence of a double origin of the Celtiberian script. Like one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the western variant of Celtiberian shows evidence{{which|date=March 2014}} of having allowed the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] ''g'' and ''d'' to be differentiated from their respective [[voicelessness|voiceless]] counterparts, ''k'' and ''t'', by adding a stroke to the voiceless signs. This is known as the ‘dual system’ in Paleohispanic scripts, which otherwise do not distinguish between pairs of voiceless and voiced stops (''p:b, t:d'' and ''k:g'').

==Location of findings==
The Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the [[Ebro]] valley and near the sources of the [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] rivers, where [[ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], [[ceramic]] receptacles, [[bronze]] plaques and [[tessera]]s, [[amphora|amphores]], stones, [[spindle (textiles)|spindle-whorls]], etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third [[Botorrita]] bronze plaque ([[Zaragoza]]) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.

The '''Centennial Honors for the Arts''',(Gawad Sentenaryo para sa Sining) is an award given by the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] and the Philippine Centennial Commission to honor the outstanding Filipino who have contributed in building the nation though Arts and Culture in the last 100 years and it coincide with the 100 years of Philippine Independence.  The awardees were chosen among the hundreds of nominees in different art fields like painting, sculpture, literature, theater, dance, film, architecture, and other arts. In the interest of painting a more complete picture of the development of Filipino culture, the CCP also decided to honor outstanding art patrons, cultural administrators, critics, and researchers. No distinctions were drawn between the fine arts, traditional folk art and popular art.  The CCP also decided not to include the [[Philippine National Artist]]s for they already received the country's highest honors for the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pelikulaatbp.blogspot.com/2012/07/cultural-heroes-ccps-centennial-honors.htmll|title=CULTURAL HEROES: THE CCP'S CENTENNIAL HONORS FOR THE ARTS (Inquirer Sunday Magazine, January 17, 1999) |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection==
Selection of who will be part of the accolade  took a painstaking six-month process of research, study and debate for the selection committee composed of scholars, critics, curators, and artists.  All 65 selection committee members were all experts in their respective fields.  The initial screening came up with nearly 300 names, which were later boiled down to the final 100. This award is primarily to identify people whose contributions helped shape the nation, although they must have achieved some level of excellence in order to be as influential and trend-setting as they were.

==Awarding Ceremony==
The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] gave out the Centennial Honors for the Arts on February 2, 1999.  Honorees received a gold medallion designed by Roberto Feleo in the shape of a palm leaf, which can also be seen as a comet, symbolizing their trailblazing efforts

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">'''Culinary names''', '''menu names''', or '''kitchen names''' are names of foods used in the preparation or selling of food, as opposed to their names in [[agriculture]] or in scientific [[nomenclature]]. The menu name may even be different from the kitchen name. For example, from the 19th until the mid-20th century, many restaurant menus were written in [[French language|French]] and not in the local language.

Examples include [[veal]] ([[calf]]), [[calamari]] ([[squid]]), and [[sweetbread]]s ([[pancreas]] or [[thymus gland]]). Culinary names are especially common for fish and seafood, where multiple species are marketed under a single familiar name.

Foods may come to have distinct culinary names for a variety of reasons:

* [[Euphemism]]: the idea of eating some foods may disgust or offend some eaters regardless of their actual taste
** [[Testicle]]s: [[Rocky Mountain oysters]], Prairie oysters, lamb fries, or [[animelles]]
** Fish [[Milt]]:  soft roe or white roe to disguise that is actually sperm not eggs
** Thymus gland and pancreas gland: [[sweetbreads]]
** [[Kangaroo meat]]:  "Australus" has been proposed as a euphemism{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* Attractiveness: the traditional name may be considered dull, undistinctive, or unattractive
** [[Kiwifruit]]:  a rename of the Chinese gooseberry, which references its fuzzy brown skin, and has now become its standard name
** Mahi-Mahi:  the [[Coryphaenidae|dolphinfish]] is often referred to with this name to avoid confusion with [[dolphin]] (the mammal) meat
** The [[Patagonian toothfish]] is marketed as the Chilean sea bass
** The African Cichlid found in many [[aquarium|aquaria]] is presented as [[Tilapia]]
** The spinal [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of veal and [[beef]] is called ''amourettes''&lt;ref&gt;from a Provencal word for roosters' testicles, but homonymous with 'puppy love' [[Le petit Robert]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='simon'&gt;Andre Simon, ''A concise encyclopedia of gastronomy'', ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grouping of a variety of sources under a single name
** [[Tuna]] includes several different species
* Evocation of more prestigious, rarer, and more expensive foods for which they are a substitute
** [[Cyclopterus lumpus|Lumpsucker]] (or lumpfish) [[roe]] is named lumpfish [[caviar]]
** [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|Cassia]] bark is called [[cinnamon]]
** [[Langostino]] is sometimes called [[lobster]] or "langostino lobster"
** In North America, many [[flounder]] species are called [[Sole (fish)|soles]], ''e.g.'' [[Microstomus pacificus]] is named "Dover sole"
* Evocation of a specific culinary tradition
** Shrimp in Italian-American contexts is often called scampi
** Florentine refers to dishes that include spinach
** Squid is often called by its Italian name, calamari, on menus&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gisslen, ''Professional Cooking'', p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social differences
** The words beef, veal, [[pork]], [[mutton]], [[venison]] and [[poultry]] are derived from the words used by the French-speaking lords in post-[[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] England{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* Other
** In French, [[chestnut]]s are called ''châtaignes'' on the tree, but ''marrons'' in the kitchen
** [[Laver (seaweed)|Laver]] is a culinary name for certain edible algae&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Animal human growth skull neoteny cuteness maturation.png|thumb|"Humans feel affection for animals with juvenile features: large eyes, bulging craniums, retreating chins (left column). Small-eyed, long-snouted animals (right column) do not elicit the same response." —[[Konrad Lorenz]]&lt;ref name="Mickey" /&gt;]]

'''Cuteness''' is a subjective term describing a type of [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]] commonly associated with [[youth]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], as well as a scientific concept and analytical model in [[ethology]], first introduced by [[Konrad Lorenz]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Konrad. ''Studies in Animal and Human Behavior''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ Press; 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz proposed the concept of baby schema (''Kindchenschema''), a set of facial and body features, that make a creature appear "cute" and activate ("release") in others the motivation to care for it.&lt;ref name="Glocker2"&gt;Glocker ML, Langleben DD, Ruparel K, Loughead JW, Valdez JN, Griffin MD, Sachser N, Gur RC. [http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/9115.figures-only "Baby schema modulates the brain reward system in nulliparous women."] ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – U.S.A'' 2009 June 2;106(22):9115–9119.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuteness may be ascribed to people as well as things that are regarded as attractive or charming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cute "cute, adj."]. OED Online. March 2012. Oxford University Press. (accessed April 29, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juvenile traits ==
[[File:Kopfproportionen.svg|thumb|Change of head proportions (especially the relative size of the [[maxilla]] and [[mandible]]) as a function of age]]

Doug Jones, a [[visiting scholar]] in anthropology at [[Cornell University]],&lt;!-- His qualifications are given on the first page of the article. --&gt; said that the proportions of facial features change with age due to changes in hard tissue and soft tissue, and Jones said that these "age-related changes" cause juvenile animals to have the "characteristic 'cute' appearance" of proportionately smaller snouts, higher foreheads and larger eyes than their adult counterparts. In terms of hard tissue, Jones said that the [[neurocranium]] grows a lot in juveniles while the bones for the nose and the parts of the skull involved in chewing food only reach maximum growth later. In terms of soft tissue, Jones said that the [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] tissues of the ears and nose continue to grow throughout a person's lifetime, starting at age twenty-five the eyebrows descend on the "[[Supraorbital ridge|supraorbital rim]]" from a position above the supraorbital rim to a position below it, the "lateral aspect of the eyebrows" sags with age, making the eyes appear smaller, and the red part of the lips gets thinner with age due to loss of connective tissue.&lt;!-- This was found on page 728 at the bottom and 729 at the top. --&gt;&lt;ref name="DJones" /&gt;

A study found that the faces of "attractive"&lt;!-- The study did not use the word "cute", but an "attractive" child's face would normally be interpreted as being synonymous with a cute child's face.--&gt; [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] Caucasian&lt;!-- On page 595, Sforza says the study used Northern Italian Caucasians.--&gt; children have "characteristics of babyness" such as a "larger forehead", a smaller jaw, "a proportionately larger and more prominent [[maxilla]]", a wider face, a flatter face and larger "[[anteroposterior]]" facial dimensions than the Northern Italian Caucasian children used as a [[reference]].&lt;!-- This information is on page 604. The citation information for the original journal article is located on page 593.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preedy, V.R. (2012).

===Biological function===
Konrad Lorenz argued in 1949 that infantile features triggered nurturing responses in adults and that this was an evolutionary adaptation which helped ensure that adults cared for their children, ultimately securing the survival of the species. Some later scientific studies have provided further evidence for Lorenz's theory. For example, it has been shown that human adults react positively to infants who are [[stereotype|stereotypically]] cute. Studies have also shown that responses to cuteness—and to facial attractiveness in general—seem to be similar across and within cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Van Duuren, Mike; Kendell-Scott, Linda; Stark, Natalie. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105817/http://www.winchester.ac.uk/view.ashx?Item=15993 "Early Aesthetic Choices: Infant Preferences for Attractive Premature Infant Faces"] (PDF), King Alfred's College. Archived from [http://www.winchester.ac.uk/view.ashx?Item=15993 the original].&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Stephan Hamann of [[Emory University]], he found using an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], that cute pictures increased brain activity in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbital frontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Agreed, Baby Pandas Are Cute. But Why? |author=Schneider, Avie |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/10/169057467/agreed-baby-pandas-are-cute-but-why |newspaper=National Public Radio |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth pattern of children==
Desmond Collins, who was an Extension Lecturer of Archaeology at [[London University]],&lt;ref&gt;(1970). Special Issue: Early Man. World Archaeology Volume 2, Issue 1, DOI: 10.1080/00438243.1970.9979467 page 112 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438243.1970.9979467?journalCode=rwar20#.VGwIFYdYvls link]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the lengthened youth period of humans is part of [[neoteny]].&lt;!-- This is on page 15.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;Collins, D. et al. (1973). Background to archaeology: Britain in its European setting. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-20155-1}} hard cover&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical anthropologist [[Barry Bogin]] said that the pattern of children's growth may intentionally increase the duration of their cuteness. Bogin said that the human brain reaches adult size when the body is only 40 percent complete, when "dental maturation is only 58 percent complete" and when "reproductive maturation is only 10 percent complete". Bogin said that this [[allometry]] of human growth allows children to have a "superficially infantile" appearance (large [[skull]], small face, small body and sexual underdevelopment) longer than in other "[[mammal]]ian species". Bogin said that this cute appearance causes a "nurturing" and "care-giving" response in "older individuals".&lt;!-- This was on page 83.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, B. (1997). Evolutionary Hypotheses for Human Childhood. Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, vol. 40, pp. 63–89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender differences ==
The perceived cuteness of an infant is influenced by the [[gender]] and behavior of the infant.&lt;ref name=Koyama&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Reiko |author2=Takahashi, Yuwen |author3=Mori, Kazuo|title=Assessing the cuteness of children: Significant factors and gender differences|journal=Social Behavior and Personality|year=2006|volume=34|pages=1087–1100|doi=10.2224/sbp.2006.34.9.1087|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karraker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karraker|first=Katherine|author2=Stern, Marilyn|title=Infant physical attractiveness and facial expression: Effects on adult perceptions|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1104_2#.UihZBbwic38|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=11|pages=371–385|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1104_2|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Koyama et al. (2006) research, female infants are seen as cute for the physical attraction that female infants display more than male infants;&lt;ref name=Koyama /&gt; whereas research by Karraker (1990) demonstrates that a caregiver's attention and involvement in the male infant's protection could be solely based on the perception of happiness and attractiveness of the child.&lt;ref name=Karraker /&gt;

The gender of an observer can determine their perception of the difference in cuteness. In a study by Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) it was suggested that women were more sensitive to small differences in cuteness than the same aged men. This suggests that reproductive [[hormone]]s in women are important for determining cuteness.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprengelmeyer | first1 = R | last2 = Perrett | first2 = D. | last3 = Fagan | first3 = E. | last4 = Cornwell | first4 = R. | last5 = Lobmaier | first5 = J. | last6 = Sprengelmeyer | first6 = A. | last7 = Aasheim | first7 = H. | last8 = Black | first8 = I. | last9 = Cameron | first9 = L. | last10 = Crow | first10 = S. | last11 = Milne | first11 = N. | last12 = Rhodes | first12 = E. | last13 = Young | first13 = A. | year = 2009 | title = The Cutest Little Baby Face: A Hormonal Link to Sensitivity to Cuteness in Infant Faces | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 9| pages = 149–154 | pmid = 19175530 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02272.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding has also been demonstrated in a study conducted by T.R. Alley in which he had 25 undergraduate students (consisting of 7 men and 18 women) rate cuteness of infants depending on different characteristics such as age, behavioral traits, and physical characteristics such as head shape, and facial feature configuration.&lt;ref name="Alley"/&gt;

==Preference in young children==
Borgi et al. stated that young children demonstrate a preference for faces with a more "infantile facial" arrangement i.e. a rounder face, a higher forehead, bigger eyes, a smaller nose and a smaller mouth.&lt;!-- This was found in the "BABY SCHEMA AND CUTENESS PERCEPTION" section. --&gt; In a study that used three- to six-year-old children, Borgi et al. asserted that the children showed a viewing time preference toward the eyes of "high infantile" faces of dogs, cats and humans as opposed to "low infantile" faces of those three species.&lt;!-- This was found in the paragraph immediately before the "Discussion" section. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgi, M. et al. (2014). Baby schema in human and animal faces induces cuteness perception and gaze allocation in children. In Frontiers in Psychology. 5(411).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hormones and cuteness variation ==
There are suggestions that hormone levels can affect a person's perception of cuteness. Konrad Lorenz suggests that "caretaking behaviour and affective orientation" towards infants as an innate mechanism, and this is triggered by cute characteristics such as "chubby cheeks" and large eyes. The Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) study expands on this claim by manipulating baby pictures to test groups on their ability to detect differences in cuteness. The studies show that [[menopause|premenopausal]] women detected cuteness better than same aged postmenopausal women. Furthermore, to support this claim, women taking [[birth control pill]]s that raise levels of reproductive hormones detect cuteness better than same aged women not taking the pill.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"/&gt;

Sprengelmeyer gathered 24 young women, 24 young men, and 24 older women to participate in his study. He ran three studies in which images of white European babies were shown, and the participants were asked to rate them on a cuteness scale of one to seven. The study found differences among the groups in cuteness discrimination, which ruled out [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] and social influences on perceived cuteness. In the second study it was found that premenopausal women discriminated cuteness at a higher level than their postmenopausal female peers. This finding suggested a biological factor, which was then investigated further in the third study. Here, Sprengelmeyer compared cuteness sensitivity between premenopausal women who were, and were not taking oral contraceptives. The study concluded that post-perceptual processes were impacted by hormone levels ([[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]] specifically) in females, and thus impacted sensitivity to cuteness.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"/&gt;

== Caregiving correlates ==
A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant's head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of "cute". However a study by Thomas Alley found no such correlation and pointed out faulty procedures in that study. Alley's study found that cephalic head shape of an infant did induce a positive response from adults, and these children were considered to be more "cute". In his study, Alley had 25 undergraduate students rate line drawings of an infant's face. The same drawing was used each time, however the cephalic head shape was changed using a cardioidal transformation (a transformation that models cephalic growth in relation to ageing process) to adjust the perceived age; other features of the face were not changed.  The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking. The study also noted that perceived cuteness was also dependent on other physical and behavioural characteristics of the child, including age.&lt;ref name="Alley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alley|first=Thomas|title=Head shape and the perception of cuteness|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1981-32782-001|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1981|volume=17|issue=5|pages=650–654|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.5.650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by McCabe (1984) of children whose ages ranged from toddlers to teenagers, the children with more "adult-like" facial proportions were more likely to have experienced physical abuse than children of the same age who had less "adult-like" facial proportions.&lt;!--This is on the bottom of page 136.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, V. &amp; Young, A. (2012). Face Perception. USA &amp; Canada: Psychology Press. {{ISBN|978-1-84169-878-6}} (hbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Karraker (1990) suggested that "an adult's beliefs about the [[personality]] and expected behavior of an infant can influence the adult's interaction with the infant", and gave evidence that in this way "basic cuteness effects may occasionally be obscured in particular infants".&lt;ref name=Karraker /&gt; Koyama (2006) said that an adult caregiver's perception of an infant's cuteness can motivate the amount of care and protection the caregiver provides, and the admiration demonstrated toward the infant, and concluded that "the adults' protective feeling for children appeared to be a more important criterion for the judgment of a boy's cuteness."&lt;ref name=Koyama /&gt;

Melanie Glocker (2009) provided experimental evidence that infants' cuteness motivates caretaking in adults, even if they are not related to the infant.&lt;ref name=Glocker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glocker|first=Melanie|author2=Daniel D.

The research suggested that individuals' rating of the perceived cuteness of an infant corresponded to the level of motivation an individual had to care for this infant.&lt;ref name=Glocker /&gt; Glocker and colleagues then used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), to demonstrate that baby faces with higher content of baby schema features, generated more activation in the [[nucleus accumbens]], a small brain area central to motivation and reward.&lt;ref name="Glocker2" /&gt; This work elucidated the neural mechanism through which baby schema (''Kindchenschema'') may motivate ("release") caretaking behavior. Furthermore, cute infants were more likely to be [[adoption|adopted]] and rated as more "likeable, friendly, healthy and competent" than infants who were less cute. There is an implication that baby schema response is crucial to human development because it lays the foundation for care giving and the relationship between child and caretaker.&lt;ref name=Glocker/&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
Doug Jones, a [[visiting scholar]] in anthropology at [[Cornell University]],&lt;!-- His qualifications are given on the first page of the article. --&gt; said that the faces of monkeys, dogs, birds and even the fronts of cars can be made to appear cuter by morphing them with a "[[cardioid]]al" ([[Heart (symbol)|heart-shaped]]) [[Transformation (function)|mathematical transformation]]. Jones said that negative cardioidal strain results in faces appearing less mature and cuter by causing facial features at the top of the face to expand outward and upward while causing features at the bottom of the face to contract inward and upward.&lt;!-- This was at the bottom of page 728. --&gt;&lt;ref name="DJones"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.|display-authors=etal|title=Sexual Selection, Physical Attractiveness, and Facial Neoteny: Cross-cultural Evidence and Implications [and Comments and Reply]|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 1995|volume=36|issue=5|pages=723–748|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1601&amp;context=fchd_facpub|accessdate=22 January 2017|doi=10.1086/204427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] said that over time [[Mickey Mouse]] had been drawn to resemble a juvenile more with a relatively larger head, larger eyes, a larger and more bulging [[cranium]], a less sloping and more rounded forehead, shorter, thicker and "pudgier" legs, thicker arms and a thicker snout which gave the appearance of being less protrusive. Gould suggested that this change in Mickey's image was intended to increase his popularity by making him appear cuter and "inoffensive".&lt;!-- This was at the bottom of the first page. --&gt; Gould said that the neotenous changes to Mickey's form were similar to the [[Neoteny#Human evolution|neotenous changes that occurred in human evolution]].&lt;!--This was at the bottom of the third page. --&gt;&lt;ref name="Mickey"&gt;Gould, S.J.

W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Etcoff, Ph.D. in psychology from [[Boston University]],&lt;!--These credentials are in "About the Author" before the table of contents.--&gt; said "cartoonists capitalize on our innate preferences for juvenile features", and she mentioned Mickey Mouse and [[Bambi]] as examples of this trend. She said Mickey Mouse's bodily proportions "aged in reverse" since his inception, because "[h]is eyes and head kept getting bigger while his limbs kept getting shorter and thicker", culminating in him resembling a "human infant". She further mentioned the "exaggerated high forehead" and the "[[wikt:doe eyes|doe eyes]]" of Bambi as another example of this trend.&lt;!-- This is in the second paragraph of the "Cuteness" section of chapter 2.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etcoff, N.

Healing Hormones: How to Turn on Natural Chemicals to Reduce Stress. Oakland, CA: Ronin Publishing, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57951-180-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; said cute animals get more public attention and scientific study due to having physical characteristics that would be considered [[neoteny|neotenous]] from the perspective of [[Human development (biology)|human development]]. Estren said that humans should be mindful of their bias for cute animals, so animals that would not be considered cute are also valued in addition to cute animals.&lt;!--This was written from reading the article's abstract.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Estren | first1 = M.J. | year = 2012 | title = The Neoteny Barrier: Seeking Respect for the Non-Cute | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ethics | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 6–11 | doi=10.5406/janimalethics.2.1.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deformity of Hand due to X-ray burns.jpg|thumb|Female hand showing deformity due to x-ray burns. The inflammation is due to excessive radiation, which occurs when x-ray machines are unshielded.]]

A '''deformity''', '''dysmorphism''', or '''dysmorphic feature''' is a major abnormality in the shape of a body part or organ compared to the normal shape of that part.
==Causes==
Deformity may arise from numerous causes:
*Genetic [[mutation]]
*Damage to the [[fetus]] or [[uterus]]
*Complications at [[childbirth|birth]]
*A growth or hormone disorder
*Reconstructive surgery following a severe injury, e.g. [[Third degree burn|burn injury]]
*[[Arthritis]] and other rheumatoid disorders
*Fractured bones left to heal without being properly [[Reduction (orthopedic_surgery)|set]] ([[malunion]])
*Chronic application of external forces, e.g. [[artificial cranial deformation]]
*Chronic [[paresis]], [[paralysis]] or [[muscle imbalance]], especially in children, e.g. due to [[poliomyelitis]] or [[cerebral palsy]]

Deformity can occur in non-humans, as well.  [[Frogs]] can be mutated due to [[Ribeiroia]] ([[Trematoda]]) infection.

==Mortality==
In many cases in which a major deformity is present at birth, it is the result of an underlying condition severe enough that the baby does not survive very long. The mortality of severely deformed births may be due to a range of complications including missing or non-functioning vital organs, structural defects that prevent breathing or eating, and high susceptibility to injuries, abnormal facial appearance, or infections that lead to death.

==In mythology==
[[Mythological]] creatures may have been created due to a deformative syndrome also, for instance, descriptions of [[mermaid]]s may be related to the symptoms of [[sirenomelia]]. The [[Irish Mythology]] includes the [[Fomorians]], who are almost without exception described as being deformed, possessing only one of what most have two of ([[human eye|eye]]s, [[arm]]s, [[Human leg|leg]]s, etc.) or having larger than normal limbs.

[[File:Bronze square ding (cauldron) with human faces 02.jpg|thumb|Square ''ding''; the human face is highly unusual decoration]]
'''''Ding''''' ({{lang|zh|鼎}}) are [[prehistoric China|prehistoric]] and [[ancient China|ancient]] [[China|Chinese]] [[cauldron]]s, standing upon legs with a lid and two facing handles. They are one of the most important shapes used in [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s.  They were made in two shapes: round vessels with three legs and rectangular ones with four, the latter often called ''fangding''. They were [[cookware|used for cooking]], storage, and [[animal sacrifice|ritual offerings]] to the [[Chinese mythology|gods]] or to [[ancestor veneration in China|ancestors]]. The earliest recovered examples are pre-[[Shang dynasty|Shang]] [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic]] ding at the [[Erlitou]] site{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=2}} but they are better known from the [[Chinese Bronze Age|Bronze Age]], particularly after the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] deemphasized the ritual use of [[huangjiu|wine]] practiced by the [[list of Shang emperors|Shang kings]].&lt;ref name=CJM&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Jianming|title=Along the Yangzi River: Regional Culture of the Bronze Age from Hunan|year=2011|publisher=Art Media Resources, Ltd.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9774054-6-6|pages=23–24|author2=Jay Xu|author3=Fu Juliang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Zhou, the ding and the privilege to perform the associated rituals became symbols of authority.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawton|first=Thomas|title=Chinese Art of the Warring States Period: Change and Continuity 480-222 B.C.|year=1982|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-934686-39-6 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of permitted ding varied according to one's rank in the [[Chinese nobility]]: the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons|Nine Ding]] of the [[list of Zhou kings|Zhou kings]] were a symbol of their rule over all China but were lost by the first [[emperor of China|emperor]], [[Shi Huangdi]] in the late 3rd century {{sc|BCE}}.&lt;ref name=botgen&gt;[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-08/04/content_57634.htm Food for Thought: Archeological Findings Point to Chinese Dietary Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204120052/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-08/04/content_57634.htm |date=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, imperial authority was represented by the [[Heirloom Seal of the Realm]], carved out of the [[He Shi Bi]] [[Chinese jade|jade]]; it was lost at some point during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period|Five Dynasties]] after the collapse of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]].

==Function and use==
In Chinese history and culture, possession of one or more ancient ding is often associated with power and dominion over the land. Therefore, the ding is often used as an implicit symbolism for power. The term "inquiring of the ding" ({{zh|c=问鼎|p=wèn dǐng}}) is often used interchangeably with the quest for power.
[[File:HK LeiChengUkHanTombMuseum PotteryDingTripod.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic tripod ding, [[Han Dynasty]]]]

In the early [[Bronze Age]] of China, the use of wine and food vessels served a religious purpose. While ding were the most important food vessels, wine vessels were the more prominent ritual bronzes of this time, likely due to the belief in [[Shamanism]] and spirit worship.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=8}} Ding were used to make ritual sacrifices, both human and animal, to ancestors. They varied in size, but were generally quite large, indicating that whole animals were likely sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Sarah|authorlink= Sarah Allan |title=The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-0459-5|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifices were meant to appease ancestors due to the Shang belief that spirits had the capability to affect the world of the living.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=14}} If the ancestors were happy, the living would be blessed with good fortune.

During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Early Western Zhou Dynasty]], the people underwent a political and cultural change. [[King Wu of Zhou]] believed that the Shang people were drunkards. He believed that their over-consumption of wine led their king to lose the [[Mandate of Heaven]], thus leading to the downfall of the Shang dynasty.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=12}} Because of this belief, food vessels (and ding in particular) replaced wine vessels in importance. Bronze vessels underwent what has been called the "Ritual Revolution."&lt;ref name=CJM/&gt; This theory suggests that because there was a change in decor as well as the types and variations of vessels found in tombs, their function shifted from solely religious to a more secular one. Instead of sacrificing food to appease ancestors, the Zhou used ding to show off the status of the deceased to both the living and spirits.{{sfn|Fong|1980|p=14}} Ding symbolized status. For example, emperors were buried with nine ding, feudal lords with seven, ministers with five, and scholar-bureaucrats with three or one.&lt;ref name=CJM/&gt; The vessels served as symbols of authority for the elite far into the [[Warring States period]].&lt;ref name=Lawton/&gt;

==Form and construction==
[[File:Ding (cooking vessel), China, Shang dynasty, 1300-1046 BC, bronze - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03993.JPG|thumb|left|Shang dynasty, 1300-1046 BC]]
Like other ritual bronze shapes, the ding was originally an ordinary [[ceramic]] cooking, serving and storage vessel, dating back to the [[Chinese Neolithic]], and ceramic dings continued to be used during and after the period when ceremonial bronze versions were made.  From the time of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in the 2nd millennium&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BCE}}, dings were also cast in [[bronze]] as high-status [[Chinese ritual bronzes|"ritual bronzes"]], which were often buried in the tomb of their owners for use in the afterlife. This is the period to which the oldest examples of bronze dings date. Inscriptions found on dings and [[Bell (instrument)#Ancient Chinese bells|zhongs]] are used to study [[bronzeware script]].

==Theories on construction==
[[File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|thumb|The [[Houmuwu Ding]] is the largest piece of bronze work found from the ancient world so far. It was made in the late Shang dynasty at [[Anyang]].]]
The most commonly believed bronze vessel casting process of ancient Chinese vessels is the piece mold process.  In this process, a model of the finished vessel, complete with décor, is made of clay and left to harden, next a negative of this is made by adding a layer of wet clay to the completed model, and allowed to harden to the point where it can still be cut away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fairbank|first=Wilma|title=Piece-Mold Craftsmanship and Shang Bronze Design|journal=Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America|year=1962|volume=16|pages=9–13|jstor=20067039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model would then be shaved down to form the core, which would eventually become the empty interior of the completed vessel.  In the final step, the negative layer was replaced around the core, these were held apart by small bronze and copper pieces called chaplets until the molten bronze could be poured into the opening, and fill the empty space between the two layers.  When the bronze had cooled, the clay would be broken away from the vessel, and the process was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=33|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer variation on the piece mold process was put forth as a way to explain asymmetrical faces on vessels which, as a rule, should be symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Nickel 2006 6–7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=6–7|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed that décor was not made on a model and then transferred to the outer mold layer, but that the décor was carved into and built up on the outer, shell layer as the first step.&lt;ref name="Nickel 2006 6–7"/&gt; Décor was added in a variety of ways.  The first was simply carving and incising lines into the clay mold layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=14|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was to stamp or press an image, inscription, or design into the wet clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=32|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third was a technique called tube lining. In this technique, soft, liquid clay would be put into a leather bag, and piped onto a surface through some kind of very fine tube made of metal or bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=Lukas|title=Imperfect Symmetry: Re-Thinking Bronze Casting Technology in Ancient China|journal=Artibus Asiae|year=2006|volume=66|issue=1|pages=15–16|jstor=25261842}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique would have been quite intensive, as it was difficult to maintain constant pressure on the bag, which was needed to create even lines; however, because of certain types of décor, such as thunder or quill patterns, this would have been the most likely technique used to create low relief design in this process.

==Decoration==
[[File:Vessel (fangding), China, Shang dynasty, bronze, Honolulu Academy of Arts.JPG|thumb|Shang fangding with [[taotie]]]]
[[File:Ding (vessel), China, Shang dynasty, c. 1500-1050 BCE, HAA.JPG|thumb|Shang ding, with [[taotie]]]]
Several common themes in decoration span across all types of vessel forms, from hu to pan, and guang to jia.  Arguably, the most frequent, though also the most intriguing and mysterious{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}, form of décor is the two eyed motif, often referred to as the [[taotie]].  This motif can range from something as simple as two protruding half spheres in an otherwise featureless plane, to highly detailed, mask-like faces with various animal features such as snouts, fangs and horns.  In ding vessels, these taotie faces most often appear on the bowl or cauldron portion of the body, but they can also appear on the legs of the vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decoration also tends to be used to fill in the background of most vessels, sometimes across the entire body of a vessel, but in other instances only a single band of décor is used.  In these backgrounds, whirl or thunder pattern, a low relief spiral design, is used to fill the space and create a texture across the surface of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=102–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later centuries, fully formed, three-dimensional animal figures, such as cows, goats, birds, dragons, and lions, were occasionally included on bronze vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these animals were purely decorative, while others also had a functional purpose.  In one example, the lid of a Li Ding has three lions lying in relaxed positions, holding rings in their mouths; these rings could have been used to lift the lid off of the vessel when it was hot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delbanco|first=Dawn Ho|title=Art From Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections|year=1983|publisher=The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-916724-54-9|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final type of decoration, used in most types of vessels, is the inscription.  Inscriptions could be used to identify owner, function, they could be poems or even tell stories. In one example, the Shi Wang Ding, the inscription is used to tell the story of why the ding was created, as well as make a wish for the lineage of the family who owned it.  The Grand Captain's young son Captain Wang says:
"Illustriously august deceased-father Duke Jiu was beautifully capable of making accordant his heart and making wise his virtue, with which he served the past kings, and gained purity without flaw. Wang for the first time has gone on to emulate his august deceased-father,  respectfully morning and night taking out and bringing in the king's commands,  not daring not to follow through or to manage. Because of this, the king has not forgotten the sagely man's descendant,  and has greatly praised his accomplishments and awarded him beneficence.  Wang dares in response to extol the Son of Heaven's
illustriously fine beneficence,  herewith making for my august deceased-father Duke Jiu this offertory caldron; may Captain Wang for ten thousand years have sons' sons and grandsons' grandsons eternally to treasure and use it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=Jay|title=Shi Wang Ding|journal=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies|year=2006|volume=32|series=Notable Acquisitions at The Art Institute of Chicago|issue=1|pages=30–31, 95|jstor=4104493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
One of the many types of bronze vessels, the ding vessel had its origins in standard ceramic vessels with the shape of a tripod.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze ding vessel from Panlongcheng, Huangpi, Hubei, for example, inherits its shape from Neolithic pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous ancient dings were the legendary [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]]. This set of bronze vessels is said to have been cast by [[Yu the Great|King Yu]] of the [[Xia Dynasty]] when he divided his territory into the ''Jiuzhou'' or [[Nine Provinces (China)|Nine Provinces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/china/art/tch_brnz.htm Art: The Great Bronze Age of China&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224112212/http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/china/art/tch_brnz.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Ding+nine+cauldrons|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, possession of all nine was considered a sign of rightful authority over [[All Under Heaven|all]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ding.org.cn/news.php?id=453 "A Brief Introduction of the Campaign of Awarding"], 2006-7-6&lt;/ref&gt; The whereabouts of the nine ding are presently unknown, but are said to have been lost during the [[Early Imperial China|imperial]] [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-206&amp;thinsp;{{sc|BCE}}), after having been passed among various royal dynasties and feudal states.&lt;ref name=botgen/&gt;

Ding vessels were used throughout the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties and later time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Round, tripod ding vessels are emblematic of the Shang and [[Western Zhou|Western]] and [[Eastern Zhou]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoneng Yang, ed., ''The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology: Celebrated Discoveries from the People's Republic of China'' (Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art, 1999), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Zhou ding vessels departed from the Shang aesthetic in terms of their oddly-proportioned legs that were deliberately emphasized through the addition of flanged [[taotie]] motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Ho Delbanco, ''Art from Ritual: Ancient Chinese Bronze Vessels from the Arthur M. Sackler Collections'' (Cambridge and Washington D.C.: Fogg Museum and Sackler Foundation, 1983), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of their significance throughout history, bronze vessels came to assume a more political role in later dynasties than in the Shang period.&lt;ref name="Jessica Rawson 1987"&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions cast on Western Zhou ding vessels, for example, commemorate political events and record gifts between monarchs and subjects.&lt;ref name="Jessica Rawson 1987"/&gt;  The [[Da Ke ding]] records a royal award to Ke of royal estate, which is seen as evidence of the breaking up of the estates of old families and their distribution to new families in the transition between different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 328.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lidded Ritual Food Cauldron (Ding) with Interlaced Dragons LACMA M.74.103a-b (2 of 5).jpg|thumb|left|[[Shanxi province]], ancient state of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], Middle [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]], late Spring and Autumn or early Warring States period, about 500-450 BC]]

In Late Western Zhou, sets of ding and [[Gui (vessel)|gui]] were used to indicate rank; a feudal lord would be entitled to nine ding and six gui, while lesser officials were entitled to a smaller number of vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, late Zhou bronzes were often very large, suggesting corresponding wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Eastern Zhou bronzes descended directly from those of Western Zhou.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In later times, in the middle [[Warring States period]], the three-legged ding would be one of the most popular ceramic forms imitating bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sullivan, ''The Arts of China'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western China in an area controlled by Qin, small, shallow tripod ding vessels were produced. &lt;ref&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 85.&lt;/ref&gt; For these vessels, groups of ceramic and bronze vessels buried together reveal that Western Zhou vessel types continued to exist over different time periods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jessica Rawson, ''Chinese Bronzes: Art and Ritual'' (London: British Museum, 1987), 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Tombs at Baoji and Hu Xian, for example, contain sets of ding among others that are shallow and with [[cabriole leg]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The role of ding vessels in the Zhou period continued, as Qin cemeteries contained ding vessels that expressed rank.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Loewe and Edward L. Shaughnessy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

Food vessels such as fu, gui, and [[Dui (vessel)|dui]] that were popular in Zhou times disappeared by the [[Han Dynasty|Han dynasty]], during which the ding, zhong, [[Hu (vessel)|hu]], and fang were the main vessel types used.&lt;ref&gt;Zongshu Wang, ''Han Civilization'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western and Eastern Han, the ding was one of the most common bronze-derived shapes in pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Zongshu Wang, ''Han Civilization'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the architecture of the [[Shanghai Museum]] is intended to resemble a bronze ding.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DooroftheDeadatStPeters.jpg|thumb|The Door of the Dead at Saint Peter's basilica.]] --&gt;
'''The Door of the Dead''', also known as the '''Door of Death''', is a [[bronze]] door sculpted by [[Giacomo Manzù]] between 1961 and 1964 by commission of [[Pope John XXIII]]. The door is located on the leftmost side of the [[narthex]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], in the [[Vatican City]], and leads to the interior of the basilica. It is called the ''Door of the Dead'' because it was traditionally used as an exit for funeral processions.&lt;ref name=Door1&gt;{{cite web|title=Door of Death|url=http://stpetersbasilica.info/Interior/DoorofDeath/DoorofDeath.htm|publisher=stpetersbasilica.info|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The door is composed of ten panels which depict the [[Christianity|Christian]] meaning of [[death]]. The panels are arranged in five rows and two columns. The top half of the door depicts the deaths of [[Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]], spread across two panels. The two central panels show a vine branch and wheat, which are shown as being turned into wine and bread in symbolic tribute to the [[Eucharist]]. The bottom panels depict the deaths of [[Abel]], [[Saint Joseph]], [[Saint Peter]], [[Pope John XXIII]], [[Saint Stephen]], [[Pope Gregory VII]], and two allusions to the [[personification of Death]]. Beneath these depictions are a row of six animals: a [[True thrush|blackbird]], a [[dormouse]], a [[hedgehog]], an [[owl]], a [[tortoise]] and a [[raven]]. The inside of the door shows the artist's dedication to Pope John XXIII&lt;ref name=Door1/&gt;, a portrayal of John XXIII receiving the bishops on the first day of the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stpetersbasilica.info/Docs/Basilica-Square2.htm#doors|title=The doors|publisher=St. Peter's - Guide to Basilica &amp; Square|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzù signed the work with the imprint of his right hand on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Selz|first=Peter|title=Giacomo Manzù and his portal for St Peter's|date=December 2001|work=[[Sculpture (magazine)|Sculpture]]|volume=v20|number=10|url=https://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag01/dec01.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The door is considered to be Manzù's most controversial work.{{fact|date=August 2014}} The corporeal depictions of death were considered disturbing by some Vatican officials, who preferred depictions of a more spiritual nature. Officials were also wary of Manzù's professed [[Communism|communist]] ideology and allusions to executions of [[Fascism|fascists]] in the panels of the door.&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=Giacomo Manzu Is Dead at 82; Prolific Sculptor of Varied Images|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/19/obituaries/giacomo-manzu-is-dead-at-82-prolific-sculptor-of-varied-images.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=17 November 2013|date=19 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these controversies, the door has remained in operation at the basilica.

The ED-Awards is different than other design awards schemes in the way that the jury comprises not of peers (designers), but of design journalists and critics – people who see and judge work for a living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/european-design-still-exploring Eye Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
Further more, since the ED-Awards organisation is made up of design magazines, it provides an opportunity for everyone submitting work, to have it featured in a number of these media. A lot of stories and articles are being created through the submitted work every year.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, #21 March 2012, {{ISSN|0976-1659}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jury==

The jury consists of fifteen representatives from high-profile European design magazines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeandesign.org/ed-awards/jury/ Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''experience model''' is a description of a typical user’s [[perception]] or [[understanding]] of how a system works. 

==Models==
Experience models are visually represented by abstract [[diagram]]s or [[metaphor]]s drawn from familiar objects, behaviors or systems. [[User interface]]s implement a variety of experience models to enable users to quickly grasp what is happening in the system, where the user is, and what the user can do next.

A [[software]] experience model may represent the relationship of one [[Software application|application]] to another, an application in relationship to various [[navigation]] mechanisms and other system or application components.

"'''Lauda Sion Salvatorem'''" is a [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] prescribed for the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] for the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]. It was written by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] around 1264, at the request of [[Pope Urban IV]] for the new Mass of this feast, along with ''[[Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium|Pange lingua]]'', ''[[Sacris solemniis]]'', ''[[Adoro te devote]]'', and ''[[Verbum supernum prodiens]]'', which are used in the Divine Office. 

==Overview==
The [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] melody of the "Lauda Sion" is borrowed from the eleventh-century sequence ''Laetabundi iubilemus'' attributed to [[Adam of Saint Victor]].

The hymn tells of the institution of the [[Eucharist]] and clearly expresses the belief of the Roman Catholic Church in [[transubstantiation]], that is, that the bread and wine truly become the Body and Blood of Christ when consecrated by a validly-ordained priest or bishop during the Mass. 

"Lauda Sion" is one of only four medieval Sequences which were preserved in the [[Tridentine Mass|''Missale Romanum'']] published in 1570 following the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563)—the others being [[Victimae paschali laudes]] (Easter), [[Veni Sancte Spiritus]] (Pentecost), and [[Dies Irae]] (Requiem Masses). (A fifth, [[Stabat Mater]], would later be added in 1727.) Before Trent, many feasts had their own sequences.&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley, ''Western Plainchant : A Handbook'' (OUP, 1993), II.22, pp.172-195&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lauda Sion" is still sung today, though its use is optional in the post-[[Vatican II]] [[Mass of Paul VI|Ordinary form]]. 

As with St. Thomas' other three Eucharistic hymns, the last few stanzas of the "Lauda Sion" are often used alone, in this case, to form the ''Ecce panis Angelorum''.

The '''[[lion]]''' is a common [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]. It traditionally symbolises [[courage]], [[nobility]], [[Royal family|royalty]], strength, stateliness and [[valour]], because historically it has been regarded as the "king of beasts".&lt;ref name="Garai73"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn = 0-671-21773-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lion refers also to a [[Judeo-Christian]] symbolism. The [[Lion of Judah]] stands in the [[Emblem of Jerusalem|coat of arms of Jerusalem]]. Similar looking lion can be found e.g. in the coat of arms of the Swedish royal [[House of Bjelbo]], from there in turn derived into the [[coat of arms of Finland]], formerly belonging to Sweden, and many others examples for similar historical reasons.

The animal designs in the [[heraldry]] of the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval period]] are a continuation of the [[animal style]] of the [[Viking Age]], ultimately derived from the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confronted animals|Symmetrically paired animals]] in particular find continuation from  [[Migration Period art]] via [[Insular art]] to [[Romanesque art]] and heraldry.

The animals of the "barbarian" ([[Eurasian nomads|Eurasian]]) predecessors of heraldic designs are likely to have been used as [[totemism|clan symbol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"They [animal style designs] have also been explained as totems venerated by the various clans of nomads as ancestors. Their transformation into clan symbols would have followed naturally and easily. The heraldic beasts of medieval chivalry, which include many deer and felines like those on the British royal coat of arms, may certainly be traces back to emblematic devices of later barbarian tribes from central Asia" Hugh Honour, John Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (2005), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT166  p. 166].&lt;/ref&gt;
Adopted in [[Germanic art|Germanic tradition]] around the [[Germanic Iron Age|5th century]],&lt;ref&gt;
Danuta Shanzer, Ralph W Mathisen, ''Romans, Barbarians, and the Transformation of the Roman World: Cultural Interaction and the Creation of Identity in Late Antiquity'',  (2013) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=1jNRbpoQOscC&amp;pg=PA322  p. 322].&lt;/ref&gt; they were re-interpreted in a  [[Germanic Christianity|Christian context]] in the western kingdoms of [[Francia|Gaul]] and [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Italy]] in the 6th and 7th centuries.  The characteristic of the lion as royal animal in particular is due the influence of [[the Physiologus]], an early Christian book about animal symbolism, originally written in Greek in the 2nd century and translated into Latin in about AD 400. 
It was a predecessor of the medieval [[bestiaries]].

The lion as a heraldic charge is present from the very earliest development of [[heraldry]] in the 12th century. One of the earliest known examples of armory as it subsequently came to be practiced can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated six golden lions rampant and wearing a blue helmet adorned with another lion. A  chronicle dated to c. 1175 states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier heraldic writers attributed the [[coat of arms of England|lions of England]] to [[William the Conqueror]], but the earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the lions of the [[List of coats of arms of the House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] (England and Normandy) coat of arms, 12th-century examples of lions used as heraldic charges include the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen (Hohenstaufen)]] and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] ([[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]) coats of arms, both 
deriving from  [[Henry the Lion]],  the [[royal coat of arms of Scotland]], attributed to [[William the Lion]],&lt;ref&gt;Hopingius, ''De Insigniis'' (1642) claimed that the use of the red lion as an emblem goes back to the [[Picts]]; cited in {{cite book|title=A System of Heraldry|author=Alexander Nisbet|volume=1|page=265|url=https://archive.org/stream/systemofheraldry01nisbuoft#page/266/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the [[coat of arms of Denmark]], first used by [[Canute VI of Denmark|Canute VI]], the [[coat of arms of Flanders]] ([[Duchy of Jülich|Jülich]]), first used by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip I]], the [[coat of arms of León]], an example of [[canting arms]]&lt;ref&gt;The actual etymology of ''[[Kingdom of León|León]] is ''[[Roman legion|Legion (Λεγίων)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Alfonso VII]] (1126), and the [[coat of arms of Bohemia]], first granted to [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Vladislaus II]].

Coats of arms of the 13th century include those of the [[House of Sverre]] ([[coat of arms of Norway]]), the [[Ludovingians]] (the [[coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]] used by [[Conrad of Thuringia]]), [[Henry V of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], the [[kingdom of Ruthenia]] ([[Coat of arms of Lviv|Volhynia]]), the [[House of Habsburg]] (the Habsburgs all but abandoned their original coat of arms after gaining the [[Duchy of Austria]] in the 1270s, but it remained in use in derived lineages such as the [[House of Kyburg]]), the [[Coat of arms of Bulgaria|kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] ([[Rubenids]]).

Unlike the [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]], which is comparatively rare in heraldry because it was reserved as an [[Reichsadler|imperial symbol]], the lion became a symbol of [[chivalry]] and was not restricted to royal coats of arms. The [[Zürich armorial]] (14th century) has a number of coats of arms with lions, most of them of [[ministeriales]] of the House of Habsburg.

The lion in the [[coat of arms of Bohemia]] is depicted with two tails (''à la queue fourchée''). 
According to [[Claude-François Ménestrier|Ménestrier]], this is due to a jest made by  [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick]], who granted  [[Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia]] a coat of arms with a lion ''coué'', that is, with its tail between its legs. Vladislaus' men refused to follow this emblem, calling it an ape, so that Frederick agreed to [[Augmentation of honour|improve]] the arms by giving the lion not just one but two erect tails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A System of Heraldry|author=Alexander Nisbet|volume=1|page=290|url=https://archive.org/stream/systemofheraldry01nisbuoft#page/290/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes==
As many ''[[attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]]'' (positions) now exist in heraldry as the heraldist's imagination can conjure, as a result of the ever-increasing need for differentiation, but very few of these were apparently known to medieval heralds.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies172&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; One distinction commonly made (especially among French heralds), although it may be of limited importance, is the distinction of lions in the walking positions as ''[[leopard (heraldry)|leopards]]''.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies172 /&gt; The following table summarizes the principal attitudes of heraldic lions:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Attitude
! Example
! Description
|-
|''Rampant''
| &lt;center&gt;[[File:Lion Rampant.svg|100px]]&lt;/center&gt;
| A "lion rampant" is depicted in profile standing erect with forepaws raised.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the hind legs varies according to local custom: the lion may stand on both hind legs, braced wide apart, or on only one, with the other also raised to strike; the word ''rampant'' is often omitted, especially in early blazon, as this is the most usual position of a carnivorous quadruped;
''Note:'' the term ''segreant'' denotes the same position, but is only used in reference to winged four-legged beasts like [[griffin]]s and [[European dragon|dragons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other terms are used to describe the lion's position in further detail. Each coat of arms has a right and left (i.e. ''dexter'' and ''sinister'') side - ''with respect to the person carrying the shield'' - so the left side of the shield as drawn on the page (thus the right side to the shield bearer) is called the dexter side. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, facing dexter (left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's ''whole body'' is turned to face right, he is ''to sinister'' or ''contourné''. If his ''whole body'' faces the viewer, he is ''affronté''. If his ''head only'' faces the viewer he is ''guardant'' or ''gardant'', and if he looks back over his shoulder he is ''regardant''. These adjectives follow any other adjectives of position.

A lion (or other beast) ''coward'' carries the tail between its hind legs.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tail also may be knotted (''nowed''), forked (''queue fourchée''), doubled (''double-queued''; as in the arms of the kingdom of Bohemia), or cut off (''defamed'').

Both lions and leopards may have been among the earliest beasts to appear in heraldry. ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'' notes that the earliest English treatise on heraldry, a late-13th or early-14th century [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] manuscript titled ''De Heraudrie'',&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock &amp; Robinson (1988), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the crow, eagle, griffin, heron, leopard, lion, martlet, popinjay, and swan.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock &amp; Robinson (1988), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Bado Aureo, the ''Oxford Guide'' further suggests that the leopard, said to be "borne of an adulterous union between a lioness and a [[pard (legendary creature)|pard]]," and like a [[mule]] incapable of reproducing, may be an appropriate charge for a person born of adultery or barred from reproducing (such as an [[abbot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock &amp; Robinson (1988), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, English heralds tend to identify ''lions'' as rampant (upright, in profile facing dexter), and ''leopards'' as passant guardant (walking, head turned to full face), but the heraldic distinction between lions and leopards is often ambiguous and in some cases may be controversial (as in the case of the [[royal arms of England]], discussed below). Part of the confusion arises from international differences in translation or in the defining characteristics of each, particularly in charges that show some characteristics of each.

English herald [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] asserted in 1909 that the ''leopard'', denoting a lion passant guardant, was a term of French origin that had "long since become obsolete in English armory. In French blazon, however, the old distinction is still observed." Fox-Davies continued, "[French heralds] term our lion passant a ''léopard-lionné'' and our lion rampant guardant is their ''lion-léopardé''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=Arthur Charles |year=1909 |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dutch heraldist [[Johannes Rietstap]], however, defined a ''Léopard lionné'' as a lion rampant guardant (i.e., upright like a lion with its head turned to full face like a leopard) and a ''Lion léopardé'' as a lion passant (i.e., walking like a leopard with its head facing dexter like a lion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rietstap |first=Johannes |year=1884 |title=Armorial Général |page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt; German-American heraldist [[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]] agrees with Rietstap's translations, in contrast to those of Fox-Davies as stated above.&lt;ref&gt;Volborth (1983), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

As if to clarify the situation, English heraldist Hugh Clark wrote in his ''Introduction to Heraldry'' (1829):
{{quote|The true heraldic lion, according to French authors, is always to be represented in profile, or, as the ancient heralds say, showing but one eye and one ear. His attitude, also, should always be rampant or ravaging. When passant and full-faced, they blazoned him a leopard, ''vide Lion Leopardé'': in England, however, the lions in the royal and other achievements have always been blazoned as lions, however depicted since the time of Henry III, in whose reign they were called "Leopards".

Lion Leopardé ... is a French term for what the English call a ''Lion passant gardant''. The word ''leopard'' is always made use of by the French heralds to express in their language, a lion full-faced, or ''gardant''. Thus, when a lion is placed on an escutcheon in that attitude which we call ''rampant gardant'', the French blazon it a ''Lion Leopardé''. When he is passant only, they call him ''leopard lioné''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Hugh |author2=J. R. Planché  |year=1866 |title=An Introduction to Heraldry |edition=18th |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

English heraldist Charles Boutell wrote in 1890 that the lions of England were generally termed ''leopards'' until the end of the 14th century, including in the roll of arms of [[Henry III of England]], and in a statute of [[Edward I of England]], dating to 1300, which made reference to "''signée de une teste de leopart''—marked with the King's lion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1978 |origyear=1890 |title=Boutell's Heraldry |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''English Heraldry'' (1867), Boutell explained:

{{quote|Only when he was in this rampant attitude did the early Heralds consider any Lion to be a Lion, and blazon him by his true name. A lion walking and looking about him, the early Heralds held to be acting the part of a leopard: consequently, when he was in any such attitude, they blazoned him as "a leopard". The animal bearing that name bore it simply as an heraldic title, which distinguished a Lion in a particular attitude. These heraldic "leopards" were drawn in every respect as other heraldic "lions", without spots or any leopardish distinction whatever. This explains the usage, retained until late in the 14th century, which assigned to the Lions of the Royal Shield of England the name of "leopards". They were so called, not by the enemies of England for derision and insult, as some persons, in their ignorance of early Heraldry, have been pleased both to imagine and to assert; but the English Kings and Princes, who well knew their "Lions" to be Lions, in blazon styled them "leopards", because they also knew that Lions in the attitude of their "Lions" were heraldic "leopards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutell |first=Charles |year=1867 |title=English Heraldry |pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (1976), German heraldist [[Ottfried Neubecker]] explained:

{{quote|When the blazon does not specifically mention a position, the lion may be assumed to be rampant. If he is in a different position, other terminology must be used, referring to the position of his head and limbs. An early heraldic convention found in medieval blazons uses the distinction between a lion and a leopard previously employed by the ancient Greeks. In antiquity, the lion, having a heavy mane, was generally shown in profile, while the leopard, having less hair, was shown looking towards the observer. A lion looking towards the observer therefore came to be given the name of the animal usually shown in that pose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning|last=Neubecker |first=Ottfried |year=1976 |location=Maidenhead, England |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=111–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Neubecker, what in [[Old French]] is termed a ''léopard'' is always ''guardant'' (head turned toward the observer), thus the modern English heraldic terms "lion passant guardant", "lion passant", and "lion rampant guardant" correlate to the Old French terms ''léopard'', ''lion léopardé'', and ''léopard lionné'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker (1976), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Improvisational theatre companies''', also known as '''improv troupes''' or '''improv groups''', are the primary practitioners of [[improvisational theater]]. Modern companies exist around the world and at a range of skill levels. Most groups make little or no money, while a few, well-established groups are profitable.

Although improvisational theater has existed in some form or another since the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gordon, ''Lazzi: The Comic Routines of the Commedia dell'Arte'' 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-933826-69-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern improv began with the teachings of [[Viola Spolin]] in Chicago, Illinois, USA and [[Keith Johnstone]] during the 1940-50s in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Improvisation for the Theater {{ISBN|0-8101-4008-X}} (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reddick, Grant. "Keith Johnstone," Theatre 100. Calgary: [[Alberta Playwrights Network]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Spolin's teachings led to the creation of [[The Compass Players]], the first modern improvisational theater company, in 1955. The presence of [[The Compass Players]], [[The Second City]], and [[ImprovOlympic]] in Chicago created a strength in the form within the city that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, David (September 3, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/03/arts/03impr.html "In Chicago, Honoring Athletes of Improv"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved January 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City, New York|New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[Toronto]] are other major hubs of improvisational theater in the [[North America]].

Many companies host [[List of improvisational theater festivals|improvisational theatre festivals]] or give improvisational theatre classes. Professional groups often perform a regular stage show acted by the most senior members. Along with this, they host "house" improv teams made up of improv students or graduates from their classes. In the past decade, professional improvisational theater groups have gradually started working more with corporate clients, using improvisational games to improve productivity and communication in the workplace.

'''Major Professional''' companies have branches in more than one city, have touring groups, and/or host large-scale improvisational comedy schools. '''Professional''' troupes are those not affiliated with a [[university]] or [[secondary school]]. '''Collegiate''' groups are those associated with a post-secondary educational institution. If a company performs more than one type of improvisational comedy, they are defined as using '''Multiple''' improvisational comedy types. If it is unclear what particular kind of improvisational comedy a group performs, they are defined as '''Improvisational'''. Those marked '''Semi-improvisational''' generally perform shows that are partially improvised and partially scripted.

The following is a '''list of noteworthy improvisational theatre companies'''&lt;ref group="nb" name="noteworthy"/&gt; from around the world.

Comic book superheroes and professional wrestling characters have long been viewed in the same vein of entertainment as colorful characters that are larger than life, and numerous wrestlers have appeared or been referenced in comic books.

[[Spider-Man]]'s first costumed appearance was the result of Peter Parker's need for a colorful gimmick, as he planned to enter and win a wrestling challenge.

==Comics in wrestling==
*"Arachnaman" (portrayed by [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]) appeared in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in the early 1990s wearing a costume resembling that of [[Spider-Man]]'s aside from its yellow coloration instead of red. His gimmick included shooting 'webs' upon his ring entrance.
*[[Steve Borden|Sting]] changed from a colorful flamboyant performer to a dark brooding figure after being falsely accused of betrayal in the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] storyline in late 1996. As a result, he adopted a black and white look and brooded in the rafters of the arenas, mimicking ''[[The Crow]]'' by [[James O'Barr]] in appearance to the point of actual birds appearing as well. [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] suggested the idea to Sting, knowing of the concept but not having seen or read any of the materials himself.
*[[Tiger Mask]] was originally a popular Japanese [[manga]] character; as a result, [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) decided to capitalize on this by employing the young [[Satoru Sayama]] to play the character as an actual wrestler. The resultant success led to the character being reassigned, following Sayama's retirement, to other wrestlers, namely the now high-profile [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] and [[Koji Kanemoto]]. The current incarnation is the fourth, played by [[Tiger Mask IV|Yoshihiro Yamazaki]].
*[[Gangrel (Old World of Darkness)|Gangrel]] was a [[vampire]] character from the White Wolf brand of comics and role-playing games. [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) employed a wrestler previously known as the [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Vampire Warrior]] (real name: David Heath) to play the character, as the leader of a cult-like faction called [[The Brood]], which also consisted of the wrestlers [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Jason Reso|Christian]].
*[[Gregory Helms]] wrestles as The Hurricane, a superhero gimmick with elements of [[Green Lantern|The Green Lantern]].

'''Lubna Agha''' (May 2, 1949 - May 6, 2012) was an American artist. She was of Pakistani descent and lived in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamicartsmagazine.com/magazine/view/in_memoriam_lubna_agha_artist_in_white/|title=In Memoriam: Lubna Agha – Artist in white| publisher= islamicartsmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her art invokes a dialogue between the modern-abstract and traditional forms and practices of Islamic paintings. Her work taps on visual images once a part of daily life but now a part of history—from places as geographically disparate as [[South Asia]] and [[North Africa]]. She painted mainly on canvas and wood, applying an infinite number of painted pixels and organic shapes that evoke [[mosaic]] tiling, intricate carvings, and ornate metalwork.

Her work has been exhibited in art museums and galleries in [[Pakistan]] and the [[United States]], as well as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], and [[Switzerland]].

Her paintings are part of the permanent collections at the Asian Collection at Bradford Museum, UK, National Council of the Arts, Pakistan, and the Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, Jordan.

The Karachi School of Arts dedicated an Art Gallery to her name. The Lubna Agha Art Gallery was inaugurated with a showing of her work and a memorial lecture in March, 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/1061918/remembering-lost-gems-ksa-honours-lubna-agha-by-launching-gallery-in-her-name/ Remembering Lost Gems – KSA Honours Lubna Agha by launching gallery in her name]&lt;/ref&gt;

A book about the artist by [[Marcella Nessom Sirhandi]] entitled ''Lubna Agha: Points of Reference'' was published by The Foundation of Museum of Modern Art, Pakistan in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fomma.info/stories_cs.php?id=33&amp;r=1 Lubna Agha: Points of Reference, The Foundation of Museum of Modern Art, Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721202447/http://www.fomma.info/stories_cs.php?id=33&amp;r=1 |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agha died of complications from [[gallbladder cancer]] at her home in Brookline, MA on May 6, 2012.

'''Lyricism''' is a quality that expresses deep feelings or emotions in an inspired work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = lyricism|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lyricism|website = Merriam Webster|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Lyricism is when art is expressed in a beautiful or imaginative way, or when it has an expressive quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=lyricism|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/lyricism|website=Oxford US English Language Dictionary|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term lyricism is often used in conjunction with art composed of sound alone, it can also apply to all forms of art including performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeFrantz|first1=Thomas F.|title=Dancing Revelations: Alvin Ailey's Embodiment of African American Culture|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=130|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Jean-Louis|title=Le Corbusier, 1887-1965: The Lyricism of Architecture in the Machine Age|date=2004|publisher=Taschen|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Steven|title=Derek Jarman and Lyric Film: The Mirror and the Sea|date=2004|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=12|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of lyricism ==
[[File:VanGogh-starry night edit.jpg|left|thumb|The Starry Night]]Although it is impossible to define beauty, emotion, or imagination in a definitive manner, it is possible to draw upon examples of works that may share those characteristics in both subtle and dramatic ways.  The following are some classic examples of lyricism:
*'''Poetry.''' Maya Angelou's poetry has intrinsic lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Maya Angelou's I Know why the Caged Bird Sings: A Casebook|last = Braxton|first = Joanne M.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Music.''' In Jazz, [[Charlie Parker]] is renowned for his lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Charlie Parker Companion: Six Decades of Commentary|last = Woideck|first = Carl|publisher = Schirmer Books|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Classical music, nearly all of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's]] work has been revered at one time or another for its lyricism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Perspectives on Mozart Performance|last = Todd|first = R. Larry|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Jane Austen and Mozart: Classical Equilibrium in Fiction and Music|last = Wallace|first = Robert K.|publisher = University of Georgia Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wolfgang Amadé Mozart|last = Georg Knepler,|first = J. Bradford Robinson|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Dance.''' [[Swan Lake|Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake]], or [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]] exhibit classic lyricism. 
*[[File:Colors Streaming, Winter Prayer Hall, Nasir-Ol-Molk Mosque, Shiraz (14288444120).jpg|thumb|Nasir ol Molk Mosque]]'''Film.''' ''Lost, Lost, Lost'' (1976) has been described as an example of the mid-20th century lyricism movement in film, as well as ''[[Dog Star Man|The Art of Vision]]'' (1965) and ''[[Fireworks (1947 film)|Fireworks]]'' (1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Film Experience: An Introduction|last = Timothy Corrigan|first = Patricia White|publisher = Macmillan|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 306}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Architecture'''. The [[Nasir ol Molk Mosque|Nasir ol-Molk Mosque]] may be seen as an example, as well as the [[Taj Mahal]], or the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Modern examples would be some of the later works of [[Le Corbusier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*'''Painting.''' [[The Starry Night]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]] can be considered the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of lyricism in the world of art.

'''''Panoramic view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam''''' is a 17th-century [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]. It is in the collection of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in [[Cambridge]].{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}}

The painting is catalogue number 10 in the 1911 catalogue raisonné by art historian [[Hofstede de Groot]]. He wrote "The river fills much of the right-hand side of the picture. In the centre is a road with several figures; on the river are a raft of timber and a small vessel, from which a gun is being fired. On the left are three windmills, houses, and a bleaching-ground. The town, with its many churches and public buildings, extends in the background. One may distinguish the Westerkerk, the town-hall, the Zuiderkerk, and Oude Kerk, as well as the great synagogue. The blockhouses are not shown."{{sfn|Hofstede de Groot|1911|p=10}} The painting is catalogue number 3 in [[Seymour Slive]]'s 2001 catalogue raisonné of Ruisdael.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}} It is object number 74 in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/explorer/index.php?qu=ruisdael&amp;oid=1895| title = Panoramic view on the Amstel looking towards Amsterdam|publisher = [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its dimensions are 52.1 cm x 66.1 cm. It is signed in the lower left.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}} Based on the presence of certain buildings Slive estimated that the undated painting was made between 1671 and 1681.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}} Ruisdael lived in Amsterdam at that time.

The drawing that served as a preliminary study for this painting, and a similar one that is in the Philips-de Jongh Collection, is at Leipzig.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}}

Tullou came to prominence as a member of the Breton artistic movement [[Seiz Breur]], and attempted to adapt his style to merge classical and Breton regional traditions. 

Like other members of the group, he was also involved in Breton nationalist politics. Following the split in the [[Breton Autonomist Party]], in 1934, Tullou, Gestalen, Francis Bayer du Kern, Goulven Mazéas and [[Morvan Marchal]] created the Breton Federalist Movement, which sought Breton federal autonomy within France. This was set up because of the creation of the extremist [[Breton National Party]], which had pro-Nazi sympathies. Nevertheless, during [[World War II]], he reported for [[L'Heure Bretonne]], the newspaper of the BNP.

In 1944, he became the last [[Secretary General]] of [[Seiz Breur]], following the resignation of [[René-Yves Creston]]. 

===Neo-druidism===
In the 1930s Tullou turned his attention towards [[Druidism|druidic]] studies. In 1936, he, Morvan Marchal, and Francis Bayer du Kern founded [[Kredenn Geltiek Hollvedel]] (Worldwide Celtic Beliefs), also known as ''Kevanvod Tud Donn'' and ''Dêua Ana''. In addition, he also founded a journal about druidic studies and philosophy called [[Kad (journal)|Kad]] (combat). During [[World War II]], the journal changed its name to become ''Nemeton'' (sanctuary). Today, it is known as ''Ialon-Kad-Nemeton''.

===Post-War===
In 1954, he founded Koun Breizh (Remember Bretons), to promote Breton artistic heritage and Breton administrative organizations. Through the movement he sought to commemorate Breton national heroes, and was responsible for the statue of [[Nominoë]], the first independent [[Duke of Brittany]], at [[Bains-sur-Oust]]. He also designed the commemorative plaque for the 18th century  Breton rebel [[Marquis de Pontcallec]] in the Place du Bouffay, in [[Nantes]].

In 1966, he created Skoed (The Shield) to be the official newspaper of Koun Breizh.

'''SCF Architects''', formerly '''Sierra Cardona Ferrer Arquitectos''', is a Puerto Rican [[architecture]], [[interior architecture]] and space planning firm.

SCF was established in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], in 1984. The firm's name is derived from the surnames of its three founding partners: Luis Sierra AIA, [[Segundo Cardona]] FAIA and Alberto Ferrer AIA, all former design professors at the School of Architecture of the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. 
Since its founding, the firm has completed more than 800 design projects in Puerto Rico and abroad. The projects, the firm and its partners have won many prestigious awards and recognitions, both locally and internationally. Among the most recent international awards received are the 2017 Public Space Award from the [[International Union of Architects]] (UIA), for the Paseo Puerta de Tierra promenade in San Juan, and two awards for the [[Salvation Army]]’s Ray &amp; Joan Kroc Community Center in Guayama, Puerto Rico: the 2014 Best Public Building Award from the [[International Union of Architects]] (UIA) and the IPC/IAKS (International Association for Sports and Leisure Facilities) Distinction for Accessibility. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uia-architectes.org/en/participer/concours/10736#.WoR8SKinFaQ|title=Winners of the 2017 Edition of the "UIA Friendly and Inclusive Spaces Awards" - INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ARCHITECTS|website=www.uia-architectes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rivera Marrero|first1=Mildred|title=Distinguen el Paseo Puerta de Tierra|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/distinguenelpaseopuertadetierra-2381060/|accessdate=14 February 2018|work=El Nuevo Día|publisher=El Nuevo Dia|date=10 December 2017|quote=Arquitecto Segundo Cardona destaca la importancia de la obra y la necesidad de que gobierno y ciudadanos la cuiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Sandra|title=Winners of the 2017 Edition of the "UIA Friendly and Inclusive Spaces Awards"|url=http://www.uia-architectes.org/en/participer/concours/10736#.WoRkN6inFaQ|website=UIA Architectes|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chapel of San Bartolomé''' ({{lang-es|Capilla de San Bartolomé}}) is a funerary chapel in the [[Historic centre of Córdoba|historic centre]] of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], Spain. It is dated between 1390 and 1410. Richly decorated, it is one of the city's finest examples of [[Mudéjar]] art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.turismodecordoba.org/agenda-evento.cfm?idnoticia=10111|title=The Chapel of San Bartolome opens to the public|publisher=Córdoba: ciudad de encuentro|accessdate=31 December 2013 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Located on the Calle Averroes in today's Faculty of Arts building, the relatively unknown chapel is one of the city's most notable monuments. With the development of the Alcázar Viejo district in 1391 and the later expulsion of the Jews from La Judería, the parish of San Bartolomé was established while a church of the same name was constructed between 1399 and 1410. The little building continued to operate as a parish church until the 17th century, possibly awaiting completion of a larger church. Restored in 1953 and 2006, the chapel is a fine example of ancient Mudéjar art.&lt;ref name=om&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artencordoba.com/OTROS-MONUMENTOS/Otros-Monumentos-Cordoba-Capilla-San-Bartolome.html|title=La Capilla de San Bartolomé|publisher=Otros Monumentos|accessdate=31 December 2013 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Rectangular in shape, the area is divided into two sections, one for the chapel itself, the other for a courtyard. Built of rusticated sandstone, the chapel has a rectangular floor measuring {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}. The [[chancel]] is slightly higher than the remainder of the building. There are two doors, one through a porch opening into a courtyard on Calle Averroes, the second, strangely locked from the outside, providing access into a side chapel which may have been connected to a [[sacristy]] in another building.&lt;ref name=om/&gt;

The entrance from the courtyard has a pointed arch with a few simple decorations while the other entrance, also pointed, has zigzag or sawtooth decorations. Two small columns bearing Islamic decorations with scrolls and leaves support the elegantly rib-vaulted ceiling. The interior walls are richly decorated with [[yeseria]] plasterwork and tiling while the floor is also decorated with alternating tiles. The wall decorations combine depictions of plants, geometric patterns and heraldry. The [[coats of arms]] belong to the [[Knights of the Band]], an order created by King [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]]. Inscriptions are in both [[Kufic]] and [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] scripts.&lt;ref name=om/&gt;

==Listing==
The chapel has been listed as a historic monument since 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordoba24.info/english/html/capilla_san_bartolome.html|title=Capilla de San Bartolomé (Saint Bartholomew Chapel)|publisher=Córdoba24|accessdate= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''style''' is a set of linguistic variants with specific [[social]] meanings. In this context, social meanings can include group membership, personal attributes, or beliefs. [[Variation (linguistics)|Linguistic variation]] is at the heart of the concept of linguistic style—without variation there is no basis for distinguishing social meanings. Variation can occur [[Syntax|syntactically]], [[Lexicon|lexically]], and [[Phonology|phonologically]].

Many approaches to interpreting and defining style incorporate the concepts of [[indexicality]], indexical order, stance-taking, and [[language ideology|linguistic ideology]]. Note that a style is not a fixed attribute of a speaker. Rather, a speaker may use different styles depending on context. Additionally, speakers often incorporate elements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or subconsciously, thereby creating a new style.

==Origins==
[[William Labov]] first introduced the concept of style in the context of sociolinguistics in the 1960s, though he did not explicitly define the term.&lt;ref name="Labov"&gt;Labov, W. (1966). The social stratification of English in New York City.[Washington]: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov primarily studied individual linguistic variables, and how they were associated with various social groups (e.g. social classes). He summed up his ideas about style in five principles:&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1984. "Field Methods of the Project in Linguistic Change and Variation." In John Baugh and Joel Sherzer, eds., Language in Use, Prentice-Hall: 28-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
;"There are no single style speakers." : [[#Style-shifting|Style-shifting]] occurs in all speakers to a different degree; interlocutors regularly and consistently change their linguistic forms according to context.
;"Styles can be ranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech." : Style-shifting correlates strongly with the amount of attention paid to speech. According to studies conducted by Labov, this was one of the single most important factors that determined whether or not an interlocutor would make a style-shift.
;"The vernacular, in which the minimum attention is paid to speech, provides the most systematic data for linguistic analysis." : Labov characterized the vernacular as the original base mode of speech, learned at a very young age, on which more complex styles build later in life. This "basic" style has the least variation, and provides the most general account of the style of a given group.
;"Any systematic observation of a speaker defines a formal context where more than the minimum attention is paid to speech." : In other words, even formal face-to-face interviews severely limit a speaker’s use of their vernacular style. An interlocutor’s vernacular style is most likely displayed if they do not perceive outside observers, and are not paying immediate attention to their own speech.
;"Face-to-face interviews are the only means of obtaining the volume and quality of recorded speech that is needed for quantitative analysis." : Quantitative analysis requires the kind of data that must be obtained in a very obvious, formal way.

Labov’s work primarily attempted to linked linguistic variants as a function of formality (a proxy for attention to speech) to specific social groups. In his study of /r/-variation in New York Department stores, he observed that those with a lower social class are less likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in words like ''fourth'' and ''floor'', while those with a higher social class are more likely to pronounce postvocalic [r] in their less careful speech. However, once forced to pay attention to language, they style-shift in a way indicative of their social aspirations. That is, those with a middle social class often alter their pronunciation of /r/ in a way that is generally indicative of a higher social standing, while those with a lower or higher social class more or less maintain their original pronunciation (presumably because they were either happy with their current position in the social hierarchy or resigned to it).&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William.. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern approaches==

===Indexical order===
[[Penelope Eckert|Penny Eckert's]]&lt;ref name="Eckert"&gt;Eckert, Penelope. Variation and the indexical field. Journal of Sociolinguistics, 2008, 12: 453–476.&lt;/ref&gt; characterization of style as related to indexicality marked the beginning of a new approach to linguistic style. She builds on [[Michael Silverstein|Michael Silverstein's]] notion of [[Indexicality|indexical]] order: the notion that linguistic variables index a social group, which by association leads to the indexing of certain traits stereotypically associated with members of that group.  For example, in New York in the 1960s, a study by Labov&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; showed that the clear articulation of postvocalic [r] in words like "fourth" and "floor" indexed a higher class (in New York), whereas the absence of postvocalic [r] indexed a lower class.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt; However, the presence of lack of postvocalic [r] can also function as a higher order indexical that points indirectly to traits stereotypically associated with members of the upper or lower class.  In this way, not articulating the [r] in the word "fourth" could index, for example, a lack of education (the trait) in addition to a lower social class (the group). According to this theory, any linguistic variable has its own indexical field spanning any number of potential meanings; the meanings actually associated with the variable are determined by social context and the style in which the variable is being used.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; These indexical fields are fluid and often change depending on their usage in different contexts or in combination with other variables. This view of style revolves around variation, and interpretation of variation as a purely indexical system built from [[Ideology|ideological]] connections.

===Ideology===
In [[Judith Irvine]]'s conception of style she emphasizes the fact that a style is defined only within a social framework.&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;[[Judith Irvine|Irvine, Judith]]. Style as distinctiveness: The culture and ideology of linguistic differentiation. In Penelope Eckert and John Rickford (eds.) Style and Sociolinguistic Variation. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2001, 21–43.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant and the social meanings it indexes are not inherently linked, rather, the social meanings exist as ideologically mediated interpretations made by members of the social framework. She highlights the fact that social meanings such as group membership mean nothing without an [[ideology]] to interpret them.

[[Mary Bucholtz|Mary Bucholtz's]] approach to style also relies heavily on ideology. She defines style as "a unidimensional continuum between vernacular and standard that varies based on the degree of speaker self-monitoring in a given speech context".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/~tylers/notes/emotion/Bucholtz_2009_reading_notes_Schnoebelen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This continuum depends on the ideology of the speaker, for they self-monitor depending on their ideologies concerning particular words. Bucholtz explains the ideology of gendered slang, in particular, the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] slang for "dude", guey. Guey indexes a stance of cool solidarity, and indirectly, [masculinity]. Ochs's framework for stance dictates that stances are ideologically connected with social groups. Bucholtz argues that ideology connects the stylistic feature of using guey with particular groups of people based on age, gender (male), and race. She also defines the concept of stylization as a set of deviations from the style one would expect from a situation according to the ideology of the style and how it matches up to the situation at hand. This leads to the [[indexicality|indexing]] of groups with which the style is associated, and thus simplifies the indexical field at hand.

===Stance-taking===
Other theories on style often incorporate the role of stance-taking. These theories maintain that style is best viewed as consisting of smaller, more variable units known as stances. In this view, a stance is essentially a form of contextualization; it indicates the position of an interlocutor with respect to a particular utterance, conversation or other interlocutors.&lt;ref name="Johnstone"&gt;Johnstone, Barbara. "Stance, Style, and the Linguistic Individual" Sociolinguistic Perspectives on Stance,. Ed. Alexandra Jaffe. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An interlocutor's use of language could imply, for instance,  that they feel a certain way about an issue at hand, or that they do not care for the subject, or the people around them; these positions with respect to the context are different stances.

According to stance theory, a given interlocutor uses certain variations among linguistic variables to take a stance or stances in an interaction. The set of stances interlocutors tend to repeat or use the most often in certain contexts (or in general) comprise their style. [[File:Stances.png|thumb|400px|Robert Podesva's depiction of the indexical relationships between linguistic resources, acts or activities, stance and style.]] This approach focuses more on interaction and reaction in a linguistic context, rather than a static identity or social group. Linguistic variables do not index specific social groups by themselves, but instead combine with other linguistic variables to index various stances and styles, which are in turn associated with social groups.&lt;ref name="Kiesling"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. A variable, a style, a stance: Word-final -er and ethnicity in Australian English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkham, Sam. 2011. Personal style and epistemic stance in classroom discussion. Language and Literature 20(3). 207-217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;  Kiesling writes:

{{cquote|In this view, personal styles are composed of a set, or repertoire, of stances, and a way of speaking represents not simply a personal style but a stance that a person tends to adopt repeatedly over time ... Because some stances are more favored by one group than another, this gives the appearance that a linguistic item directly indexes ...  that group, where in actuality it also, or primarily, indexes a stance … &lt;ref name=Kiesling/&gt;}}

In this model of linguistic variation, stances are an important middle step between linguistic variables and a style or characteristic social group.

==Emergence of new styles==

===Performative creation of new styles===
The [[Performativity|performative]] creation of style is the result of a desire to project a certain social image or [[#Style and stance|stance]]. [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|Interlocutors]] who wish to present in a certain manner may consciously alter their linguistic style to affect how they appear to others. An example of this performative style is exemplified by non-linguistic situations. In one study, Eckert interviewed several female students at [[Palo Alto High School]] in California. "New-wave" teens who wished to be distinctive adapted a more rebellious fashion style, wearing mostly dark clothes and pegged jeans, whereas popular, "[[preppy]]" girls tended towards light pastel colors and straight designer jeans.  However, a couple girls wished to portray themselves as unique without losing their popular [[Conformity|conformist]] [[Social identity theory|social identity]]. The table below compares resulting styles:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| eye makeup!! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| general color scheme !! scope="col" style="width:100px;"| pants
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "New-wave" girls|| dark/black || black || black, pegged
|-
| style="text-align:left;"|  "Preppy" girls|| light/none || pastels || blue designer straight-cut
|-
| style="text-align:left;"| "Preppy but unique" girls || light/none || pastels || blue, pegged
|}

As Eckert demonstrates, the "preppy" girls who wished to maintain a slightly distinctive style combined certain aspects of the "preppy" style with the "new-wave" style. They maintained their color choices and shied away from dark eye-makeup—but wore blue pegged jeans instead of the standard designer jeans of their group. This is because they perceive that the eye makeup indexes an "adult" or "slutty" characteristic, while the all-black color scheme is "scary".

In the same way, interlocutors often choose to performatively create their own linguistic style to suit the self-image they desire. In a [[#Gay styles|case study conducted by Podesva]], he studies the style of a gay lawyer, who combines certain aspects of common professional and gay linguistic features to create his own style, indexing both a "professional lawyer" characteristic and a unique "gay" characteristic with his speech.

===Nonperformative emergence of new styles===
Styles are not necessarily consciously created; there are a number of processes that contribute to the construction of meaning for both individual speech variants and styles. Obviously, individual variants can be adopted by multiple styles. When a variant is newly adopted by a style, it changes both the perception of the variant and the perception of the style. In the Eckertian view, a person's linguistic style identifies their position in an indexical field of social meanings. These social meanings are created by a continual analysis and interpretation of the linguistic variants that are observed based on who uses them.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irvine/&gt;

==Style-shifting==
Style shifting refers to a single speaker changing style in response to context. As noted by Eckert and Rickford,&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-59789-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eckert, Penelope |author2=Rickford, John |title=Style and sociolinguistic variation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-521-59789-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in sociolinguistic literature terms style and '''register''' sometimes have been used interchangeably. Also, various connotations of style are a subject of study in [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]].

Style-shifting is a manifestation of intraspeaker (within-speaker) variation, in contrast with interspeaker (between-speakers) variation. It is a voluntary act which an individual effects in order to respond to or initiate changes in sociolinguistic situation (e.g., interlocutor-related, setting-related, topic-related).

[[William Labov]], while conducting [[Sociolinguistics#Traditional sociolinguistic interview|sociolinguistic interviews]], designated two types of spoken style, casual and formal, and three types of reading style (a reading passage, a word list, and a [[minimal pair]] list). Analysing style-shifting Labov postulated that "styles can be arranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech" (1972, as quoted in&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Milroy, Lesley |author2=Gordon, John |title=Sociolinguistics: Method and Interpretation |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-631-22225-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), casual style requiring the least amount of conscious self-monitoring. Such style-shifting is often referred to as responsive (produced in response to normative pressures).&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22225-1"/&gt;

In recent developments of stylistic variation analysis scholars such as [[Allan Bell (Sociolinguist)|Allan Bell]], [[Barbara Johnstone]], Natalie Schilling-Estes have been focusing on initiative dimension of style-shifting, which occurs when speakers proactively choose among various linguistic resources (e.g. dialectal, archaic or [[vernacular]] forms) in order to present themselves in a specific way. In initiative style-shifting speakers actively engage in  social practices to construct social meaning.

There have been a large number of suggested motivations for this phenomenon:
;Attention to speech model : In the attention to speech model it is proposed that the style a speaker uses is dependent on how much attention the speaker is paying to their own speech, which in turn is dependent on the formality of the situation.&lt;ref name="Labov1972a"&gt;Labov, William. Sociolinguistic patterns. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labov1972b"&gt;Labov, William.. Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society,1972, 1.97-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, each speaker has one most natural style, which is defined as the style the speaker uses when paying the least attention (i.e. in the most casual situations). Criticisms of this model include that it is difficult to quantify attention paid to speech&lt;ref name="Kies"&gt;Kiesling, Scott Fabius. 1998. Men’s identities and sociolinguistic variation: The case of fraternity men. Journal of Sociolinguistics 2/1.69-99&lt;/ref&gt; and the model suggests that a speaker has only one style for a given level of formality.&lt;ref name="Hindle"&gt;Hindle, D. The social and situational conditioning of phonetic variation. Dissertation. University of Pennsylvania, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Communication accommodation theory : Communication accommodation theory (CAT) seeks to explain style-shifting in terms of two processes: convergence, in which the speaker attempts to shift their speech to match that of the interlocuter to gain social approval, and divergence, in which the speaker attempts to distance themselves from the interlocuter by shifting their speech away from that of the interlocuter.&lt;ref name="Schilling-Este"&gt;Kiesling, S. F., and Schilling-Estes, N. Language Style as Identity Construction: A Footing and Framing Approach. Poster presented at NWAVE 27, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Two specific shortcomings of this basic form of CAT include its inability to explain situations in which convergence occurs when the motivation is clearly not social approval (e.g. in arguments)&lt;ref&gt;Mosher, D., Mortimer, L., Grebel, M. Verbal aggressive behavior in delinquent boys. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 1968 73.454-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., and Kendon, A. The experimental analysis of social performance. Advances in experimental social psychology, Berkowitz, L. (ed.), 1967 vol. 3, 55-98. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that non-convergent speech is often used to maintain social distance in asymmetric relationships (e.g. employer-employee).&lt;ref&gt;Montepare, J. M., and Vega, C. Women’s vocal reactions to intimate and casual male friends. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 1988 14.103-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Audience design model : The audience design model is very similar to communication accommodation theory with an added component: the audience design model proposes the existence of nonpresent reference groups, with which a speaker may converge or diverge.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, Allan. Language style as audience design. Language in Society, 1984 13.145-204.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speakers constantly negotiating their relationship, not only with the audience, but also with other nonpresent people or groups that come up in the discourse.&lt;ref name=Schilling-Este/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BellJohnson"&gt;Bell, Allan, and Johnson, Gary. Towards a sociolinguistics of style. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.1: A Selection of Papers from NWAVE, 1997, 25. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Style-shifting as an act of identity: Style shifting can be a creative process, in which speakers shape their speech to associate or disassociate themselves with specific social groups. Furthermore, a speaker does not have an underlying style. Rather, the casual speech style that some sociolinguists consider fundamental is no more fundamental than any other style.&lt;ref name="LePage"&gt;LePage, R.B., and Andrée Tabouret-Keller. Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press,1985&lt;/ref&gt;
;Footing and framing model : A footing is a role that a speaker occupies and may be described as follows:{{Quote| &lt;br&gt;"[footings] may change many times during the course of a single interaction, and speakers often balance a number of roles simultaneously, since footing exist on a number of different levels, from the personal interactional (e.g. the role of `friend') to the institutional (e.g. `CEO of a corporation') to the sociocultural (e.g. `Native American male')."&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;}}By style shifting speakers are able to cast themselves in different footings. Also central to this model is the frame of the discourse, which is the feeling of the interactants about what kind of interaction is occurring (e.g. formal interview, casual conversation, political discussion, etc.). Different frames are being continuously foregrounded and backgrounded relative to one another throughout the discourse. The footings that speakers adopt through style-shifting are dependent on which frames are most prominent at any given time.&lt;ref name=Kies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving, Forms of talk. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style matching==
Style matching is defined as the matching of behaviors between a speaker and an [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]].&lt;ref name="N"&gt;Niederhoffer, Kate G. Pennebaker, James W. Linguistic Style Matching in Social Interaction. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, Vol.21No.4,December 2002. 337-360 {{doi|10.1177/026192702237953}} 2002 Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  The premise of the theory is that individuals have the ability to strategically negotiate the social distance between themselves and their interaction partners.  This can be done linguistically, [[paralinguistic]]ally, and non-verbally, for example, by varying speech style, rate, pitch, and [[gaze]].

One theory behind linguistic style matching suggests that the words one speaker uses prime the listener to respond in a specific way. In this fashion, an interlocutor is influenced by her partner’s language at the word level in natural conversation in the same way that one’s non-verbal behavior can be influenced by another’s movement.

Additionally, Kate G. Niederhoffer&lt;ref name=N/&gt; proposes a coordination-engagement hypothesis, which suggests that the degree of engagement should be predictive of both linguistic and nonverbal coordination. There exists an interactional complexity whereby people can converge on some communicative features to meet social needs, but diverge on others for identity management. For example, one can diverge in accent but converge in [[lexical diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Janet M. Fuller (1996). When cultural maintenance means linguistic convergence: Pennsylvania German evidence for the Matrix Language Turnover hypothesis. Language in Society, 25 , pp 493-514 {{doi|10.1017/S0047404500020790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals in two-person interactions exhibit linguistic style matching on both the conversational level and on a turn-by-turn level.&lt;ref name=N/&gt; This coordinated use of language occurs at a remarkably basic level (e.g., classes of words) and appears to occur independently of the perceived quality of an interaction, the length of the interaction, whether the interaction is face-to-face or on an Internet-like chat, etc.  Socially, two people appear to fall into this coordinated way of interacting almost immediately even if they have never spoken to one another before. The listener is influenced by many linguistic primes set up by the speaker. All of this occurs on an unconscious level and is sensitive to the power differential between the participants, with less dominant participants generally being more attentive to more dominant participants’ words.

==Case studies==

===Urban styles===
An opposition between urban and suburban linguistic variables is common to all metropolitan regions of the United States. Although the particular variables distinguishing urban and suburban styles may differ from place to place, the trend is for urban styles to lead in the use of nonstandard forms and [[negative concord]].
In Penny Eckert’s study of Belten High in the Detroit suburbs, she noted a stylistic difference between two groups that she identified: school-oriented jocks and urban-oriented, school-alienated burnouts.&lt;ref name=Eckert/&gt; The variables she analyzed were the usage of negative concord and the mid and low vowels involved in the [[Northern Cities Shift]], which consists of the following changes: æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, ə &gt; a, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ  ([y] here is equivalent to the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol [j]). All of these changes are urban-led, as is the use of negative concord.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Burnouts.PNG|thumb|400px|alt=burnouts diagram|Use of Detroit variables involved in the Northern Cities Shift (NCS) by gender and social category. Black = greatest use, gray = second greatest use.]] --&gt;The older, mostly stabilized changes, æ &gt; ea, a &gt; æ, and ə &gt; a, were used the most by women, while the newer changes, ʌ &gt; ə, ay &gt; oy, and ɛ &gt; ʌ were used the most by burnouts. Eckert theorizes that by using an urban variant such as [foyt], they were not associating themselves with urban youth. Rather, they were trying to [[indexicality|index]] traits that were associated with urban youth, such as "tough" and "street-smart".

This theory is further supported by evidence from a subgroup within the burnout girls, which Eckert refers to as ‘burned-out’ burnout girls. She characterizes this group as being even more anti-establishment than the ‘regular’ burnout girls. This subgroup led overall in the use of negative concord as well as in female-led changes. This is unusual because negative concord is generally used the most by males. ‘Burned-out’ burnout girls were not indexing masculinity &amp;mdash; this is shown by their use of female-led variants and the fact that they were found to express femininity in non-linguistic ways. This shows that linguistic variables may have different meanings in the context of different styles.

===Gay styles===

There is some debate about what makes a style "gay." In stereotypically flamboyant gay speech, the phonemes /s/ and /l/ have a greater duration.&lt;ref name="Christ"&gt;Crist, Sean. 1997. Duration of Onset Consonants in Gay Male Stereotyped Speech. University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics 4.3.53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; People are also more likely to identify those with higher frequency ranges as gay.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;Rogers, Henry, Ron Smyth, and Greg Jacobs. 2000. Vowel and Sibilant Duration in Gay- and Straight-sounding Male Speech. Paper presented at the International Gender and Language Association Conference 1, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are many different styles represented within the gay community. There is much linguistic [[variation (linguistics)|variation]] in the gay community, and each subculture appears to have its own distinct [[feature (linguistics)|features]]. According to Podesva et al., "gay culture encompasses reified categories such as leather daddies, clones, drag queens, circuit boys, guppies (gay yuppies), gay prostitutes, and activists both mainstream and radical, as well as more local communities of practice which may not even have names."&lt;ref name="Podesva"&gt;Podesva, Robert J., Sarah J. Roberts and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler. 2002. Sharing resources and indexing meanings in the production of gay styles. In Kathryn Campbell-Kibler, Robert J. Podesva, Sarah J. Roberts and Andrew Wong (eds.) Language and Sexuality: Contesting Meaning in Theory and Practice. Stanford , California : CSLI Press. 175–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, each of these sub-cultures speaks with a different style than all the other sub-cultures.

There are also many features that are fairly prevalent in all of society but can index homosexuality in particular contexts. "Cooperative discourse" is often considered a feature of gay linguistic style, but is also used by some straight men, as well as by women.&lt;ref&gt;Leap, William L. 1996. Word’s Out: Gay Men’s English. Minneapolis: University of
Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with an approach to style that emphasizes stance.

Podesva et al.&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt; performed a study describing a sub-style within gay culture that some gay activists, lawyers, or other professionals use. The gay lawyer in their study does not want to appear "too gay," lest he also convey frivolity or other characteristics that he deemed unprofessional. It was important to him that he appear rational, educated, and competent as a lawyer. This is in line with the audience approach to style in which styles receive their meaning as a result of their opposition to other styles in their social sphere (in this case other gay styles). The lawyer's high release of word final stops, a variable also often found in the language of geek-girls and Orthodox Jews, indexes a desire to appear educated and not "too gay."  This actually indexes his gay [[identity (social science)|identity]] because he is tailoring his gay style (or lack thereof).&lt;ref name=Podesva/&gt;

The '''Terracotta Army''' is a collection of [[terracotta]] sculptures depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]]. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.

The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=TL dating of pottery sherds and baked soil from the Xian Terracotta Army Site, Shaanxi Province, China |author=Lu Yanchou, Zhang Jingzhao, Xie Jun |journal= International Journal of Radiation Applications and Instrumentation.

== History ==
[[File:秦始皇帝陵.JPG|thumb|right|The mound where the tomb is located]]
The construction of the tomb was described by historian [[Sima Qian]] (145{{ndash}}90 BCE) in his most noted work ''[[Shiji]]'', written a century after the mausoleum's completion.  Work on the mausoleum began in 246 BCE soon after Emperor Qin (then aged 13) ascended the throne, and the project eventually involved 700,000 workers.&lt;ref name="chinesetext"/&gt; Geographer [[Li Daoyuan]], writing six centuries after the First Emperor's death, recorded in ''[[Shui Jing Zhu]]'' that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology, "famed for its jade mines, its northern side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the First Emperor, covetous of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there".{{sfn|Clements|2007|p = 158}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B4%E7%B6%93%E6%B3%A8/19 Shui Jing Zhu Chapter 19] 《水经注·渭水》'''Original text:''' 秦始皇大兴厚葬，营建冢圹于骊戎之山，一名蓝田，其阴多金，其阳多美玉，始皇贪其美名，因而葬焉。&lt;/ref&gt; Sima Qian wrote that the First Emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artifacts and wondrous objects. According to this account, 100 flowing rivers were simulated using mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to "models" or "imitations"; however, those words were not used in the original text, which makes no mention of the terracotta army.&lt;ref name="chinesetext"&gt;[http://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?filter=d270 Sima Qian –  Shiji Volume 6] 《史记·秦始皇本纪》 '''Original text:''' {{lang|zh-hans|始皇初即位，穿治郦山，及并天下，天下徒送诣七十余万人，穿三泉，下铜而致椁，宫观百官奇器珍怪徙臧满之。令匠作机驽矢，有所穿近者辄射之。以水银为百川江河大海，机相灌输，上具天文，下具地理。以人鱼膏为烛，度不灭者久之。二世曰："先帝后宫非有子者，出焉不宜。" 皆令从死，死者甚众。葬既已下，或言工匠为机，臧皆知之，臧重即泄。大事毕，已臧，闭中羡，下外羡门，尽闭工匠臧者，无复出者。树草木以象山。}} '''Translation:'''  When the First Emperor ascended the throne, the digging and preparation at Mount Li began. After he unified his empire, 700,000 men were sent there from all over his empire. They dug down deep to underground springs, pouring copper to place the outer casing of the coffin. Palaces and viewing towers housing a hundred officials were built and filled with treasures and rare artifacts. Workmen were instructed to make automatic crossbows primed to shoot at intruders. Mercury was used to simulate the hundred rivers, the Yangtze and Yellow River, and the great sea, and set to flow mechanically. Above, the heaven is depicted, below, the geographical features of the land. Candles were made of "mermaid"'s fat which is calculated to burn and not extinguish for a long time. The Second Emperor said: "It is inappropriate for the wives of the late emperor who have no sons to be free", ordered that they should accompany the dead, and a great many died. After the burial, it was suggested that it would be a serious breach if the craftsmen who constructed the tomb and knew of its treasure were to divulge those secrets.  Therefore, after the funeral ceremonies had completed, the inner passages and doorways were blocked, and the exit sealed, immediately trapping the workers and craftsmen inside. None could escape. Trees and vegetation were then planted on the tomb mound such that it resembled a hill.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=17}} High levels of mercury were found in the soil of the tomb mound, giving credence to Sima Qian's account.{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=202}} Later historical accounts suggested that the tomb had been looted by [[Xiang Yu]], a contender for the throne after the death of the first emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B4%E7%B6%93%E6%B3%A8/19 Shui Jing Zhu Chapter 19] 《水经注·渭水》 '''Original text:''' 项羽入关，发之，以三十万人，三十日运物不能穷。关东盗贼，销椁取铜。牧人寻羊，烧之，火延九十日，不能灭。'''Translation:''' Xiang Yu entered the gate, sent forth 300,000 men, but they could not finish carrying away his loot in 30 days.

The Terracotta Army is part of a much larger [[necropolis]].  Ground-penetrating radar and core sampling have measured the area to be approximately 98 square kilometers (38 square miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/china-first-emperor-terra-cotta-warriors-tomb/?sf38672445=1|title=Discoveries May Rewrite History of China's Terra-Cotta Warriors|date=12 October 2016|access-date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necropolis was constructed as a microcosm of the emperor's imperial palace or compound, and covers a large area around the tomb mound of the first emperor. The earthen tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li and built in a [[Chinese pyramids|pyramidal]] shape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=73号 Qin Ling Bei Lu |url=http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=34.38130,+109.25365&amp;aq=&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=14.588871,37.265625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=34.381864,109.254398&amp;spn=0.004967,0.009098&amp;z=16 |title=Google maps |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is surrounded by two solidly built [[rammed earth]] walls with gateway entrances. The necropolis consists of several offices, halls, stables, other structures as well as an imperial park placed around the tomb mound.

The warriors stand guard to the east of the tomb. Up to {{convert|5|m}} of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the two millennia following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the excavations near the Mount Li burial mound, archaeologists found several graves dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments. These were discarded as worthless and used along with soil to back fill the excavations.{{sfn|Clements|2007|p=160}}

=== Tomb ===
{{main article|Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor}}

The tomb appears to be a hermetically sealed space roughly the size of a football pitch (c. 100 × 75 m).&lt;ref name="channel4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/firstemperor4a.html |title=The First Emperor |publisher=Channel4.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:DP-039QAig8J:ftp://124.42.15.59/ck/2011-01/165/096/062/464/On%2520the%2520Prediction%2520of%2520Heat%2520Transfer%2520Across%2520Turbulent%2520Liquid%2520Films.pdf+3d+reconstruction+of+underground+palace+of+qin+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg0Uyt9EYlzOcxA4XPYGfq7TW0LnYcEIcuIYTgZmhVOmZ8iZAf5H9R-1IJN0SrEck4vRM60ZDAv0XbQ4dbqoASdO7bbLhZzYEGTKa607_9Sh6bCIFkEX_pirIG1BthOknVjKOe0&amp;sig=AHIEtbQA1PhVFoMbOjCMjxcO_CUt_rYkDg |title=Application of geographical methods to explore the underground palace of the Emperor Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb remains unopened, possibly due to concerns over preservation of its artifacts.&lt;ref name="channel4"/&gt; For example, after the excavation of the Terracotta Army, the painted surface present on some terracotta figures began to flake and fade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2003/031127/full/news031124-7.html |title=Terracotta Army saved from crack up |journal=News@nature |accessdate=3 December 2011|doi=10.1038/news031124-7 |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lacquer covering the paint can curl in fifteen seconds once exposed to Xi'an's dry air and can flake off in just four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Larmer, Brook.

The soldiers within were laid out as if to protect the tomb from the east, where the Qin Emperor's conquered states lay.

====Pit 1====
Pit 1, which is {{convert|230|m}} long and {{convert|62|m}} wide,&lt;ref name="Lothar"&gt;{{harvnb|Ledderose|1998|pp=51–73}} [https://www.scribd.com/doc/6694321/LedderoseA-Magic-Army-for-the-Emperor A Magic Army for the Emperor]&lt;/ref&gt; contains the main army of more than 6,000 figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/kuaixun/74862.htm |title=The Mausoleum of the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty and Terracotta Warriors and Horses |publisher=China.org.cn |date=12 September 2003 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pit 1 has eleven corridors, most more than {{convert|3|m|round=5}} wide and paved with small bricks with a wooden ceiling supported by large beams and posts. This design was also used for the tombs of nobles and would have resembled palace hallways when built. The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more [[soil]] raising them about {{convert|2|to|3|m}} above the surrounding ground level when completed.{{sfn|Portal|2007}}

==== Others ====

Pit 2 has cavalry and infantry units as well as [[Chariot (China)|war chariots]] and is thought to represent a military guard. Pit 3 is the command post, with high-ranking officers and a war chariot. Pit 4 is empty, perhaps left unfinished by its builders.

Some of the figures in Pits 1 and 2 show fire damage, while remains of burnt ceiling rafters have also been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8676886.stm |title=China unearths 114 new Terracotta Warriors |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, together with the missing weapons, have been taken as evidence of the reported looting by Xiang Yu and the subsequent burning of the site, which is thought to have caused the roof to collapse and crush the army figures below. The terracotta figures currently on display have been restored from the fragments.

Other pits that formed the necropolis have also been excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/xian/terracotta/pits.htm |title=Terracotta Accessory Pits |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pits lie within and outside the walls surrounding the tomb mound. They variously contain bronze carriages, terracotta figures of entertainers such as acrobats and strongmen, officials, stone armour suits, burial sites of horses, rare animals and labourers, as well as bronze cranes and ducks set in an underground park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/daminggong/2010-05/13/content_9845517_3.htm |title=Decoding the Mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shihuang |work=China Daily  |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Warrior figures ==

===Types and appearance===

[[File:I was impressed with the life-like expression (35300697030).jpg|thumb|left|A terracotta soldier]]
The terracotta figures are life-sized. They vary in height, uniform, and hairstyle in accordance with rank. Their faces appear to be different for each individual figure; scholars, however, have identified 10 basic face shapes.&lt;ref name="national geographic"&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TrPmZXt-wIEC|page=27}} |title =The Terra Cotta Warriors |work=National Geographic Museum |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are of these general types: armored warriors; unarmored [[infantrymen]]; [[cavalrymen]] who wear a pillbox hat; helmeted drivers of chariots with more armor protection; spear-carrying charioteers; kneeling archers who are armored; standing archers who are not; as well as generals and other lower-ranking officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=110}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=105–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, many variations in the uniforms within the ranks: for example, some may wear shin pads while others not; they may wear either long or short trousers, some of which may be padded; and their body armors vary depending on rank, function, and position in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=103}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=103–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also terracotta horses placed among the warrior figures.

[[File:Recreated colored terracotta warriors.jpg|thumb|Recreated figures of an archer and an officer, showing how they would have looked when painted]]

Originally, the figures were painted with bright pigments, variously coloured pink, red, green, blue, black, brown, white and lilac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Simpson, Greg Hurst 3 December 2011 12:01&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2414695.ece |title=Terracotta soldier – in full colour |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-09/09/content_11278335.htm |title=Terracotta army emerges in its true colors |work=China Daily  |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coloured lacquer finish and individual facial features would have given the figures a realistic feel. However, much of the colour coating had flaked off or become greatly faded.

Some scholars have speculated a possible [[Hellenistic]] link to these sculptures, because of the lack of life-sized and realistic sculptures before the Qin dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem89619.html Early links with West likely inspiration for Terracotta Warriors, argues SOAS scholar], School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lukas Nickel, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9035632 The First Emperor and sculpture in China], SOAS, University of London, Cambridge University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that potential Greek influence is particularly evident in some terracotta figures such as those of acrobats, as well as the technique used for casting bronze sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37624943 |title=Western contact with China began long before Marco Polo, experts say |date=12 October 2016 |work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/china-terracotta-army-ancient-greek-sculptors-alexander-the-great-marco-polo-a7357606.html | title = Ancient Greeks may have built China's famous Terracotta Army – 1,500 years before Marco Polo| last = Johnston | first = Ian | date = 13 October 2016 | website = Independent.co.uk | access-date = 14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this idea is disputed by scholars and it has been pointed out that there is "no substantial evidence at all" for contact between ancient Greeks and Chinese builders of the tomb.&lt;ref name=han-sil&gt;{{cite web |author1 = Hanink, Johanna | author2 = Silva, Felipe Rojas |date= 20 November 2016 | url=https://www.livescience.com/56939-china-terracotta-warriors-stir-controversy.html |title=Why China's Terracotta Warriors Are Stirring Controversy |publisher=Live Science}} Originally published in {{cite web|last1=Hanink&lt;!-- Associate Professor of Classics, Brown University  --&gt;|first1=Johanna|last2=Silva&lt;!-- Assistant Professor of Archaeology and the Ancient World, Brown University --&gt;|first2=Felipe Rojas|title=Why there's so much backlash to the theory that Greek art inspired China's Terracotta Army|url=https://theconversation.com/why-theres-so-much-backlash-to-the-theory-that-greek-art-inspired-chinas-terracotta-army-67488|publisher=The Conversation|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that such speculations in its core rest on flawed and old "Eurocentric" ideas that assumed other civilizations were incapable of sophisticated artistry and thus foreign artistry must be seen through western traditions.&lt;ref name=han-sil/&gt;

===Construction===
The terracotta army figures were manufactured in workshops by government laborers and local craftsmen using local materials. Heads, arms, legs, and torsos were created separately and then assembled by [[luting]] the pieces together. When completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upf.edu/materials/huma/central/abast/ledder.htm |title=A Magic Army for the Emperor |publisher=Upf.edu |date=1 October 1979 |accessdate=3 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128181533/http://www.upf.edu/materials/huma/central/abast/ledder.htm |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faces were created using [[Molding (process)|molds]], and at least ten face molds may have been used.&lt;ref name="national geographic"/&gt; Clay was then added after assembly to provide individual facial features to make each figure appear different.{{sfn|Portal|2007|p=170}} It is believed that the warriors' legs were made in much the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were manufactured at the time. This would classify the process as [[assembly line]] production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times of tight imperial control, each workshop was required to inscribe its name on items produced to ensure quality control. This has aided modern historians in verifying which workshops were commandeered to make tiles and other mundane items for the terracotta army.

=== Weaponry ===
[[File:Bronze jian of the Terracotta Army.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Bronze ''[[jian]]'' sword with chrome plating]]
Most of the figures originally held real weapons, which would have increased their realism. The majority of these weapons were looted shortly after the creation of the army or have rotted away.  Despite this, over 40,000 bronze items of weaponry have been recovered, including swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle-axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and crossbow triggers. Most of the recovered items are arrowheads, which are usually found in bundles of 100 units.&lt;ref name="lecture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/shaanxi/xian/terra_cotta_army/weapon_1.htm |title=Exquisite Weaponry of Terra Cotta Army |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Making Weapons for the Terracotta Army |authors= Marcos Martinón-Torres, Xiuzhen Janice Li, Andrew Bevan, Yin Xia, Zhao Kun, Thilo Rehren |date =2011 |journal= Archaeology International|volume= 13 |pages=65–75 |doi=10.5334/ai.1316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DbtrAwAAQBAJ|page=99}}|title=The Terracotta Warriors: The Secret Codes of the Emperor's Army |first= Maurice |last=Cotterell |publisher=Inner Traditions Bear and Company|date=June 2004|isbn=978-1591430339 |pages=99–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of these arrowheads suggests that they were produced by self-sufficient, autonomous workshops using a process referred to as ''cellular production'' or ''[[Toyotism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/chinese-terra-cotta-warriors-had-real-and-very-carefully-made-weapons/2012/11/26/999b9cb4-2840-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_story.html |title=Chinese terra cotta warriors had real, and very carefully made, weapons | first=Jennifer |last=Pinkowski |date=26 November 2012|work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some weapons were coated with a 10–15 micrometer layer of [[chromium dioxide]] before burial that has protected them from any form of decay for the last 2200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatourguide.com/xian/terracotta_warriors_details.html|title=Terracotta Warriors (Terracotta Army)|publisher=China Tour Guide|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=K5PpAAAAMAAJ|page=102}}|title=China's imperial tombs and mausoleums|author=Zhewen Luo|year=1993|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=978-7-119-01619-1|accessdate=28 June 2010|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swords contain an alloy of copper, tin, and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/terracottawarriors/assets/tcw-exhibition-eguide.pdf|title=Terracotta Warriors|year=2009|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=28 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some carry inscriptions that date their manufacture to between 245 and 228 BCE, indicating that they were used before burial.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/Teachers_resource_pack_30_8a.pdf |title=The First Emperor - China's Terracotta Army - Teacher's Resource Pack |publisher=British Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific research ==

In 2007, scientists at [[Stanford University]] and the [[Advanced Light Source]] facility in Berkeley, California reported that [[powder diffraction]] experiments combined with [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] and [[micro-X-ray fluorescence]] analysis showed that the process of producing terracotta figures colored with [[Han purple and Han blue|Chinese purple]] dye consisting of [[barium]] [[copper]] [[silicate]] was derived from the knowledge gained by [[Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] in their attempts to synthesize [[jade]] [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=Loïc|author2=Robinet, Laurianne |author3=Thoury, Mathieu |author4=Janssens, Koen |author5=Cohen, Serge X. |author6= Schöder, Sebastian |title=Cultural heritage and archaeology materials studied by synchrotron spectroscopy and imaging|journal=[[Applied Physics A]]|date=26 November 2011|volume=106|issue=2|pages=377–396|doi=10.1007/s00339-011-6686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Z.|author2=Mehta, A. |author3=Tamura, N. |author4=Pickard, D. |author5=Rong, B. |author6=Zhou, T. |author7= Pianetta, P. |title=Influence of Taoism on the invention of the purple pigment used on the Qin terracotta warriors|journal=[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]|date=November 2007|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1878–1883|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2007.01.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307000131|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.8552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, an international team of researchers at the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]] have been using [[analytical chemistry]] techniques to uncover more details about the production techniques employed in the creation of the Terracotta Army. Using [[X-ray fluorescence]] spectrometry of 40,000 bronze [[arrowhead]]s bundled in groups of 100, the researchers reported that the arrowheads within a single bundle formed a relatively tight cluster that was different from other bundles. In addition, the presence or absence of metal impurities was consistent within bundles. Based on the arrows’ chemical compositions, the researchers concluded that a [[cellular manufacturing]] system similar to the one used in a modern [[Toyota]] factory, as opposed to a continuous [[assembly line]] in the early days of the automobile industry, was employed.&lt;ref name="rsc"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rees|first=Simon|title=Chemistry unearths the secrets of the Terracotta Army|url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/chemistry-unearths-the-secrets-of-the-terracotta-army/2000074.article|magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]]|volume=51|issue=2|pages=22–25|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martinón-Torres|first=Marcos|author2=Li, Xiuzhen Janice |author3=Bevan, Andrew |author4=Xia, Yin |author5=Zhao, Kun |author6= Rehren, Thilo |title=Forty Thousand Arms for a Single Emperor: From Chemical Data to the Labor Organization Behind the Bronze Arrows of the Terracotta Army|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory|volume=21|issue=3|pages=534|date=20 October 2012|doi=10.1007/s10816-012-9158-z|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1361957/1/Rehren_Forty_thousand_arms_for_a_single_emperor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bar''''' is a [[1954 in art|1954]] painting by Australian artist [[John Brack]]. The subject of the painting is a direct reference to [[Édouard Manet]]'s 1882 work ''[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]''.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/record-price-for-painting-bar-none/2006/04/11/1144521342067.html|title=Record price for painting, bar none|date=12 April 2006|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a [[barmaid]] working in an [[pubs in Australia|Australian pub]] at the time of the "[[six o'clock swill]]". As in Manet's work, the patrons of the bar are shown in a reflection behind the barmaid. The work is considered a companion piece to Brack's later work ''[[Collins St., 5 pm]]''.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/19/2520543.htm|title=Gallery buys The Bar|date=19 March 2009|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was first sold to a Melbourne art collector for 90 [[guinea (coin)|guineas]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="record" /&gt; In 2006, the painting sold for $3.12m, a then record for an Australian work of art at auction.&lt;ref name="record" /&gt; The [[National Gallery of Victoria]] acquired the painting in 2009.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

The painting is part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art collection and exhibited in the [[Ian Potter Centre]] in [[Federation Square]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery Victoria Acquisition [http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/85242 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lane that Had No Turning, and Other Tales Concerning the People of Pontiac''''' is a collection of short stories by [[Sir Gilbert Parker, 1st Baronet|Gilbert Parker]], published in 1900 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.]] and also that same year by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] in London and by the Canadian publisher George N. Morang in Toronto. The first four stories in the collection (including the title story) had been published previously in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''. Parker dedicated the book to Canadian prime minister [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], declaring his "sincere sympathy with French life and character, as exhibited in the democratic yet monarchial province of Quebec."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Lane that Had No Turning|last = Parker|first = Gilbert|publisher = Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.|year = 1900|isbn = |location = New York|pages = v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book served as the basis for a [[The Lane That Had No Turning|silent film of the same title]], released in 1922.

The following stories are included in the collection:
* The Lane that Had No Turning
* The Absurd Romance Of P’tite Louison
* The Little Bell Of Honour
* A Son of the Wilderness
* A Worker in Stone
* The Tragic Comedy of Annette
* The Marriage of the Miller
* Mathurin
* The Story of the Lime-Burner
* The Woodsman's Story of the Great White Chief
* Uncle Jim
* The House with the Tall Porch
* Parpon the Dwarf
* Times Were Hard in Pontiac
* Medallion's Whim
* The Prisoner
* An Upset Price
* A Fragment of Lives
* The Man that Died at Alma
* The Baron of Beaugard
* Parables of a Province
** The Golden Pipes
** The Guardian of the Fire
** By That Place Called Peradventure
** The Singing of the Bees
** There Was a Little City
** The Forge in the Valley 
The final six pieces in the collection, the so-called "Parables of a Province," are different in tone from the other stories, had not been as well received upon magazine publication, and have not always been included in later reprints of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Note on the Text and Author in The Lane that Had No Turning and Other Tales Concerning the People of Pontiac|last = Rubio|first = Jen|publisher = Rock's Mills Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-9881293-7-5|location = Oakville, ON|pages = 268–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Thing''' is an international net-community of artists and art-related projects that was started in 1991 by [[Wolfgang Staehle]]. The Thing was launched as a mailbox system accessible over the telephone network in New York feeding a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) in 1991 before their website was launched in 1995 on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], ''Art and Electronic Media''. London: Phaidon, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, The Thing grew into a diverse online community made up of dozens of members' Web sites, mailing lists, a successful Web hosting service, a community studio in Chelsea (NYC), and the first Web site devoted to [[Net Art]]: bbs.thing.net.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== The Thing BBS (1991)===
In 1991, The Thing began as a [[Bulletin Board System]] (BBS) focusing on contemporary art and cultural theory.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Daniels, Gunther Reisinger (Eds.) “Net Pioneers 1.0: Contextualizing Early Net-Based Art”, Sternberg. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the writer and critic Blackhawk (having recently produced the film ''[[Cyberpunk]]'') taught Wolfgang Staehle many of the abilities he needed to start the original The Thing BBS. Blackhawk was the first person Staehle turned to after conceiving the idea for an electronic culture resource based on the model of [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[Social sculpture]]''. Blackhawk and Wolfgang jointly set up the editorial structure of the original BBS and planned for many of the then experimental activities that took place. Other people who helped develop and shape the content of the early BBS included [[Josefina Ayerza]], [[Dike Blair]], Donald Newman, the original programmer, Jordan Crandall, David Platzker, Josh Decter, [[Rainer Ganahl]], [[Julia Scher]], [[Barry Schwabsky]], Morgan Garwood, Franz von Stauffenberg and Benjamin Weil.

A second node, The Thing Cologne, was added in 1992, followed by The Thing Vienna in November 1993. Nodes in Berlin and elsewhere were soon to follow.

===The Thing on the Web (1995)===
The Thing changed its form when a website was created for a presentation at the 1995 [[Ars Electronica]]. Credits on the 1995 website also name Nicky Chaikin, [[John F. Simon Jr.]], [[Wolfgang Staehle]], Rob Keenan, Darryl Erentzen and John Rabasa.&lt;ref&gt;http://old.thing.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 The Thing set up an independent art network with hardware of its own that offered arts communities ways to establish themselves, to send information to one another and also to conceive of new artistic practices deriving from [[conceptual art]] and from [[performance art]]. The idea was that working with the Internet was a way to operate around the institutions of art distribution of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana. ''New Media Art''. Cologne: Taschen Verlag. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Max Kossatz designed ''The Thing Communicator'' a website mimicking many functions of the original BBS including member login, chat and messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

The most [[interactive]] area of The Thing consisted of various message boards offering forums for [[art theory]] debate, news and gossip, ongoing dialogue and an open-access flow of information as well as several online versions of art journals.

Alongside discussion forums The Thing has offered artworks in the form of [[graphics]] downloadable to the home [[personal computer]] – for example by [[Peter Halley]].

===thing.net communities===
The Thing has enabled a diverse group of artists, critics, curators, and activists to use the internet in its early stages. At its core, The Thing is a [[social network]], made up of individuals from diverse backgrounds with a wide range of expert knowledge. From this social hub, The Thing has built an array of programs and initiatives, in both technological and cultural networks. During its first five years, TT became widely recognized as one of the founding and leading online centers for [[new media]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]], ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include hosting artists' projects and mailing lists - as well as publishing cultural criticism.

The Thing has also organized many public events and symposia on such topics as the state of [[new media]] arts, the preservation of online privacy, artistic innovations in [[robotics]], and the possibilities of community empowerment through wireless technologies.

In 1997, thing.net communications, LLC, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) was incorporated by Wolfgang Staehle, Gisela Ehrenfried and Max Kossatz.  The ISP was to provide a financial backbone for The Thing Inc. (a 501 c 3 non profit organization).  thing.net has hosted arts and activist groups and publications including [[P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center]], [[Artforum]], [[Mabou Mines]], [[Willoughby Sharp]] Gallery, [[Zingmagazine]],  Journal of Contemporary Art, [[RTMark]] and Tenant.net.

Among many others, artists and projects associated with thing.net have included Sawad Brooks, [[Heath Bunting]], Cercle Ramo Nash, [[Vuk Cosic]], [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)|Ricardo Dominguez]], [[Ursula Endlicher]], [[etoy]], [[GH Hovagimyan]], Jérôme Joy, [[John Klima (artist)|John Klima]], Jenny Marketou, [[Mariko Mori]], [[Olivier Mosset]], Prema Murty, [[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Phil Niblock]], Daniel Pflumm, [[Francesca da Rimini]], [[Beat Streuli]] and Beth Stryker.

{{nihongo||鶴の恩返し|'''Tsuru no Ongaeshi'''|lit. "Crane's Return of a Favor"}} is a story from [[Japanese folklore]] about a crane who returns a favor to a man.  A variant of the story where a man marries the crane that returns the favor is known as {{nihongo||鶴女房|'''Tsuru Nyōbō'''|"Crane Wife"}}.

==Crane's Return of a Favor==
An elderly couple saves a crane caught in a trap.  That night, a beautiful girl appears at the couple's house and asks to stay the night.  Soon, she asks to be their daughter, takes care of them, and offers to weave cloth so that they may sell it for money at market.  She warns them not to look in on her as she is weaving, but they disobey her warning.  When they look in on her weaving, they discover a crane plucking out its feathers to weave the cloth.  She admits she was the crane they once saved, and had wished to take care of them to return the favor.  She explains now that her identity is revealed, she must leave, and so she transforms into a crane and flies away.

==The Crane Wife==

In ''The Crane Wife'', a man (generally named Karoku)  marries a woman who is in fact a crane disguised as a human. To make money the crane wife plucks her own feathers to weave silk brocade which the man sells, but she becomes increasingly ill as she does so. When the man discovers his wife's true identity and the nature of her illness, she leaves him.&lt;ref&gt;Elder, John, and Hertha Dawn. Wong. Family of Earth and Sky: Indigenous Tales from around the World. Beacon Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Variations==

In ''The Copper Pheasant Wife'', the wife does not weave cloth but instead provides her husband a plume to feather an arrow shaft the husband is rewarded for.  The wife is not looked in on by the husband like in ''The Crane Wife''; instead like in ''Crane's Return of a Favor'' the pheasant wife leaves as soon as the favor is returned.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Bird Wife'', it is an injured wild goose the man saves.  In this story, the wife weaves without prompting from the husband.  One day she disappears, and he finds her in a local pond.  It is there she explains she was trying to repay his kindness, and asks him to use the money from selling the cloth to take care of their child before flying away.&lt;br&gt;  
In ''The Fox Wife'', it is a fox that the man helps and who shows up on the man's doorstep to become his bride.  In this tale the fox does not weave but uses her tail to help sweep the floors.  Upon discovering his wife's identity, the husband drives her away.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Clam Wife'' A man finds a beautiful woman mysteriously appear at his doorway.  They become married, and the wife cooks the husband a delicious bean soup each day.  He peeks in on her cooking, and discovers that she is urinating clam juice into the soup, so he chases her away.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Fish Wife'' a fisherman releases fish that he does not need to eat back into the water because he does not have a greedy nature.  A beautiful woman appears at the fisherman's door and begs to be his wife.  The wife cooks the husband a bean soup that is so good he is suspicious of how she makes it.  He spies on her while she is cooking, and discovers she urinates in the soup.  Later at dinner he alludes to her cooking method.  When the wife realizes he knows she says she must return to her former home, and bids the husband visit her at the pond the following day.  When he does, she explains how she was a fish he saved and had wanted to repay the favor.  She disappears into the water, leaving him a box of gold and silver.&lt;br&gt;
In ''The Snake Wife'' a beautiful woman appears in a widower's doorway asking to stay the night.  They become married, and the wife becomes pregnant.  The wife warns the husband not to look in on the hut where she intends to have their child.  He looks, and discovers a snake.  The wife says that as the husband has seen her true form, she must leave.  She ends up giving her child her two eyeballs for nourishment as she cannot be there to feed it.  When the son grows of age he takes care of his blind mother.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Fanny Hagin. Ancient Tales in Modern Japan: an Anthology of Japanese Folk Tales.

* In [[Laid-Back Camp]] - Episode 3, one of the characters, Nadeshiko, closes the lid of a hot-pot saying "Don't peek until it's done!" and another character, Rin, subvocalizes, "Nadeshiko Returns a Favor" as a reference to the folktale.
* In the anime adaptation of [[Golden_Time_(novel_series)|Golden Time]], episode 13, Koko Kaga tells Tada Banri an extremely muddled version of the Crane Wife story to discourage him from peeking at her while she's cooking.
'''Video Games'''
*Iroha from the ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' video game series is loosely based on the "Crane Wife" version of the story, being a crane-turned-human who became a maidservant to an unseen "master", to repay him for the kindness of rescuing her from a hunter's trap. During one of her special attacks she hides behind a ''[[Shōji|shoji]]'' while saying "Please don't look, no matter what", referencing a scene from the story.
*The Grateful Crane from the videogame ''[[The Battle Cats]]'' is based on the crane of this folkloric tradition.
'''Music'''
* ''[[The Crane Wife]]'' ([[The Decemberists]] album)
*[[The Crane Wives]] (band)
*The [[Vocaloid]] song 'Seasonal Feathers' (using [[Kagamine Rin/Len]])

The '''Vladimir Nazor Award''' ({{lang-hr|Nagrada Vladimir Nazor}}) is an annual award given by the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]] to Croatian artists for highest achievements in various artistic fields. It was established in 1959 and is named for poet [[Vladimir Nazor]]. {{As of|2016}}, the award is given in the following six categories:

*[[Architecture]] and [[urbanism]]
*[[Film]]
*[[Literature]]
*[[Music]]
*[[Theatre]]
*[[Visual arts]] and [[applied arts]]

Two awards are given in each category every year - a life achievement award (for overall contributions to their respective field) and an annual award (for notable works in the field in the past twelve months). The winners for the preceding year are announced every year on 19 June, the anniversary of Nazor's death.

[[File:Wacky Wallwalker.jpg|thumb|Wacky Wallwalker as a [[cereal box prize]]]]
The '''Wacky WallWalker''' was a [[toy]] molded out of a sticky [[elastomer]]. It was shaped similar to an [[octopus]], and when thrown against a wall would "walk" its way down. It was a hugely popular toy in the early 1980s.

Before its introduction in the [[United States]], [[Ken Hakuta]] received in the mail several sticky octopus-like toys from his mother, who lived in [[Japan]]. They were intended for his children, but Hakuta found himself fascinated with the toy, which was called ''Tako'' in Japan. He realized their [[marketing]] potential, and after purchasing rights to the product in 1983 for $5,000,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Church. "Want to buy some goo?" ''The Globe and Mail (Canada)'' 21 July 1999. M1.&lt;/ref&gt; he began to market them locally in Washington, D.C., dubbing them "''Wacky WallWalkers''". Their popularity was mediocre, until [[Nina Hyde]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote a [[feature story]] on them. This created a buzz, and people in the Washington area flooded local stores to purchase them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Within the next several months, hundreds of media outlets ran stories on them, creating one of the biggest selling fads of all time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} As the fad began to decline, over 240 million Wacky WallWalkers had been sold, raking in about 80 million dollars.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The popular toy was featured in the 1983 animated Christmas special ''[[Deck the Halls with Wacky Walls]]'', starring the voices of [[Daws Butler]], [[Tress MacNeille]], and [[Marvin Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1150937/ Deck the Halls with Wacky Walls (1983) (TV)]&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured seven Wallwalkers from the planet Kling-Kling: Big Blue, Springette, Bouncing Baby Boo, Crazylegs, Stickum, Wacko, and their leader, Kling-Kling.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shales. "The Year Dan Rather Lost His Place and Other Great Moments in TV '83" ''The Washington Post'', 6 January 1984. D1.&lt;/ref&gt; One character in the special was modeled after Hakuta's son, Kenzo.&lt;ref&gt;Briefing. James F. Clarity and Warren Weaver Jr. ''The New York Times'', 11 July 1983.

The Wacky WallWalker was referenced in ''The Simpsons''{{'}} "Treehouse of Horror XXII"'s ''Avatar'' parody when the female alien hit a tree and "walked" down it in the manner of the Wacky WallWalker. The Wacky WallWalker was similarly referenced in an episode of [[Family Guy]], when [[Peter Griffin]] draws faces on an octopus tank, only to have the glass break, and is subsequently saved by [[List_of_Family_Guy_characters#Other_recurring_characters|Seamus Levine]] who throws the octopus on the wall.

'''''Water Lilies''''' (or '''''Nymphéas''''', {{IPA-fr|nɛ̃.fe.a|lang}}) is a [[Serial imagery|series]] of approximately 250 oil paintings by French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] [[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926). The paintings depict his [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|flower garden]] at [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|his home]] in [[Giverny]], and were the main focus of his artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name=A&gt;"Monet, Claude." [[Grove Art Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smart|first1=Alastair|title=Why are Monet's water-lilies so popular?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11167000/Why-are-Monets-water-lilies-so-popular.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Monet's long preference for producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and perspective began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the ''Valley of the Creuse'', which were shown at the Galerie Georges Petit.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Paul Hayes, ''Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings'', 1989, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in association with [[Yale University Press]], p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his other famous series are his ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''.

During the 1920s, the state of France built a pair of oval rooms at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] as a permanent home for eight water lily [[mural]]s by Monet. The exhibit opened to the public on 16 May 1927, a few months after Monet's death.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; Sixty water lily paintings from around the world were assembled for a special exhibition at the Musée de l'Orangerie in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Bell. "Paris sees Monet lilies in a new light." ''[[The Times]]''. 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings are on display at museums all over the world, including the [[Princeton University Art Museum]], [[Musée Marmottan Monet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmottan.fr/fr/claude_monet-musee-2517 Claude Monet paintings] at the Marmottan&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=monet Water Lilies] at the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Art Institute of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Monet%2C+Claude Water Lilies] at the Art Institute of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slam.org/emuseum/code/emuseum.asp?style=single&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;page=seealso&amp;profile=objects&amp;searchdesc=The%20Promenade%20with%20the%20Rail...&amp;searchstring=id/,/is/,/7056/,/false/,/true&amp;newvalues=1&amp;rawsearch=id/,/is/,/1930/,/false/,/true&amp;newstyle=single&amp;newprofile=objects&amp;newsearchdesc=Water%20Lilies&amp;newcurrentrecord=1&amp;module=objects Water Lilies] at the Saint Louis Art Museum,&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in Kansas City, Missouri,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelson-atkins.org/art/CollectionDatabase.cfm?id=6650&amp;theme=euro Water Lilies], the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], the [[National Museum of Wales]], the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1960.81 |title=Water Lilies (Agapanthus) |publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Portland Art Museum]] and the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famsf.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The paintings at auction==
On 19 June 2007, one of Monet's water lily paintings sold for £18.5 million at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalya Alberge. "Monet lilies make £18.5m but just miss world record." ''The Times''. 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2008 another of his water lily paintings, ''[[Le Bassin Aux Nymphéas]]'', sold for almost £41 million at [[Christie's]] in [[London]], almost double the estimate of £18 to £24 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xmotu.com/laurahenrycollection/news_monet.html The Laura Henry Collection] "Monet masterpiece sells at auction for almost £41million" ''The Laura Henry Collection''. 25 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, it was announced that the 1906 ''Nymphéas'' work would be auctioned in [[London]] in June 2010. The painting had an estimated sale price of between £30 and £40 million.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10225556.stm|title=Monet water lily to be auctioned at Christie's|date=3 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanna Bertazzoni, [[Christie's]] auction house director and head of impressionist and modern art, said, "Claude Monet's water-lily paintings are amongst the most recognised and celebrated works of the 20th Century and were hugely influential to many of the following generations of artists."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The sale took place on 23 June 2010 at the auction house and the painting attracted bids of up to £29 million, but it ultimately failed to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10396341.stm|title=Picasso reaches £34.7m in Christie's auction|date=24 June 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 2014, one of the Water Lilies paintings was auctioned at Christie's, New York City for $27 million.[16]  This auction totaled $141 millon &lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/market/christies-141-million-impressionist-evening-sale-496091&lt;/ref&gt; with the Monet piece Le bassin aux nymphéas being auctioned for $27 million of this amount. 

In June of 2014, one of the Water Lilies, ''Nymphéas'', sold for $54 million USD at a Sotheby's auction in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; This piece was auctioned to an anonymous buyer, but the piece went on to be part of the exhibition "Painting the Modern Garden: From Monet to Matisse" at the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts, London, starting in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The co-chairman of Sotheby's modern and impressionist art department, Helena Newman, claims that the result is at the top of the original estimated selling price. This price was between 34 and 51 million USD. 

While many of Monet’s masterpieces have sold, there are still an estimated 250 oil paintings from this series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/claude-monet-water-lilies-sell-for-32m-in-second-highest-auction-sale-for-his-work-9558624.html&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is widely popular, with many of these pieces residing in exhibits that have yet to go to auction.

'''Yi Yuanji''' ({{zh|c=易元吉}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: '''I Yüan-chi''') (c. 1000, [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]&lt;ref name=gov&gt;[http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/selection/info/mainA-05.htm I Yüan-chi]&lt;/ref&gt; – c. 1064)  was a [[Northern Song Dynasty]] painter, famous for his realistic paintings of animals. According to [[Robert van Gulik]], Yi Yuanji's paintings of [[gibbon]]s were particularly celebrated.&lt;ref name=gulik&gt;[[Robert van Gulik|Van Gulik, Robert Hans]] (1967), The gibbon in China: An essay in Chinese animal lore, E. J. Brill, Leiden, Holland. There is a brief summary at [http://www.gibbons.de/main/introduction/chapter_english08.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Geissmann, [http://www.gibbonconservation.org//07_journal/gibbon_journal_4.pdf Gibbon paintings in China, Japan, and Korea: Historical distribution, production rate and context"] . ''Gibbon Journal'', No. 4, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century critic  [[Guo Ruoxu]] (郭若虚) in his "Overview of Painting" (图画见闻志, ''Tuhua Jian Wen Zhi'') tells this about Yi's career:&lt;ref&gt;English translation by Van Gulik, in Van Gulik (1967), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guo Ruoxu's text is also in [http://www.esgweb.net/Article/Class138/Class161/Class165/200702/12045_5.htm this article] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|... His painting was excellent: flowers and birds, bees and [[cicada]]s he rendered life-like with subtle detail. At first he specialized in flower and fruit, but after he had seen such paintings by [[Zhao Chang]] (趙昌), he admitted their superiority with a sigh, and then resolved he would acquire fame by painting subjects not yet tried by the artists of old; thus he began to paint roebucks and gibbons.}}
He spent months roaming the mountains of southern [[Hubei]] and northern [[Hunan]], watching [[Roe Deer|roebuck]]s (獐鹿) and gibbons (猿狖) in their natural environment.&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt;

[[Image:Yi-Yuanji-Fan-painting-Two-gibbons.jpg|thumb|A gibbon picture on a fan by Yi Yuanji]]
In 1064, Yi Yuanji was invited to paint screens in the imperial palace. Once this job has been completed, the [[Emperor Yingzong of Song|Yingzong Emperor]], impressed, commissioned him to paint the "Picture of a Hundred Gibbons", but unfortunately the artist died after painting only a few gibbons.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt; A few of his other gibbon paintings have survived, and [[Robert van Gulik]], quite familiar with the behavior of this ape, comments on how naturally they look in the pictures.&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt; His other work includes depictions of deer, peacocks, birds-and-flowers and fruits-and-vegetables; many of them are kept in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]].&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; The "Monkey and Cats" painting is especially charming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809434-3,00.html MASTERPIECES OF CHINESE ART], [[Time Magazine]], May 6, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gulik identifies the monkey as a [[macaque]].&lt;ref name=gulik/&gt; This painting was featured on a 2004 "Year of the Monkey" stamp from [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/philately/archive/review-04-2.html Feline Philately: Cats on stamps]&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of Yi Yuanji, with his intimate knowledge of nature, has attracted attention from modern Chinese painters.&lt;ref&gt;Painting by modern artist Fan Zeng (范曾) [http://auction.sc001.com.cn/detail_auction.asp?id=591600 "Yi Yuanji playing with a monkey (易元吉戏猴图)"], painting by the modern Chinese artist Fang Zeng (范曾)&lt;/ref&gt;
