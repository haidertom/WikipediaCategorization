It was founded in 1990 by David Jones and Marilyn Propp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-07/entertainment/9606070202_1_drawings-etching-prints|title=Anchor Shows Printmaking Process As Well As Product|publisher=Chicago Tribune|first=Barbara B. |last=Buchholz|date=7 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for the quality of its prints as well as its educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;Second Sight: Printmaking in Chicago 1935-1995," by James Yood. Essays by Mark Pascale, James Yood, and David Mickenberg (Mary and Leigh Block Gallery, Northwestern University, 1996), p. 50 and 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=demo3&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://issuu.com/columbiacollegepubs/docs/demo3|first=Anne|last=Wiens|title=The Fine Print|journal=Demo3|publisher=Columbia College|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
For twenty years, Anchor provided free classes for high school students, and had an outreach program called Press on Wheels (POW) which brought [[printmaking]] into schools, galleries, museums, and community centers.&lt;ref name=demo3 /&gt; Workshops were open to students of all ages who learned to create handmade prints. During the Toulouse-Lautrec and Rembrandt exhibitions at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], a press was brought to the museum, and Anchor staff demonstrated the print processes and tools used by both artists. Ann Weins writes in DEMO 3, pages 24–28: "Anchor Graphics maintains an impressive schedule of classes, workshops, residencies, and lectures, all the while publishing exquisite, hand-pulled prints."&lt;ref name=demo3 /&gt;

The Artist-in-Residence Program was created to provide uninterrupted use of the shop by national and international printmakers for research and the development of new work. Scraping the Surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colum.edu/academics/anchor-graphics/Education/Lecture_Series/Past_Lectures/McCay_Lecture.html|title=Winsor McCay|work=colum.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; a free lecture series open to the public, presented talks by artists, curators, museum specialists, conservators, collectors, and others with an interest in prints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colum.edu/academics/anchor-graphics/Information/history.html|title=History|work=colum.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was funded by the Terra Foundation for American Art from 2006 - 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terraamericanart.org/grant/anchor-graphics-columbia-college/&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in [[Ukrainian Village, Chicago|Ukrainian Village]], and then Chicago's [[Ukrainian Village, Chicago|River North]], Anchor moved to the [[Chicago Loop|South Loop]] upon becoming a part of the Art + Design Department at [[Columbia College Chicago]] in 2006. According to [[David Mickenberg]], former director of the David Museum and Cultural Center, and of the [[Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art|Block Museum]] at [[Northwestern University]], " [Anchor's reputation] has to do with. . .  the balancing act between education and collaborative printmaking. . . "&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-06-25/news/0606240244_1_contemporary-artists-prints-david-jones|title=Dropping Anchor at Columbia|publisher=Chicago Tribune|first=Jeff |last=Huebner|date=25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anchor provides Artist-in-Residencies, open studio time for the Chicago community, adult classes, and publishing and contract work.

'''Architectural management''' falls into two distinct parts, [[office management]] and [[project management]] (Brunton et al., 1964; Emmitt, 1999a &amp; 1999b). Office management provides an overall framework within which individual projects are commissioned, designed and completed. Both parts have the same objectives but are typically addressed by separate [[management systems]]. Office management involves the allocation and [[Financial management|financing]] of resources, principally premises, trained staff and [[computer systems]], and on establishing and charging appropriate fees for the services rendered. Project management focuses on timescales, developing a [[design]] from initial concept to working drawings, and managing the [[construction]] process (see for example Emmitt, 2014).

The essence of architectural management is to ensure that work on a project is cost-effective, to achieve a balance between profitability and design quality.

== Development ==
Standard management techniques and tools, borrowed mainly from repetitive industrial processes, have not always fitted comfortably with the image of the [[architect]] as a creative individual, rather than a professional member of a business team. The term ‘architectural management’ has been in use since the 1960s as building construction became more complex, because of a shift from standard traditional construction details, to innovation and experimentation. [[Architectural practice]]s generally employ an office manager who may have at their disposal an [[Administrative Assistant|administration assistant]] or team of assistants. Project management is increasingly a role played by an independent consultant, especially during the construction phase. Project managers are typically from one of the [[surveying]] disciplines, leaving only the architectural elements to be managed in-house by the architects.

[[File:Bhatkhande.jpg|thumb|Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande]]
'''Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University''', formerly '''Bhatkhande Music Institute''', is a music institute in [[Lucknow]]. Established in 1926 by [[Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande]], it was declared a [[deemed university]] by [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugc.ac.in/inside/deemed%20universities/bhatkhandemusicinstitute.html Bhatkhande Music Institute] [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; and offers [[music education]] in Vocal Music, Instrumental, Rhythms, Dance, Musicology and Research and Applied Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2006/02/03/stories/2006020302100300.htm|title=The prescribed notes! |date=3 February 2006|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060118/asp/careergraph/story_5731615.asp|title=Song sung true |date=18 January 2006|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute finds its origin in the Marris College of Music,&lt;ref&gt;often misspelled as Morris College&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1926 by renowned classical singer and [[musicologist]], [[Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande]] and [[Umanath Bali|Rai Umanath Bali]] with the help of Dr. [[Rai Rajeshwar Bali]], then Education minister of the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]], the institution was formally inaugurated by then [[List of Governors of the United Provinces of British India|Governor]] of [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]], [[William Sinclair Marris|Sir William Sinclair Marris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upgovernor.nic.in/marrisbio.htm Sir William S Marris, K.C.S.I.., K.C.I.E., C.I.E, Governor of U.P. (1922-1928)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130015314/http://www.upgovernor.nic.in/marrisbio.htm |date=30 January 2010 }} [[Governor of Uttar Pradesh]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also named after him.

Later, on 26 March 1966, the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] took over the college and renamed it after its founder as Bhatkhande Music College of Hindustani Music, later  and now Bhatkhande Music Institute University, after [[Government of India]] through a notification on 24 October 2000, declared the institute a deemed university.&lt;ref name=td/&gt;

During the 1970s &amp; 1980s, the institute organized annual festivals in which the most eminent of the country’s musicians performed.  Some of the memorable concerts, that included performances by stars like Pd. Ravishanker, Amjad Ali Khan, Zakir Hussain, N Rajam, VJ Jog, Sitara Devi, etc. were part of the Lucknow Festival in the 1970s.  During the same period various new courses, like "Thumri" (singer Mrs. Begum Akhtar was the honorary faculty), were introduced.

In 2005, it organised a three-day classical music festival part of the Lucknow Mahotsav.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=158717|title=10-day Lucknow Mahotsava begins|date=26 November 2005|publisher=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily teaching vocal, dance, musicology and applied music in [[Hindustani classical music]], the institute also started teaching [[western classical music]] in 2009,&lt;ref name=td&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sindhtoday.net/news/1/45228.htm|title=Bhatkhande University to also teach Western classical music|date=25 August 2009|publisher=Sindh Today}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a move that didn't go well with some [[chauvinist]]s (not musicians or affiliated to the Institute), who feared that addition of Western classical music could later lead to replacement of [[Bharatnatyam]] courses by 'belly dancing.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/city/lucknow/Western-music-strikes-a-discordant-note/articleshow/5092354.cms|title=Western music strikes a discordant note|date=6 October 2009|publisher=The Times of India|first1=Manjari|last1=Mishra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IMG CastlestrangeStone2771.jpg|thumb|280px|The Castlestrange stone]]
'''The Castlestrange stone''' is located in the grounds of "Castlestrange House" near [[Athleague]] in [[County Roscommon]], [[Ireland]]. It is a granite boulder decorated with flowing spirals in the [[La Tène style]], dating from the [[Iron Age]] period between 300 BC and 100 AD. 

Only three other stones of this type have been found in Ireland, of which the [[Turoe stone]] in [[County Galway]] is the best known. The use of the stones is not known but it is assumed they served some religious or ritual purpose. 

The stone is a protected National Monument.

__NOTOC__

==Description==

Since being founded in 1995 by Anita Durst, daughter of New York real estate developer [[Douglas Durst]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chashama.org/about/board-members Chashama website: Board of Directors] retrieved March 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thevillager.com/villager_236/chashamacreating.html The Villager: "Chashama — creating art where you least expect it" By Raquel Hecker] November 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/06/magazine/the-dursts-have-odd-properties.html New York Times: "The Dursts Have Odd Properties" By James Traub] October 6, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; chashama has transformed 70 locations throughout the city and launched the careers of over 12,000 artists by giving them access to subsidized space, which supported approximately 10,000 public presentations for over 500,000 viewers. chashama provides free and subsidized space for artists to live, work, and present partnering with developers and property owners to transform their vacant buildings into centers of creativity with the added benefit of increasing local foot traffic and supporting area businesses.

chashama runs a variety of programs to serve the emerging artist community in the city. They include:

* Using temporarily vacant storefront windows for free, public installations and performances 
* Providing subsidized or free rehearsal and performance space
* Providing subsidized artist's studios
* Presenting a variety of visual artist exhibitions throughout the year

The meaning of "chashama" depends on whom one asks. chashama (pronounced: sha-SHA-ma) is [[Persian language|Persian]] for "to have vision". Although some say it is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word that means "shame," others say it means "from the eye" ({{lang-fa|Chashm'a}}) or "spring outlet" ({{lang-fa|Chesh'ma}}). There are many more theories of spelling, pronunciation, and meaning. Some critics argue that the word is a complete fabrication, both in spelling and etymology.

[[File:Pope John XXIII - Time Magazine Cover - January 4, 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Time (magazine)|Time]] cover from 1963. Copyright was not renewed, so the collective work is in the public domain. The artist, [[Bernard Safran]] (1924–95), created 73 covers for Time.{{sfn|Bernard Safran: Paintings – safran-arts}}]]
A '''collective work''' is a work that contains the works of several authors assembled and published under the direction of one natural or legal person who owns the [[copyright]] in the work as a whole. 
Definitions vary considerably from one country to another, but usually treat ownership of the work as a whole as distinct from ownership of the individual contributions, so the individual authors may retain the right to publish their work elsewhere.
It is common for publication of articles on the Internet, when isolated from the context of the overall work, to be considered to be outside of the standard agreement between the author and the owner of the collective work.

==General==

===International agreements===

Many countries have agreed to be bound by the terms of the [[Berne Convention]] and/or the [[TRIPS Agreement]].

Article 2.5 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Paris Text 1971) specifies: "Collections of literary or artistic works such as encyclopaedias and anthologies which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections."{{sfn|Berne Convention ... 1971}}

Section 10.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, to which members of the [[World Trade Organization]] are bound, states, "Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself."{{sfn|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights – WTO}}

===Limitation on publisher rights===

In general, the author of a contribution to a collective work retains the copyright, and the publisher does not have the right to reuse the contribution in some context other than the collective work without the express consent of the author. 
In England it has been held that exploiting the work of a freelance newspaper photographer in a back numbers website was a use that had not been contemplated in the original license and was not covered by the license.
Such reuse would also infringe the journalist's copyright in the United States.
In a 1997 case in the Netherlands it was held that reuse of newspaper articles on a website and CD-ROM went beyond the implied license.
In Germany any attempt by the author to grant rights to exploit their work in a way that was unknown when the contract was made is null and void under the law.
In France, online publication is considered fundamentally different from print publication.{{sfn|Stokes|2014|p=138}}

===Creative Commons===

The Creative Commons legal code for Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 (CC2.0) defines a collective work as:
{{quote|"'''Collective Work'''" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.{{sfn|Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 – Creative Commons}} }}
The license for a CC2.0 work allows the user to incorporate the CC2.0 work in a collective work in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The collective work does not have to be released under a Creative Commons license, but access to the incorporated CC2.0 work must be consistent with the CC2.0 license, and the author must be credited.{{sfn|Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 – Creative Commons}}

==Common law countries==

The British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) was the first copyright law in the world.{{sfn|Tallmo|2014}}
The statute is considered a "watershed event in Anglo-American copyright history ... transforming what had been the publishers' private law copyright into a public law grant".{{sfn|Patterson|Joyce|2003|p=916}}  
Under the statute, copyright was for the first time vested in authors rather than publishers; it also included provisions for the public interest, such as a [[legal deposit]] scheme. The Statute was an influence on copyright law in several other nations, including the [[United States]], and even in the 21st century is "frequently invoked by modern judges and academics as embodying the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] underpinnings of copyright law".{{sfn|Alexander|2010|p=17}}

===Australia===

In Australia a collective work is a work composed of separate parts that each attract their own copyright.
An example would be a song in which the author of the music and the author of the lyrics each have copyright in their contribution.{{sfn|Caenegem|2010|p=36}}
The authors have a moral right to be attributed, but only if they are author of a substantial part and it is reasonable to identify the author.{{sfn|Sainsbury|2003|p=50}}
It may be unreasonable to attribute each author in a collective work such as an encyclopedia.{{sfn|Sainsbury|2003|p=51}}

===Canada===

Under Canadian copyright law, a collective work means{{sfn|Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)|pp=2–3}} 
:(a) an encyclopaedia, dictionary, year book or similar work,
:(b) a newspaper, review, magazine or similar periodical, and
:(c) any work written in distinct parts by different authors, or in which works or parts of works of different authors are incorporated; 

When the author of a work is the first owner of copyright, any rights granted by the author revert to his estate.
However, this does not apply to the assignment of the copyright in a collective work or a licence to publish a work or part of a work as
part of a collective work.{{sfn|Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)|loc=14 (1)}}

''[[Robertson v Thomson Corp]]'', {{lexum-scc3|2006|43|2 |363}} is a 2006 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the ownership of copyright in published text that are stored in databases.  The ruling held that though a newspaper held the copyright in the collection and the arrangement of freelance articles and in its newspaper, it could not publish the articles within a database.  Publication within the database would remove the articles from the context of the collective work and therefore their publication as such was not within the rights held by the newspaper.{{sfn|Robertson v. Thomson Corp., [2006]}}
Robertson decided that freelance journalists' copyright can stop the republication of their articles onto databases which display one article at a time but not onto CD-ROMs featuring whole newspapers. The court decided that a CD-ROM in which individual articles may only be viewed in the context of a whole newspaper is not a republication of an individual article as an individual work, but is rather a reproduction of the newspaper as a whole as a work.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom section 178 of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] (CDPA) defines a collective work as either “(a) a work of joint authorship or (b) a work in which there are distinct contributions by different authors or in which works or parts of works of different authors are incorporated.”{{sfn|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 UK|loc=s.178}}
The general principle is that authors who contribute to a collective work have the right to control future exploitation in their works unless this is expressly waived in the contract.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The editor receives a separate copyright in the collective work for their efforts as long as they meet the originality standard set by the government.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|pp=254}}
The copyright law related to collective works does not provide an exception to the general European term of protection of 70 years following death, which would apply to death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}

The [[Copyright Act 1842]] stated that the authors of contributions to collective works did not retain full copyright control over their works. However, they had the right to be paid, the right to refuse consent for additional uses of their work, reversion of copyright after 28 years and (if agreed with the owner of the collective work) the ability to publish their own work.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The 1911 Act, which replaced the 1842 Act, stated that the owner of a collective work would only gain ownership of the copyright of contributions where they had given or promised some valuable consideration and there was no agreement to the contrary.
The author would retain copyright if this could be inferred from the mutual intention of the parties.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
Under the [[Copyright Act 1911]], no copyright vests in the proprietor of a collective work unless the author is employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, or there is an assignment in writing; and when the copyright vests in the proprietor of a periodical by reason of a contract of service or apprenticeship, the author may restrain separate publication.{{sfn|Macgillivray|1912}}

With the 1911 Act the author of a contribution would regain copyright after 25 years, but this would be concurrent with the publisher's right in the collective work. 
It was argued that reversion of full rights to the author would have been "a great hardship to proprietors of collective works, particularly of those permanent in nature, such as ecyclopaedias, if they could not have acquired from the author an unfettered right to produce the work at any future time as part of the collective work."
The author could, however, restrain the publisher from transferring or licensing their work to others.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=60}}
Under the [[Copyright Act 1956]] employees retained copyright in their work unless there was an agreement to the contrary.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The  CDPA removed the waiver on employee rights.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}

===United States===

{{main|Collective work (US)}}

In the [[Copyright law of the United States]], the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], section 101, defines a collective work as "a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole". 
It is protected as long as the "author" can show that the selection and organization of the contributions is original, and that these contribution can themselves be protected, as opposed to being mere facts such as statistical data.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

Article 201 (c) states, "Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series".{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The compiler, or author of the collection, owns copyright in the expression he or she contributed, which is primarily the selection and arrangement of the separate contributions, but may include such things as a preface, advertisements, etc., that the collective author created.{{sfn|Barrett|2012|loc=PT449}}
The contributions remain the property of the authors by default, but the property may be passed to the owner of the collective work by contract.
They may also obtain ownership of the contributions if they are [[Work for hire|works made for hire]].{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

The Supreme Court case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' (2001) concerned free-lance journalists who had been paid for their contributions to paper editions of newspapers and magazines, but their contracts had not covered digital rights for reproduction on CD-ROMs or publication on the Internet.
When the articles were distributed in electronic form a few years later, the court ruled that this did not constitute a revision of the work, because the articles could be accessed individually.
A revision must maintain the articles in their context of origin.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
In ''Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises Inc.'' (2005), a Court of Appeal ruled that an electronic version of a newspaper was a revision of the collective work if it reproduced the paper version identically, including advertisements and photographs.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

==European countries==

"The New Renaissance", the report of the ''Comité des Sages'' Reflection Group on Bringing Europe’s Cultural Heritage Online, published on 10 January 2011, stated that the public sector had a duty to digitize their cultural heritage. Under the heading of "Ensuring wide access to and use of digitised public domain material" the report stated:{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}
{{blockquote|
* Cultural institutions should make public domain material digitised with public funding as widely available as possible for access and re-use. This cross-border access should be part of the funding conditions for digitisation across Europe. The use of intrusive watermarks or other means that limit the use of the material should be avoided.{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}
* The European Commission should consider ways and means to eliminate the differences in the rights status of digitised material between the Member States in a context where cross-border access and use is the norm. In principle the mere digitisation process should not generate any new rights.{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}}}
The [[Copyright Term Directive]] of 2006 was intended to address the second concern, but has not been effective in harmonizing the terms and definitions.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=2}}
It does state that the term of protection for works whose right-holder is a legal person, as well as for collective works, is 70 years after the work is made available to the public.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=3}}
It also states that where "the natural persons who have created the [collective] work are identified as such in the versions of the works which are made available to the public" the duration of protection is 70 years after the death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}
However, there is no standard European definition of the terms "works of joint authorship" and "collective works", so each country must define laws and make legal decisions over when a work with multiple authors is a work of joint authorship, collective work or simply a collection of separate works.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=4}}

=== Czech Republic===

In the Czech Republic a collective work is a work that is created with the participation of more than one authors at the initiative and under the management of a natural person or of a legal entity and made available to the public under that person’s or entity’s name and where the individual contributions involved in the work are not capable of independent use. The work is protected for 70 years after it was made publicly available.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

===France===
{{main|Collective work (France)}}

The concept of a collective work (''œuvre collective'') in the [[copyright law of France]] is complex, and case law and scholarly views do not always agree.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Bernard Edelman, in his ''l’œuvre collective : une définition introuvable'' (1998), describes the legal definition of collective works as "obscure and tangled".{{sfn|Jacobacci Avocats|2014}}
However, all authorities agree that the concept of an ''oeuvre collective'' in France covers dictionaries, encyclopaedias and periodical works such as newspapers or magazines.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

A "collective work" in France is a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created.
"A collective work shall be the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed.  The author’s rights shall vest in such person."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2–3}}
"In the case of ... collective works, the term of the exclusive right shall be 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=7}}

It does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The ''maître'' takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the ''maître'' rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the ''maître'' directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
In a 22 March 2012 decision the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]] (''Cour de cassation'') stated that "the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives".{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
Each contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

The rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.{{sfn|France: Industrial Relations ... Press Reference}}
When a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.
Publication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.
Electronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.
However, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.
Further, the contributors to a newspaper may have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

===Germany===

The main relevant law in Germany is the Copyright Act of 9 September 1965, the ''Gesetz über Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte '' (UrhG).
German copyright law defines collective works as collections of works, data, or other independent elements, provided that the collection itself is a personal intellectual creation (UrhG, sec. 4 para 1), in other words: a work as defined by UrhG, sec. 2 para 2.
The authors grant the rights of exploitation to a third party who decides what works to include in the collection.
The difference from a work of joint authorship is that it is practical to separately exploit the parts of a collective work, while that cannot be done with parts of a work of joint authorship. 
It is possible to distinguish between the collection as a work and the parts as different works.{{sfn|Engelhardt|Jaeger}}

Since the authors retain copyright in their contributions, both the authors and the creator of the collective work must consent to its exploitation.
The creator and the authors of the contributions may enforce their rights separately.{{sfn|Engelhardt|Jaeger}}
The copyright term of each contribution is measured from the death of the author of the contribution.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|p=253}}
The collective work resembles a joint work in that the author of each contribution may require the consent to alteration or exploitation of all the contributors "if such consent may reasonably be demanded of them."{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|pp=253-254}}
Two years after granting an exploitation right to an editor, or after delivering the work to the editor, the author can revoke the grant if the work has not been published and the author has been harmed as a result.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|p=269}}

===Hungary===

In Hungary a work shall be regarded as a collective work if the contributions of the authors co-operating in the creation of the work are combined in the product of joint creation in a manner which makes the separate determination of the individual authors' rights impossible.  In the case of a collective work ... the copyright shall be transferred by legal succession to the natural or legal person,   business company or legal entity at whose initiative and under whose instructions the work was created and who published it in his own name.{{sfn|Act No. LXXVI of 1999 on copyright – Hungary|loc=Art 6}}
The term of protection of a collective work shall be seventy years counted from the first day of the year following the first disclosure of the work.{{sfn|Act No. LXXVI of 1999 on copyright – Hungary|loc=Art 31}}

===Italy===

Article 3 of the Italian Copyright Law defines collective works as formed by “the assembling of works or parts of works possessing the character of a self-contained creation resulting from selection
and coordination with a specific literary, scientific, didactic, religious, political or artistic aim, such as encyclopaedias, dictionaries, anthologies, magazines and newspapers”. The collective work as a whole is protected for 70 years from publication. For magazines, newspapers and other periodical works, each individual part or issue is given an independent term.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
The collective works shall be protected as original works, independently and without prejudice to the copyright on the works or parts of works of which they are composed."

Article 7 of the Copyright Law considers the author as the one who organizes and directs the creation of the work: "The author of a collective work is considered to be the person who organizes and directs its creation itself."
What characterizes the collective work is not so much the structural element as the creative coexistence of two levels: that of individual contributions that make up the work and the total ideation of the work and the choice and coordination of contributions or of organization and direction of creative activity carried out by employees.

The individual parts of the collective work are deemed creative works, so the rights to them are retained by their individual creators. This is stated in paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the Copyright Law stating: "The right to use their own contributions separately is reserved for the individual employees of the collective work, in compliance with the agreed terms, and failing that, the following standards."
Moreover, the Article 38 also provides that: "With a collective work, unless otherwise agreed, the right to economic use is with the publisher of the same" where "publisher" means the natural or legal person who assumes the economic risk and bear the costs imposed by the creation and publication of the work.

As part of these works we must therefore distinguish three distinct holders of rights: the author (who organizes and directs its creation), the publisher (who owns only the economic rights) and individual authors. 
Article 42 allows the use of a fragment from the collective work by the author provided it indicates the collective work from which it was taken, and the date of publication:
"The author of the article or other work that is reproduced in a collective work shall be entitled to reproduce it in separate publications or collected in a volume, provided that it indicates the collective work from which it is taken and the date of publication."

===Kosovo===

In Kosovo the copyright in the collective work lasts for seventy years after the lawful disclosure of the work, unless the natural persons who have created the work are identified as such in the versions of the work which are disclosed to the public. 
In case of identification of the authors, copyright will last for seventy years from the date of death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 61}}
Property rights and other copyrights pertaining to a database or collective work created during employment are considered to have passed to the employer exclusively and without limitations, unless the contract provides otherwise,{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 128}} 

A collective copyright work is a work created by collaboration of several authors, by combining their contribution separately into a whole such as encyclopedias, lexicons, databases, computer programs, collections and similar works at the initiative and under the direction of a natural or legal person as the ordering party. 
It is considered that the authors transfer unlimited and exclusive rights to all the material and other copyright in the collective work, unless otherwise provided by contract. 
The principal of the collective copyright work has the right to publish and use the work in its own name, but every copy of the work must contain a list of authors participating in 
the creation of collective work.{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 106}}

===Netherlands===

Under Dutch copyright law Article 5 states that “if a literary, scientific or artistic work consists of separate works by two or more persons, the person under whose guidance and supervision the work as a whole has been made or, if there is no such person, the compiler of the various works, shall be deemed the author of the whole work, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works separately”. This could apply to works such as anthologies or encyclopedias.
The term of protection is not specified, so by default the collective work may be assumed to be protected until 70 years after the death of the person deemed to be author of the whole work. If this person is a legal person, protection would be for 70 years after publication.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}

===Norway===

In Norway a work is protected for 70 years following the year of death of the author. 
In a collective or joint work, this is counted from the death of the longest surviving author. 
For a motion picture, the following are considered authors: main director, scriptwriter, dialogue author, and composer of original musical score.{{sfn|Hannemyr|2009|p=2}}

===Spain===

Under the 1987 [[copyright law of Spain]] collections of other works, such as anthologies, and other elements or data that by the selection or arrangement of materials constitute intellectual creations, are considered protected works without prejudice to the rights of the authors of the original works.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 12}}
A collective work is a work created by the initiative and under the coordination of a natural or legal person who edits and publishes it under their name and consists of the collection of contributions from different authors whose personal contributions are based on autonomous creation, and for whom it is not possible to attribute separately a right over the whole of the work. Unless otherwise agreed, the rights to the collective work belong to the person who publishes and disseminates it under their name.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 9}}
The duration of rights over a collective work shall be sixty years from the date of its disclosure.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 28}}
Article 28 of the 1996 revision to this law grants collective works protection for 70 years following  lawful disclosure of the work.{{sfn|Real Decreto Legislativo 1/1996 – Spain|loc=Art. 28}}

==Other countries==

===Algeria===

In Algeria a collective work is protected for 50 years from publication, 50 years from the time it was made accessible to the public if unpublished, or 50 years from the time it is realized that it has not been made available to the public within 50 years of creation.{{sfn|DZ001: Droits d'auteur, Ordonnance ... Algeria|loc=Art. 56}}

===China===

Chinese law is in some ways closer to that of common law countries than to European civil law. 
It follows the general principle that ownership is originally vested in the author, but makes an exception with collective works.
Article 11 of the Chinese copyright code states that when a legal entity or organization directs creation of a work and bears responsibility for the work, that entity is considered the author of
the work. All rights vest in the organizational author.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=11–12}}

===Philippines===

Under the [[copyright law of the Philippines]], a "collective work" is a work which has been created by two or more natural persons at the initiative and under the direction of another with the understanding that it will be disclosed by the latter under his own name and that contributing natural persons will not be identified.{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines - Part Four|loc=171.2}}
When an author contributes to a collective work, his right to have his contribution attributed to him is deemed waived unless he expressly reserves it.{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines - Part Four|loc=196}}

===Vanuatu===

In Vanuatu a "collective work" is a work created by 2 or more individuals at the initiative and under the direction of another person on the understanding that (a) the work will be disclosed by that other person under that person’s own name; and (b) the identity of the contributing individuals will not be indicated.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=3}}
The person who initiated and directed the creation of a collective work is the original owner of the economic rights.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=13}} 
A "work of joint authorship" is a work created by 2 or more authors and in which the contribution of each author is not separate from the contribution of the other author or the contributions of the other authors, but does not include a collective work.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=5}} 
For a collective work (other than an work of applied art) and an audiovisual work protection extends for 50 years on and after the date on which the work: was made; or first made available to the public; first published; whichever date is the latest.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=12}}

'''Color mapping''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that maps (transforms) the [[color]]s of one (source) [[Digital image|image]] to the colors of another (target) image. A color mapping may be referred to as the [[algorithm]] that results in the mapping function or the algorithm that transforms the image colors. Color mapping is also sometimes called ''color transfer'' or, when [[Grayscale|grayscale images]] are involved, ''brightness transfer function (BTF)''.

== Algorithms ==
There are two types of color mapping algorithms: those that employ the statistics of the colors of two images, and those that rely on a given [[pixel]] correspondence between the images.

An example of an algorithm that employs the statistical properties of the images is [[histogram matching]]. This is a classic algorithm for color mapping, suffering from the problem of sensitivity to image content differences. Newer statistic-based algorithms deal with this problem. An example of such algorithm is adjusting the [[mean]] and the [[standard deviation]] of [[Lab color space|Lab]] channels of the two images.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/ColorTransfer.pdf Color Transfer between Images]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common algorithm for computing the color mapping when the pixel correspondence is given is building the [[Frequency_distribution#Joint_frequency_distributions|joint-histogram]] (see also [[co-occurrence matrix]]) of the two images and finding the mapping by using [[dynamic programming]] based on the joint-histogram values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2003-103.pdf Inter-Camera Color Calibration using Cross-Correlation Model Function]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the pixel correspondence is not given and the image contents are different (due to different point of view), the statistics of the image corresponding regions can be used as an input to statistics-based algorithms, such as histogram matching. The corresponding regions can be found by detecting the corresponding [[Feature_detection_(computer_vision)|features]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.idc.ac.il/sefyk/colmap.htm Piecewise-consistent Color Mappings of Images Acquired Under Various Conditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721135029/http://www1.idc.ac.il/sefyk/colmap.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Color mapping can serve two different purposes: one is calibrating the colors of two cameras for further processing using two or more sample images, the second is adjusting the colors of two images for perceptual visual compatibility.

[[Color calibration]] is an important pre-processing task in [[computer vision]] applications. Many applications simultaneously process two or more images and, therefore, need their colors to be calibrated. Examples of such applications are: [[Image differencing]], [[Image registration|registration]], [[object recognition]], multi-camera [[Video tracking|tracking]], [[Segmentation (image processing)|co-segmentation]] and [[Correspondence problem|stereo reconstruction]].

{{Refimprove|date=February 2018}}

In [[computer programming]], an '''entry point''' is where control is transferred from a [[Loader (computing)|loader]] or [[operating system]] to a [[computer program]], at which place the processor enters a program or a [[Machine code|code]] fragment and [[Execution (computing)|execution]] begins. (It's possible that the computer program itself is the operating system, in which case the launcher is the [[bootloader]]). In some operating systems or [[programming language]]s, the initial entry is not part of the program but of the [[runtime library]], in which case the runtime library initializes the program and then the runtime library enters the program. In other cases, the program may call the runtime library before doing anything when it is entered for the first time, and, after the runtime library returns, the actual code of the program begins to execute. This marks the transition from [[load time]] (and dynamic [[link time]], if present) to [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

In simple [[Layout (computing)|layouts]], programs begin their execution at the beginning, which is common in [[scripting language]]s, simple binary [[executable]] formats, and [[boot loader]]s. In other cases, the entry point is at some other fixed point, which is some [[memory address]] than can be an [[absolute address]] or relative address ([[offset (computer science)|offset]]).

Alternatively, execution of a program can begin at a named point, either with a conventional name defined by the [[programming language]] or [[operating system]], or at a caller-specified name. In many programming languages, notably [[C (programming language)|C]], this named point is a function called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; as a result, the entry point is often called the '''main function'''.

A common form of the '''main function''' in C, C# or C++, is a static method, either returning no data (&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;) or a number (&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;), also known as the [[return code]].
[[File:Program-entry-point-demonstration-CSharp.png|alt=Example of the main function, in C#.|none|thumb|467x467px|How the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; might look in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] source code. Different parts are labeled for users who know less about programming.]]

== Usage ==
Entry points apply both to source code and to [[executable]] files. However, in day-to-day [[software development]], programmers specify the entry points only in source code, which makes them much better known. Entry points in executable files depend on the [[application binary interface]] (ABI) of the actual operating system, and are generated by the compiler or linker (if not fixed by the ABI). Non-executable [[object file]]s may also have entry points, which are used later by the linker when generating entry points of an executable file.

Entry points are capable of passing on command arguments, variables, or other information as a local variable used by the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; method. This way, specific options may be set upon execution of the program, and then interpreted by the program. Many programs use this as an alternative way to configure different settings, or perform a set variety of actions using a single program.

=== Contemporary ===
In most of today's popular programming languages and operating systems, a [[computer program]] usually only has a single ''entry point''.

In [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[D programming language|D]], [[Rust programming language|Rust]] and [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] programs this is a [[Function (computer science)|function]] named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] it is a [[static method]] named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; (although the class must be specified at the invocation time), and in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] it is a static method named &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.cbclx01/mainf.htm |title=The main() function |publisher=[[IBM]] |work=ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/acy3edy3.aspx |title=Main() and Command-Line Arguments (C# Programming Guide) |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In major operating systems, the standard executable format has a single entry point. In the [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF), used in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]], the entry point is specified in the &lt;code&gt;e_entry&lt;/code&gt; field of the ELF header. In the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (gcc), the entry point used by the linker is the &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt; symbol. Similarly, in the [[Portable Executable]] format, used in [[Microsoft Windows]], the entry point is specified by the &lt;code&gt;AddressOfEntryPoint&lt;/code&gt; field, which is inherited from [[COFF]]. In [[COM file]]s, the entry point is at the fixed [[offset (computer science)|offset]] of 0100h.

One notable modern exception to the single-entry-point paradigm is [[Android (operating system)|Android]].  Unlike applications on most other operating systems, Android applications do not have a single entry point{{snd}} there is no &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function, for example.  Instead of a single entry point, they have essential components (which include activities and services) which the system can instantiate and run as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/android/devguide/guide/topics/fundamentals.html |title=Application Fundamentals |work=Android Development |accessdate=2014-02-19 |publisher=linuxtopia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An occasionally used technique is the [[fat binary]], which consists of several executables for different targets packaged in a single binary. Most commonly, this is implemented by a single overall entry point, which is compatible with all targets and branches to the target-specific entry point. Alternative techniques include storing separate executables in separate [[fork (file system)|forks]], each with its own entry point, which is then selected by the operating system.

=== Historical ===
Historically, and in some contemporary [[legacy system]]s, such as [[OpenVMS|VMS]] and [[OS/400]], computer programs have a multitude of ''entry points'', each corresponding to the different functionalities of the program. The usual way to denote entry points, as used system-wide in VMS and in [[PL/I]] and [[Macro (computer science)|MACRO]] programs, is to append them at the end of the name of the [[executable image]], delimited by a [[dollar sign]] ($), e.g. &lt;code&gt;directory.exe$make&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[Apple I]] computer also used this to some degree. For example, an alternative entry point in Apple I's [[BASIC]] would keep the BASIC program useful when the reset button was accidentally pushed.{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}&lt;!-- in memory? difficult to know without a reference --&gt;

== Exit point ==
In general, programs can exit at any time in an unstructured way, by returning to the operating system or [[crash (computing)|crashing]]. Scripting languages typically end by reaching the end of the program, but for binaries the control must return to the operating system or it will simply run off the end of the process's memory, either executing whatever code is there or (in modern operating systems) resulting in a [[memory access]] violation and termination by the operating system.

Usually, there is not a single exit point specified in a program. However, in other cases runtimes ensure that programs always terminate in a structured way via a single exit point, which is guaranteed unless the runtime itself crashes; this allows cleanup code to be run, such as &lt;code&gt;atexit&lt;/code&gt; handlers. This can be done by either requiring that programs terminate by returning from the main function, by calling a specific exit function, or by the runtime catching exceptions or operating system signals.

==Programming languages==
In many programming languages, the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function is where a program starts its execution. It enables high-level organization of the program's functionality, and typically has access to the [[command-line argument|command arguments]] given to the program when it was executed.

The main function is generally the first programmer-written [[subroutine|function]] that runs when a program starts, and is invoked directly from the system-specific initialization contained in the [[runtime environment]] ([[crt0]] or equivalent). However, some languages can execute user-written functions before main runs, such as the constructors of [[C++]] global objects.

In other languages, notably [[scripting language]]s, execution simply begins at the start of the program.

A non-exhaustive list of programming languages follows, describing their way of defining the main entry point:

===APL===
In [[APL (programming language)|APL]], when a workspace is loaded, the contents of "quad LX" (latent expression) variable is interpreted as an APL expression and executed.

===C and C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], the [[function prototype]] of the main function looks like one of the following:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(void);
int main();

int main(int argc, char **argv);
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env);



// more specifically in C
// NOT according to the ISO C standard 5.1.2.2.1
// BUT in embedded programming depending on the µC, this form is also used
void main (void);


&lt;/source&gt;

The [[parameter (computer science)|parameters]] &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt;, ''argument count'', and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;, ''argument vector'',&lt;ref&gt;argv: the vector term in this variable's name is used in traditional sense to refer to strings.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively give the number and values of the program's [[command-line argument]]s. The names of &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; may be any valid identifier in C, but it is common convention to use these names. In C++, the names are to be taken literally, and the "void" in the parameter list is to be omitted, if strict conformance is desired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.c++/browse_thread/thread/a1e5504b499bc58f Parameter types and names of main]&lt;/ref&gt; Other platform-dependent formats are also allowed by the C and C++ standards, except that in C++ the return type must always be &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.6.1.2, Standard C++ 2011 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[Unix]] (though not [[POSIX.1]]) and [[Windows]] have a third argument giving the program's [[environment variable|environment]], otherwise accessible through &lt;code&gt;getenv&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;[[stdlib.h]]&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]-based operating systems, such as [[macOS]], have a fourth parameter containing arbitrary OS-supplied information, such as the path to the executing binary:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unixjunkie.blogspot.com/2006/02/char-apple-argument-vector.html The &lt;code&gt;char *apple&lt;/code&gt; Argument Vector]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp, char **apple);
&lt;/source&gt;

The value returned from the main function becomes the [[exit status]] of the process, though the C standard only ascribes specific meaning to two values: &lt;code&gt;EXIT_SUCCESS&lt;/code&gt; (traditionally 0) and &lt;code&gt;EXIT_FAILURE&lt;/code&gt;. The meaning of other possible return values is implementation-defined. In case a return value is not defined by the programmer, an implicit &lt;code&gt;return 0;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is inserted by the compiler; this behavior is required by the C++ standard.

It is guaranteed that &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; is non-negative and that &lt;code&gt;argv[argc]&lt;/code&gt; is a [[null pointer]]. By convention, the command-line arguments specified by &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; include the name of the program as the first element if &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; is greater than 0; if a user types a command of "&lt;code&gt;rm file&lt;/code&gt;", the [[shell (computing)|shell]] will initialise the &lt;code&gt;[[rm (Unix)|rm]]&lt;/code&gt; process with &lt;code&gt;argc = 2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argv = {"rm", "file", NULL}&lt;/code&gt;.  As &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; is the name that processes appear under in &lt;code&gt;[[ps (Unix)|ps]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[top (Unix)|top]]&lt;/code&gt; etc., some programs, such as [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]] or those running within an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or [[virtual machine]] (where &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt; would be the name of the host executable), may choose to alter their argv to give a more descriptive &lt;code&gt;argv[0]&lt;/code&gt;, usually by means of the &lt;code&gt;[[Exec (operating system)|exec]]&lt;/code&gt; system call.

The &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; function is special; normally every C and C++ program must define it exactly once.

If declared, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; must be declared as if it has external linkage; it cannot be declared &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;.

In C++, &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; must be in the global [[namespace]] (i.e. &lt;code&gt;::main&lt;/code&gt;), cannot be overloaded, and cannot be a [[member function]], although the name is not otherwise reserved, and may be used for member functions, classes, enumerations, or non-member functions in other namespaces. In C++ (unlike C) &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; cannot be called [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] and cannot have its address taken.

===C#===
When executing a program written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] searches for a static method marked with the &lt;code&gt;.entrypoint&lt;/code&gt; IL directive, which takes either no arguments, or a single argument of type &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;, and has a return type of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, and executes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/02/NETConsoleApps/ |title=Console Applications in .NET, or Teaching a New Dog Old Tricks |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date=2003-06-12 |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
static void Main();
static void Main(string[] args);
static int Main();
static int Main(string[] args);
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how it is done in Java. For versions of &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.

Since C#7.1 there are four more possible signatures of the entry point, which allow asynchronous execution in the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-7.1/async-main.md}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
static Task Main()
static Task&lt;int&gt; Main()
static Task Main(string[])
static Task&lt;int&gt; Main(string[])
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; types are the asynchronous equivalents of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

===Clean===
[[Clean (programming language)|Clean]] is a functional programming language based on graph rewriting. The initial node is called &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; and is of type &lt;code&gt;*World -&gt; *World&lt;/code&gt; if it ''changes'' the world or some fixed type if the program only prints the result after [[graph rewriting|reducing]] &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
Start :: *World -&gt; *World
Start world = startIO ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Or even simpler

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
Start :: String
Start = "Hello, world!"
&lt;/source&gt;

One tells the compiler which option to use to generate the executable file.

===Common Lisp===
ANSI Common Lisp does not define a main function; instead, the code is read and evaluated from top to bottom in a source file. However, the following code will [[Emulator|emulate]] a main function.

&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
(defun hello-main ()
  (format t "Hello World!~%"))

(hello-main)
&lt;/source&gt;

===D===
In [[D (programming language)|D]], the [[function prototype]] of the main function looks like one of the following:

&lt;source lang="D"&gt;
void main();
void main(string[] args);
int main();
int main(string[] args);
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how it is done in C# or Java. For versions of &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.

===FORTRAN===
[[FORTRAN]] does not have a main subroutine or function. Instead a &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; statement as the first line can be used to specify that a program unit is a main program, as shown below. The &lt;code&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/code&gt; statement cannot be used for recursive calls.&lt;ref&gt;XL FORTRAN for [[AIX]]. Language Reference. Third Edition, 1994. [[IBM]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="fortran"&gt;
      PROGRAM HELLO
      PRINT *, "Cint!"
      END PROGRAM HELLO
&lt;/source&gt;

Some versions of Fortran, such as those on the [[IBM System/360]] and successor mainframes, do not support the PROGRAM statement. Many compilers from other software manufacturers will allow a fortran program to be compiled without a PROGRAM statement. In these cases, whatever module that has any non-comment statement where no SUBROUTINE, FUNCTION or BLOCK DATA statement occurs, is considered to be the Main program.

===GNAT===
Using [[GNAT]], the programmer is not required to write a function called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; a source file containing a single subprogram can be compiled to an executable. The binder will however create a package &lt;code&gt;ada_main&lt;/code&gt;, which will contain and export a C-style main function.

===Go===
In [[Go (programming language)|Go]] programming language, program execution starts with the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;package main&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang="go"&gt;
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
&lt;/source&gt;

There is no way to access arguments or a return code outside of the standard library in Go. These can be accessed via &lt;code&gt;os.Args&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;os.Exit&lt;/code&gt; respectively, both of which are included in the &lt;code&gt;"os"&lt;/code&gt; package.

===Haskell===
A [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] program must contain a name called &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; bound to a value of type &lt;code&gt;IO t&lt;/code&gt;, for some type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/modules.html |title=The Haskell 98 Report: Modules |publisher=Haskell.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is a [[monads in functional programming|monad]], which organizes [[Side effect (computer science)|side-effects]] in terms of [[purely functional programming|purely functional]] code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geekrant.wordpress.com/2008/06/23/misconceptions/ Some Haskell Misconceptions: Idiomatic Code, Purity, Laziness, and IO] — on Haskell's monadic IO&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; value represents the side-effects-ful computation done by the program. The result of the computation represented by &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is discarded; that is why &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; usually has type &lt;code&gt;IO ()&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates that the type of the result of the computation is &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, the [[unit type]], which contains no information.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
&lt;/source&gt;

Command line arguments are not given to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;; they must be fetched using another IO action, such as &lt;code&gt;[https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/base-4.11.1.0/System-Environment.html#v%3AgetArgs System.Environment.getArgs]&lt;/code&gt;.

===Java===
[[Java (programming language)|Java]] programs start executing at the main [[method (computer science)|method]], which has the following [[method heading]]:

&lt;source lang="java5"&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
public static void main(String... args)
public static void main(String args[])
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are passed in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;. As in C and C++, the name "&lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;" is special. Java's main methods do not return a value directly, but one can be passed by using the &lt;code&gt;System.exit()&lt;/code&gt; method.

Unlike C, the name of the program is not included in &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt;, because the name of the program is exactly the name of the class that contains the main method called, so it is already known. Also unlike C, the number of arguments need not be included, since arrays in Java have a field that keeps track of how many elements there are.

Another aspect unique to Java is that the main function must be included within a class, and then called manually by the runtime. This is because in Java everything has to be contained within a class. For instance, a [[hello world]] program in Java may look like so:

&lt;source lang="java5"&gt;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

To run this program, one must call &lt;code&gt;java HelloWorld&lt;/code&gt; in the directory where the compiled [[Java class file|class file]] (which itself must be named &lt;code&gt;HelloWorld.class&lt;/code&gt;) exists. Alternatively, executable [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] files use a [[manifest file]] to specify the entry point in a manner that is filesystem-independent from the user's perspective.

===LOGO===
In [[Logo (programming language)|FMSLogo]], the procedures when loaded do not execute. To make them execute, it is necessary to use this code:

 to procname
  ...                 ; Startup commands (such as print [Welcome])
 end

 make "startup [procname]

Note that the variable &lt;code&gt;startup&lt;/code&gt; is used for the startup list of actions, but the convention is that this calls another procedure that runs the actions. That procedure may be of any name.

===OCaml===
[[OCaml]] has no &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function. Programs are evaluated from top to bottom.

Command-line arguments are available in an array named &lt;code&gt;Sys.argv&lt;/code&gt; and the exit status is 0 by default.

Example:
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;

print_endline "Hello World"

&lt;/source&gt;

===Pascal===
In [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], the main procedure is the only unnamed procedure in the program. Because Pascal programs have the procedures and functions in a more rigorous top-down order than C, C++ or Java programs, the main procedure is usually the last procedure in the program. Pascal does not have a special meaning for the name "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" or any similar name.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
program Hello(Output);
begin
  writeln('Hello, world!');
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

Command-line arguments are counted in &lt;code&gt;ParamCount&lt;/code&gt; and accessible as strings by &lt;code&gt;ParamStr(n)&lt;/code&gt;, with n between 0 and &lt;code&gt;ParamCount&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that "unit" or "module" based versions of Pascal start the main module with the PROGRAM keyword, while other separately compiled modules start with UNIT (UCSD/Borland) or MODULE (ISO). The unnamed function in modules is often module initialization, and run before the main program starts.

===Perl===
In [[Perl]], there is no main function. Statements are executed from top to bottom.

Command-line arguments are available in the special array &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike C, &lt;code&gt;@ARGV&lt;/code&gt; does not contain the name of the program, which is &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt;.

===PHP===
PHP does not have a "main" function. Starting from the first line of a PHP script, any code not encapsulated by a function header is executed as soon as it is seen.

===Pike===
In [[Pike (programming language)|Pike]] syntax is similar to that of C and C++.  The execution begins at &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.  The "&lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt;" variable keeps the number of [[Parameter (computer science)|arguments]] passed to the program.  The "&lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt;" variable holds the value associated with the arguments passed to the program.

Example:
&lt;source lang="pike"&gt;
 int main(int argc, array(string) argv)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Python===
[[Python (programming language)|Python]] programs are evaluated top-to-bottom, as is usual in scripting languages: the entry point is the start of the source code. Since definitions must precede use, programs are typically structured with definitions at the top and the code to execute at the bottom (unindented), similar to code for a [[one-pass compiler]], such as in Pascal.

Alternatively, a program can be structured with an explicit &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function containing the code to be executed when a program is executed directly, but which can also be invoked by importing the program as a module and calling the function. This can be done by the following idiom, which relies on the internal variable &lt;code&gt;__name__&lt;/code&gt; being set to &lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; when a program is executed, but not when it is imported as a module (in which case it is instead set to the module name); there are many variants of this structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Python main() functions
|author=Ned Batchelder
|date=6 June 2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import sys

def main(argv):
    n = int(argv[1])
    print(n + 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))
&lt;/source&gt;

In this idiom, the call to the named entry point &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; is explicit, and the interaction with the operating system (receiving the arguments, calling system exit) are done explicitly by library calls, which are ultimately handled by the Python runtime. This contrast with C, where these are done ''implicitly'' by the runtime, based on convention.

=== QB64 ===
The [[QB64]] language has no main function, the code that is not within a function, or subroutine is executed first, from top to bottom:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
print "Hello World! a =";
a = getInteger(1.8d): print a

function getInteger(n as double)
    getInteger = int(n)
end function
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Command line arguments (if any) can be read using the COMMAND$ function:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vb"&gt;
dim shared commandline as string
commandline = COMMAND$

'Several space-separared command line arguments can be read using COMMAND$(n)
commandline1 = COMMAND$(2)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Ruby===
In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], there is no distinct main function. The code written without additional "&lt;code&gt;class .. end&lt;/code&gt;", "&lt;code&gt;module .. end&lt;/code&gt;" enclosures is executed directly, step by step, in context of special "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" object. This object can be referenced using:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):001:0&gt; self
=&gt; main
&lt;/source&gt;

and contain the following properties:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):002:0&gt; self.class
=&gt; Object
irb(main):003:0&gt; self.class.ancestors
=&gt; [Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
&lt;/source&gt;

Methods defined without additional classes/modules are defined as private methods of the "&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;" object, and, consequently, as private methods of almost any other object in Ruby:

&lt;source lang="irb"&gt;
irb(main):004:0&gt; def foo
irb(main):005:1&gt;   42
irb(main):006:1&gt; end
=&gt; nil
irb(main):007:0&gt; foo
=&gt; 42
irb(main):008:0&gt; [].foo
NoMethodError: private method `foo' called for []:Array
	from (irb):8
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
irb(main):009:0&gt; false.foo
NoMethodError: private method `foo' called for false:FalseClass
	from (irb):9
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
&lt;/source&gt;

Number and values of command-line arguments can be determined using the single &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt; constant array:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ irb /dev/tty foo bar

tty(main):001:0&gt; ARGV
ARGV
=&gt; ["foo", "bar"]
tty(main):002:0&gt; ARGV.size
ARGV.size
=&gt; 2
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that first element of &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ARGV[0]&lt;/code&gt;, contains the first command-line argument, not the name of program executed, as in C. The name of program is available using &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$PROGRAM_NAME&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/rubyworld.html#UB Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide, Ruby and Its World] — on Ruby &lt;code&gt;ARGV&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Python, one could use:

&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
  # Put "main" code here
end
&lt;/source&gt;

===Rust===
&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
fn main() {
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Visual Basic===
In [[Visual Basic]], when a project contains no forms, the startup object may be the &lt;code&gt;Main()&lt;/code&gt; procedure. The &lt;code&gt;Command$&lt;/code&gt; function can be optionally used to access the argument portion of the command line used to launch the program:
&lt;source lang="vb"&gt;
Sub Main()
    Debug.Print "Hello World!"
    MsgBox "Arguments if any are: " &amp; Command$
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

===Xojo===
In [[Xojo]], there are two different project types, each with a different main entry point. Desktop (GUI) applications start with the &lt;code&gt;App.Open&lt;/code&gt; event of the project's &lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; object. Console applications start with the &lt;code&gt;App.Run&lt;/code&gt; event of the project's &lt;code&gt;ConsoleApplication&lt;/code&gt; object. In both instances, the main function is automatically generated, and cannot be removed from the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10133">[[File:Jokai tabla.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Historical marker on the Feszty-Jókai Palace]]'''Epreskert Art Colony''' ({{lang-hu|Epreskerti művésztelep}}; the name means "Mulberry Garden" in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) was an [[artists' colony]] in [[Budapest]] in the last decades of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Among the artists who worked and lived there the most important were sculptors [[György Zala (sculptor)|György Zala]] and [[Adolf Huszár]], and painter [[Árpád Feszty]].

==Location==

The artists' colony was located in the [[Terézváros]] district of Budapest (District VI.) in the area of the former Epreskert garden. The colony occupied an oblong shaped block bounded by Bajza, Lendvay, Epreskert (after 1900 Munkácsy Mihály) and Kmety Street. In 1886 the block was divided into ten lots for ateliers. The Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts (now [[Hungarian University of Fine Arts]]) established its campus on the other side of Kmety Street.

==History==

The Epreskert was a municipal garden of [[mulberry tree]]s on the outskirts of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] which remained in agricultural usage until the 1870s. After the opening of [[Andrássy Avenue]] in 1871 the commercial value of the plot went up and urbanization began. In 1879 the municipal council donated a parcel on the corner of Bajza and Lendvay Streets to Adolf Huszár, a renowned sculptor who worked on prestigious municipal projects but was in need of a suitable workshop. Two years later Huszár built an atelier in fashionable [[Neo-Renaissance]] style and became the first artist to live there.

The garden was divided into two by the opening of a new street (called Kmety Street) in 1883. The Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts established its campus on the northern parcel. The southern city block was intended to become an artists' colony. Many famous artists applied for lots but the municipal council was slow to make decisions. The block was divided into nine plots (the tenth was Huszárs' property). In the first round only one plot was apportioned to painter [[Gyula Aggházy]] who built a house on the corner of Epreskert and Kmety Streets in 1884.

In 1886 three plots in Lendvay Street were leased by the municipality to sculptors [[György Zala (sculptor)|György Zala]], [[Gyula Donáth]] and [[Antal Szécsi]]. Kmety Street became the painter's row in 1890 when three plots were leased to [[Árpád Feszty]], [[Ida Konek]] and [[Béla Pállik]]. Good political connections played a larger part in the decision than artistic merits.

Two neighbouring plots on 31-33 Kmety Street remained empty. The parcel was used by the municipality as storage place for cobble stones from 1897 until 1910 when it was sold for a private villa.

The colony flourished in the last decade of the 19th century. Rising property prices in the first decade of the 20th century caused a strong demand for plots suitable for building private villas. After the artists died or moved elsewhere the municipality sold their plots to developers. In 1914 there were only three ateliers in the former colony compared to five private villas, one cultural institution and one empty plot. The artists' colony practically ceased to exist but one atelier survived even after the second world war.

During the [[siege of Budapest]] the city block was seriously damaged. After the war many of ruined buildings were demolished and the plots on Lendvay Street (the former sculptor's row) were acquired by the Soviet authorities. Now this part of the block is used as an extension and garden of the Russian Embassy in Budapest.

==Ateliers==
[[File:Epreskert art.jpg|thumb|right|330px]]
* Villa Huszár (2 Lendvay Street) — The parcel on the corner of Lendvay and Bajza Streets was sold by the municipality to sculptor Adolf Huszár in 1879. The house-cum-atelier was built in 1881 by the plans of [[Kálmán Gerster]] in fashionable Neo-Renaissance style. The garden was larger than the other plots in the colony. Huszár worked on hist last work, the sculpture of Hungarian statesman [[Ferenc Deák]] in his studio until his early death in 1885. The heirs of his estate leased the atelier to other sculptors but later sold the house to a property developer in 1889. The garden was divided and the house was converted to a private villa. It was enlarged and thoroughly rebuilt in 1925–27 by the plans of [[Emil Vidor]]. At present the house belongs to the Russian Embassy in Budapest.
* Atelier Donáth (6 Lendvay Street) — Sculptor Gyula Donáth's atelier was a simple wooden shed erected on the property in 1887. Donáth lived there until his death in 1909 when the studio was dismantled. The plot was sold to a developer but remained unbuilt.
* Atelier Szécsi (8 Lendvay Street) — Sculptor Antal Szécsi's atelier was a simple timber framed building (1886) which was later enlarged by the artist. Szécsi lived in the colony until his death in 1904. The studio was leased by the municipality to sculptor [[Ede Telcs]] who used it for work but never lived here. The studio was leased to architect and sculptor [[Géza Maróti]] in 1911. Maroti moved to the Lendvay Street home in the early 1920s. The council abrogated his contract in 1937 and building was leased to the Hungarian Association of High Frequency Radio Amateurs. It was destroyed during the siege of Budapest.
* Atelier Zala (10 Lendvay Street) — Sculptor György Zala bought a former exhibition pavilion and re-erected it as a studio on the corner of Lendvay and Epreskert Street in 1888. A brick addition contained the flat of the artist and a rented studio for painters. The house was sold to painter [[Zsigmond Vajda]] in 1898. Vajda sold the land to a developer in 1909 who demolished the studio.
* Villa Aggházy (35 Kmety Street) — Painter Gyula Aggházy built his gabled, one storey high villa on the corner of Epreskert and Kmety Street in 1884 by the plans of [[Béla Benczúr]]. The artist sold the house in 1909 to a developer who demolished it for a larger mansion.
* Atelier Kernstok (29 Kmety Street) — [[Animal painter|Animal artist]] [[Béla Pállik]], who was mockingly called "sheep-painter", built his atelier in 1891 by plans of [[Vince Medek]]. Three studios on the second floor were rented to other painters. The house was inherited by his daughter, Margit Pállik in 1908. It was sold in 1916 to sculptor [[Gina Stricker]] who later married to [[avantgarde]] painter [[Károly Kernstok]]. They rebuilt the house in 1936 which remained Kernstok's studio until his death in 1940. The building housed ateliers during the second half of the 20th century. Later it was bought by contemporary architect [[György Vadász]] for the same use.
* Villa Konek (27 Kmety Street) — The small, turreted villa was built for painter Ida Konek in 1890 by [[Gyula Kauser]]. It was an elegant, secluded home for the artist and her older sister. Private exhibitions were held in 1903, 1915 and 1917. The house was destroyed during the siege of Budapest in 1945.

There were three other ateliers in the Epreskert academy campus nearby which belonged to painters [[Gyula Benczúr]] and [[Károly Lotz]], and sculptor [[Alajos Stróbl]]. The studios were places of work and teaching but strictly speaking they were not part of the artists' colony.

==The Feszty-Jókai family==

[[File:Jókai Mór és Nagy Bella fotó.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Jókai with his young wife, Bella Nagy.]] The most important house in the Epreskert artists' colony was the small palace of the Feszty-Jókai family. [[Árpád Feszty]], creator of the famous [[Feszty Cyclorama]] acquired the parcel on the corner of Bajza and Kmety Streets in 1890. He built a small palace in [[Venetian Gothic]] style according to his own plans. The façade was decorated with reliefs by Gyula Donáth and György Zala (both artists lived in the colony) together with the coat-of-arms of the Feszty and Jókai families. Feszti had a two storeys high studio.

The celebrated writer, [[Mór Jókai]] was stepfather of Feszty's wife, [[Róza Jókai]]. He was a widower who chose to live with the young couple. Jókai occupied the upper floor while the Fesztys lived downstairs. Róza Jókai's [[salon (gathering)|salon]] soon became the center of the artistic and social life of Budapest. Ministers, politicians, actors and actresses, curators, writers and painters gathered regularly in the small Venetian palace on Bajza Street. From the older generation [[Kálmán Tisza]] and [[Kálmán Mikszáth]] were regular visitors at Jókai upstairs. In 1894 Jókai celebrated his golden jubilee as an author in the palace.

The golden era of the palace ended with the biggest social scandal of the decade. In 1899 the 74-year-old Jókai suddenly married a young actress, [[Bella Nagy]]. The public and the Fesztys were equally shocked. Jókai left the palace and the family got mixed up in a public debate. In the next few years Feszty ran into a huge debt and was forced to sell the house in 1907.

The palace was bought by the [[Petőfi Literary Society]], which converted it into a literary museum (forerunner of the current [[Petőfi Museum of Literature]]). It was damaged in World War II but was rebuilt in 1947. After the museum moved out the palace was converted into storage place for a natural history collection, and later an atelier for sculptor [[Pál Kő]] in the 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6482">In [[art history]], '''formalism''' is the study of art by analyzing and comparing form and [[Style (visual arts)|style]]. Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes [[composition (art)|compositional]] elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.

==History==
The historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to [[Immanuel Kant]] and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: "Every form of the objects of sense is either ''figure'' (''Gestalt'') or ''play'' (''Spiel''). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (''Reiz'') of colors... may be added, but the delineations (''Zeichnung'') in the... composition (''Komposition'')... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste."&lt;ref&gt;Kant. ''Critique of Judgment''. Section 14.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: "Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the ''Critique of Judgment'' in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Crawford, ''Kant's Aesthetic Theory'' (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1974), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary definition==
The philosopher Nick Zangwill of Glasgow University has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties "that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, ''The Metaphysics of Beauty'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2001), p.&amp;nbsp;56, {{ISBN|0801438209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic has defined formalism in art and architecture as "the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties."&lt;ref&gt;Branko Mitrović, ''Philosophy for architects'' (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, [2011]), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies ''extreme formalists'' who think "that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties," then he defines ''anti-formalist'' thinkers as those who "think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties."&lt;ref name="z84"&gt;Zangwill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of ''moderate formalism'', where its principal exponents defend the principle "that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored."&lt;ref name="z84"/&gt;

The philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled "Deep Formalism", which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: "a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6|title=Aestheticism: Deep Formalism and the Emergence of Modernist Aesthetics|last=Gal|first=Michalle|date=2015|publisher=Peter Lang AG|year=|isbn=9783035199925|location=|pages=14|language=en|doi=10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.

==Uses in art history==
A formal analysis is an academic method in [[art history]] and criticism for [[analysis|analyzing]] works of [[art]]: "In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively".&lt;ref&gt;Review by: Clemency Chase Coggins of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'' edited by Margaret W. Conkey and Christine A. Hastorf, p.&amp;nbsp;233, ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (Summer, 1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34, Maney Publishing, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/529988 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geneva Amateur Operatic Society''' ('''GAOS''') is claimed to be the largest English-speaking amateur operatic society in Europe. Based in [[Geneva]], GAOS was founded in 1971 by a small group of theatre enthusiasts. They produce four productions per season, including their traditional English [[pantomime]] in the winter. GAOS is a [[Non-profit organization]], its members receive no payment and the society makes a point of giving a substantial donations to various charities around Geneva.

The '''Great Books Foundation''', incorporated in the state of [[Illinois]] and based in [[Chicago]], is an independent, nonprofit [[educational organization]] whose mission is to help people think and share ideas. Toward this end, the Foundation publishes collections of classic and modern literature as part of a continuum of reading and discussion programs for children and adults. The foundation has two main programs: Junior Great Books, serving students in kindergarten through high school, and Great Books Discussion for college students, continuing education, and Great Books book groups. The organization derives its income from the sale of books, teacher professional development fees, contributions, and grants.

Established in 1947 by a group of prominent citizens led by [[University of Chicago]] Chancellor [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] and [[Mortimer Adler]], the Great Books Foundation began as a grassroots movement to promote continuing liberal education for the general public. In 1960 the Foundation extended its mission to children with the introduction of Junior Great Books. Since its inception, the Foundation has helped thousands of people throughout the U.S. and in foreign countries begin their own discussion groups in schools, libraries, and community centers. Since 2001, the Foundation has published the quarterly magazine ''[[The Common Review]]''.

Great Books discussions use a distinctive discussion method called "Shared Inquiry", in which the leader starts with an [[open-ended question]] about the meaning of a selection and then asks follow-up questions to help participants develop their ideas. Developed by the Great Books Foundation, ''Shared Inquiry'' is related to [[Socratic method|Socratic]] discussion but is distinguished by the fact that the basic discussion question is one to which the leader does not know the answer.

Sixty years after Adler co-founded the Great Books Foundation, it continues to embrace his insistence that the civil discussion of challenging ideas is a powerful source of personal growth and social engagement. But for most of that history and certainly since the introduction of Junior Great Books in 1960, the foundation has rejected Adler's narrow view of "great books" as almost entirely the product of Western males. Despite a common misconception to the contrary, the foundation promotes the reading and discussion of great literature wherever it is found, including literature by outstanding contemporary authors, women authors, and authors from all over the world.

'''''Haystacks''''' is the common English title for a [[Serial imagery|series]] of [[impressionism|impressionist]] [[painting]]s by [[Claude Monet]]. The principal subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested [[wheat]] (or possibly [[barley]] or [[oats]]: the original French title, '''''Les Meules à Giverny''''', simply means '''''The Stacks at Giverny'''''). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five [[Canvas#Canvas for painting|canvas]] series ([[Wildenstein Index Number|Wildenstein Index Numbers]] 1266-1290) which Monet began near the end of the summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring though Monet also produced earlier paintings using this same stack subject.

The series is famous for the way in which Monet repeated the same subject to show the differing [[light]] and [[atmosphere]] at different times of day, across the [[seasons]] and in many types of [[weather]].

The series is among Monet's most notable work. The largest ''Haystacks'' collections are held at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] and [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] in Paris, with other collections in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=34078&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=41|title=Collection Search Results: Grainstack (Snow Effect)|accessdate=July 3, 2007|year=2007|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205040316/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=34078&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=41|archivedate=December 5, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=32189&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=21|title=Collection Search Results: Grainstack (Sunset)|accessdate=July 3, 2007|year=2007|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027003450/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=32189&amp;coll_keywords=Monet&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=21|archivedate=October 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monet background==
{{main|Claude Monet}}
Monet settled in [[Giverny]] in 1883. Most of his paintings from 1883 until his death 40 years later were of scenes within {{convert|3|km|0}} of his home. Monet was intensely aware of and fascinated by the visual nuances of the region’s landscape and by the endless variations in the days and in the seasons - the stacks were just outside his door.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet had previously painted a single subject in different light and different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] influences were increasingly concerned not only with specific effects but with the overall color harmonies that allowed him an autonomous use of rich color.&lt;ref&gt;House, page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional wisdom was that the stacks were a simple subject but also an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers and friends of the artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Monet undertook to capture the stacks in direct light and then to re-examine them from the same view-point in different, often more muted, light and atmospheric conditions. It was then not unusual for Monet, in search of harmonious transitions within the series, to alter the canvases back in his studio.&lt;ref&gt;"It is worth remembering that the stacks were literally at his doorstep, as photographs of the area make clear {{cite book |first=Paul Hayes |last=Tucker |authorlink=Paul Hayes Tucker |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ojp0NUShY4YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Tucker%2C%20Paul%20Hayes%2C%20Monet%20in%20the%20'90s%3A%20The%20Series%20Paintings%2C%201989&amp;pg=PA95#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts |year=1989 |isbn=9780300049138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series background==
The stacks depicted in the series are commonly referred to in English as hay, wheat or grain-stacks. In reality they stored [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]]s of grain primarily for bread - so [[wheat]] [or possibly [[barley]] or [[oats]]] - and not [[hay]], an animal food. The {{convert|10|to|20|ft|adj=on}} stacks were a way of keeping the sheafs dry until the grain could be separated from the stalks by [[threshing]].&lt;ref name=MiN143&gt;Lemonedes, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The local method of storing and drying unthreshed-grains was to use wheat-straw, or sometimes hay, as a thatched 'roof' for the stack, shielding the wheat, barley or oats from the elements until, once dry-enough, they could be threshed. The [[threshing machine]]s then traveled from village to village. Thus, although the grain was harvested and the stacks were built by July, it often took until the following spring or even later - so through all the light and atmosphere changes of summer, autumn, winter and spring - for all the stacks to be reached by the threshing-machines. Grain storage/drying-stacks like these became common throughout [[Europe]] in the 19th century and survived until the inception of [[combine harvesters]]. Although the shapes of stacks were regional, in [[Normandy]], where Giverny is situated, it was common for them to be round with quite steeply-pitched thatched 'roofs' - just as Monet painted.

The stacks belonged to Monet's farmer-neighbour, Monsieur Quéruel. Noticing the way the light changed on M. Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for overcast conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kelder, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her [[wheelbarrow]] could hold.&lt;ref&gt;The veracity of this story has been doubted: '"When I began I was like the others; I believed that two canvases would suffice, one for gray weather and one for sun! At the time I was painting some stacks.... One day I saw that my light had changed. I said to my stepdaughter: 'Go to the house, if you don't mind, and bring me another canvas!'" And so Monet worked on the story: another canvas! Another! The fact is that ever since he had started to paint he had had the habit of working from the same ''motif'' under different conditions.... And yet there is something new here, a difference of emphasis.' Forge and Gordon, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve carting [[paint]]s, [[easel]]s and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled the scene of the moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks ''[[en plein air]]'', Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.&lt;ref name=MIN139&gt;Lemonedes, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet produced numerous ''Haystacks'' paintings. He painted five paintings (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1213-1217) with stacks as his primary subject during the 1888 harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; His earlier [[Landscape art|landscapes]] (Wildenstein Index Number 900-995, 1073) had included stacks [and also some more-accurately described [[hay]]ricks: that is smaller piles of hay for animal-feed] in an ancillary manner. The general consensus is that only the canvases produced using the 1890 harvest (Wildenstein Index Number 1266-1290) comprise the ''Haystacks'' series proper. However some commentators include additional paintings when referencing this series. For example, the [[Hill-Stead Museum]] talk of their two stack paintings even though one is from the 'proper' 1890 harvest, the other from the 1888 harvest.&lt;ref name=HSM/&gt; 

Monet's ''Haystacks'' series is one of his earliest to rely on repetition to illustrate nuances in his perception across natural variations such as times of day, seasons, and types of weather.  For Monet, the concept of producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and vantage point began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the ''Valley of the Creuse'', and subsequently shown at the [[Art gallery|Galerie]] [[Georges Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; This interest in the serial [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] would continue for the rest of his career.

==Thematic issues==
Although the mundane subject was constant throughout the ''Haystack'' series, the underlying theme may be seen as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series.&lt;ref&gt;So as to return to a painting at the correct moment, "on occasion Monet took the precaution of writing the time of day on the back of his canvases". House, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.&lt;ref name=MIN139/&gt;

Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, Monet focused on ''Haystacks'' and a number of other subjects (other series included the ''Mornings on the [[Seine]],'' ''[[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplar]]s'', ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]],'' the ''[[London Parliament (Monet)|Houses of Parliament]],'' and the ''[[Water Lilies]],'' among others). In order to work on many paintings virtually simultaneously, he would awake before [[dawn]] so as to begin at the earliest time of day:

{{cquote|...for the Early Mornings on the Seine series, he chose to paint at and before dawn, which made it 'an easier subject and simpler lighting than usual', because at this time of day the effects did not change so rapidly; however, this involved him getting up at 3:30 a.m., which seems to have been unprecedented even for so inveterate an early riser as Monet."&lt;ref&gt;House, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the morning progressed and the light changed he would switch to sequentially later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to Alice Monet dated March 29, 1893, Monet wrote of having worked on fourteen paintings in one day at Rouen. House, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt; The process would be repeated over the course of days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.

Certain effects of light only last for a few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera received attention for no more than a few minutes a day.&lt;ref&gt;"In 1883 Jules Laforgue had spoken of a quarter hour as the natural time span for an Impressionist painting, while Monet himself mentioned seven minutes as the limit for one of his Poplar series...and in 1918 talked of effects which lasted 'sometimes three or four minutes at the most'". House, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent [[sunrise]]s, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series.&lt;ref&gt;"The constantly varying weather, rather than any idea of a final pictorial ensemble, remained his initial reason for endlessly multiplying his canvases." House, page 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, different [[hue]]s are evident in each painting, and in each work, [[color]] is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color [[spectrum]]. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.&lt;ref&gt;"In ''Grain Stack at Sunset'' intense brick reds give the shadowed side of the stack an incandescent core, while the light of the sunset haloes the stack with vermilion and yellow, and scatters the lit parts of the field with particles of pink, orange, and mauve." House, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notable painters have been influenced by this particular series including [[Les Fauves]], [[Derain]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck|Vlaminck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impressionist-art-gallery.com/monet_haystacks.html|accessdate=October 1, 2007|year=2006|publisher=Impressionist Art Gallery|title=Monet Haystacks|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009052515/http://www.impressionist-art-gallery.com/monet_haystacks.html|archivedate=October 9, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]'s memoirs refer to the series: “What suddenly became clear to me was the unsuspected power of the palette, which I had not understood before and which surpassed my wildest dreams.”&lt;ref&gt;Excerpts from Kandinsky's memoirs, page 53. [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft5v19n9xh&amp;doc.view=content&amp;chunk.id=d0e2244&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;anchor.id=0&amp;brand=eschol CDlib.org] Retrieved May 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:1274 Grainstacks Snow Effect, Meules, effet de neige, 1890-91, 60 x 100cm, Oil on Canvas, Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, CT.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Grainstacks, Snow Effect'', 1890-91, [[National Gallery of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].]]
The ''Haystacks'' series was a financial success.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p.77"&gt;Tucker, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen of these were exhibited by [[Durand-Ruel]] in May 1891, and every painting sold within days.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p.77"/&gt; The exhibit met with great public acclaim. [[Octave Mirbeau]] described Monet's daring series as representing "what lies beyond progress itself." Others described the stacks as "faces of the landscape" - they represented the [[countryside]] as a retreat from daily problems and home for contentment with nature. [[Camille Pissarro]] said: "These canvases breathe contentment."&lt;ref name=MiN143/&gt; Most of the paintings sold immediately for as much as 1,000 [[franc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"...before the show even opened, Durand-Ruel purchased eight of the fifteen ''Grainstacks'' that the artist would exhibit. In the meantime, Monet had been able to sell two others that he would include in the exhibition...That meant that of the fifteen stacks that went on view in May 1891, ten were already spoken for, leaving only five for anyone who might have been interested." Tucker, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Monet’s prices, in general, began to rise steeply. As a result, he was able to buy outright the house and grounds at [[Giverny]] and to start constructing a [[Nymphaeaceae|waterlily]] [[pond]]. After years of mere subsistence living, he was able to enjoy success.

The series demonstrates his intense study of light and atmospheric conditions and Monet was a perfectionist in his renderings. Monet destroyed more than one series of paintings that he found wanting.&lt;ref&gt;"Many accounts speak of Monet destroying incomplete abortive paintings; with the London series and the Water Lilies of 1903-1909 the destructions seem to have been very extensive. In 1907, when deferring his exhibition of Water Lilies, he told Durand-Ruel that he had destroyed 'at least thirty of them, to my great satisfaction'." House, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this series escaped his own harsh self-criticism and destruction.

==1888-1889 paintings==
From the 1888 harvest, Monet produced three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213-5) against the backdrop of hills along the left bank of the [[Seine]] and a few [[Giverny]] houses to the right. Then, he turned to his left to capture two scenes (1216-7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.&lt;ref&gt;Forge, Andrew, and Gordon, Robert, ''Monet'', Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1989, pp. 156-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Wilhelm Göring''' (or '''Goering''';{{efn|name=spelling}} {{IPA-de|ˈɡøːʁɪŋ|lang|De-HermannWGoering.ogg}}; 12 January 1893&amp;nbsp;– 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) that ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' ("The Blue Max"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].

An early member of the Nazi Party, Göring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, Göring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, Göring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, Göring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].

By 1941, Göring was at the peak of his power and influence, and Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent [[Göring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.

After the war, Göring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] the night before the sentence was to be carried out.

== Early life ==

Göring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst Göring]] (31 October 1839&amp;nbsp;– 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327–330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Göring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert Göring|Albert]]. At the time that Göring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21–22}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann Göring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Göring in 1907, at age 14]]

Göring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the Göring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25–45}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. Göring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22–24}}

Interested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, Göring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–25}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials In 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}

Göring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; Göring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, Göring was stationed at [[Mulhouse]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}}

== World War I ==
{{stack|[[File:Göring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of Göring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}

During the first year of World War I, Göring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[Mülhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&amp;nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]'' ("air combat forces") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Göring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&amp;nbsp;– Göring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, Göring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28–29}}

After completing the pilot's training course, Göring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Zähringer Lion|Zähringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–32}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, Göring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165–166}}

On 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], Göring was made commander of the famed "Flying Circus", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–33}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}

In the last days of the war, Göring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34–36}}

Like many other German veterans, Göring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}

== After World War I ==

Göring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. Göring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, Göring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39–41}}{{efn|name=swastika}}

This was also the first time that Göring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin Göring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''née'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. Göring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when Göring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed Göring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After Göring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}

== Early Nazi career ==
[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|left|upright=1.0|thumb|Göring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]

Göring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-Führer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenführer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin—who liked Hitler—often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Ernst Röhm]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=47}} Hitler later recalled his early association with Göring:

{{quote|text="I liked him. I made him the head of my SA. He is the only one of its heads that ran the SA properly. I gave him a dishevelled rabble. In a very short time he had organised a division of 11,000 men."{{sfn|Hitler|1988|p=168}}|sign=Adolf Hitler|source=}}

Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=49–51}} Inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]], the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Göring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to [[Innsbruck]], where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=57–58}} This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=644}} Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to [[Venice]]. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=59–60}}

Personal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The Görings—with difficulty—raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with [[epilepsy]] and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=61}} He was violent to the point where he had to be confined in a [[straitjacket]], but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=404}} Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=62, 64}} Hitler, who had written ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' while in prison, had been released in December 1924.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=160}} Carin Göring, ill with [[epilepsy]] and tuberculosis,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=146}} died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.

Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in a period of rebuilding and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]] as its head rather than Göring, and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In [[German federal election, 1928|the May 1928 elections]] the NSDAP only obtained 12 seats out of an available 491 in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=118–121}} Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=66}} The [[Great Depression]] led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and [[German federal election, 1930|in the 1930 election]], the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136, 138}} In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], where he met the future [[Pope Pius XII]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=74}}

In the [[German federal election, July 1932|July 1932 election]], the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, the Nazis were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag, and elected Göring to the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}}

== Reichstag fire ==
The [[Reichstag fire]] occurred on the night of 27 February 1933. Göring was one of the first to arrive on the scene. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]]—a Communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. Göring immediately called for a crackdown on Communists.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329–330}}

The Nazis took advantage of the fire to advance their own political aims. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] were suppressed, and some 4,000 Party members were arrested.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=194}} Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but [[Rudolf Diels]], head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=331}} Some researchers, including [[William L. Shirer]] and [[Alan Bullock]], are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=192}}{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=262}}

At the [[Nuremberg trials]], General [[Franz Halder]] testified that Göring admitted responsibility for starting the fire. He said that, at a luncheon held on Hitler's birthday in 1942, Göring said, "The only one who really knows about the Reichstag is I, because I set it on fire!"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=193}} In his own Nuremberg testimony, Göring denied this story.{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial Proceedings, 18 March 1946}}

== Second marriage ==
During the early 1930s, Göring was often in the company of [[Emmy Göring|Emmy Sonnemann]], an actress from [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=111}} They were married on 10 April 1935 in Berlin; the wedding was celebrated on a huge scale. A large reception was held the night before at the Berlin Opera House. Fighter aircraft flew overhead on the night of the reception and the day of the ceremony,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=139–140}} at which Hitler was best man.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=63}} Göring's daughter, [[Edda Göring|Edda]], was born on 2 June 1938.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}}

== Nazi potentate ==
{{Nazism sidebar}}

When Hitler was named [[chancellor of Germany]] in January 1933, Göring was appointed as [[minister without portfolio]], Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} [[Wilhelm Frick]] was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick and head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) [[Heinrich Himmler]] hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with [[Rudolf Diels]] at its head. The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. Göring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}

Hitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst Röhm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=306}} Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=31–35, 39}} Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=38}}

One of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to maintain an air force. After the 1926 signing of the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the [[Luftwaffe]] was formally acknowledged,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=116–117}} with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=364}}

During a cabinet meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler announced that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, to the chagrin of [[Hjalmar Schacht]], the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357–360}} Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=311}} and [[Walther Funk]] took over the position, as well as control of the [[Reichsbank]]. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control under the auspices of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=361}} In July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]] was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=145}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17986, Schorfheide, Lord Edward Frederik Halifax, Hermann Göring crop.jpg|200px|thumb|Göring with [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] at Schorfheide, 20 November 1937]]

In 1938, Göring was involved in the [[Blomberg–Fritsch Affair]], which led to the resignations of the War Minister, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Werner von Blomberg]], and the army commander, General [[Werner von Fritsch]]. Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=116}} Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg. Blomberg was forced to resign. Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=116, 117}} Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. Göring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of ''Generalfeldmarschall''. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=642–644}}

{{main article|Anschluss}}
As minister in charge of the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of [[Styria]] had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=646–652}}

{{main article|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}
Although [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had been named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring continued to involve himself in foreign affairs.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}} That July, he contacted the British government with the idea that he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for [[Czechoslovakia]]. [[Neville Chamberlain]] was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the [[Nuremberg Rally]] that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=194–197}} Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the [[Sudetenland]] to Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=674}} In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president [[Emil Hácha]] with the bombing of [[Prague]]. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]].{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|2001|p=119}}

Although many in the party disliked him,{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} before the war Göring enjoyed widespread personal popularity among the German public because of his perceived sociability, colour and humour.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}}{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}} As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself as a champion of national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}} In Britain and the United States, some viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}}

== World War II ==

=== Success on all fronts ===

Göring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=197, 211}} The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=597}} Later in the day, speaking to the ''Reichstag'', Hitler designated Göring as his successor as Führer of all Germany, "If anything should befall me",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=599}} with Hess as the second alternate.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the [[Polish Air Force]] was defeated within a week.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|pp=177–189}} The ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' seized vital airfields in [[Norway]] and captured [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium. Göring's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Battles of the Netherlands]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Battle of France|France]] in May 1940.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=721, 723}}

After the [[Fall of France]], Hitler awarded Göring the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] for his successful leadership.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}} During the [[1940 Field Marshal Ceremony]], Hitler promoted Göring to the rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]] des Grossdeutschen Reiches'' (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war. Göring had already received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}}

The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=113, 136, 143}} Göring had by then already announced in a radio speech, "If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!",{{sfn|Oestermann|2001|p=157}} something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940.{{sfn|Selwood|2015}} Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, Göring, like Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], commander-in-chief of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy),{{sfn|Raeder|2001|pp=324–325}} was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]]).{{sfn|Bungay|2000|p=337}} Göring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=144}} After their defeat in the [[Battle of Britain]], the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via [[strategic bombing]]. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=500}} By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by [[the Blitz]], though the bombings continued through May 1941.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=145}}

=== Decline on all fronts ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Reprich-012-08, Wolfschanze, Hitler, Ley, Porsche und Göring.jpg|thumb|Hitler meeting Göring and automotive engineer [[Ferdinand Porsche]] at the ''[[Wolf's Lair]]'' in 1942]]
In spite of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began [[Operation Barbarossa]]—the invasion of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft in the first month of fighting.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=178–179}} Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=187}} But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=201}} After the long, but successful, [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|Battle of Smolensk]], Hitler ordered [[Army Group Centre]] to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the [[Battle of Moscow]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=207–213}}

Hitler decided that the summer 1942 campaign would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=404–405}} The [[Battle of Stalingrad]], a major turning point of the war,{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=421}} began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=409}} The [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|Sixth Army]] entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded by the end of November in [[Operation Uranus]], Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=412–413}}{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=329}} The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=932}}

=== War over Germany ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1977-149-13, Hermann Göring, Adolf Hitler, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|Göring with Hitler and [[Albert Speer]], 10 August 1943]]
Meanwhile, the strength of the US and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began [[Defence of the Reich|operations against German targets]]. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|on Cologne]] on 30 May 1942.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=438, 441}} Air raids continued on targets further from England after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on US [[fighter aircraft]]. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as [[Aachen]] in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=378}}

The American [[P-51 Mustang]], with a [[combat radius]] of over {{convert|1800|mi}} when using underwing [[drop tank]]s, began to escort the bombers in large formations to and from the target area in early 1944. From that point onwards, the Luftwaffe began to suffer casualties in aircrews it could not sufficiently replace. By targeting oil refineries and rail communications, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers crippled the German war effort by late 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=461}} German civilians blamed Göring for his failure to protect the homeland.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=447}} Hitler began excluding him from conferences, but continued him in his positions at the head of the Luftwaffe and as plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=296, 297, 299}} As he lost Hitler's trust, Göring began to spend more time at his various residences.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=510}} On [[D-Day]] (6 June 1944), the Luftwaffe only had some 300 fighters and a small number of bombers in the area of the landings; the Allies had a total strength of 11,000 aircraft.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=295, 302}}

=== End of the war ===
{{see also|Göring Telegram}}
[[File:Goeringcaptivity.jpg|thumb|Göring in captivity 9 May 1945]]

As the Soviets approached Berlin, Hitler's efforts to organise the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=725}} His last birthday, celebrated at the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=310}} and its art treasures moved to [[Berchtesgaden]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=722}} Göring arrived at his estate at [[Obersalzberg]] on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=723}} He also stated that Göring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1115}}

OKW operations chief [[Alfred Jodl]] was present for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]], at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason if he tried to take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]], the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}

[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann Göring.ogv|left|thumb|Göring after his capture (May 1945)]]

The telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor and that the telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown. Hitler sent a reply to Göring{{mdash}}prepared with Bormann's help{{mdash}}informing him that, unless he resigned immediately, he would be executed for high treason. Soon afterward, Hitler removed Göring from all of his offices and ordered Göring, his staff, and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=724}} Bormann made an announcement over the radio that Göring had resigned for health reasons.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=318}}

By 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg was under attack by the Allies, so Göring was moved to [[Burg Mauterndorf|his castle at Mauterndorf]]. In his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], Hitler expelled Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed [[Karl Dönitz]], the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, [[Eva Braun]], [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near [[Radstadt]] on 6 May by elements of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army|US Army]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=320–325}} This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1128}}{{clear left}}

== Trial and death ==
[[File:GöringDetentionReport.png|thumb|325px|Prisoner's "mug shot" taken at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice|alt=]]

{{main article|Nuremberg trials}}

Göring was flown to [[Camp Ashcan]], a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at [[Mondorf-les-Bains]], Luxembourg. Here he was weaned off [[dihydrocodeine]] (a mild morphine derivative)—he had been taking the equivalent of three or four grains (260 to 320&amp;nbsp;mg) of morphine a day—and was put on a strict diet; he lost {{convert|60|lb}}. His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=31}} Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to [[Nuremberg]], which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=329–331}}

Göring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled an indictment of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany of works of art and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be "in the sense of the indictment not guilty".{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=336–337}} 

[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Göring (first row, far left) at the [[Nuremberg trial]]]]

The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defence{{mdash}}the first to be presented{{mdash}}lasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=337}} Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of [[Rudolf Hess|Hess]], who was seated beside him.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=341–342}} Göring told US psychiatrist [[Leon Goldensohn]] that the court was "stupid" to try "little fellows" like Funk and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}} He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}}

Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]], a German-speaking US intelligence officer and psychologist, interviewed Göring and the others in prison during the trial.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} Gilbert kept a journal, which he later published as ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''. Here he describes Göring on the evening of 18 April 1946, as the trials were halted for a three-day Easter recess:

[[File:Hermann Goering - Nuremberg2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.02|Göring at the Nuremberg Trials]]

{{quote|sign=Cpt. Gustave Gilbert|source=|Sweating in his cell in the evening, Göring was defensive and deflated and not very happy over the turn the trial was taking. He said that he had no control over the actions or the defense of the others, and that he had never been anti-Semitic himself, had not believed these atrocities, and that several Jews had offered to testify on his behalf.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=278}}}}

On several occasions over the course of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343–347}} When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359–367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H. Jackson]] read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after [[Kristallnacht]], a major [[pogrom]] in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} Later, [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell-Fyfe]] proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the [[Stalag Luft III murders]]{{mdash}}the shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from [[Stalag Luft III]]{{mdash}}in time to have prevented the killings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=371}} He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the [[Hungarian Jews]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=374–375}}

[[File:Goering-corpse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Göring's corpse]]

Göring was found guilty on all four counts and was sentenced to death by hanging. The judgment stated:

{{quote|There is nothing to be said in mitigation. For Göring was often, indeed almost always, the moving force, second only to his leader. He was the leading war aggressor, both as political and as military leader; he was the director of the slave labour programme and the creator of the oppressive programme against the Jews and other races, at home and abroad. All of these crimes he has frankly admitted. On some specific cases there may be conflict of testimony, but in terms of the broad outline, his own admissions are more than sufficiently wide to be conclusive of his guilt. His guilt is unique in its enormity. The record discloses no excuses for this man.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1946}}}}

Göring made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal, but the court refused.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=392–393}} Defying the sentence imposed by his captors, he committed suicide with a [[potassium cyanide]] capsule the night before he was to be hanged.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=964}}

One theory as to how Göring obtained the poison holds that US Army Lieutenant Jack G. Wheelis, who was stationed at the Nuremberg Trials, retrieved the capsules from their hiding place among Göring's personal effects that had been confiscated by the Army and handed them over to the prisoner,{{sfn|Taylor|1992|p=623}} after being bribed by Göring, who gave him his gold watch, pen, and cigarette case.{{sfn|Botting|2006|p=280}} In 2005, former US Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers, who served in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]'s [[26th Infantry Regiment]]{{mdash}}the honour guard for the Nuremberg Trials{{mdash}}claimed he gave Göring "medicine" hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison. Stivers later said that he did not know what was in the pill until after Göring's suicide.{{sfn|BBC News|2005}}

Göring's body, as with those of the men who were executed, was displayed at the execution ground for the witnesses of the executions. The bodies were cremated at [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]], Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the [[Isar]] River.{{sfn|Darnstädt|2005}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=393}}{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=205}}

== Personal properties ==
{{see also|Nazi plunder|Reichswerke Hermann Göring}}
[[File:Göering weapon and baton.jpg|thumb|upright|Göring's ''Reichsmarschall'' baton and [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] revolver. To the left is the silver-bound guest book from [[Carinhall]]. ([[West Point Museum]])]]
Göring's name is closely associated with the Nazi plunder of Jewish property. His name appears 135 times on the [[Nazi plunder#Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index|OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Red Flag Names List]]{{sfn|OSS Reports}} compiled by US Army intelligence in 1945-6 and declassified in 1997.{{sfn|NARA Records}}

The confiscation of Jewish property gave Göring the opportunity to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took [[Political corruption|kickbacks]] from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Spanish Civil War]] via [[Pyrkal]] in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=366–368, 538}}

Göring was appointed Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around this time he became interested in [[Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve|Schorfheide Forest]], where he set aside {{convert|100000|acres|km2}} as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, [[Carinhall]], in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site and placed in a vault on the estate.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=120–123}} The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=244–245}}{{sfn|Rothfeld|2002}} Göring worked closely with the ''Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg'' ([[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]]), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285}} Headed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]], the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285, 291}} The estimated value of his collection—numbering some 1,500 pieces—was $200 million.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=281}}

[[File:Mundur Goeringa.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Göring's uniform on display at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr]]'']]

Göring was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing. He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held;{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=115–116}} his ''Reichsmarschall'' uniform included a jewel-encrusted baton. [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]], the top ''[[Stuka]]'' pilot of the war, recalled twice meeting Göring dressed in outlandish costumes: first, a medieval hunting costume, practicing archery with his doctor; and second, dressed in a red [[toga]] fastened with a golden clasp, smoking an unusually large pipe. Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] once noted Göring wearing a fur coat that looked like what "a high grade prostitute wears to the opera."{{sfn|Fussell|2002|pp=24–25}} He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=122}}

Göring was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=417}} Armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=416–417}} As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Erhard Milch]] told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=417–418}} For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Collar of Annunziata]]. The award reduced him to tears.{{sfn|Mosley|1974|p=280}}

[[File:Standarte des Reichsmarschalls (1941–45).jpg|thumb|Standard, on display at the ''Musée de la Guerre'' in [[Les Invalides]], Paris]]

The design of the ''Reichsmarschall'' standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold [[German eagle]] grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a [[swastika]]. The reverse side of the flag had the ''Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'' ("[[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]]") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.

Though he liked to be called "''der Eiserne''" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, "no matter how rude", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that "he sits down on his stomach".{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|p=330}}{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=65}} One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: "Mission accomplished. Pope unfrocked. Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit."{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=409}}{{clear left}}

== Complicity in the Holocaust ==
{{see also|Luftwaffe#War crimes}}
[[File:Carta Göring.JPG|thumb|Göring's July 1941 letter to [[Reinhard Heydrich]]]]
[[Joseph Goebbels]] and Himmler were far more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that attitude because party politics required him to do so.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} His deputy, [[Erhard Milch]], had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}}

At the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}} Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. "I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government", he claimed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=378}}

In July 1941, Göring issued a memo to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] ordering him to organise the practical details of the [[Final Solution]] to the "Jewish Question". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], and elsewhere. At the [[Wannsee Conference]], held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. Göring did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=259–260}}{{sfn|Blood|2001|p=75}}

Göring directed [[anti-partisan]] operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the [[Białowieża Forest]] between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.{{sfn|Blood|2010|pp=261–262, 266}}

== Support of anti-Nazi brother ==
{{main article|Albert Göring}}

Göring's younger brother Albert despised [[Nazism]], and offered active resistance to the regime, including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps. He was arrested four times, but Hermann secured his release each time. Hermann's daughter [[Edda Göring|Edda]] told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Albert "could certainly help people in need himself financially and with his personal influence, but as soon as it was necessary to involve higher authority or officials, then he had to have the support of my father, which he did get."{{sfn|Burke|2010}}

'''John Heminges''' (spelled Heming, Hemynges&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Frayne. ''Mr. Shakespeare of The Globe.'' Dutton (1941). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and —  in both the [[First Folio]], which he edited, and also on the monument in the graveyard where he is buried — it is spelled Heminge&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Jeffrey.

A&amp;C Black, 2005. p. 105 {{ISBN|9781852853457}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (bapt. 25 November 1566 – 10 October 1630) was an actor in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the playing company for which [[William Shakespeare]] wrote. Along with [[Henry Condell]], he was an editor of the [[First Folio]], the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623. He was also the financial manager for the King's Men.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, Kate. ''Shakespeare's Friends''. Greenwood Publishing Group (2006) {{ISBN|9780275989569}} pp. 129-136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F.

K.]] ''The Elizabethan Stage''. 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923. Vol. 2, pp. 320–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Heminges was baptised at, at St Peter de Witton Church, [[Droitwich Spa|Droitwich]], [[Worcestershire]], on 25 November 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Noseworth, J. M. "A Note on John Heminge". ''The Library'', Volume s5-III, Issue 4, 1 March 1949, Oxford Univ. Press. pp. 287–288&lt;/ref&gt; Sent to [[City of London|London]] at the age of twelve, he was apprenticed for nine years to the City [[Worshipful Company of Grocers|Grocer]] John Collins, becoming a freeman of the Grocers' Company on 24 April 1587. On 10 March 1588 he received a licence to marry Rebecca Knell (née Edwards), the widow of [[William Knell (actor)|William Knell]], an actor with the [[Queen's Men]] who had been killed at [[Thame]], Oxfordshire, in 1587 by John Towne, a fellow actor. Heminges and his sixteen-year-old wife settled in the parish of [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], and had at least thirteen children there between the years 1590 and 1613.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3844321?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] Kathman, David (2004). "Grocers, Goldsmiths, and Drapers: Freemen and Apprentices in the Elizabethan Theater". Shakespeare Quarterly. Vol 55, no. 1. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 1–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Heminges's association with the theatre had begun by 1593, when he and [[Augustine Phillips]] were with [[Lord Strange's Men]]. By the next year he and Phillips had joined the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], later the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3844321?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] Kathman, David (2004). "Grocers, Goldsmiths, and Drapers: Freemen and Apprentices in the Elizabethan Theater". Shakespeare Quarterly. Vol 55, no. 1. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 1–49&lt;/ref&gt; Heminges remained with the Company until his death. [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] records from 1630 state that he received £100 to relieve the Company during a period of plague.

Heminges remained active in the Grocers' Company alongside his theatrical activities; indeed, the two sometimes intertwined. On 13 December 1608 he was admitted as one of the ten [[Coal|seacoal-meters]] for the city of London,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CnANK3yMXGoC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Gurr, Andrew (2004). The Shakespeare Company, 1594–1642. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; citizens appointed to measure the coal imported into the city by sea. Shortly afterwards he took on John Jackson as his deputy. Both Heminges and Jackson later acted as trustees for [[William Shakespeare]] when he purchased the Blackfriars Gatehouse in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3844321?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] Kathman, David (2004). "Grocers, Goldsmiths, and Drapers: Freemen and Apprentices in the Elizabethan Theater". Shakespeare Quarterly. Vol 55, no. 1. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 1–49&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1595 and 1628 Heminges took on ten apprentices with the Grocers' Company. Of these ten, eight appear to have performed for Heminges's company, in both boys' and adult roles. [[Alexander Cooke]] was one of his apprentices. Heminges also built and operated a taphouse at the Globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berry|1987|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heminges was mentioned in Shakespeare's will, along with [[Richard Burbage]] and [[Henry Condell]], each being bequeathed 26 shillings and eightpence to buy [[mourning ring|mourning rings]]. [[Stanley Wells]] and others have wondered if that bequest represented a kind of pact for the three men to create and publish an edition of Shakespeare’s collected plays.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. ''Shakespeare for All Time.'' Oxford University Press (2003) p. 99. {{ISBN|978-0195160932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Charles. ''In Search of Shakespeare''. Harcourt Brace (1985). p. 84-86 {{ISBN|978-0156445535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Hesketh. ''A Life of Shakespeare''. New York, 1961. p. 70 &amp;191&lt;/ref&gt; Burbage died before the publication of the ''First Folio'', but Heminges and Condell became co-editors of the book. They mentioned in their preface, "To the great Variety of Readers", that they wished "the Author himselfe had liv'd to have set forth, and overseen his owne writings", they also mention their own care and pain "to haue collected &amp; publish’d" the works. Their editorial efforts were vital to preserving a number of Shakespeare's plays, some of which might have been lost otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Bate, Jonathan. ''Soul of the Age: A Biography of the Mind of William Shakespeare.'' Random House Publishing Group, 2009. pp. 375, 423, 424. {{ISBN|9781588367815}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmundson, Paul. "His Editors; John Heminges and Henry Condell". ''The Shakespeare Circle.'' Cambridge University Press (2015) p. 315-320. {{ISBN|978-1107699090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a sharer in the Globe Theatre, Heminges’ name, along with the other sharers, is mentioned several times in various legal documents that were discovered by American researcher [[Charles William Wallace]]. The Globe was plagued by lawsuits as the shares were left to beneficiaries who did not have the continued welfare of the company at heart. In one such lawsuit,  Heminges v. Ostler, Heminges was sued by his daughter, Thomasina Ostler over a share of the company. The surviving records do not specify the final outcome of the suit. At his death, Heminges’ shares in the Globe and Blackfriars theatres passed to his son, [[William Heminges]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2 , pp. 322–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit records are valuable to historians for the detailed information they contain regarding the company business.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron, Melissa, D.

Oxford University Press (2012) {{ISBN|9780199566105}} page 431&lt;/ref&gt;

Heminges died in October 1630 in [[Southwark]], and was buried 12 October 1630 at the parish church of St Mary Aldermanbury. In his will he had asked to be buried as close to his wife as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/12/101012890/] Edmond, Mary (2004). "Heminges, John (bap. 1566, d. 1630)".

The extent and nature of Heminges' acting is not entirely clear. He is known to have performed in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' and ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (in both cases, alongside Shakespeare). A Jacobean inscription in the 1616 Jonson [[Folio (printing)|folio]] lists him playing the role of Corbaccio in ''[[Volpone]]''; since the same list includes [[Nathan Field]], who did not join the King's Men until 1616, it seems that Heminges continued to act, at least intermittently, into his fifties. [[Edmond Malone]] reported seeing Heminges' name associated with the role of [[Falstaff]]; there is, however, no other evidence of this connection. There is little more evidence to substantiate the claim later made by an actor to [[Alexander Pope]] that Heminges was a tragedian. Of his activities as manager more is known. Court documents relating to the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] generally list Heminges as the recipient of money due the company; the records of [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]] indicate that Heminges at least sometimes served as the point of contact between the company and the [[Master of the Revels]]. He appears to have owned a structure abutting the [[Globe Theatre]], which may have been used as an alehouse. He served as trustee for Shakespeare when the latter purchased a house in [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] in 1613.

'''Sir Joshua Reynolds''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|RA|FRS|FRSA}} (16 July 1723 – 23 February 1792) was an English painter, specialising in portraits.[[John Russell (art critic) | John Russell]] said he was one of the major European painters of the 18th century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/arts/art-view-anybody-who-was-somebody-knocked-at-his-door.html|title=ART VIEW; ANYBODY WHO WAS SOMEBODY KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR|first=John|last=Russell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted the [[Grand manner|"Grand Style"]] in painting which depended on idealization of the imperfect. He was a founder and first president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1769. In 2018, the 250th anniversary of the founding of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]], UK was celebrated, of which Sir Joshua Reynolds was the first president. 

==Early life==
[[File:Self-portrait c.1747-9 by Joshua Reynolds (2).jpg|thumb|Joshua Reynolds, ''Self-portrait'', aged about 24]]
[[File:PlymptonOldGrammarSchool Devon.JPG|thumb|[[Plympton Grammar School|Old Grammar School, Plympton]], founded 1658, built 1664, attended by Joshua Reynolds whose father was headmaster]]
Reynolds was born in [[Plympton]], [[Devon]], on 16 July 1723&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; the third son of the Rev. Samuel Reynolds, master of the [[Plympton Grammar School|Plympton Free Grammar School]] in the town. His father had been a fellow of [[Balliol College]], Oxford, but did not send any of his sons to the university.&lt;ref name=penny1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|pages=17–18|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of his sisters was [[Mary Palmer]] (1716–1794), seven years his senior, author of ''Devonshire Dialogue'', whose fondness for drawing is said to have had much influence on him when a boy. In 1740 she provided £60, half of the premium paid to [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]] the portrait-painter, for Joshua's pupilage, and nine years later advanced money for his expenses in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Elizabeth, Biography of Mary Palmer, Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Vol.43&lt;/ref&gt; His other siblings included [[Frances Reynolds]] and [[Elizabeth Johnson (pamphleteer)|Elizabeth Johnson]].

As a boy, he came under the influence of [[Zachariah Mudge (clergyman)|Zachariah Mudge]], whose Platonistic philosophy stayed with him all his life. Reynolds made extracts in his [[commonplace book]] from [[Theophrastus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Marcus Antonius]], [[Ovid]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Dryden]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Richard Steele]], [[Aphra Behn]], and passages on art theory by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy]], and [[André Félibien]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Martin Postle, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23429 Reynolds, Sir  Joshua  (1723–1792)]’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009. Retrieved 24 Sep 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The work that came to have the most influential impact on Reynolds was [[Jonathan Richardson]]'s ''An Essay on the Theory of Painting'' (1715). Reynolds' annotated copy was lost for nearly two hundred years until it appeared in a Cambridge bookshop, inscribed with the signature ‘J. Reynolds Pictor’, and is now in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Joshua Reynolds by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|150px|Self-portrait, aged 17, entitled, ''Uffizi Self-portrait'']]
Having shown an early interest in art, Reynolds was apprenticed in 1740 to the fashionable London portrait painter [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]], who had been born in Devon.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt; Hudson had a collection of Old Master drawings, including some by [[Guercino]], of which  Reynolds made copies.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt;  Although apprenticed to Hudson for four years, Reynolds remained with him only until summer 1743.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt; Having left Hudson, Reynolds worked for some time as a portrait-painter in Plymouth Dock (now [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]). He returned to London before the end of 1744, but following his father's death in late 1745 he shared a house in Plymouth Dock with his sisters.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt;

In 1749, Reynolds met Commodore [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]], who invited him to join [[HMS Centurion (1732)|HMS ''Centurion'']], of which he had command, on a voyage to the Mediterranean. While with the ship he visited Lisbon, Cadiz, Algiers, and Minorca. From Minorca he travelled to Livorno in Italy, and then to Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, pp. 35–7&lt;/ref&gt; where he spent two years,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; studying the Old Masters and acquiring a taste for the "Grand Style".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Lord Edgcumbe, who had known Reynolds as a boy and introduced him to Keppel, suggested he should study with [[Pompeo Batoni]], the leading painter in Rome, but Reynolds replied that he had nothing to learn from him.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt; While in Rome he suffered a severe cold, which left him partially deaf, and, as a result, he began to carry a small [[ear trumpet]] with which he is often pictured.

Reynolds travelled homeward overland via Florence, Bologna, Venice,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, pp. 62–5&lt;/ref&gt; and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by [[Giuseppe Filippo Liberati Marchi|Giuseppe Marchi]], then aged about 17.&lt;ref name=marchi/&gt; Apart from a brief interlude in 1770, Marchi remained in Reynolds' employment as a studio assistant for the rest of  the artist's career.&lt;ref name=marchi&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Giuseppe Marchi|page=181|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his arrival in England in October 1752, Reynolds spent three months in Devon,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; before establishing himself in London, where he remained for the rest of his life. He took rooms in [[St Martin's Lane]], before moving to Great Newport Street, his sister Frances acted as his housekeeper.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He achieved success rapidly, and was extremely prolific.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.102. His pocket book records him as painting 150 sitters in 1758 alone.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Edgecumbe recommended the Duke of Devonshire and Duke of Grafton to sit for him, and other peers followed, including the Duke of Cumberland, third son of George II,&lt;ref name=penny22&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|page=22|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; in whose portrait, according to [[Nicholas Penny]] "bulk is brilliantly converted into power".&lt;ref name=penny22/&gt; In 1760 Reynolds moved into a large house, with space to show his works and accommodate his assistants, on the west side of [[Leicester Square|Leicester Fields]] (now Leicester Square).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|page=24|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Joshua Reynolds Self Portrait.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|''Self-portrait'']]
Alongside ambitious full-length portraits, Reynolds painted large numbers of smaller works. In the late 1750s, at the height of the social season, he received five or six sitters a day, each for an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|pages=17–8|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1761 Reynolds could command a fee of 80 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] for a full-length portrait; in 1764 he was paid 100 guineas for a portrait of [[John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Burghersh]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' ''Sale Of The Vaile And Other Pictures'' 25 May 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothing of Reynolds' sitters was usually painted by either one of his pupils,&lt;ref name=northcote/&gt; his studio assistant Giuseppe Marchi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Tate Gallery|title=Suzanna Beckford 1756|accessdate=3 July 2016|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/reynolds-suzanna-beckford-n05799/text-summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the specialist drapery painter [[Peter Toms (painter)|Peter Toms]].&lt;ref name=northcote&gt;{{cite book|title=The life of Sir Joshua Reynolds |volume=2|first=James |last=Northcote:| page=26|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Northcote, his pupil, wrote of this arrangement that "the imitation of particular stuffs is not the work of genius, but is to be acquired easily by practice, and this was what his pupils could do by care and time more than he himself chose to bestow; but his own slight and masterly work was still the best."&lt;ref name=northcote/&gt; Lay figures were used to model the clothes.&lt;ref name=penny22/&gt;
 
Reynolds often adapted the poses of his subjects from the works of earlier artists, a practice mocked by [[Nathaniel Hone the Elder|Nathaniel Hone]] in a painting called ''The Conjuror'' submitted to the Royal Academy exhibition of 1775, and now in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. It shows a figure representing, though not resembling, Reynolds, seated in front of a cascade of prints from which Reynolds had borrowed with varying degrees of subtlety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Reynolds and Hone|first=John|last=Newman|pages=344–54|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not known principally for his landscapes, Reynolds did paint in this genre. He had an excellent vantage from his house, [[Wick House, Richmond Hill|Wick House]], on [[Richmond Hill, London|Richmond Hill]], and painted the view in about 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/local_history_richmond_hill.pdf|publisher=London Borough of Richmond|title=Local History RichmondHill|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204050838/http://www.richmond.gov.uk/local_history_richmond_hill.pdf|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Age of Innocence - Reynolds.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Age of Innocence (painting)|The Age of Innocence]]'' {{circa|1788}}, Reynolds emphasized the natural grace of children in his paintings]]
Reynolds also was recognized for his portraits of children. He emphasized the innocence and natural grace of children when depicting them. His 1788 portrait, [[The Age of Innocence (1788 painting)|''Age of Innocence'']], is his best known character study of a child. The subject of the painting is not known, although conjecture includes Theophila Gwatkin, his great niece, and Lady Anne Spencer, the youngest daughter of the fourth Duke of Marlborough.

===The Club===
Reynolds worked long hours in his studio, rarely taking a holiday. He was gregarious and keenly intellectual, with many friends from London's intelligentsia, numbered amongst whom were [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Samuel Johnson]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Giuseppe Baretti]], [[Henry Thrale]], [[David Garrick]], and artist [[Angelica Kauffman]]. Johnson said in 1778: "Reynolds is too much under [Charles James] Fox and Burke at present. He is under the ''Fox star'' and the ''Irish constellation'' [meaning Burke]. He is always under some planet".&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 923.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his popularity as a portrait painter, Reynolds enjoyed constant interaction with the wealthy and famous men and women of the day, and it was he who brought together the figures of [[The Club (dining club)|"The" Club]]. It was founded in 1764 and met in a suite of rooms on the first floor of the Turks Head at 9 Gerrard Street, now marked by a plaque. Original members included Burke, [[Bennet Langton]], [[Topham Beauclerk]], Goldsmith, Anthony Chamier, [[Thomas Hawkins (literary editor)|Thomas Hawkins]], and Nugent, to be joined by Garrick, [[James Boswell|Boswell]], and Sheridan. In ten years the membership had risen to 35. The Club met every Monday evening for supper and conversation and continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning. In later years, it met fortnightly during Parliamentary sessions. When in 1783 the landlord of the Turks Head died and the property was sold, The Club moved to Sackville Street.&lt;ref&gt;City of Westminster green plaques {{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Academy===
[[File:Loton Park c1870.jpg|thumb|The hall at [[Loton Park]], {{circa|1870}}. Showing, in situ, on the far wall Reynolds' ''Frances Anne Crewe (miss Greville), as St. [[Genevieve]]'', {{circa|1773}}]]
Reynolds was one of the earliest members of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], helped found the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], and in 1768 became the first president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], a position he was to hold until his death. In 1769, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], only the second artist to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;Wendorf, Richard, ''Sir Joshua Reynolds: The Painter in Society'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1998), p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''Discourses'', a series of lectures delivered at the Academy  between 1769 and 1790, are remembered for their sensitivity and perception. In one lecture he expressed the opinion that "invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory." William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of Reynolds ' there is much ingenuity and originality in all his academic discourses, replete with classical knowledge of his art, acute remarks on the works of others,  and general taste and discernment'.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, William ''The Four Ages including essays on various subjects'', Cadell &amp; Davies, London 1798&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds and the Royal Academy received a mixed reception. Critics included [[William Blake]] who published the vitriolic ''Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses'' in 1808. [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]] were fervent acolytes: Turner requested he be laid to rest at Reynolds' side, and Northcote, who spent four years as Reynolds' pupil, wrote to his family "I know him thoroughly, and all his faults, I am sure, and yet almost worship him."

The Royal Academy of Art in London celebrated their 250th anniversary in 2018, since their opening in 1768. This became an impetus for galleries and museums across the UK to celebrate "the making, debating and exhibiting art at the Royal Academy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/ra250uk|title=RA250 UK|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waddedson manor was amongst the historic houses that supported Sir Joshua Reynolds's influence at the academy, acknowledging how:
[[File:Waddesdon 2468.jpg|thumb|Reynolds's 'Mrs Sheridan in the character of St Cecilia' was considered by the artist's nephew as a 'sight worth coming to Devonshire to see, I cannot suppose that there was ever a greater Beauty in the world, nor even Helen or Cleopatra could have exceeded her', 1775, [[Waddesdon Manor]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[He] transformed British painting with portraits and subject pictures that engaged their audience's knowledge, imagination, memory and emotions... As an eloquent teacher and art theorist, he used his role at the head of the Royal Academy to raise the status of art and artists of Britain. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waddesdon.org.uk/joshua-reynolds/|title=Joshua Reynolds digital trail, Waddesdon Manor|last=Carey|first=Juliet|date=30 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Lord Keppel''===
[[File:Augustus Keppel, Viscount Keppel by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Augustus Keppel|Lord Keppel]]'' (1779)]]
In the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] against the French in 1778, [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Lord Keppel]] commanded the [[English Channel|Channel]] Fleet and the outcome resulted in no clear winner; Keppel ordered the attack be renewed and was obeyed except by Sir [[Hugh Palliser]], who commanded the rear, and the French escaped bombardment. A dispute between Keppel and Palliser arose and Palliser brought charges of misconduct and neglect of duty against Keppel and the Admiralty decided to court-martial him. On 11 February 1779 Keppel was acquitted of all charges and became a national hero. One of Keppel's lawyers commissioned Sir [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]] to paint a portrait of Keppel but Keppel redirected it to Reynolds. Reynolds alluded to Keppel's trial in the painting by painting his hand on his sword, reflecting the presiding officer's words at the court-martial: "In delivering to you your sword, I am to congratulate you on its being restored to you with so much honour".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, pp. 350–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal Painter in Ordinary to the King===
On 10 August 1784 [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] died and the office of [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[King George III]] became vacant. [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] felt that he had a good chance of securing it, but Reynolds felt he deserved it and threatened to resign the presidency of the Royal Academy if he did not receive it. Reynolds noted in his pocket book: "Sept. 1, 2½, to attend at the Lord Chancellor's Office to be sworn in painter to the King".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not make Reynolds happy, however, as he wrote to Boswell: "If I had known what a shabby miserable place it is, I would not have asked for it; besides as things have turned out I think a certain person is not worth speaking to, nor speaking of", presumably meaning the king.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 427"&gt;McIntyre, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds wrote to [[Jonathan Shipley]], [[Bishop of St Asaph]], a few weeks later: "Your Lordship congratulation on my succeeding Mr. Ramsay I take very kindly, but it is a most miserable office, it is reduced from two hundred to thirty-eight pounds per annum, the Kings Rat catcher I believe is a better place, and I am to be paid only a fourth part of what I have from other people, so that the Portraits of their Majesties are not likely to be better done now, than they used to be, I should be ruined if I was to paint them myself".&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 427"/&gt;

===''Lord Heathfield''===
[[File:George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield - by Joshua Reynolds - Project Gutenberg eText 19009.jpg|thumb|''[[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lord Heathfield]]'' (1787)]]
In 1787 Reynolds painted the portrait of [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lord Heathfield]], who became a national hero for the successful defence of [[Gibraltar]] in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Great Siege]] from 1779 to 1783 against the combined forces of France and Spain. Heathfield is depicted against a background of clouds and cannon smoke, wearing the uniform of the 15th Light Dragoons and clasping the key of the Rock, its chain wrapped twice around his right hand.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Constable]] said in the 1830s that it was "almost a history of the defence of Gibraltar".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Desmond Shawe-Taylor has claimed that the portrait may have a religious meaning, Heathfield holding the key similar to St. Peter (Jesus' "rock") possessing the keys to Heaven, Heathfield "the rock upon which Britannia builds her military interests".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Shawe-Taylor, ''The Georgians: Eighteenth-Century Portraiture and Society'' (London: Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1990), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1789, Reynolds lost the sight of his left eye, which forced him into retirement. In 1791 [[James Boswell]] dedicated his ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' to Reynolds. Reynolds  agreed with Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' and, writing in early 1791, expressed his belief that the ''ancien régime'' of France had fallen due to spending too much time tending, as he puts it; &lt;blockquote&gt;to the splendor of the foliage, to the neglect of the stirring the earth about the roots. They cultivated only those arts which could add splendor to the nation, to the neglect of those which supported it – They neglected Trade &amp; substantial Manufacture...but does it follow that a total revolution is necessary that because we have given ourselves up too much to the ornaments of life, we will now have none at all.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; When attending a dinner at Holland House, Fox's niece Caroline was sat next to Reynolds and "burst out into glorification of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] &amp;ndash; and was grievously chilled and checked by her neighbour's cautious and unsympathetic tone".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 1791 at a dinner at the Freemasons' Tavern to mark the king's birthday, Reynolds drank to the toasts "GOD ''save the'' KING!" and "May our glorious Constitution under which the arts flourish, be immortal!", in what was reported by the ''Public Advertiser'' as "a fervour truly patriotick". Reynolds "filled the chair with a most convivial glee".&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 523"&gt;McIntyre, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to town from Burke's house in [[Beaconsfield]] and [[Edmond Malone]] wrote that "we left his carriage at the Inn at Hayes, and walked five miles on the road, in a warm day, without his complaining of any fatigue".&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 523"/&gt;

Later that month Reynolds suffered from a swelling over his left eye and had to be purged by a surgeon. In October he was too ill to take the president's chair and in November Fanny Burney recorded that &lt;blockquote&gt;I had long languished to see that kindly zealous friend, but his ill health had intimidated me from making the attempt": "He had a bandage over one eye, and the other shaded with a green half-bonnet. He seemed serious even to sadness, though extremely kind. 'I am very glad,' he said, in a meek voice and dejected accent, 'to see you again, and I wish I could see you better! but I have only one eye now, and hardly that.' I was really quite touched.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, pp. 523–524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On 5 November Reynolds, fearing he might not have an opportunity to write a will, wrote a memorandum intended to be his last will and testament, with [[Edmund Burke]], [[Edmond Malone]], and [[Philip Metcalfe]] named as executors. On 10 November Reynolds wrote to Benjamin West to resign the presidency, but the General Assembly agreed he should be re-elected, with Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] and West to deputise for him.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 524–525"&gt;McIntyre, pp. 524–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors [[Richard Warren]] and Sir [[George Baker, 1st Baronet|George Baker]] believed Reynolds' illness to be psychological and they bled his neck "with a view of drawing the humour from his eyes" but the effect, in the view of his niece, was that it seemed "as if the 'principle of life' were gone" from Reynolds. On New Year's Day 1792 Reynolds became "seized with sickness" and from that point could not keep down food.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 524–525"/&gt;
Reynolds died on 23 February 1792 at his house in [[Leicester Fields]] in London between eight and nine in the evening.

Burke was present on the night Reynolds died, and was moved within hours to write a eulogy of Reynolds starting with the following sentiments: "Sir Joshua Reynolds was on very many accounts one of the most memorable men of his Time. He was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant Arts to the other Glories of his Country. In Taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in the richness and Harmony of colouring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned Ages." Burke's tribute was well received and one journalist called it "the eulogium of [[Apelles]] pronounced by [[Pericles]]".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds was buried at [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. In 1903, [[Statue of Joshua Reynolds|a statue]], by [[Alfred Drury]], was erected in his honour in Annenberg Courtyard of [[Burlington House]], home of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name="LR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/burlington-house-courtyard-joshua-reynolds|title=Burlington House courtyard – Joshua Reynolds|publisher=London Remembers|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the statue are fountains and lights, installed in 2000, arranged in the pattern of a star chart at midnight on the night of Reynolds' birth. The planets are marked by granite discs, and the Moon by a water recess. &lt;ref name="AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burlingtonhouse.org/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=Burlington House|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal characteristics==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Gilbert Stuart Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|''Joshua Reynolds'' painted by American artist [[Gilbert Stuart]], oil on canvas, 1784]]

In appearance Reynolds was not striking. Slight, he was about 5'6" with dark brown curls, a florid complexion and features that [[James Boswell]] thought were "rather too largely and strongly limned." He had a broad face and a cleft chin, and the bridge of his nose was slightly dented; his skin was scarred by smallpox and his upper lip disfigured as a result of falling from a horse as a young man. [[Edmond Malone]] asserted that "his appearance at first sight impressed the spectator with the idea of a well-born and well-bred English gentleman."

In his mature years he suffered from deafness, as recorded by [[Fanny Burney]], although this did not impede his lively social life (he used an ear trumpet).&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned for his placidity, Reynolds often claimed that he "hated nobody". Never quite losing his Devonshire accent, he was not only an amiable and original conversationalist, but a friendly and generous host, so that [[Fanny Burney]] recorded in her diary that he had "a suavity of disposition that set everybody at their ease in his society", and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] believed "of all the polite men of that age, Joshua Reynolds was the finest gentleman." Dr. Johnson commented on the "inoffensiveness" of his nature; [[Edmund Burke]] noted his "strong turn for humor". Thomas Bernard, who later became [[List of Anglican Bishops of Killaloe|Bishop of Killaloe]], wrote in his closing verses on Reynolds stating:

[[File:Miniature Portrait of Sir Joshua Reynolds by William Grimaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Enamel Miniature Portrait of ''Sir Joshua Reynolds'' by William Grimaldi. Dated 1811]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Thou say'st not only skill is gained
But genius too may be attained
By studious imitation;
Thy temper mild, thy genius fine
I'll copy till I make them mine
By constant application.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some, such as [[Hester Lynch Piozzi]], construed Reynolds' equable calm as cool and unfeeling.

It is to this lukewarm temperament that [[Frederick W. Hilles]], Bodman Professor of English Literature at [[Yale University|Yale]] attributes Reynolds' never having married. In the editorial notes of his compendium ''Portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds'', Hilles theorizes that "as a corollary one might say that he [Reynolds] was somewhat lacking in a capacity for love", and cites Boswell's notary papers: "He said the reason he would never marry was that every woman whom he liked had grown indifferent to him, and he had been &lt;u&gt;glad&lt;/u&gt; he did not marry her." Reynolds' own sister, Frances, who lived with him as housekeeper, took her own negative opinion further still, thinking him "a gloomy tyrant". The presence of family compensated Reynolds for the absence of a wife; he wrote on one occasion to his friend [[Bennet Langton]], that both his sister and niece were away from home "so that I am quite a bachelor". 

Biographer [[Ian McIntyre]] discusses the possibility of Reynolds having enjoyed sexual rendezvous with certain clients, such as Nelly O'Brien (or "My Lady O'Brien", as he playfully dubbed her) and [[Kitty Fisher]], who visited his house for more sittings than were strictly necessary. [[Dan Cruickshank]] in his book ''London's Sinful Secret'' summarized Reynolds as having visited and re-visited various reputed red light districts in London after his return from Italy as a possible contributor to his medical condition and appearance due to commonly contracted disease in those areas of London.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Cruickshank]], ''London's Sinful Secret'', p.92. St. Martin's Press, New York (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot''''' is a 2012 non-fiction book by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Martin Dugard (author)|Martin Dugard]] about the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of the 35th [[President of the United States]] [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill O'Reilly to Pen Book on Kennedy Assassination|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-oreilly-john-f-kennedy-assassination-292017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=21 December 2012|first=Andy|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a follow-up to O'Reilly's 2011 book ''[[Killing Lincoln]]''. ''Killing Kennedy'' was released on October 2, 2012 through [[Henry Holt and Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JFK assassination gets the O'Reilly treatment|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2012/10/01/bill-oreilly-jfk-assassination/1591991/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=21 December 2012|first1=Bob|last1=Minzesheimer|date=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In ''Killing Kennedy'' the authors narrate the events leading up to the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] of President Kennedy as well as the event's aftermath. O'Reilly and Dugard also focus on the element of the growing [[Cold War]], Kennedy's attempt to deal with the rise of [[Communism]], and the potential threat from organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Killing Kennedy' Is Intriguing|url=http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/history/info-10-2012/bill-oreilly-discusses-jfk-assassination.html|publisher=AARP Radio|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical response to ''Killing Kennedy'' was mixed, with ''[[The New York Times]] ''writing that the book was at times disappointing but that it "picks up strength as it heads for its date with destiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unabashed in the Face of Tragedy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/books/killing-kennedy-by-bill-oreilly-and-martin-dugard.html?_r=0/|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=7 December 2012|first=Janet|last=Maslin|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been criticized for a "lack of citation and occasional 'literary liberties'". For example, in the prologue, the authors write, "Kennedy is the youngest president ever elected. Eisenhower is the oldest."&lt;ref&gt;O'Reily &amp; Dugard, Killing Kennedy (2012), Prologue&lt;/ref&gt; While Kennedy was the youngest president ever elected at the time of his inauguration and remains so today, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was not the oldest ever elected even in 1961 at the time of Kennedy's inauguration. [[William Henry Harrison]] was the oldest president ever elected as of 1961. However, in 1961 at the end of his term Eisenhower was the oldest president to date, as Harrison died one month into his term at the age of 68 years 54 days. Eisenhower was 70 years 98 days old on the day of Kennedy's inauguration.

O'Reilly has stated that he and Dugard wrote the book to be "fun" and "to get people engaged with their country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill O'Reilly returns to presidential assassinations with his new book 'Killing Kennedy'|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2012/1004/Bill-O-Reilly-returns-to-presidential-assassinations-with-his-new-book-Killing-Kennedy|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book sold 118,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Riordan, O'Reilly Post Huge Debuts|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/54298-riordan-o-reilly-post-huge-debuts.html|work=publishersweekly.com|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=May 26, 2013|author=Publishers Weekly|authorlink=Publishers Weekly|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another passage where O'Reilly claims he was present outside the Florida home of alleged conspirator [[George de Mohrenschildt]] when he committed suicide has been shown by several sources to be false, as he was known not to be in the state at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O'Reilly Lied About Suicide Of JFK Assassination Figure, Former Colleagues Say|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/02/24/oreilly-lied-about-suicide-of-jfk-assassination/202655|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico-Mar2-2015" &gt;

After the success of ''[[Killing Lincoln (film)|Killing Lincoln]]'', [[National Geographic Channel]] announced it would produce a film adaptation of ''Killing Kennedy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/537540/bill-oreillys-killing-lincoln-sets-natgeo-ratings-record/ | title=Bill O'Reilly's 'Killing Lincoln' Sets NatGeo Ratings Record | work=Inquistir, Ld. | publisher=''The Inquistir'' | date=February 21, 2013 | accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/02/18/killing-lincoln-gives-natgeo-record-ratings/ | author=Hibberd, James | title='Killing Lincoln' gives NatGeo record ratings | work=''[[Entertainment Weekly]] Inc.'' | date=February 18, 2013 | accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, it was announced that [[Rob Lowe]] was to play [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

A '''library''' is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/library|title=Library – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|website=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both.&lt;ref&gt;"Library ... collection of books, public or private; room or building where these are kept; similar collection of films, records, computer routines, etc. or place where they are kept; series of books issued in similar bindings as set." – Allen, R. E., ed. (1984) ''The Pocket Oxford Dictionary of Current English''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; A library's collection can include [[book]]s, [[Periodical literature|periodicals]], [[newspaper]]s, [[manuscript]]s, [[film]]s, [[map collection|maps]], [[print room|prints]], [[document]]s, [[microform]], [[compact disc|CDs]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[videotape]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Discs]], [[e-book]]s, [[audiobook]]s, [[database]]s, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a [[bookcase]] is represented by ''Bibliotheca'' and ''Bibliothēkē'' (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean ''library'' in many modern languages, e.g. French ''bibliothèque''.

The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]]—the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in [[Sumer]], some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in [[classical Greece]] in the 5th century BC. In the 6th century, at the very close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of [[Imperial Library of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]].

A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of [[librarian]]s who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the [[Internet]].

Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to [[information]] in many formats and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources. Libraries are increasingly becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. As community centers, libraries are also becoming increasingly important in helping communities mobilize and organize for their rights. The relationship between [[librarianship and human rights]] works to ensure that the rights of cultural minorities, immigrants, the homeless, the disabled, LGBTQ community, as well as other marginalized groups are not infringed upon as protected in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

The first libraries consisted of [[archive]]s of the [[Writing#The beginning of writing|earliest form of writing]]—the [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]] discovered in temple rooms in [[Sumer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ECBkVPQkNSsC&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Libraries in the Ancient World |first=Lionel |last=Casson |page=3 |publisher=Yale University Press |date=11 August 2002 |accessdate=7 March 2012|isbn=978-0300097214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krasner&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html |title=History Magazine |first=Barbara |last=Krasner-Khait |website=history-magazine.com |year=2010 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some dating back to 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/05/06_tablet.shtml |title=Clay cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia to be placed online |first=Kathleen |last=Maclay |date=6 May 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These archives, which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories, mark the end of [[prehistory]] and the start of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin. ''Prehistory The Making of the Human Mind'', New York: Modern Library, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3QZXvUhGwhAC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A short history of the world |first=John Morris |page=35 |last=Roberts |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=17 July 1997 |accessdate=7 March 2012|isbn=9780195115048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things were much the same in the government and temple records on [[papyrus]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; The earliest discovered private archives were kept at [[Ugarit]]; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes. There is also evidence of libraries at [[Nippur]] about 1900 BC and those at [[Nineveh]] about 700 BC showing a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;''The American International Encyclopedia'', New York: J. J. Little &amp; Ives, 1954; Volume IX&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 30,000 clay tablets from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] have been discovered at Nineveh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/ashurbanipal_library_phase_1.aspx |title="Assurbanipal Library Phase 1", British Museum One |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work. Among the findings were the [[Enûma Eliš|Enuma Elish]], also known as ''the Epic of Creation'',&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Creation", in [[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]]. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 233–81&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creation; the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'';&lt;ref&gt;"Epic of Gilgamesh", in Dalley, Stephanie. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989; pp. 50–135&lt;/ref&gt; a large selection of "omen texts" including ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' which "contained omens dealing with the moon, its visibility, eclipses, and conjunction with planets and fixed stars, the sun, its corona, spots, and eclipses, the weather, namely lightning, thunder, and clouds, and the planets and their visibility, appearance, and stations";&lt;ref&gt;Van De Mieroop, Marc. ''A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000–323 BC''. Oxford, UK: [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2007: pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt; and astronomic/astrological texts, as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists, bilingual vocabularies, lists of signs and synonyms, and lists of medical diagnoses.

The tablets were stored in a variety of containers such as wooden boxes, woven baskets of reeds, or clay shelves.  The "libraries" were cataloged using colophons, which are a publisher's imprint on the spine of a book, or in this case a tablet.  The colophons stated the series name, the title of the tablet, and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate.  Eventually, the clay tablets were organized by subject and size.  Unfortunately, due to limited to bookshelf space, once more tablets were added to the library, older ones were removed, which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Weitemeyer, M. (1956). Archive and library technique in ancient Mesopotamia. ''Libri: International Journal of Libraries, 6''(3). 217–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, mythical philosopher [[Laozi]] was keeper of books in the earliest library in China, which belonged to the Imperial [[Zhou dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Mukherjee, A. K 1966 p. 86"&gt;Mukherjee, A. K. Librarianship: Its Philosophy and History. Asia Publishing House (1966) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Also, evidence of catalogues found in some destroyed ancient libraries illustrates the presence of librarians.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee, A. K 1966 p. 86"/&gt;

===Classical period===
[[File:Ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|Artistic rendering of the [[Library of Alexandria]], based on some archaeological evidence]]
The [[Library of Alexandria]], in [[Egypt]], was the largest and most significant [[List of libraries in the ancient world|great library of the ancient world]].&lt;ref name="Sagan, C. 1980"&gt;Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan, C 1980, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;feature=related "Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean"]&lt;/ref&gt; It flourished under the patronage of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (323–283 BC) or during the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy&amp;nbsp;II]] (283–246 BC).&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"&gt;Phillips, Heather A., [http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm "The Great Library of Alexandria?". Library Philosophy and Practice, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; An early organization system was in effect at Alexandria.&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; The Great Library of Alexandria would remain as the intellectual capital of the Western World during the rise of Christianity, even after the library had suffered through fires and conquest. This Great library was more than a place to hold books and records, it became a place of culture. The Alexandrian book collections steadily diminished as a result of natural causes, war, and wholesale theft by corrupt administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Library of Celsus]] in [[Ephesus]], [[Anatolia]], now part of [[Selçuk]], [[Turkey]] was built in honor of the [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swain |first=Simon |title=Dio Chrysostom: Politics, Letters, and Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |page=57 |isbn=9780199255214 |quote=Nevertheless, in 92 the same office went to a Greek, Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, who belonged to a family of priests of Rome hailing from Sardis; entering the Senate under Vespasian, he was subsequently to be appointed proconsul of Asia under Trajan, possibly in 105/6. Celsus' son, Aquila, was also to be made suffectus in 110, although he is certainly remembered more as the builder of the famous library his father envisioned for Ephesus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicols, John 1978 109"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nicols |first=John |title=Vespasian and the partes Flavianae |publisher=Steiner |year=1978 |page=109 |isbn=9783515023931 |quote=Ti. Julius Celsus Polemaeanus (PIR2 J 260) was a romanized Greek of Ephesus or Sardes who became the first eastern consul.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (completed in 135) by Celsus' son, Gaius Julius Aquila ([[consul]], 110 AD). The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus.

Private or personal libraries made up of written books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late 2nd century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]''. All these libraries were Greek. The cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus, there were public libraries near the forums of Rome. There were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Bibliotheca Ulpiana in the [[Trajan's Forum|Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]].

Private libraries appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]]'s several villas, or Pliny the Younger's, all described in surviving letters. At the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.

[[File:Ephesus Celsus Library Façade.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Library of Celsus]] at Ephesus]]
In the West, the first public libraries were established under the [[Roman Empire]] as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor. Rome's first public library was established by [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]]. Pollio was a lieutenant of [[Julius Caesar]] and one of his most ardent supporters. After his military victory in Illyria, Pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what Julius Caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of Rome and rival the one in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, L. (2001). Libraries in the ancient world. New Haven: Yale University Press; Ewald, L. A. (2004). Library Culture in Ancient Rome, 100 B.C. – A.D. 400. Kentucky Libraries, 68(1), 9–11;Buchanan, S. (2012). Designing the Research Commons: Classical Models for School Libraries. School Libraries Worldwide, 18(1), 56–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollios's library, the ''Anla Libertatis'',&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; which was housed in the ''Atrium Libertatis'', was centrally located near the [[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]]. It was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into Greek and Latin. All subsequent Roman public libraries will have this design.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of Rome's civil wars following the death of [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]] in 30 BC, the Emperor Augustus sought to reconstruct many of Rome's damaged buildings. During this construction, Augustus created two more public libraries. The first was the library of the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, often called the [[Bibliotheca Palatina|Palatine library]], and the second was the library of the ''Porticus of Octaviae''.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p. 81; Buchanan, 2012, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more libraries were added by the [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]] on Palatine Hill and one by Vespasian after 70 AD. Vespasian's library was constructed in the [[Imperial fora|Forum of Vespasian]], also known as the ''Forum of Peace'', and became one of Rome's principal libraries. The ''Bibliotheca Pacis'' was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for Greek and Latin libraries containing the works of Galen and Lucius Aelius.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p.84; Buchanan, 2012, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best preserved was the ancient [[Ulpian Library]] built by the Emperor Trajan. Completed in 112/113, the Ulpian Library was part of Trajan's Forum built on the Capitoline Hill. Trajan's Column separated the Greek and Latin rooms which faced each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, 2004, p.10; Buchanan, 2012, p.62; Casson, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, G. W. (2008). ''Tiberius and the Libraries: Public Book Collections and Library Buildings in the Early Roman Empire''. Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record, 43, 247–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself. The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features. Most of the large [[Thermae|Roman baths]] were also cultural centres, built from the start with a library, a two-room arrangement with one room for Greek and one for Latin texts.

Libraries were filled with [[scroll|parchment scrolls]] as at [[Library of Pergamum]] and on [[papyrus]] scrolls as at [[Alexandria]]: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce. There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (such as the Serapeum collection of the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest [[List of libraries in the ancient world|library in the ancient world]]),&lt;ref name="unllib.unl.edu"/&gt; but on the whole collections were private. In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books, there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks. In all recorded cases, the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway. Most of the works in catalogs were of a religious nature, such as volumes of the Bible or religious service books. "In a number of cases the library was entirely theological and liturgical, and in the greater part of the libraries the non-ecclesiastical content did not reach one third of the total"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beddie, J. (1930). The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries. ''Speculum'', 5(1), 3–20. {{doi|10.2307/2846353}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these types of works, in some libraries during that time Plato was especially popular. In the early Middle Ages, Aristotle was more popular. Additionally, there was quite a bit of censoring within libraries of the time; many works that were "scientific and metaphysical" were not included in the majority of libraries during that time period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latin authors were better represented within library holdings and Roman works were less represented. Cicero was also an especially popular author along with the histories of Sallust.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, Virgil was universally represented at most of the medieval libraries of the time. One of the most popular was Ovid, mentioned by approximately twenty French catalogues and nearly thirty German ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Surprisingly, old Roman textbooks on grammar were still being used at that time.

[[Han Chinese]] scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] established the first library classification system during the [[Han dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Late Antiquity===
[[File:Bibl. Malatestiana 3.jpg|thumb|[[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], the first [[Europe]]an civic library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp |title=Stradavinisaporifc.it |publisher=Stradavinisaporifc.it |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages periods, there was no Rome of the kind that ruled the Mediterranean for centuries and spawned the culture that produced twenty-eight public libraries in the ''urbs Roma''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Bischoff|Bischoff, B.]] and [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Gorman, M.]] (1994). ''Manuscripts and libraries in the age of Charlemagne''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The empire had been divided then later re-united again under [[Constantine the Great]] who moved the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330 AD to the city of Byzantium which was renamed [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, K. K. (2004). ''The history of the library in Western civilization''. New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman intellectual culture that flourished in ancient times was undergoing a transformation as the academic world moved from laymen to Christian clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; As the West crumbled, books and libraries flourished and flowed east toward the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; There, four different types of libraries were established: imperial, patriarchal, monastic, and private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papademetriou | first1 = G. C. | year = 2000 | title = The Patriarchal libraries of Constantinople | url = | journal = Greek Orthodox Theological Review | volume = 45 | issue = 1–4| pages = 171–190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each had its own purpose and, as a result, their survival varied.

Christianity was a new force in Europe and many of the faithful saw Hellenistic culture as pagan. As such, many classical Greek works, written on scrolls, were left to decay as only Christian texts were thought fit for preservation in a codex, the progenitor of the modern book.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2011). ''Books: A living history''. London: Thames and Hudson, pp.&amp;nbps;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the East, however, this was not the case as many of these classical Greek and Roman texts were copied.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; "[F]ormerly paper was rare and expensive, so every spare page of available books was pressed into use. Thus a seventeenth-century edition of the Ignatian epistles, in Mar Saba, had copied onto its last pages, probably in the early eighteenth century, a passage allegedly from the letters of Clement of Alexandria".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. (1960). Monasteries and Their Manuscripts. Archaeology, 13(3), 172–177. {{JSTOR|41663782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old manuscripts were also used to bind new books because of the costs associated with paper and also because of the scarcity of new paper.

In Byzantium, much of this work devoted to preserving Hellenistic thought in codex form was performed in [[scriptorium]]s by monks.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, H. A. (2010). The genesis of monastic libraries. ''[[Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record]]'', 45(3), 320–332, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; While '''monastic library''' scriptoriums flourished throughout the East and West, the rules governing them were generally the same.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009; Peterson, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Barren and sun-lit rooms (because candles were a source of fire) were major features of the scriptorium that was both a model of production and monastic piety.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, pp. 36, −38&lt;/ref&gt; Monks scribbled away for hours a day, interrupted only by meals and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 2009, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; With such production, medieval monasteries began to accumulate large libraries. These libraries were devoted solely to the education of the monks and were seen as essential to their spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of these texts that were produced were Christian in nature, many monastic leaders saw common virtues in the Greek classics. As a result, many of these Greek works were copied, and thus saved, in monastic scriptoriums.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 2010, pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt;

When Europe passed into the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Byzantine scriptoriums laboriously preserved Greco-Roman classics. As a result, Byzantium revived Classical models of education and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.W. (1957). The medieval library. New York: Hafner Publishing Co., p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]] was an important depository of ancient knowledge. Constantine himself wanted such a library but his short rule denied him the ability to see his vision to fruition. His son [[Constantius II]] made this dream a reality and created an '''imperial library''' in a portico of the royal palace.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; He ruled for 24 years and accelerated the development of the library and the intellectual culture that came with such a vast accumulation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantius II appointed [[Themistius]], a pagan philosopher and teacher, as chief architect of this library building program. Themistius set about a bold program to create an imperial public library that would be the centerpiece of the new intellectual capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoikos, 2007, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Classical authors such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Isocrates]], [[Thucydides]], [[Homer]], and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] were sought. Themeistius hired calligraphers and craftsman to produce the actual codices. He also appointed educators and created a university-like school centered around the library.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Constantius II, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]], a bibliophile intellectual, ruled briefly for less than three years. Despite this, he had a profound impact on the imperial library and sought both Christian and pagan books for its collections.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1957, p. 312"/&gt; Later, the [[Valens|Emperor Valens]] hired Greek and Latin scribes full-time with funds from the royal treasury to copy and repair manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt;

At its height in the 5th century, the Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] had 120,000 volumes and was the largest library in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A fire in 477 consumed the entire library but it was rebuilt only to be burned again in 726, 1204, and in 1453 when [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillerbrand|first1=Hans J.|title=On Book Burnings and Book Burners: Reflections on the Power (and Powerlessness) of Ideas|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=2006|volume=74|issue=3|pages=593–614|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriarchal libraries''' fared no better, and sometimes worse, than the Imperial Library. The Library of the Patriarchate of Constantinople was founded most likely during the reign of Constantine the Great in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As a theological library, it was known to have employed a [[library classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; It also served as a repository of several [[ecumenical council]]s such as the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], [[Council of Ephesus]], and the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. The library, which employed a librarian and assistants, may have been originally located in the Patriarch's official residence before it was moved to the Thomaites Triclinus in the 7th century. While much is not known about the actual library itself, it is known that many of its contents were subject to destruction as religious in-fighting ultimately resulted in [[book burning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, small '''private libraries''' existed. Many of these were owned by church members and the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Staikos, 2007, p.429&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also were known to have small personal libraries as well as wealthy bibliophiles who could afford the highly ornate books of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1957, pp.313–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the 6th century, at the close of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|Alexandria]]. [[Cassiodorus]], minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the toe of Italy (modern Calabria) with a library where he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately. In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a century.

Through [[Origen]] and especially the scholarly presbyter [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having the [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima|most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time]], containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]], [[Jerome]], and others came and studied there.

===Islamic lands===
[[File:Chinguetti-biblio.jpg|thumb|Inside a Qur'anic Library in [[Chinguetti]], Mauritania]]
By the 8th century, first [[Iran]]ians and then [[Arabs]] had imported the craft of [[papermaking]] from China, with a [[paper mill]] already at work in [[Baghdad]] in 794. Early paper was called bagdatikos, meaning "from Baghdad", because it was introduced to the west mainly by this city.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history. New York, NY : [[Skyhorse Pub.]] ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009. p.&amp;nbps;57&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th century, [[Public library|public libraries]] started to appear in many Islamic cities. They were called "house of knowledge" or ''dar al-'ilm''. They were each endowed by [[Islam]]ic sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge. The 9th-century [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliphate|Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] of [[Iraq]], ordered the construction of a "zawiyat qurra"&amp;nbsp;– an enclosure for readers which was "lavishly furnished and equipped". In [[Shiraz]], Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval historian, [[al-Muqaddasi]], as "a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms.... In each [[Departmentalization|department]], [[Library catalog|catalogues]] were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Al-Muqaddasi: Ahsan al-Taqasim |editor=Goeje, M. J. de |year=1906 |encyclopedia=Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum |language=Arabic |volume=III |publisher=E. J. Brill |location=Leiden |pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render into [[Arabic]] the bulk of the available [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Roman and [[Sanskrit]] non-fiction and the classics of literature.

Organization was a strength of Islamic Libraries during the Golden Age (7th–14th century). In this period, books were organized by subject.  Within the subject, the materials were further organized by when the libraries gained the item, not by last name of the author or the title of the book. Also, Islamic libraries may be the first to have implemented a catalogue of owned materials. The content of a bookshelf was recorded on paper and attached to the end of shelf.
Arab-Islamic people also were very favorable of public knowledge. Public libraries were very popular along with mosque, private, and academic libraries. Instead of being available to the elite of society, such as caliphs and princes, information was something that was offered to everyone.  Some of the libraries were said to let patrons check out up to 200 items. These buildings were also made for comfort of the readers and information seekers. It was said that the rooms had carpets for sitting and reading comfortably. Also, openings such as doors and windows were secured closed as to protect patrons against cold drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elayyan|first1=Ribhi Mustafa|title=The history of the Arabic-Islamic Libraries: 7th to 14th Centuries|journal=International Library Review|date=1990|volume=22|issue=2|pages=119–135|doi=10.1016/0020-7837(90)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], after many of these libraries were destroyed by [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]]. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the Islamic world. However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the libraries of [[Chinguetti]] in [[West Africa]], remain intact and relatively unchanged. Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the [[Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi]] in the Iranian city of [[Mashhad]], which has been operating for more than six centuries.

The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily. From there they eventually made their way into other parts of Christian [[Europe]]. These copies joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] works. The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern library today.

[[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]], educational materials, and histories were stored in libraries in pre-modern [[Southeast Asia]]. In [[Myanmar|Burma]], a royal library called the [[Pitakataik]] was legendarily founded by King [[Anawrahta]];&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zoq_TtEN54IC&amp;pg=PA29 International dictionary of library histories]'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, British envoy [[Michael Symes (diplomat)|Michael Symes]], on visiting this library, wrote that "it is not improbable that his Birman majesty may possess a more numerous library than any potentate, from the banks of the Danube to the borders of China". In Thailand, libraries called [[ho trai]] were built throughout the country, usually on stilts above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books.

====Islam====
[[File:Flickr - dlisbona - Old Koran manuscript, Alexandria library.jpg|thumb|Qur'an manuscript on display at the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The centrality of the [[Quran|Qurʾān]] as the prototype of the written word in [[Islam]] bears significantly on the role of books within its intellectual tradition and educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nasr |first1=Seyyed Hossein |year=1992 |title=Oral Transmission and The Book in Islamic Education: The Spoken and The Written Word |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1093/jis/3.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early impulse in Islam was to manage reports of events, key figures and their sayings and actions. Thus, "the onus of being the last '[[People of the Book]]' engendered an ethos of [librarianship]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nanji |first1=Azim |editor1-first=Hermann |editor1-last=Landolt |editor2-first=Samira |editor2-last=Sheikh |editor3-first=Kutub |editor3-last=Kassam |title=An Anthology of Ismaili Literature: A Shi'i Vision of Islam |year=2008 |publisher=IB Tauris |location=London |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; early on and the establishment of important book repositories throughout the Muslim world has occurred ever since.

Upon the spread of Islam, libraries in [[Islamic Golden Age|newly Islamic lands]] knew a brief period of expansion in the Middle East, [[North Africa]], [[Sicily]], and [[Spain]]. Like the Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of [[paper]], and took a [[codex]] or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques, private homes, and universities, from [[Timbuktu]] to [[Afghanistan]] and modern day [[Pakistan]]. In [[Aleppo]], for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sibai |first=Mohamed Makki |title=Mosque libraries: An Historical Study |year=1987 |publisher=Mansell Publishing Limited |page=71 |isbn=978-0-7201-1896-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s bibliography ''Fihrist'' demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for books about the doctrines of other religions. Modern Islamic libraries for the most part do not hold these antique books; many were lost, [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed by Mongols]],&lt;ref&gt;Chief among the libraries destroyed by the Mongol hordes was that of the Shia Ismaili Muslim community who occupied a network of mountain fortresses – lead from the castle of Alamut – beginning from the end of the eleventh century to about 1256. "The Fatimids and their successors at Alamut were great lovers and patrons of books, and their vast libraries attracted scholars of every creed from far and wide. The Imam al-Hakim even provided ink, pens, paper, and inkstands free of charge for all who sought learning in the 'House of Knowledge' (dār al-ʿilm). We can only imagine the horror the Ismailis would have felt when they witnessed the destruction of the literary legacy they had so painstakingly fostered. Al-Maqrizi (d.845/1442) describes how great hills of ashes were formed when the slaves and maids of the Luwata Berber tribe burned the Fatimid books. As an act of further desecration, they used the precious bindings of the volumes to make sandals for their feet. Similarly, Juwayni exults at torching the Ismaili library of Alamut, "the fame of which", he adds, "had spread throughout the world". See, {{cite book |last=Virani |first=Shafique N. |authorlink=Shafique Virani |year=2007 |title=The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, a Search for Salvation |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or removed to European libraries and museums during the colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=John L. |editor-last=Esposito |year=1995 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-506613-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Middle Ages===
[[File:13-11-02-olb-by-RalfR-03.jpg|thumb|Science library of Upper Lusatia in Görlitz, Germany]]
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], monastery libraries developed, such as the important one at the [[Monte Cassino|Abbey of Montecassino]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crossingitaly.net/travel/936/montecassino-one-of-the-most-important-libraries-in-the-world/ |title=Montecassino, one of the most important libraries in the world |website=crossingitaly.net |year=2012 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books were usually [[chained library|chained to the shelves]], reflecting the fact that [[manuscript]]s, which were created via the labour-intensive process of hand copying, were valuable possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jM-OY0LCHCEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Chained+libraries#v=onepage&amp;q=Chained%20libraries&amp;f=false |title=The Chained Library |first=Burnett Hillman |last=Streeter |authorlink=Burnett Hillman Streeter |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2012|isbn=9781108027892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hand-copying was often accomplished by travelling monks who made the treks to the sources of knowledge and illumination they sought for learning or to copy the manuscripts held by other monasteries for their own monastic libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Books: A Living History |last=Lyons |first=Martyn |publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum |year=2011 |isbn= |location=Los Angeles, CA |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this protectiveness, many libraries loaned books if provided with security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread. In 1212, the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is "one of the chief works of mercy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Putnam |first=Geo. Haven |title=Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages |year=1962 |publisher=Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early libraries located in monastic [[cloister]]s and associated with [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] were collections of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[Bookcase|bookpresses]]. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This "stall system" (i.e. fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of English institutional libraries. In European libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This "wall system" was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].

Also, in [[Eastern Christianity]] monastery libraries kept important manuscripts. The most important of them were the ones in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the library of the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] for the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]].

===Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca medicea laurenziana interno 01.JPG|thumb|Reading room of the [[Laurentian Library]]]]
From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, libraries of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "[[academy]]" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence. [[Malatesta Novello]], [[Signoria|lord]] of [[Cesena]], founded the [[Malatestiana Library]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici]] in [[Florence]] established his own collection, which formed the basis of the [[Laurentian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html Survivor: the History of the Library], history-magazine.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, the papal collections were brought together by [[Pope Nicholas V]], in separate Greek and Latin libraries, and housed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who consigned the [[Vatican Library|Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] to the care of his librarian, the humanist [[Bartolomeo Platina]] in February 1475.&lt;ref&gt;This section on Roman Renaissance libraries follows Kenneth M. Setton, "From Medieval to Modern Library" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''104'''.4, Dedication of the APS Library Hall, Autumn General Meeting, November 1959 (August 1960:371–390) p. 372 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] bisected Bramante's [[Cortile del Belvedere]] with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The 16th and 17th centuries saw other privately endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the [[Biblioteca Vallicelliana|Vallicelliana]], formed from the books of Saint [[Philip Neri|Filippo Neri]], with other distinguished libraries such as that of [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]], the [[Biblioteca Angelica]] founded by the Augustinian [[Angelo Rocca]], which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which [[Pope Alexander VII]] endowed the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]; the [[Biblioteca Casanatense]] of the Cardinal [[Girolamo Casanata]]; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII Corsini]] and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. The [[Republic of Venice]] patronized the foundation of the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], based on the library of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]]. In Milan, Cardinal [[Federico Borromeo]] founded the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

This trend soon spread outside of Italy, for example [[Louis III, Elector Palatine]] founded the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] of [[Heidelberg]].

These libraries don't have as many volumes as the modern libraries. However, they keep many valuable manuscripts of Greek, Latin, and Biblical works.

[[Tian Yi Ge|Tianyi Chamber]], founded in 1561 by Fan Qin during the [[Ming dynasty]], is the oldest existing library in China. In its heyday, it boasted a collection of 70,000 volumes of antique books.

At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966) ''Early Public Libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850'' London: Library Association; p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Predeek, Albert (1947) ''A History of Libraries in Great Britain and North America''. Chicago: American Library Association; p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[British Museum]] existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public, or even to a majority of the population. Access to the Museum depended on passes, of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open to browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew (2003) ''Library: an unquiet history''; p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subscription libraries====
{{main|Subscription library}}
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Museum]] was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books.]]
At the start of the 19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Only one important library in Britain, namely [[Chetham's Library]] in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 185"/&gt; However, there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis.

The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially the commercial [[subscription library|subscription libraries]]. Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares in the libraries. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as [[biography]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[travel]], rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel.

Unlike a [[public library]], access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late 17th century England, such as [[Chetham's Library]] in 1653, [[Innerpeffray Library]] in 1680, and [[Thomas Plume|Thomas Plume's Library]] in 1704. In the [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonies]], the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] was started in 1731 by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in Philadelphia.

Parochial libraries attached to Anglican parishes or Nonconformist chapels in Britain emerged in the early 18th century, and prepared the way for local public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts: 1616–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956) p 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing production and demand for fiction promoted by commercial markets led to the rise of [[circulating library|circulating libraries]], which met a need that subscription libraries did not fulfil. William Bathoe claimed that his commercial venture was "the Original Circulating library", opening doors at two locations in London in 1737.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;Raven, James. "Libraries for sociability: the advance of subscription library." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=picture1807&gt;{{cite book |last=Feltham |first=John |authorlink=John Feltham |title=Picture of London, for 1807 |publisher=Richard Phillips |edition=8th |location=London |chapter=Circulating Libraries |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9MHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulating libraries also charged subscription fees to users and offered serious subject matter as well as the popular novels, thus the difficulty in clearly distinguishing circulating from subscription libraries.&lt;ref name=Eliot&gt;Eliot, Simon. "Circulating libraries in the Victorian age and after." The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vogel Załuski Library.jpg|thumb|left|[[Załuski Library|Biblioteka Załuskich]], built in [[Warsaw]] in the mid 18th century]]
Subscription libraries were democratic in nature; created by and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, in order to raise funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.&lt;ref name=Forster&gt;Forster, Geoffrey, and Alan Bell. "The subscription libraries and their members." The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, there were more than 200 commercial circulating libraries open in 1800, more than twice the number of subscription and private proprietary libraries that were operating at the same time.  Many proprietors pandered to the most fashionable clientele, making much ado about the sort of shop they offered, the lush interiors, plenty of room and long hours of service.&lt;ref name="Raven"/&gt; "These 'libraries' would be called rental collections today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810829725 |publication-place=Metuchen, N.J |title=History of libraries in the western world |publication-date=1995|date=January 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private Subscription Libraries====
[[File:Linen Hall Library, 1888.jpg|thumb|The [[Linen Hall Library]] in Belfast was an 18th-century [[subscription library]]. Pictured in 1888, shortly before its demolition.]]
Private subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was a gentleman's only library. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liverpool [[Subscription library|Subscription Library]] was a gentlemen only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul. Libraries and Their Users. Page 29. The Library Association. 1969. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Donald McDonald, stationer, and his Circulating Library, Gulgong, 1870.jpg|left|thumb| [[Circulating library]] and stationery shop, [[Gulgong]], Australia 1870]]
Private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Paul (1969); p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, David (2008); p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the nineteenth, the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Raymond (1964); p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, "designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the Artizans' library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings. The subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.&lt;ref name="Kelly, Thomas 1966; p. 128"/&gt;

Benjamin Franklin lead the founding of the first American subscription library. In Philadelphia, Franklin formed "a club of mutual improvements".. calling themselves the "Junto", which meant a council or a combination of individuals organized for a specific purpose. Because the men in this club had a steady income, they could afford to be apart of this club and afford to purchase books. Only some had enough to be considered a library; together they shared what they all had.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=1602397066|location=|pages=145-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
{{main|National library}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is but one of the treasures made available in the [[British Museum]] upon its establishment in 1753.]]
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state. This era is termed the "golden age of libraries", with millions of printed books available and widespread interest growing in both national and classical literature. National libraries would eventually become objects of pride in that same spirit, most Europeans considered themselves as belonging to a nation first and a religion second. Wars of religion would give way to wars of nationalism, as fierce and widespread as ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would become a major turning point for many libraries and their collections. 

One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[John Dee]], who in 1556 presented [[Mary I of England]] with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.&lt;ref&gt;Fell-Smith, Charlotte (1909) ''John Dee: 1527–1608''. London: Constable and Company [http://www.johndee.org/charlotte/ Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the [[British Museum]].
This new institution was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor the king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunton |first=Larkin |title=The World and Its People |publisher=Silver, Burdett |year=1896 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's foundations lay in the will of the physician and naturalist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]], who gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] over his lifetime which he bequeathed to the nation for £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum |publisher=Fathom |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102202555/http://fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html |archivedate= 2 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloane's collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, as well as [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx|title=General history|website=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also incorporated the [[Cotton library]] and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian library]]. These were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 346&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the first national library was the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]], which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the [[Louvre Palace]] by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1368. The appointment of [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] as librarian in the 17th century, initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of [[Camille le Tellier de Louvois|Abbé Louvois]], Minister Louvois's son. Abbé Louvois was succeeded by the [[Jérôme Bignon|Abbé Bignon]], or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library's system. Catalogues were made, which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]], at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and [[Joseph Van Praet]] it suffered no injury.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

The library's collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|radical phase]] of the [[French Revolution]], when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergy were seized. After the establishment of the [[French First Republic]] in September 1792, "the Assembly declared the ''Bibliotheque du Roi'' to be national property and the institution was renamed the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]]''. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people."&lt;ref name=priebe&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Paul M. |last1=Priebe|title=From Bibliothèque du Roi to Bibliothèque Nationale: The Creation of a State Library, 1789–1793|journal= The Journal of Library History (1974–1987)|volume= 17|issue= 4 |pages=389–408|date= 1982|jstor=25541320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern public library===
{{main|Public library}}
[[File:James Silk Buckingham by Clara S. Lane.jpg|thumb|[[James Silk Buckingham]] led the campaign for public libraries in the mid 19th century.]]
Although by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 [[subscription library|subscription libraries]] and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the [[Public Libraries Act 1850]]. The Act first gave local [[municipal borough|boroughs]] the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] economic model had created a significant amount of free time for workers, and the middle classes were concerned that the workers' free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism rather than by demand from the lower social orders.&lt;ref&gt;McMenemy (2009), pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |title=History of the Public Libraries Act |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316170538/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Llibrary.htm |archivedate=16 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, and against government opposition, [[James Silk Buckingham]], MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the [[temperance movement]], was able to secure the Chair of the [[Parliamentary select committees of the United Kingdom|Select Committee]] which would examine "the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom" and propose solutions. [[Francis Place]], a campaigner for the working class, agreed that, "The establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on inquiry into drunkenness, ''Report'' (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on [[William Ewart (British politician)|William Ewart]] MP and [[Joseph Brotherton]] MP, who introduced a bill which would "[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly &amp; Kelly (1977), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This became the [[Museums Act 1845]].

The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the Committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Minto (1932) chapters 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murison (1971) chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard (1850) Col. 848&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill passed through [[Parliament]] as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower [[crime statistics|crime rates]].

The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems. The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the UK in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849, their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries.

Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after [[Winchester]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Kidderminster]], [[Cambridge]], [[Birkenhead]], and [[Sheffield]].

Another important act was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Education Act 1870]], which increased literacy and thereby the demand for libraries. By 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the number had reached 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Michael H. |title=The History of Libraries in the Western World |year=1984 |location=London |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-1666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finally marks the start of the public library as we know it. And these acts influenced similar laws in other countries, such as the US. The first tax-supported public library in the United States was [[Peterborough]], [[New Hampshire]] (1833) first supported by state funds then an "Act Providing for the Establishment of Public Libraries" in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shera |first=Jesse H. |title=Foundations of the Public Library: The Origins of the Public Library Movement in New England, 1629–1855 |year=1949 |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion====
[[File:Andrew Carnegie at Skibo 1914 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Carnegie]] played an important role in financing public libraries across the [[English-speaking world]].]]
[[The American School Library]] (1839) was an early frontier traveling library in the [[United States]]. The year 1876 is key in the history of librarianship in the United States. The [[American Library Association]] was formed on October 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/node/530/|title=ALA Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''The [[American Library Journal]]'', [[Melvil Dewey]] published his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|decimal-based system]] of classification, and the United States Bureau of Education published its report, "Public libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management."  During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed [[Women's club (United States)|women's clubs]]. They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fund raising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the [[Carnegie library]] Endowment founded in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Paula D.

Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, [[Henry Tate]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]], helped to increase the number of public libraries from the late 19th century. Carnegie alone built over 2000 libraries in the US, 660 [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Libraries]] in Britain, in addition to many more in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Theodore |title=Carnegie Libraries across America |publisher=Preservation Press |location=Washington |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-471-14422-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie also funded academic libraries, favoring small schools and schools with African American students.  "In 1899, Pennsylvania State College became the first college to receive Carnegie funding ($150,000) and their library was constructed in 1903."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryan |first1=S |title='An Idea Likely Too Big': John B.

==Types==
Many institutions make a distinction between a circulating or [[lending library]], where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons, institutions, or other libraries, and a reference library where material is not lent out. Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Story of Kentucky's Horseback Librarians (10 Photos)|url=http://archiveproject.com/the-horseback-librarians-of-eastern-kentucky-10-photos|website=Archive Project|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bookmobiles]], are generally of the lending type. Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises. Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility.

===Academic libraries===
{{Main|Academic library}}

[[File:Cmglee London Maughan Library reading room.jpg|thumb|The round reading room of [[Maughan Library]], the main university library of [[King's College London]]]]
Academic libraries are generally located on college and university campuses and primarily serve the students and faculty of that and other academic institutions. Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part.

[[File:Egyetemi Könyvtár4.JPG|thumb|left|The University Library in [[Budapest]]]]
Academic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational institutions, such as colleges and universities. Their main function are to provide support in research and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution. Specific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours). Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators.

Academic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.library.utoronto.ca/workshops/|title=St. George Library Workshops|website=utoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software. These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom.

[[File:Robartslibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Robarts Library]] at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada.]]
The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms. In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented. The library provides a "gateway" for students and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.&lt;ref&gt;Dowler, Lawrence (1997). ''Gateways to knowledge: the role of academic libraries in teaching, learning, and research''. {{ISBN|0-262-04159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases, providing research and scholarly writing software, and usually provide computer workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search databases and portals, institutional electronic resources, Internet access, and course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet software). Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/anunobi-okoye.htm |title=The Role of Academic Libraries in Universal Access to Print and Electronic Resources in the Developing Countries, Chinwe V. Anunobi, Ifeyinwa B.

===Children's libraries===
[[File:Children. Children's Library in N.D.G BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08742.jpg|thumb|left|A children's library in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada in 1943]]
[[Children's libraries]] are special collections of books intended for juvenile readers and usually kept in separate rooms of general public libraries. Some children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children. They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading. Their work supplements that of the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Americana|last=Modell |first=David A. |wstitle=Children's Libraries|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services commonly provided by public libraries may include storytelling sessions for infants, toddlers, preschool children, or after-school programs, all with an intention of developing early literacy skills and a love of books. One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries are summer reading programs for children, families, and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Udomisor, I., Udomisor, E., &amp; Smith, E. (2013). Management of Communication Crisis in a Library and Its Influence on Productivity. In Information and Knowledge Management (Vol. 3, No. 8, pp. 13–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular reading program for children is PAWS TO READ or similar programs where children can read to certified therapy dogs. Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading. Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paws to read|url=http://www.readingpaws.org/READingPaws/Welcome.html|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National libraries===
[[File:National Library of Wales.jpg|thumb|[[National Library of Wales]]]]
{{Main|National library}}
A [[national library|national or state library]] serves as a national repository of information, and has the right of [[legal deposit]], which is a legal requirement that publishers in the country need to deposit a copy of each publication with the library. Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books. Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the [[Institutional repository|repository]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Line, Maurice B.; Line, J. (1979). "Concluding notes". ''National libraries'', Aslib, pp. 317–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lor, P. J.; Sonnekus, E. A. S. (1997). [http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm "Guidelines for Legislation for National Library Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813200532/http://www.ifla.org/VII/s1/gnl/index.htm |date=13 August 2006 }}, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]]. Retrieved on 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfil their duties. The national libraries of Europe participate in [[European Library|The European Library]] which is a service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

===Public lending libraries===
{{Main|Public library}}
[[File:Biblioteka Raczyńskich.jpg|thumb|[[Raczyński Library]], the public library of [[Poznań]], Poland]]

A public library provides services to the general public. If the library is part of a [[county]]wide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system. A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system. Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing. The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted.  Typically, libraries issue [[library card]]s to community members wishing to borrow books. Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.

Many public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time. For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment. According to a study by the [[Pennsylvania Library Association]], public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths.&lt;ref&gt;Celano, D., &amp; Neumann, S. B. (2001). The role of public libraries in children's literacy development: An evaluation report. Pennsylvania, PA: Pennsylvania Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.
[[File:Bates Hall - Boston Public Library.jpg|thumb|Bates Hall, the main reading room of the [[Boston Public Library]]]]

As the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown. The ''[[library stack|stack system]]'' involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room. This arrangement arose in the 19th century. Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty). The introduction of [[electric light|electrical lighting]] had a huge impact on how the library [[lighting in libraries|operated]]. The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks. As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space.

[[File:ET Amhara asv2018-02 img120 Awra Amba.jpg|thumb|left|A community library in [[Ethiopia]].]]
[[Library 2.0]], a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using [[web 2.0]] technology. Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, use of online social networks by libraries, [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]], and [[Software widget|widgets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=L.B. |title=A Manifesto for our time |year=2007 |pages=47–9 |journal=American Libraries |volume=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a more user-driven institution.

Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their budgets cut by state legislature. Funding has dwindled so badly that many public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jaeger |first=Paul T. |last2=Bertot |first2=John Carol |last3=Gorham |first3=Ursula |title=Wake Up the Nation: Public Libraries, Policy Making, and Political Discourse |journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy |date=January 2013 |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |doi=10.1086/668582 |jstor=10.1086/668582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reference libraries{{anchor|Reference library}}===
A reference library does not lend books and other items; instead, they must be read at the library itself. Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university. Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique. Many lending libraries contain a "reference section", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Ehrenhaft |first2=William |last2=Howard Armstrong |first3=M.

===Research libraries{{anchor|Research library}}===
{{main|Research library}}

A research library is a collection of materials on one or more subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Young |first=Heartsill |title=ALA Glossary of Library and Information Science |year=1983 |page=188 |publisher=American Library Association |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-8389-0371-1 |oclc=8907224}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally include [[primary source|primary]] as well as [[secondary source]]s; it will maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials. A research library is most often an [[academic library|academic]] or [[national library]], but a large [[special library]] may have a research library within its special field, and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries. A large university library may be considered a research library; and in North America, such libraries may belong to the [[Association of Research Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arl.org/arl/membership/members.shtml |title=Association of Research Libraries (ARL) :: Member Libraries |website=arl.org |year=2012 |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, they may be members of [[Research Libraries UK|Research Libraries UK (RLUK)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rluk.ac.uk/|title=RLUK: Research Libraries UK|publisher=RLUK|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research library can be either a reference library, which does not lend its holdings, or a lending library, which does lend all or some of its holdings. Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials. Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization.  Examples of research libraries include the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]] on 42nd Street in Manhattan, [[State Public Scientific &amp; Technological Library|State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Sibirian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spsl.nsc.ru/en/|title=SPSTL SB RAS|website=www.spsl.nsc.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl|title=Our Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital libraries===
{{main article|Digital library}}

Digital libraries are libraries that house digital resources. They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury &amp; Foo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Digital Libraries and Information Access: research perspectives|last1=Chowdhury|first1=G. G.|last2=Foo|first2=C.|date=2012|publisher=Neal-Schuman|year=|isbn=9781555709143|oclc=869282690|location=Chicago|pages=2–3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a digital library implies that "a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community."{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|pp=3–4}} Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together. The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=49}} Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question. Digital objects cannot be preserved passively, they must be curated by digital librarians to ensure the trust and integrity of the digital objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scholarship in the digital age: information, infrastructure, and the Internet|last=Borgman|first=Christine L.|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262026192|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=88|oclc=181028448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest considerations for digital librarians is the need to provide long-term access to their resources; to do this, there are two issues requiring watchfulness: Media failure and format obsolescence. With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem. A scratched CD-Rom, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem. Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable. Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself. In contrast, format obsolescence is preparatory, because changes are anticipated and solutions are sought before there is a problem.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

Future trends in digital preservation include: Transparent enterprise models for digital preservation, launch of self-preserving objects, increased flexibility in digital preservation architectures, clearly-defined metrics for comparing preservation tools, and terminology and standards interoperability in real time.{{sfnp|Chowdhury|Foo|2012|p=211}}

===Special libraries===
{{Main|Special library}}All other libraries fall into the "[[special library]]" category. Many private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, churches, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work. Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof. In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library.

Special libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community. [[Libraries and the LGBTQ community]] have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community. Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the [[Women's Library]] @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history.

Some special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries, and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the institution in question. Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection. Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library.

Special libraries are distinguished from [[special collections]], which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area.

For more information on specific types of special libraries, see [[law library|law libraries]], [[medical library|medical libraries]], [[music library|music libraries]], or [[transportation libraries]].

==Organization==
[[File:HK Wan Chai Library Inside Bookcase a.jpg|thumb|Library shelves in Hong Kong, showing numbers of the classification scheme to help readers locate works in that section]]

Most libraries have materials arranged in a specified order according to a [[library classification]] system, so that items may be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library classification|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/library-classification|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored. These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public. Others require patrons to submit a "stack request", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see [[List of closed stack libraries]] (in progress).

Larger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional [[librarian]]s.
* Circulation (or Access Services) – Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, V. &amp; Bullard, J. (2009). Circulation Services. In ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences'' (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collection development|Collection Development]] – Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.
* Reference – Staffs a [[reference desk]] answering questions from users (using structured [[reference interview]]s), instructing users, and developing library programming. Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are [[children's literature]], [[Young adult fiction|young adult literature]], and [[genealogy]] materials.
* Technical Services – Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning [[Weeding (library)|weeded materials]].
* Stacks Maintenance – Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services. Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.

[[File:Library card.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Browne Issue System|Card]] used by a user to sign out a book]]

Basic tasks in [[library management]] include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Library and information center management|last1=Stueart |first1=Robert |last2=Moran |first2=Barbara B. |last3=Morner |first3=Claudia J.|isbn=9781598849882|edition=Eighth|location=Santa Barbara, California|oclc=780481202 |year=2013 |publisher= Libraries Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt; More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming). Library materials like books, magazines, periodicals, CDs, etc. are managed by Dewey Decimal Classification Theory and modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory is more practical reliable system for library materials management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharjee|first1=Pijush Kanti|title=Modified Dewey Decimal Classification Theory for Library Materials Management|journal=International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology|date=2010|volume=1|issue=3|pages=292–294| url=http://www.ijimt.org/list-24-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has published several standards regarding the management of libraries through its Technical Committee 46 (TC 46),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48750 |title=ISO – Technical committees – TC 46 – Information and documentation |publisher=ISO.org |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is focused on "libraries, documentation and information centers, publishing, archives, records management, museum documentation, indexing and abstracting services, and information science". The following is a partial list of some of them:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=48750 |title=ISO – ISO Standards – TC 46 – Information and documentation |publisher=ISO.org |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians have sometimes complained&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Scott|date=Apr 2009|title=Libraries and Learning: A History of Paradigm Change|url=|journal=Portal : Libraries and the Academy|volume=9|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; that some of the library buildings which have been used to accommodate libraries have been inadequate for the demands made upon them. In general, this condition may have resulted from one or more of the following causes:
# an effort to erect a [[monument]]al building{{Vague|date=May 2012}}; most of those who commission library buildings are not librarians and their priorities may be different
# to conform it to a type of [[architecture]] unsuited to library purposes
# the appointment, often by competition, of an architect unschooled in the requirements of a library
# failure to consult with the librarian or with library experts

Much advancement has undoubtedly been made toward cooperation between architect and librarian,{{when|date=September 2012}} and many good designers have made library buildings their speciality, nevertheless it seems that the ideal type of library is not yet realized—the type so adapted to its purpose that it would be immediately recognized as such, as is the case with school buildings at the present time.{{when|date=September 2012}} This does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement, but it does mean that the exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the interior.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana|last=Wiley |first=Edwin |wstitle=Library Architecture and Construction|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Architecture and Design.net published the web article 45+ Of the Most Majestic Libraries in the World showcasing some beautiful examples of the architecture of libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MMK|title=45+ Of The Most Majestic Libraries in the World|url=https://www.architecturendesign.net/45-of-the-most-majestic-libraries-in-the-world/|website=www.architecturendesign.net|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrons may not know how to fully use the library's resources. This can be due to some individuals' unease in approaching a staff member. Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use. An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness. In the [[public library|public libraries]] of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the [[library instruction]] movement, which advocated library user education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=S. C.|date=2003|title=The origin of library instruction in the United States, 1820–1900|journal=Research Strategies|volume=19|issue=3/4|pages=233–243|doi=10.1016/j.resstr.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early leaders was [[John Cotton Dana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mattson|first=K.|date=2000|title=The librarian as secular minister to democracy: The life and ideas of John Cotton Dana|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|volume=35|issue=4|pages=514–534|jstor=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as [[information literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=T. E.|date=2006|title=Information literacy: Adapting to the media age|journal=Alki|volume=22|issue=1|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card [[library catalog|catalogue]]—a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with [[index card]]s that identified books and other materials. In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room. The emergence of the [[Internet]], however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as "webcats" or as [[online public access catalog]]ues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloan|first=B|last2=White|first2=M. S. B.|date=1992|title=Online public access catalogs|journal=Academic and Library Computing|volume=9|issue=2|pages=9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as [[digital library|digital libraries]] and [[distributed library|distributed libraries]], as well as older libraries that have been [[retrofitting|retrofitted]]. Electronic catalogue databases are criticized by some who believe that the old card catalogue system was both easier to navigate and allowed retention of information, by writing directly on the cards, that is lost in the electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mamis |first=Joshua |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/life_death_of_the_card_catalog/ |newspaper=New Haven Independent |title=Dewey Decimal didn't die |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is analogous to the debate over paper books and [[e-book]]s. While libraries have been accused of precipitously throwing out valuable information in card catalogues, most modern ones have nonetheless made the move to electronic catalogue databases. Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing the resources across a series of shelves. Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically; a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging.

[[Finland]] has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world. Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pantzar |first=Katja |url=http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=160064&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=The humble Number One: Finland |publisher=This is Finland |date=September 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978. From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%. The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galbithink.org/libraries/circulation.htm Statistics on Book Circulation Per User of U.S. Public Libraries Since 1856&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from galbithink.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift to digital libraries===

[[File:Bibliotheca Alexandrina interior - 2008-07-17.JPG|thumb|Interior of the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]], Alexandria, Egypt, showing both stacks and computer terminals]]

In the 21st century, there has been increasing use of the Internet to gather and retrieve data. The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries. Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw the overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.&lt;ref&gt;Applegate, Rachel. "Whose Decline? Which Academic Libraries are "Deserted" in Terms of Reference Transactions?" ''Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly''; 2nd ser. 48 (2008): 176–89. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away. For example, the University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 and 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000.&lt;ref&gt;University of California Library Statistics 1990–91, University-wide Library Planning, University of California Office of the President (July 1991): 12; University of California Library Statistics July 2001, 7, [http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf Ucop.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702182256/http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf |date= 2 July 2010 }}.

These facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources. In 1999–2000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100&amp;nbsp;million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23&amp;nbsp;million from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html "ARL Libraries Spend Nearly $100 Million on Electronic Resources," ''ARL Bimonthly Report 219'', Association of Research Libraries (December 2001)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521154449/http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html |date=21 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8&amp;nbsp;million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Striphas, Ted. ''The Late Age of Print: Everyday Book Culture From Consumerism to Control''. New York City: [[Columbia University Press]], 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in [[Cushing Academy]]'s decision to dispense with its library of printed books—more than 20,000 volumes in all—and switch over entirely to digital media resources.&lt;ref&gt;Striphas, Ted.

One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities. There have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library. As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet, their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased. Finding information by simply searching the Internet could be much easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them than going to the library. Also, 75% of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet. While the retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time saving than visiting a traditional library, research has shown that undergraduates are most likely searching only .03% of the entire web.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, Denise A. "How and Why are Libraries Changing?" Digital Library Federation. Library Information Technology – Carnegie Mellon, 9 January 2001. Web. 29 November 2009. [http://www.diglib.org/use/whitepaper.htm Diglib.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library.

In the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the [[GoLibrary]], that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as [[El Cerrito del Norte station|El Cerrito del Norte]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART station]] in [[California]].

===The Internet===

A library may make use of the [[Internet]] in a number of ways, from creating their own [[library website]] to making the contents of its [[Online public access catalog|catalogues searchable online]]. Some specialised search engines such as [[Google Scholar]] offer a way to facilitate searching for academic resources such as journal articles and research papers.

[[Digitizing|Digitization]] of books, particularly those that are [[Out of print|out-of-print]], in projects such as [[Google Books]] provides resources for library and other online users.

Library scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that they market their services if they are to compete with the Internet and mitigate the risk of losing users.&lt;ref&gt;Vrana, R., and Barbaric, A. (2007). "Improving visibility of public libraries in the local community: a study of five public libraries in Zagreb, Croatia".

[[Public library advocacy]] is support given to a [[public library]] for its financial and philosophical goals or needs. Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as [[Friends of Libraries]] and community members. Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide "economic value to the community" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Ellen G.  |date=2009|title=Hard Times = A New Brand of Advocacy|journal=Georgia Library Quarterly|volume= 46|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1269&amp;context=glq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''lion head horn''' is an undecorated silver horn that has a flaring rim and tapers down to the tip. It curves at an obtuse angle, and its lower extremity is inserted into the back of the gold lion head, and fixed with four gold rivets. The vase is not properly a [[rhyton]], since no secondary orifice is present. A hole on the upper left [[Canine tooth|canine]] of the lion is very small for effective pouring: it seems accidental. The ferocious animal is shown with open mouth, prominent canines and protruding tongue, in a grimace shared by animals and monsters of the [[Archaic Greek]] art. The wrinkled skin on both sides of the muzzle with its triangular nostrils are rendered as continuous lines and dots. Similar dots run along the upper half of the mouth contour, while the lower half shows a chased pattern of minuscule ovals. Punched circles and hatching appear in the mouth's interior. The eyes are almond-shaped, and two low, circular protuberances on the forehead are covered with hatching. The semicircular ears have three radial lines in their interior. The mane is rendered as a plastic collar of triangular section. Its front and back sides are covered with finely chiseled, stylized hair locks.

==Origin==
Among the various types of rhyta and horns, the one with an animal head termination on a long horn seems the least popular in the Near and Middle Eastern cultural domains. The horns are usually provided with an animal forepart, while the simple heads of rather large dimensions are typically combined with a straight or flaring calyx-like neck.

|last1=Hoffmann

|pages=137–161
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Manassero, who collected the evidence in all materials and reviewed the earlier literature, counts four metal exemplars of the Archaic period, of which only two are made of silver, or silver and gold, both with a lion head finial. 
&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The type enjoys a revival in Scythia during the Classical period, often with animal heads of precious metal mounted on real horns; it continues in a pipe-like version well into the Hellenistic times.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The bronze lion heads are large, strongly stylized, with an almost flat muzzle; they have little in common with the VBC gold head. They probably come from Luristan and are undeniably much earlier than our exemplar. 
&lt;ref&gt;Probably 8th Century BC&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several silver exemplars entered the art market, and later some of them even museum collections, ([[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum]], [[Miho Museum]]) without any documentation, since they come from illicit digging, reportedly "from a cave cache", which became known as the "Western Cave", in Kal-e Makarekh (or Kalmakarra), western Iran.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The silver rhyta have their lion head finials made of gold and soldered onto the silver horn. All horns are undecorated with very slight tapering towards the finial. All lion heads are quite large (up to three times as big as the VBC exemplar), and show the same stylistic features, chiselled details, and rings on the point of their junction with the horn. None of them is a rhyton stricto sensu, since they are not supplied with a secondary orifice. Consequently, they are supposed to have being made in the same pre-Achaemenid western Iranian workshop, possibly in the second half of the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Although their authenticity is not questioned by Ebbinghaus 1998, or nor by Manassero 2008 (p. 44, nt. 56), who on the contrary wonders whether a piece believed a fake by Muscarella 2000(p.427) should be reconsidered. They are further confirmed as authentic by other experts (Doole 2004, p. 12), but  the absence of excavated compranda renders their dating rather a working hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lira dos Vinte Anos''''' (in {{lang-en|Twenty-year-old Lyre}}) is a poetry [[anthology]] written by [[Brazil]]ian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] author [[Álvares de Azevedo]]. Originally part of an aborted project that would be written in partnership with [[Aureliano Lessa]] and [[Bernardo Guimarães]] called ''As Três Liras'' ({{lang-en|The Three Lyres}}), it was published in [[1853 in literature|1853]]. It is one of the few works whose publication was prepared by Álvares himself, due to his premature death on April 25, 1852.&lt;ref name="YoungCisneros2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Richard|last2=Cisneros|first2=Odile|title=Historical Dictionary of Latin American Literature and Theater|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0ZyleoLY5UC&amp;pg=PA68|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7498-5|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided in three parts: the "[[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] Face" (first and third parts) and the "[[Caliban]] Face" (second part), as Álvares calls them, based on characters from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Limites: anais|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZoa3CBQyyoC&amp;pg=PA288|year=1995|publisher=EdUSP|language=Portuguese|isbn=978-85-314-0290-6|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the poems of the Ariel Face feature extreme [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]], [[platonic love]], melancholy, among others, the poems of the Caliban Face are heavily morbid, sarcastic and ironic.

From its initial publication in 1853, it would suffer many re-edits, getting to its current form in 1942.

Some studies about this book: "O belo e o disforme", Cilaine Alves; "Risos entre pares", Vagner Camilo; "Uma lira de duas cordas", Rafael Fava Belúzio.

Zuckerberg came up with the idea as part of his New Year's Resolution for 2015 after Cynthia Greco, the Audience Development Manager for MediaOnePA/York Newspaper Company, suggested that Zuckerberg read a new book every month. Zuckerberg modified the idea to one book every two weeks and books which "emphasize learning about new cultures, beliefs, histories and technologies."&lt;ref name=chowdhry/&gt;

'''''Marshy Landscape''''' is an oil painting created in 1883 by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. From 1883-85, van Gogh lived in [[Drenthe]], a remote district of the Netherlands, flat and riven with canals, a landscape of marsh and mist. Throughout 1883, the artist worked on his [[Cottages (Van Gogh series)|series of peasants' cottages]], exploring the local terrain of marshes and peat fields, ditches and canals. Like much of his work of this period, ''Marshy Landscape'' is rendered with subdued earthy tones, giving the impression of being painted with the very soil itself.  Alone in the wilderness, Vincent drew upon the power of nature, the stillness and silence of the marshes inspiring him. He wrote to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]:

{{quote|Went further into the peat fields last week — marvellous scenes, the longer I stay here the more beautiful I find it, and from the outset I’ll try to stay here in this region. For it’s so beautiful here that at the same time a great deal of study is needed to capture it, and only solid work can give a truer understanding of things as they are at bottom, and of their serious, sober nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let389/letter.html Letter 389] To Theo van Gogh. Hoogeveen, Monday, 24 September 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These edifices marked the burial sites of many eminent Egyptians during Egypt's [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] and [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. In the Old Kingdom epoch, local kings began to be buried in [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] instead of in mastabas, although non-royal use of mastabas continued for over a thousand years. Egyptologists call these tombs ''mastaba'', from the Arabic word {{lang|ar|مسطبة}} "stone bench".&lt;ref name="Bench"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mastaba Tomb of Perneb|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/543937|website=Met Museum|access-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[afterlife]] became a main focus of Egyptian civilization and ruled every aspect of the society.{{citation needed|date= March 2016}} This is reflected in Egyptian architecture and most prominently by the enormous amounts of time, money, and manpower involved in the building of tombs.&lt;ref name="Hamlin"&gt;{{cite book |last= Hamlin |first= Talbot |title= Architecture through the Ages |location= New York |publisher= Putnam |year= 1954 |page= 30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptians believed the soul could live only if the body was preserved from corruption and depredation as well as fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Badawy |first= Alexander |title= Architecture in Ancient Egypt and the Near East |location= Cambridge |publisher= MIT Press |year= 1966 |page= 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic]] era and continuing into the later dynasties, the ancient Egyptians developed increasingly complex and effective methods for preserving and protecting the bodies of the dead. The ancient Egyptians initially buried their dead in pit graves dug out from the sand. The body of the deceased was buried inside the pit on a mat, usually along with some items believed to help them in the afterlife. The first tomb structure that the Egyptians built was the mastaba. Mastabas provided better protection from scavenging animals and from grave robbers. However, the human remains were not in contact with the dry desert sand, so natural mummification could not take place. Use of the more secure mastabas required Ancient Egyptians to devise a system of artificial mummification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ancient Egypt and the Near East |location= Cambridge |publisher= MIT Press |year= 1966 |page= 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until at least the Old Period or First Intermediate Period, only high officials and royalty would be buried in these mastabas.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Mastaba schematics.svg|right|thumb|Structure of a mastaba]]
The word 'mastaba' comes from the [[Arabic]] word for a bench of mud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Alan Gardiner |last=Gardiner |first=A. |year=1964 |title=Egypt of the Pharahos |page=57 n7 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when seen from a distance a mastaba does resemble a bench. Historians speculate that the Egyptians may have borrowed architectural ideas from Mesopotamia since at the time they were both building similar structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gascone|first=Bamber|title=History of architecture|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=arb|publisher=History of the world|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-ground structure of a mastaba is rectangular in shape with inward-sloping sides and a flat roof. The exterior building materials were initially bricks made of sun dried mud, which was readily available from the Nile River. Even after more durable materials like stone came into use, all but the most important monumental structures were built from the easily available mud bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=R. |first=C. L. |title=A Model of the Mastaba-Tomb of Userkaf-Ankh |journal=Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |volume=8 |year=1913 |issue=6 |pages=125–130 |jstor=3252928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastabas were often about four times as long as they were wide, and many rose to at least 30 feet in height. The mastaba was built with a north-south orientation, which the Ancient Egyptians believed was essential for access to the afterlife. This above-ground structure had space for a small offering chapel equipped with a false door. Priests and family members brought food and other offerings for the soul, or ''[[Ba (Egyptian soul)|ba]]'', of the deceased because Egyptians believed that the soul had to be maintained in order to continue to exist in the afterlife.

Inside the mastaba, a deep chamber was dug into the ground and lined with stone and bricks. The burial chambers were cut deep, until they passed the bedrock, and were lined with wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|title=Mastabas|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/pyramid_gallery_02.shtml|publisher=bbc|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second hidden chamber called a "serdab" (سرداب), from the Persian word for "cellar",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard | first = K. A. | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1999 |isbn=978-0415185899}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used to store anything that may have been considered essential for the comfort of the deceased in the afterlife, such as beer, cereal, grain, clothes, and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Ralph|title=Burial practices, and Mummies|url=http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/burialpracticesgallery|publisher=Rosicrucian Museum|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mastaba housed a statue of the deceased that was hidden within the masonry for its protection. High up the walls of the serdab were small openings that would allow the ''ba'' to leave and return to the body (represented by the statue); Ancient Egyptians believed the ''ba'' had to return to its body or it would die.  These openings "were not meant for viewing the statue but rather for allowing the fragrance of burning incense, and possibly the spells spoken in rituals, to reach the statue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Dorothea |title=When the Pyramids were Built: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom |location=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1999 |page=12 |isbn=978-0870999086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural evolution==
[[File:Giza pyramid complex (map).svg|right|thumb|Map of the [[Giza Plateau]], showing the mastabas constructed within the complex]]
The mastaba was the standard type of tomb in pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egypt for both the [[pharaoh]] and the social elite. The ancient  city of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] was the location chosen for many of the [[cenotaph]]s. The royal cemetery was at [[Saqqara]], overlooking the capital of early times, [[memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fletcher |first=Banister |year=1996 |title=A History of Architecture |edition=20th |location=Oxford |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0750622677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mastabas evolved over the early dynastic period. During the [[1st Dynasty]], a mastaba was constructed simulating house plans of several rooms, a central one containing the sarcophagus and others surrounding it to receive the abundant funerary offerings. The whole was built in a shallow pit above which a brick superstructure covering a broad area. The typical [[2nd Dynasty|2nd]] and [[3rd Dynasty]] mastabas was the 'stairway mastaba', the tomb chamber of which sank deeper than before and was connected to the top with an inclined shaft and stairs.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt;

Even after pharaohs began to construct pyramids for their tombs in the 3rd Dynasty, members of the nobility continued to be buried in mastaba tombs. This is especially evident on the [[Giza Plateau]], where at least 150 mastaba tombs have been constructed alongside the pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Ben|date=1997|title=THE FUTURE OF THE PAST|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24995879|journal=Scientific American|volume=277|issue=2|pages=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[4th Dynasty]] (c. 2613 to 2494 BC), [[rock-cut tombs]] began to appear. These were tombs built into the rock cliffs in [[Upper Egypt]] in an attempt to further thwart grave robbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=R. |first=L. E. |title=Two Mastaba Chambers |journal=Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin |volume=8 |issue=45 |year=1910 |pages=19–20 |jstor=4423469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastabas, then, were developed with the addition of offering chapels and vertical shafts. [[5th Dynasty]] mastabas had elaborate chapels consisting of several rooms, columned halls and '[[serdab]]'. The actual tomb chamber was built below the south-end of mastaba, connected by a slanting passage to a stairway emerging in the center of a columned hall or court.

Mastabas are still well attested in the Middle Kingdom. Here they had a revival. They were often solid structures with the decoration only on the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, D. (2008): ''Middle Kingdom Tomb Architecture at Lisht'', Egyptian Expedition XXVIII, Metropolitan Museum of Art: New York {{ISBN|9781588391940}}, S. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the time of the [[New Kingdom]] (which began with the [[18th Dynasty]] around 1550 BC), "the mastaba becomes rare, being largely superseded by the independent pyramid chapel above a burial chamber".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badawy |first=Alexander |title=Architecture in Ancient Egypt and the Near East |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1966 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mexican featherwork''', also called "plumería", was an important artistic and decorative technique in the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Hispanic]] and colonial periods in what is now [[Mexico]]. Although feathers have been prized and feather works created in other parts of the world, those done by the ''amanteca'' or feather work specialists impressed Spanish conquerors, leading to a creative exchange with Europe. [[Featherwork]] pieces took on European motifs in Mexico. Feathers and feather works became prized in Europe. The "golden age" for this technique as an art form was from just before the Spanish conquest to about a century afterwards. At the beginning of the 17th century, it began a decline due to the death of the old masters, the disappearance of the birds that provide fine feathers and the depreciation of indigenous handiwork. Feather work, especially the creation of "mosaics" or "paintings" principally of religious images remained noted by Europeans until the 19th century, but by the 20th century, the little that remained had become a handcraft, despite efforts to revive it. Today, the most common feather objects are those made for traditional dance costumes, although mosaics are made in the state of [[Michoacán]], and feather trimmed [[huipil]]s are made in the state of [[Chiapas]].

==Mesoamerican featherwork==

The use of feather for decorative purposes has been documented in many parts of the world in the past. In the [[New World]], it is known to have had ceremonial use and ranking purposes, especially in attire in what are now [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=tcastello18&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses22&gt;Meneses, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesoamerica]], their use became highly developed with some of the most intricate examples coming from what is now [[Mexican Plateau|central Mexico]].&lt;ref name=tcastello17&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this was their symbolic and religious use.&lt;ref name=hmeneses19&gt;Meneses, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this symbolism arose with the spread of the worship of the [[Toltec]] god/king [[Quetzalcoatl]], depicted as a serpent covered in [[quetzal]] feathers. Quetzalcoatl was said to have discovered gold, silver and precious stones. When he fled [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], he released all kind of birds he was breeding.&lt;ref name=tcastello17&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello33&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztec main god, [[Huitzilopochtli]], is associated with the [[hummingbird]]. His origin is from ball of fine feathers that fell on his mother, [[Coatlicue]], and impregnated her. He was born fully armed with an eagle feather shield, fine plumage in his head and on his left sandal.&lt;ref name=arusso3&gt;Russo, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers were valued similarly to [[jade]] and [[turquoise]] in Mesoamerica. They were considered to have magical properties as symbols of fertility, abundance, riches and power and those who used them were associated with divine powers.&lt;ref name=tcastello27&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of use goes back at least as far as the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]], with depictions of them on the murals at [[Bonampak]]. The Mayans also raised birds in part for feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello82&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello19&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Toltec groups were making feathered items from black and white feathers of local origin.&lt;ref name=tcastello33/&gt; The most developed use of feathers in Mesoamerica was among the [[Aztec]]s, [[Tlaxcaltec]]s and [[Purépecha people|Purepecha]].&lt;ref name=tcastello18/&gt; Feathers were used to make many types of objects from arrows, fly whisks, fans, complicated headdresses and fine clothing.&lt;ref name=tcastello238&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; By the reign of the Aztec ruler [[Ahuizotl]], richer feathers from tropical areas came to the [[Aztec Empire]] with quetzal and the finest feathers used by [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma's]] reign.&lt;ref name=tcastello33/&gt; Feathers were used for ceremonial shields, and the garments of Aztec eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Feather work dressed idols and priests as well.&lt;ref name=tcastello20&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Moctezuma asked the Purépecha for help against the Spanish by sending gifts that included quetzal feathers. Among the Purépecha, feathers were used similarly, for ceremonial shields, bucklers, doublets for the cazonci or ruler and feather ceremonial garments for priests, warriors and generals. To declare war, the Purépecha showed enemies wood covered in feathers and send highly prized green feathers to allies and potential allies. Soldiers who died in war were buried with feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello143&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello81&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 67r bottom.jpg|thumb|Aztec warriors with feathered shields and other gear from the Mendoza Codex]]
Feathers from local and faraway sources were used, especially in the Aztec Empire. The feathers were obtained from wild birds as well as from domesticated turkeys and ducks, with the finest feathers coming from Chiapas, [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]] .&lt;ref name=tcastello2735&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 27, 35&lt;/ref&gt; These feathers were obtained through trade and tribute.&lt;ref name=tcastello35&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers functioned as a kind of currency along with cocoa beans, and were a popular trade item because of their value and ease of transport over long distances and a close relationship developed between traders and feather workers.&lt;ref name=tcastello3336&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 33&amp;ndash;36&lt;/ref&gt; Certain areas were required to pay tribute in raw feathers and other in finished feather goods, but no area was required to provide both.&lt;ref name=tcastello65&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuetzalan]] paid tribute to Moctezuma in the form of quetzal feathers. This demand was so great that it led to the local extinction of quetzals in that region, leaving only the name of a local tree, ''quetzalcuahuitl'', where the birds used to hide to eat.&lt;ref name=tcastello195196&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 196&amp;ndash;196&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the [[resplendent quetzal]] which were reserved for deities and the emperor.&lt;ref name=tcastello35/&gt; One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released.&lt;ref name=tcastello28&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Other tropical birds were used as well. [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] made a list of the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either [[threatened species|threatened]] or locally extinct. These include the [[mountain trogon]], [[lovely cotinga]], [[roseate spoonbill]], [[squirrel cuckoo]], [[red-legged honeycreeper]], [[emerald toucanet]], [[agami heron]], [[russet-crowned motmot]], [[turquoise-browed motmot]], [[blue grosbeak]], [[golden eagle]], [[great egret]], [[military macaw]], [[scarlet macaw]], [[yellow-headed amazon]], [[Montezuma oropendola]] and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.&lt;ref name=tcastello207&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello235&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The_Florentine_Codex-_Aztec_Feather_Painters_IV.tiff|thumb|right|Skilled feather workers (''amanteca''). [[Florentine Codex]], Book IV.]]
In Aztec society, the class that created feather objects was called the amanteca, named after the Amantla neighborhood in [[Tenochtitlan]] where they lived and worked.&lt;ref name=tcastello19/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello14&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The amanteca had their own god, [[Coyotlinahual]], who had companions called [[Tizaua]], [[Mamiocelotl]] and [[Mamiltochtli]]. They also honored the female deities [[Xiuhtlati]] and [[Xilo]].&lt;ref name=tcastello56&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses18&gt;Meneses, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Daughters of amanteca generally became embroiderers and feather dyers, with the boys dedicated to the making of feather objects.&lt;ref name=tcastello56/&gt; The amanteca were a privileged class of craftsmen. They did not pay tribute nor were required to perform public service. They had a fair amount of autonomy in how they ran their businesses. Feather work was so highly prized that even sons of nobility learned something of it during their education.&lt;ref name=tcastello57&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The sophistication of this art can be seen in pieces created before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], some of which are part of the collection of the [[Museum of Ethnology, Vienna|Museum of Ethnology in Vienna]], such as [[Montezuma's headdress]], the ceremonial coat of arms and the great fan or fly whisk. Other important examples such as shields are in museums in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=tcastello19/&gt;
[[File:YoungWeaversCCEMEX15.JPG|thumb|left|Close up of a cloth woven in cotton and feathers at the Centro Cultural de España en México in Mexico City]]
The [[Florentine Codex]] gives information about how feather works were created. The amantecas had two ways of creating their works. One was to secure the feathers in place using [[agave]] cord for three-dimensional objects such as fly whisks, fans, bracelets, headgear and other objects. The second and more difficult was a mosaic type technique, which the Spanish also called "feather painting." These were done principally on feather shields and cloaks for idols.&lt;ref name=arusso25&gt;Russo, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello70&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Feather mosaics were arrangements of minute fragments of feathers from a wide variety of birds, generally worked on a paper base, made from cotton and paste, then itself backed with [[amate]] paper, but bases of other types of paper and directly on amate were done as well.&lt;ref name=arusso5&gt;Russo, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello202&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;   These works were done in layers with "common" feathers, dyed feathers and precious feathers. First a model was made with lower quality feathers and the precious feathers found only on the top layer.&lt;ref name=arusso25/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt; The adhesive for the feathers in the Mesoamerican period was made from orchid bulbs.&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt;
[[File:Huipil-de-la-malinche.jpg|thumb|The Huipil of La Malinche with feathered thread borders]]
Sometimes feathers were dyed, and sometimes fine lines or dots were painted on the feathers themselves.&lt;ref name=tcastello203&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In some of the most precious of Aztec art, feathers were combined with gold and precious stones.&lt;ref name=arusso27&gt;Russo, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Feather art needs to be protected from light, which fades the colors and from insects that eat them. Preservatives were made with several kinds of plants, but today commercial insecticides are used.&lt;ref name=tcastello202203&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 202&amp;ndash;203&lt;/ref&gt;

One other way to use feathers was the creation of garments either decorated with feathers or with thread which was created by spinning cotton and feather shreds. The garments of eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Fabric made of the latter was favored by the nobility, both men and women which distinguished them from commoners.&lt;ref name=hmeneses19/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello20/&gt; Little is known how feathers were incorporated into fabric in the Mesoamerican period.&lt;ref name=tcastello77&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The only vestige of this practice is the making of wedding huipils in the town of [[Zinacantán]] in Chiapas. Although research has shown this practice is descended from the Mesoamerican one, it is still different. The Mesoamerican feathered cloth was made with thread made of cotton fiber and feathers done on a backstrap loom, which the current wedding huipils incorporate feathers into commercially spun cotton thread.&lt;ref name=arusso25/&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses88&gt;Meneses, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==European discovery of featherwork==
When the Spanish arrived to Mexico, they were impressed with the bird species of the land and the use of feather, with [[Hernán Cortés]] receiving among his gifts feathers from Moctezuma.&lt;ref name=tcastello20/&gt; As early as 1519, Cortés sent feathered shields, head adornments,  and fans to Spain. In 1524, Diego de Soto returned to Spain from the New World. Among the gifts for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles V]] was artwork, including that made with feathers, such as shields with scenes of sacrifice, serpents, butterflies, birds and crests. In 1527, Cortés sent thirty eight pieces of what are identified as feather work to Asia.&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello11&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Conquest, the art of working with feathers survived, but on a lesser scale and its uses changed.&lt;ref name=tcastello82/&gt; pagan  ritual use ended with Christian evangelization, with some surviving works conveying Christian religious themes. Featherwork's use in war also remained. One type of feather work to remains strong was the creation of mosaics, many of which were created and sent to Europe, Guatemala and Peru.&lt;ref name=tcastello40&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; They were even sent as far as Asia as gifts but little is known of this trade.&lt;ref name=tcastello104&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Exotic feathers themselves were exported to Europe and used to adorn hats, horses and clothing.&lt;ref name=tcastello40&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of feather work and the impression it made on the Spanish is documented by Spaniards such as Hernán Cortés, [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguilar]], [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]], [[Francisco López de Gómara]], [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera|Peter Martyr]], Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and [[Andrés de Tapia Motelchiuh|Andres de Tapia]] .&lt;ref name=tcastello12&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers add chromatic and luminous feathers difficult to create with paints, although oil painting at the time had well developed techniques to play with light.&lt;ref name=arusso27/&gt; Mexican expertise was valued as well.  Even though there was feather art also made in Asia, it was not as valued in the 16th and 17th century as that from Mexico.&lt;ref name=tcastello103&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featherwork with Christian themes==
[[File:Juan Bautista Cuiris - Portrait of Christ Made of Humming Bird and Parrot Feathers - WGA05815.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Christ made of humming bird and parrot feathers by Juan Bautista Cuiris|270x270px]]
Feather work and the conquest led to a creative exchange from the conquest to about 1800.&lt;ref name=arusso6&gt;Russo, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelism added Christian themes to feather work, including the making of ritual items.&lt;ref name=tcastello12/&gt; Amantecas were creating Christian religious images within months after the arrival of the conquistadors, destined for Europe as well as Asia.&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt; The first known Christian-inspired pictures in feather work were made for banners, on a cotton cloth with an [[imprimatur]], on which the design was made. They had a backing of very fine palm or rush mats bound with twine or vegetable [[liana]]s.&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt; The [[Huejotzingo Codex]] depicts the making of a feather and gold banner, the first indication of feather work with Christian images.&lt;ref name=tcastello186&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, feather work was suppressed by the Spanish as part of their efforts to eradicate the old religion.  However, they soon changed tactics and employed the feather workers to create Christian images. These new works are called "feather mosaics" because of the small pieces of feathers used, and most are in the Baroque style then favored, as the artists copied images brought from Spain.&lt;ref name=tcastello21&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; After the Conquest, hummingbird feathers were used to adorn images of Christ in Michoacan, such as agave yarn sandals in hummingbird feathers made in [[Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán|Tzintzuntzan]].&lt;ref name=tcastello202/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello145&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Indian craftsmen made and offered crosses and candlesticks adorned with green feathers called quezalli.&lt;ref name=tcastello175&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Small scale feather images and pendants serving as protective amulets were also made.&lt;ref name=arusso17&gt;Russo, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century mosaics were made with different sized feathers combined with paper strips. Over the years, the feathers became smaller, the compositions more harmonious and the designs more subtle with the additions of gold leaf, gold foil and colored brushwork. The basic imagery was European but the edging shows traces of pre Hispanic designs.&lt;ref name=tcastello207208&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of feather art images focused on founders and patron saints, along with figures related to the various religious orders. These always followed the recommendations of the [[Council of Trent]] and often to the dominant style.&lt;ref name=tcastello125&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Feathered religious items were sent to Europe, including to several popes in Rome. A number of these were re-gifted to other nobles and for this reason can be found in various museums in various parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=tcastello2122&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Feather work became a popular item in the collection of kings, emperors, nobles, clergy, intellectuals and naturalists from the 16th to 18th century, with pieces reaching courts in Prague, Abras Castle, El Escorial and various other cities in Europe. Some even went as far as China, Japan and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt;[[File:Huanitzin.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The ''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego Huanutzin]], nephew and son in law of [[Moctezuma II]] to present to [[Pope Paul III]], dated 1539, now in the [[Musée des Jacobins (Auch)|Musée des Jacobins]] in [[Auch]], [[France]].]]In addition to the images, feathers were used to adorn priests' clothing such as chasubles, rain capes and [[mitre|miters]]. They also made feather decorations for church altars and convents.&lt;ref name=tcastello21/&gt; Feathered miters and other vestments were sent and gifted to European bishops, especially in southern Europe and were used while conducting Mass.&lt;ref name=arusso5/&gt; Although there are no written records to indicate that this use of feathered vestments were a result of Mexican influence, they did not appear until after the mid 16th century.&lt;ref name=tcastello160&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;  European engravings were used as a model for feather images created for miters which today can be still found in Milan, Florence and New York. However, these and other Christian images were not exact copies of the prints as elements from several prints were combined and even pre Hispanic motifs appeared in some. These miters served as an innovation in the pictoral language of the church as the vestments themselves added a kind of power through their magnificence.&lt;ref name=arusso1920&gt;Russo, p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Monastery schools in Mexico, especially those run by the Franciscans and Augustinians, taught feather work, especially the creation of feather mosaics.&lt;ref name=tcastello21/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello152&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The skills of these artists remained important initially, even able to reproduce Latin calligraphy. One important example of this is  "Sacras de Ambras" at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]. Here, black feathers are pasted over a ribbon of small white feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello125/&gt; One particularly notable area of colonial feather working was in Patzcauaro, Michoacán. These workers maintained many of the ancient privileges of pre Hispanic feather workers.&lt;ref name=tcastello147152&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 147&amp;ndash;152&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican feather work inspired European works such as the Libro di piume (The Feather Book) by Dionisio Minaggio, the gardener to the governor of Milan, who learned the technique and created reproductions of birds in his regions, as well as portraits of the actors of the Commedia dell'arte.&lt;ref name=arusso56&gt;Russo, pp. 5&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists such as Tommaso Ghisi and Jacopo Ligozzi used the technique as well to create works for the collections of the Medicis, Aldrovandi, Settala and Rudolf II of Prague.&lt;ref name=arusso6/&gt; Ulisse Aldrovandi described the creation of feather mosaics as a "threshold between art and science."&lt;ref name=arusso14&gt;Russo, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featherwork 1600-1900==
The "golden age" of Mexican feather work lasted until the very beginning of the 17th century, when it declined because the old masters disappeared. At this time, demand for the work declined as well, because the Spanish began to disdain indigenous handcrafts and oil painting became preferred for the production of religious images.&lt;ref name=tcastello12/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello22&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, imagery done in feather work became more varied, including the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] and those from [[European mythology]], especially on fans for ladies.&lt;ref name=tcastello200&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello128&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques changed to include a profusion of paper strips on mosaics, replacing the earlier use of gold trimmings.&lt;ref name=tcastello208&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; One image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is completely of feathers. While she is clothed in the usual way, the image lacks many of the decorations and symbols that are now standard. This may indicate that this is one of the first copies of the image.&lt;ref name=tcastello128/&gt; Another important 17th century piece depicts the [[Assumption of Mary]], now in the [[Museum of the Americas (Madrid)|Museum of the Americas in Madrid]] .&lt;ref name=tcastello130&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

More modification of the technique occurred in the 18th century, perhaps because it was no longer done only by the indigenous. Feather work was supplemented with the use of oil paint to depict people (especially faces and hands), landscapes and animals and tiny strips of paper were dropped along with the outer borders.&lt;ref name=tcastello208/&gt;&lt;ref name=arusso29&gt;Russo, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

By the nineteenth century, the craft all but disappeared with only some limited activity in Michoacán. Many were done with cheap, dyed feathers, smaller works with little artistic value.&lt;ref name=tcastello22/&gt; They, however, still attracted attention from visitors to Mexico. In 1803, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] visited [[Pátzcuaro]] and both a feather image of Our Lady of Health, which is now in a German museum. Her hands and face are in oil but the rest is in hummingbird feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello208/&gt; Count Beltrani traveled in Mexico in 1830 and mentioned Michoacan feather work in his journals, obtaining two mosaics.  [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Frances Calderon de la Barca]], with of the first Spanish ambassador to Mexico, noted that the mosaics of saints and angels were crude in drawing but exquisite in coloring.&lt;ref name=tcastello209&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The nuns at the Santa Rosa Convent in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]] were noted for their feather work in the 19th century, with several notable works still in existence.&lt;ref name=tcastello209/&gt; In the mid 19th century, [[lithography]] was introduced in Mexico and some prints were used as bases for feather work, which were then backed with sheet metal. In Puebla, this was a popular technique for folk figures such as the China Poblana.&lt;ref name=tcastello213&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The last innovation in the craft was the use of photographs. One such work used a photograph of Juan Arriaga de Yturbe done by Monico Guzman Alvarez of Patzcuaro, done in 1895.&lt;ref name=tcastello214&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featherwork 1900-2000==
By the 20th century, feather work existed as a handcraft, rather than as art. One reason for this was that the disappearance of many bird species has led to a lack of fine feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello221&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the century feather work images were almost exclusively of postcards or other informal forms, with images of cockfights or birds made with dyed chicken or turkey feathers. [[Manuel Gamio]] tried to revive feather work's artistic nature. In 1920 he designed and supervised the creation of two mural panels, one with an Aztec serpent and the other with a Mayan serpent, copied from archeological pieces. It was done on black silk with quetzal feathers, gold, silver and silk threads. However, the fate of these works is not known.&lt;ref name=tcastello221/&gt;

Similarly, garments made with feathers have also almost completely disappeared. The only vestige of this is the wedding huipil made by the Tzotzils in Zinacatlan, Chiapas. However, these have the feathers added to commercially made cotton thread, anchored to it as decoration. Thread spun with feathers is no longer made.&lt;ref name=hmeneses2526&gt;Meneses, pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt;  One other notable piece was a reproduction of the "Montezuma headdress" made for the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=tcastello22/&gt;

In the latter 20th century, a number of artists tried to bring back the technique as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, she had to stop by the 1990s because of the difficultly of obtaining feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello221/&gt; Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] with the goal of applying them to feather work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using crepe paper cut outs and colored feathers.  However, she, too, no longer works with this technique.&lt;ref name=tcastello222&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.&lt;ref name=tcastello225&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable family that continues the technique as a handcraft is the Olay family. This tradition began when Gabriel Olay traveled with a mule train and hunted birds during his wanderings. Then an indigenous person taught him the basics of feather working. He developed his craft then passed it onto his children and grandchildren. Most of the family works on reproductions of pre Hispanic images. Son Gabriel Olay Olay has created a large body of work in the technique and lives in [[Tlalpujahua]], Michoacan. Four of his pieces are part of the collection of the Morelia Cultural Center and others in various museums in the state of Michoacan. His image of the Virgin of Guadalupe was given by Mexican president [[Luis Echeverría]] to [[Pope John XXIII]] and is part of the Vatican's collection. Grandson Hans Matias Olay specializes in reproducing the birds and flowers that the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] in [[Guerrero]] paint on amate paper. In 1990, the National Museum of Anthropology held an exhibit of works by Gabriel Olay Ramos and his sisters Gloria and Esperanza.  Olay Ramos lives in Mexico City and mostly uses rooster and hen feathers dyed in different colors. The Olays try to maintain as much of the pre Hispanic technique as possible, avoiding peacock and pheasant feathers as they are not native to Mexico. They use Campeche wax to affix the feathers and amate paper as the backing.&lt;ref name=tcastello222223&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 222&amp;ndash;223&lt;/ref&gt;

Other workers with feathers include Juan Carlos Ortiz of Puebla who also creates feather mosaics, Jorge Castillo of [[Taxco]] who combines silver and feathers.&lt;ref name=tcastello226&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common use of feathers in modern Mexico is in the creation of traditional dance costumes. These include the headdresses for dances such as the Quetzales in [[Puebla]] and the Concheros performed in various parts of central Mexico. In Oaxaca, there is the Dance of the Feather, which used dyed ostrich feathers and for the Dance of Calala, in [[Suchiapa]], Chiapas, the main dancer uses a fan of turkey and rooster feathers. Ostrich feathers are the most common in traditional dance costumes, followed by rooster, turkey and hen feathers. Despite their bright color, peacock feathers are rarely used. In most cases, the symbolic meaning of the feathers has been forgotten. One notable exception is the [[Huichol]]s, who have maintained much of their original cosmology.&lt;ref name=tcastello227&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable featherwork pieces==
Despite its popularity from in the late Mesoamerican period into the early colonial period, few vestiges with this technique survive into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=hmeneses11&gt;Meneses, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  One reason for this is the care needed to maintain the pieces. It is important to know the characteristics of each type of feather to use and preserve them correctly. The best feathers to use are those that have been molted, as they have less organic materials and less likely to deteriorate.  A feather object can last indefinitely if it is preserved in a hermetically sealed case of inert gas, with a fixed humidity, darkness and low temperature. However, this renders the piece unobservable. These objects can be exhibited in galleries, museums and private collections with minimal decay if temperature and humidity are controlled and light kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name=tcastello238/&gt;

Perhaps the best known piece is the so-called Montezuma's headdress. Despite its name, research has proven that it was not worn by the Aztec emperor. It was most likely made for an image as it looks like the one for Quetzalcoatl depicted in the [[Codex Magliabechiano]]. The original is in the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna. A replica made with authentic techniques was made for the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=tcastello70/&gt;

Because of the sending of many fine feather mosaics to Europe, a number of important pieces are located in museums and other collections on that continent. The oldest feather piece created by Christian indigenous workers is the Misa de San Gregorio at the Museum of the Jacobins in [[Auch]], France. It was commissioned by [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego de Huanitzin]], a converted member of Moctezuma's family and [[Pedro de Gante]]. It was probably made by artisans from San Jose de Belen de los Naturales. It is dated 1539 and given as a gift to [[Pope Paul III]] by [[Antonio de Mendoza]], according to the inscription, following the [[papal bull]] that declared the indigenous to be endowed with reason and able to fully participate in Catholic rites. It is probably the piece never made it to the Pope and its interim fate is unknown. However, it was rediscovered in 1987, when a second-hand clothes dealer took it to auction in Paris.&lt;ref name=arusso17&gt;Russo, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello118119&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 118&amp;ndash;119&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable work is from the 19th century called San Lucas pintando a la Virgen, located in the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in Paris. It is attributed to painter [[Juan Correa]]. The clothing is done in feathers but the face and hands were done in oil.&lt;ref name=tcastello138&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of important feather mosaic pieces remain in Mexico. San Pedro is a work from the 16th century, found at the archbishopric of Puebla and shows Roman influence in the style.&lt;ref name=tcastello120&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Another piece in Puebla is a portrait of [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]], who protected the Indians in Puebla.&lt;ref name=tcastello126&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; La Piedad is from the 17th century at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]]. It depicts Mary with Jesus dead on her lap.&lt;ref name=tcastello130/&gt; Another piece in this museum is the Virgen del Rosario, from the 17th century, with the imagery of the Rosary important to counter Islam and Protestantism.&lt;ref name=tcastello135&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; One important 16th century image is Salvator Mundi at the [[Museo del Virreinato, Tepotzotlán|Museum of Tepotzotlan]]. It shows influence from Byzantine iconography including Asian features. In the four corners there are Cyrillic characters repeated that have not been deciphered. The inscription FILIUS appears on the right when it should be on the left.&lt;ref name=arusso17/&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello120/&gt;

No examples of pre Conquest feather fabric survive, and only a few survive from the colonial period.&lt;ref name=tcastello85&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Important cloths of this type include two mantles from [[San Miguel Zinacantepec]], the Huipil of La Malinche at the Museum of Anthropology, the Tlamachayatl at the Ethnographic and Historical Museum  in Rome and the Paño Novohispano at the Museo Textil de Oaxaca.&lt;ref name=hmeneses1112&gt;Meneses, pp. 11&amp;ndash;12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcastello8889&gt;Castello Yturbide, pp. 88&amp;ndash;89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hmeneses24&gt;Meneses, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  All have feathers or feather pieces either embroidered onto or twisted into cotton. The Paño is a remnant of a huipil with feathers woven into the cloth, and is of a very similar design to the Malinche huipil.&lt;ref name=hmeneses1214&gt;Meneses, p. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Church vestments, especially miters can be found in various collections in Europe including the Vatican. The church of [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]], Rome preserves two 18th century sets of vestments which were gifts from Mexico. These include two miters with a base of flax paper and silk with white feathers glued onto it. Against this background are small pieces of paper sewn on, then with colored feathers glued to these to form floral wreath patterns.&lt;ref name=tcastello98&gt;Castello Yturbide, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monks Mound in July.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Monks Mound]], built ''circa'' 950–1100 CE and located at the [[Cahokia|Cahokia Mounds]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] near [[Collinsville, Illinois]], is the largest [[pre-Columbian]] [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] in America north of [[Mesoamerica]].]]

The various cultures collectively termed '''Mound Builders''' were inhabitants of [[North America]] who, during a 5,000-year period, constructed various styles of earthen [[mound]]s for religious, ceremonial, burial, and elite residential purposes. These included the [[pre-Columbian]] cultures of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], [[Woodland period]] ([[Calusa]] culture [[Adena culture|Adena]] and [[Hopewell culture]]s), and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian period]]; dating from roughly 3500 BCE (the construction of [[Watson Brake]]) to the 16th century CE, and living in regions of the [[Great Lakes]], the [[Ohio River]] Valley, and the [[Mississippi River]] valley and its tributary waters.&lt;ref&gt;See Squier p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, the prevailing scholarly consensus has been that the mounds were constructed by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Sixteenth-century Spanish explorers met natives living in a number of later Mississippian cities, described their cultures, and left artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Constance E. Richards, "[http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~arch/berrysitepress/amerarchspring2008.pdf Contact and Conflict]", ''American Archaeologist'', Spring 2004, accessed 26 Jun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Research and study of these cultures and peoples has been based mostly on [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]].

==Woodland culture==
[[File:Mississippian culture mound components HRoe 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A mound diagram of the [[platform mound]] showing the multiple layers of mound construction, mound structures such as temples or mortuaries, ramps with log stairs, and prior structures under later layers, multiple terraces, and intrusive burials]]

The namesake cultural trait of the Mound Builders was the building of mounds and other earthworks. These burial and ceremonial structures were typically [[Frustum|flat-topped pyramid]]s or [[platform mound]]s, flat-topped or rounded cones, elongated ridges, and sometimes a variety of other forms. They were generally built as part of complex villages. The early earthworks built in [[Louisiana]] around 3500 BCE are the only ones known to have been built by a hunter-gatherer culture.

The best-known flat-topped pyramidal structure, which at more than 100 ft (30&amp;nbsp;m) tall is the largest pre-Columbian earthwork north of [[Mexico]], is [[Monks Mound]] at [[Cahokia]] in present-day [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. At its maximum about CE 1150, Cahokia was an urban settlement with 20,000–30,000 people; this population was not exceeded by North American European settlements until after 1800.

[[File:Serpent Mound - The Century.gif|thumb|250px|A depiction of the [[Serpent Mound]] in southern Ohio, as published in the magazine ''The Century'', April 1890]]
Some [[effigy mound]]s were constructed in the shapes or outlines of culturally significant animals. The most famous effigy mound, [[Serpent Mound]] in southern Ohio, ranges from 1 to just over 3 ft tall  (30–100 cm)., 20 ft (6&amp;nbsp;m) wide, more than 1,330 ft (405&amp;nbsp;m) long, and shaped as an undulating [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]].

Many different [[tribe|tribal groups]] and [[chiefdom]]s, involving an array of beliefs and unique cultures over thousands of years, built mounds as expressions of their cultures. The general term, "mound builder", covered their shared architectural practice of earthwork mound construction. This practice, believed to be associated with a [[cosmology]] that had a cross-cultural appeal, may indicate common cultural antecedents. The first mound building was an early marker of political and social complexity among the cultures in the [[Eastern United States]]. [[Watson Brake]] in Louisiana, constructed about 3500 BCE during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Middle Archaic period]], is the oldest dated mound complex in North America. It is one of 11 mound complexes from this period found in the Lower Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ccsmpug-xaoC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Hedgepeth+Middle+Archaic+site&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2wHOwXsN4r&amp;sig=5dL53XIFwgUqr8BCFujsxMRXpBo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x8-tTo-SBcrIsQLa6pXaDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hedgepeth%20Middle%20Archaic%20site&amp;f=false Robert W. Preucel, Stephen A. Mrozowski, ''Contemporary Archaeology in Theory: The New Pragmatism,''] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

These mound builders were organized; hundreds or even thousands of workers had to dig up tons of earth with the hand tools available, the soil had to be moved long distances, and finally, workers had to create the shape the builder had planned.

==Archaeological surveys==
[[File:Portsmouth Works Group A B C D Squier and Davis 01.jpg|thumb|250px|A depiction of the [[Portsmouth Earthworks]] in ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'']]
The most complete reference for these earthworks is ''[[Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley]]'', written by [[E. G. Squier|Ephraim G. Squier]] and Edwin H. Davis. It was published [[1848 in archaeology|in 1848]] by the [[Smithsonian]] Institution. Since many of the features which the authors documented have since been destroyed or diminished by farming and development, their surveys, sketches, and descriptions are still used by modern [[archeology|archaeologists]]. All of the sites which they identified as located in [[Kentucky]] came from the manuscripts of [[C. S. Rafinesque]].

==Reports of early European explorers==
[[File:Parkin Mounds Aerial HRoe 2016.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the [[Parkin Archeological State Park|Parkin Site]], thought to be the capital of the Province of [[Casqui]] visited by de Soto]]
[[Hernando de Soto]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]], who during 1540–1542, traversed what became the Southeast United States, encountered many different mound-builder peoples, perhaps descendants of the great [[Mississippian culture]]. The mound-building tradition still existed in the southeast during the mid-16th century. De Soto observed people living in fortified towns with lofty [[Platform mound|mounds]] and plazas, and surmised that many of the mounds served as foundations for priestly temples. Near present-day [[Augusta, Georgia]], de Soto encountered a mound-building group ruled by a queen, [[Cofitachequi]]. She told him that the mounds within her territory served as the burial places for nobles.

[[File:Bulletin (1901) (20396721516).jpg|thumb|250px|Engraving after [[Jacques Le Moyne]], showing the burial of a Timucua chief]]
The artist [[Jacques Le Moyne]], who had accompanied [[France|French]] settlers to northeastern Florida during the 1560s, likewise noted many Native American groups using existing mounds and constructing others. He produced a series of watercolor paintings depicting scenes of native life. Although most of his paintings have been lost, some engravings were copied from the originals and published in 1591 by a [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] company. Among these is a depiction of the burial of an aboriginal Floridian tribal chief, an occasion of great mourning and ceremony. The original caption reads:

{{cquote|Sometimes the deceased king of this province is buried with great solemnity, and his great cup from which he was accustomed to drink is placed on a tumulus with many arrows set about it.|20px|20px|Jacques Le Moyne, 1560s}}

[[Maturin Le Petit]], a [[Jesuit]] priest, met the [[Natchez people]] as did [[Le Page du Pratz]] (1758), a French explorer. Both observed them in the area that later became Mississippi. The Natchez were devout [[solar deity|worshippers of the sun]]. Having a population of some 4,000, they occupied at least nine villages and were presided over by a [[paramount chief]], known as the Great Sun, who wielded absolute power. Both observers noted the high temple mounds which the Natchez had built so that the Great Sun could commune with God, the sun. His large residence was built atop the highest mound, from “which, every morning, he greeted the rising sun, invoking thanks and blowing tobacco smoke to the four cardinal directions.”&lt;ref&gt;Mallory O'Connor, ''Lost Cities of the Ancient Southeast'' (University Press of Florida, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ephraim Squier and Edwin Davis, ''Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley'' (Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, vol. 1. Washington DC, 1848)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biloine Young and Melvin Fowler, ''Cahokia: The Great Native American Metropolis'' (University of Illinois Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- These cover all of the above paragraphs --&gt;

Later explorers to the same regions, only a few decades after mound-building settlements had been reported, found the regions largely depopulated, the residents vanished, and the mounds untended. Since  little violent conflict with Europeans had occurred in that area during that period, the most plausible explanation is that infectious diseases from the Old World, such as [[smallpox]] and [[influenza]], had decimated most of the Native Americans who had comprised the last mound-builder civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Davis Brose and N'omi Greber (eds.), ''Hopewell Archaeology'' (Kent State UP, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Kennedy, ''Hidden Cities: The Discovery and Loss of Ancient North American Civilization'' (Free Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Silverberg, "...And the Mound-Builders Vanished from the Earth", originally in the 1969 edition of ''American Heritage'', collected in the anthology ''A Sense of History'' [Houghton-Mifflin, 1985]; available online [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1969/4/1969_4_60.shtml here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828083500/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1969/4/1969_4_60.shtml |date=2008-08-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon M.

[[File:Poverty Point Aerial HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of [[Poverty Point]] in [[West Carroll Parish, Louisiana]]]]
Radiocarbon dating has established the age of the earliest Archaic mound complex in southeastern Louisiana. One of the two Monte Sano Site mounds, excavated in 1967 before being destroyed for new construction at Baton Rouge, was dated at 6220 BP (plus or minus 140 years).&lt;ref name="RSaunders"/&gt; Researchers at the time thought that such societies were not organizationally capable of this type of construction.&lt;ref name="RSaunders"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/40656501 Rebecca Saunders, "The Case for Archaic Period Mounds in Southeastern Louisiana"], ''Southeastern Archaeology'', Vol. 13, No. 2, Winter 1994, accessed 4 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been dated as about 6500 BP, or 4500 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important new findings in Louisiana|url=http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000363.html|work=Archaeo News|publisher=Stone Pages|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not all agree.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ed3aT7jIxQUC&amp;dq=Monte+Sano+Site+%2816EBR17%29&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Joe W. Saunders, "Middle Archaic and Watson Brake"], in ''Archaeology of Louisiana,'' edited by Mark A. Rees, Ian W. (FRW) Brown, LSU Press, 2010, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Watson Brake]] is located in the floodplain of the [[Ouachita River]] near Monroe in northern Louisiana. Securely dated to about 5,400 years ago (around 3500 BCE), in the Middle Archaic period, it consists of a formation of 11 mounds from 3 to 25 ft (1-8 m) tall, connected by ridges to form an oval nearly 900 ft (270 m) across.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2010 pp. 69-76"&gt;Saunders, in Rees and Brown (2010), ''Archaeology of Louisiana'', pp. 69-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the Americas, building of complex earthwork mounds started at an early date, well before the [[pyramids]] of Egypt were constructed. Watson Brake was being constructed nearly 2,000 years before the better-known [[Poverty Point]], and building continued for 500 years.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2010 pp. 69-76"/&gt; Middle Archaic mound construction seems to have ceased about 2800 BC, and scholars have not ascertained the reason, but it may have been because of changes in river patterns or other environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, in Rees and Brown (2010), ''Archaeology of Louisiana'', pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 1990s dating of Watson Brake and similar complexes, scholars established that preagricultural, preceramic American societies could organize to accomplish complex construction during extended periods of time, invalidating scholars' traditional ideas of Archaic society.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, in Rees and Brown (2010), ''Archaeology of Louisiana'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Watson Brake was built by a hunter-gatherer society, the people of which occupied the area on only a seasonal basis, but where successive generations organized to build the complex mounds over a 500-year period. Their food consisted mostly of fish and deer, as well as available plants.

Poverty Point, built about 1500 BCE in what is now Louisiana, is a prominent example of Late Archaic mound-builder construction (around 2500 BCE – 1000 BCE). It is a striking complex of more than one square mile, where six earthwork crescent ridges were built in concentric arrangement, interrupted by radial aisles. Three mounds are also part of the main complex, and evidence of residences extends for about 3 miles along the bank of [[Bayou Macon]]. It is the major site among 100 associated with the [[Poverty Point culture]] and is one of the best-known early examples of earthwork monumental architecture. Unlike the localized societies during the Middle Archaic, this culture showed evidence of a wide trading network outside its area, which is one of its distinguishing characteristics.

[[Horr's Island]], Florida, now a gated community next to [[Marco Island, Florida|Marco Island]], when excavated by Michael Russo in 1980 found an Archaic Indian village site. Mound A was a burial mound that dated to 3400 BCE, making it the oldest known burial mound in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Brown&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2018}}

===Woodland period===
{{main|Woodland period}}
The oldest mound associated with the Woodland period was the mortuary mound and pond complex at the [[Fort Center]] site in Glade County, Florida. 2012 excavations and dating by Thompson and Pluckhahn show that work began around 2600 BCE, seven centuries before the mound-builders in Ohio.
[[File:Grave Creek Mound.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Grave Creek Mound]], [[Moundsville, West Virginia]], [[Adena culture]]]]

The Archaic period was followed by the Woodland period (''circa'' 1000 BCE). Some well-understood examples are the [[Adena culture]] of [[Ohio]], [[West Virginia]], and parts of nearby states. The subsequent [[Hopewell culture]] built monuments from present-day [[Illinois]] to Ohio; it is renowned for its geometric earthworks. The Adena and Hopewell were not the only mound-building peoples during this time period. Contemporaneous mound-building cultures existed throughout what is now the [[Eastern United States]], stretching as far south as [[Crystal River (Florida)|Crystal River]] in western Florida. During this time, in parts of present-day Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, the Hopewellian [[Marksville culture]] degenerated and was succeeded by the [[Baytown culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/seac/outline/04-woodland/index-3.htm|title=Southeastern Prehistory-Late Woodland Period|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for degeneration include attacks from other tribes or the impact of severe climatic changes undermining agriculture.

===Coles Creek culture===

{{main|Coles Creek culture}}
The Coles Creek culture is a Late Woodland culture (700-1200 CE) in the [[Lower Mississippi Valley]] in the Southern United States that marks a significant change of the cultural history of the area. Population and cultural and political complexity increased, especially by the end of the Coles Creek period. Although many of the classic traits of [[chiefdom]] societies were not yet made, by CE 1000, the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Coles Creek sites are found in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Texas. The Coles Creek culture is considered ancestral to the Plaquemine culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kidder|first=Tristram|editors=R.

{{main|Fort Ancient culture}}
Fort Ancient is the name for a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture that flourished from 1000-1650 CE among a people who predominantly inhabited land along the [[Ohio River]] in areas of modern-day southern Ohio, northern [[Kentucky]], and western [[West Virginia]].

===Plaquemine culture===
[[File:Holly Bluff Aerial HRoe 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|Illustration of the [[Holly Bluff Site]] in [[Yazoo County, Mississippi]]]]
{{main|Plaquemine culture}}
A continuation of the Coles Creek culture in the lower [[Mississippi River]] Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana. Examples include the [[Medora Site]] in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana; and the [[Anna Site|Anna]] and [[Emerald Mound Site|Emerald Mound]] sites in Mississippi. Sites inhabited by Plaquemine peopless continued to be used as vacant ceremonial centers without large village areas much as their Coles Creek ancestors had done, although their layout began to show influences from Middle Mississippian peoples to the north. The [[Winterville Site|Winterville]] and [[Holly Bluff Site|Holly Bluff]] (Lake George) sites in western Mississippi are good examples that exemplify this change of layout, but continuation of site usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/SEAC/hnc/outline/05-mississippian/index.htm|title=Mississippian and Late Prehistoric Period|accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Terminal Coles Creek period (CE 1150 to 1250), contact increased with [[Mississippian culture]]s centered upriver near St. Louis, Missouri. This resulted in the adaption of new [[Mississippian culture pottery|pottery techniques]],  as well as new ceremonial objects and possibly new social patterns during the Plaquemine period.&lt;ref name=PLAQMISS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/archaeology/virtualbooks/LAPREHIS/plaqu.htm|title=Plaquemine-Mississippian| accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more Mississippian culture influences were absorbed, the Plaquemine area as a distinct culture began to shrink after CE 1350. Eventually, the last enclave of purely Plaquemine culture was the Natchez Bluffs area, while the Yazoo Basin and adjacent areas of Louisiana became a hybrid Plaquemine-Mississippian culture.&lt;ref name=ENCYCARCH&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeology of prehistoric native America: an encyclopedia|author1=Guy E.

==Alternative explanations==
Through the mid-19th century, European Americans did not recognize that ancestors of the Native Americans had built the prehistoric mounds of the eastern U.S. They believed that the massive earthworks and large ceremonial complexes were built by a different people. A ''[[New York Times]] ''article from 1897 described a mound in Wisconsin in which a giant human skeleton measuring over 9 ft in length was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EED61330E333A25753C2A9649D94669ED7CF|title=Wisconsin Mound Opened: Skeleton Found of a Man Over Nine Feet High with an Enormous Skull|date=December 20, 1897|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1886, another ''New York Times'' article described water receding from a mound in [[Cartersville, Georgia]], which uncovered acres of skulls and bones, some of which were said to be gigantic. Two thigh bones were measured with the height of their owners estimated at 14 ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E1D71330E533A25756C0A9629C94679FD7CF|title=Monster Skulls and Bones|date=April 5, 1886|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] made reference to the giants whose bones fill the mounds of America. {{blockquote|"But still there is more. It calls up the indefinite past. When Columbus first sought this continent – when Christ suffered on the cross – when Moses led Israel through the Red-Sea – nay, even, when Adam first came from the hand of his Maker – then as now, Niagara was roaring here. The eyes of that species of extinct giants, whose bones fill the mounds of America, have gazed on Niagara, as ours do now. Co[n]temporary with the whole race of men, and older than the first man, Niagara is strong, and fresh to-day as ten thousand years ago. The Mammoth and Mastodon – now so long dead, that fragments of their monstrous bones, alone testify, that they ever lived, have gazed on Niagara.

The antiquarian author [[William Pidgeon (archaeologist)|William Pidgeon]] created fraudulent surveys of mound groups that did not exist, possibly tainting this opinion, which was replaced by others.&lt;ref&gt;Pidgeon, William (1858) ''Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches''. Horace Thayer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finney, Fred (2008) William Pidgeon and T.H. Lewis. ''Minnesota Archaeologist'' 67: 89–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham, Robert A. and Leslie E. Eisenberg (2000) ''Indian Mounds of Wisconsin.'' University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, Wisconsin, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major factor in increasing public knowledge of the origins of the mounds was the 1894 report by [[Cyrus Thomas]] of the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]].  He concluded that the prehistoric earthworks of the Eastern United States were the work of early cultures of Native Americans. A small number of people had earlier made similar conclusions: [[Thomas Jefferson]], for example, excavated a mound and from the artifacts and burial practices, noted similarities between mound-builder funeral practices and those of Native Americans in his time. In addition, [[Theodore Lewis]] in 1886 had refuted Pidgeon's fraudulent claims of pre-Native American moundbuilders.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Theodore H. (1886) "The 'Monumental Tortoise' Mounds of 'Dee-Coo-Dah'" ''The American Journal of Archaeology'' 2(1):65–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers and scholars have proposed many alternative origins for the Mound Builders:
;Vikings
In 1787, [[Benjamin Smith Barton]] proposed the theory that the Mound Builders were [[Viking]]s who came to North America and eventually disappeared.&lt;ref name="feder"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frauds, Myths, And Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology |last=Feder |first=Kenneth L. | authorlink=Kenneth Feder |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=Central Connecticut State Univ |chapter=The Myth of the Moundbuilders |isbn=978-0-07-286948-4 |pages=151–155, 159–160, 164–166 |url=http://www.udel.edu/anthro/neitzel/mythofmoundbuilders.pdf |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ancient world immigrants
Other people believed that [[Greeks]], [[Africans]], [[History of China|Chinese]], or assorted [[European ethnic groups|European]]s built the mounds. Some Euro-Americans thought the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israel]] had built the mounds.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;

;''Book of Mormon'' inhabitants
{{See also|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon}}
During the 19th century, a common belief was that the [[Jews]], particularly the Lost Ten Tribes, were the ancestors of Native Americans and the Mound Builders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-27txt.htm|author=Chapman, Jefferson|authorlink=Jefferson Chapman|title=Prehistoric American Indians in Tennessee|publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|accessdate=2012-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205072907/http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/research/renotes/rn-27txt.htm|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' (published first in 1830) provides a related belief, as its narrative describes two major immigrations to the Americas from [[Mesopotamia]]: the [[Jaredite]]s (3000–2000 BCE) and an Israelite group in 590 BCE (termed [[Nephite]]s, [[Lamanite]]s, and [[Mulekite]]s). While the Nephites, Lamanites, and Mulekites were all of Jewish origin coming from Israel around 590 BCE, the Jaradites were a non-Abrahamic people separate in all aspects, except in a belief in Jehovah, from the Nephites. ''The Book of Mormon'' depicts these settlers building magnificent cities, which were destroyed by warfare about CE 385.

Some Mormon scholars{{Who|date=March 2015}} have considered the'' Book of Mormon'' narrative a description of the mound-building cultures; other Mormon apologists argue for a Mesoamerican or South American setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~jsdaniel/BoM_Meso.html|title=The Book of Mormon and Mesoamerican Archeology|accessdate=2012-02-08|author=Jon Daniels|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119071523/http://www.stanford.edu/~jsdaniel/BoM_Meso.html|archive-date=2011-11-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories about a Mesoamerican setting for the ''Book of Mormon'' did not develop until after Latter-day Saints were influenced by publicized findings about the [[Central America]]n stone ruins. This occurred after the ''Book of Mormon'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;See the anonymous newspaper article titled "Zarahemla", ''Mormon Times and Seasons'', October 1842, excerpts from John Lloyd Stephens, ''Incident of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán'' (1841). Stephens' conclusion that the Central American stone ruins were not of any great antiquity was overlooked by excited LDS readers.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Black civilizations
During the 20th century, certain sects affiliated with the Black nationalist [[Moorish Science Temple of America|Moorish Science]] philosophy theorized an association with the Mound Builders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.federationmsta.org/mound.html| publisher= Federation : MSTA | title= The Mound Builders of North America  Part I| accessdate=2017-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The Black Washitaw Nation of America | url= https://www.africaresource.com/rasta/sesostris-the-great-the-egyptian-hercules/the-black-washitaw-nation-on-america/ | accessdate=2017-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the Mound Builders were an ancient advanced Black civilization that developed the legendary continents of [[Atlantis]] and [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], as well as ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica. These Black groups claim that the American Indians were too primitive to have developed the sophisticated societies and the technology believed necessary to build the mounds.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

;Mythical cultures
Some people attributed the mounds to mythical cultures: [[Lafcadio Hearn]] suggested that the mounds were built by people from the lost continent of Atlantis.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Mound Builders |author=Hearn, Lafcadio |url=http://www.trussel.com/prehist/mound.htm |newspaper=The Commercial |date=April 24, 1876 |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of alternative explanations===
The mound-builder explanations were often honest misinterpretations of real data from valid sources. Both scholars and laymen accepted some of these explanations. Reference to an alleged race appears in the poem "The Prairies" (1832) by [[William Cullen Bryant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4literature.net/William_Cullen_Bryant/Prairies/ Bryant, William Cullen, "The Prairies" (1832)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105173208/http://www.4literature.net/William_Cullen_Bryant/Prairies/ |date=2007-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Assumption that construction was too complex for Indians
One belief was that American Indians were too unsophisticated to have constructed such complex earthworks and artifacts. The associated stone, metal, and clay artifacts were thought to be too complex for the Indians to have made. In the American Southeast and Midwest, numerous Indian cultures were sedentary and used agriculture. Numerous Indian towns had built surrounding stockades for defense. Capable of this type of construction, their ancestors and they could have built mounds, but people who believed that the Indians did not build the earthworks did not analyze it in this manner. They thought the Native American nomadic cultures would not organize to build such monuments, for failure to devote the time and effort to construct such time-consuming projects.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;

When most British colonists first arrived in America, they never witnessed the American Indians building mounds, and they found that few Indians knew of their history when asked. Yet earlier Europeans, especially the Spanish, had written numerous non-English-language accounts about the Indians' construction of mounds. [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] reported how the Indians built the mounds and placed temples on top of them. A few French expeditions reported staying with Indian societies who built mounds.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;

;Assumption construction older than Indians
People also claimed that the Indians were not the Mound Builders because the mounds and related artifacts were older than Indian cultures. [[Caleb Atwater]]'s misunderstanding of [[stratigraphy]] caused him to believe that the Mound Builders were a much older civilization than the Indians. In his book, ''Antiquities Discovered in the Western States'' (1820), Atwater claimed that Indian remains were always found right beneath the surface of the earth. Since the artifacts associated with the Mound Builders were found fairly deep in the ground, Atwater argued that they must be from a different group of people. The discovery of metal artifacts further convinced people that the Mound Builders were not Native Americans. The Indians encountered by the Europeans and Americans were not thought to engage in [[metallurgy]]. Some artifacts that were found in relation to the mounds were inscribed with symbols. As the Europeans did not know of any Indian cultures that had a writing system, they assumed a different group had created them.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;

==Hoaxes==
[[File:Ohio Newark Great Circle01 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2| Panoramic view from within the Great Circle at the [[Newark Earthworks]] in Newark, Ohio (wall of which can be seen in the background)]]

Several hoaxes have involved the Mound Builder cultures.

;Newark Holy Stones

In 1860, David Wyrick discovered the "Keystone tablet", containing [[Hebrew language]] inscriptions written on it, in [[Newark, Ohio]]. Soon afterward, he found the "[[Newark Decalogue Stone]]" nearby, also claimed to be inscribed in Hebrew. The authenticity of the "[[Newark Holy Stones]]" and the circumstances of their discovery are disputed.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;

;Davenport tablets
Reverend Jacob Gass discovered what were called the [[Davenport Tablets | "Davenport tablets"]] in Iowa in the 1870s. These bore inscriptions that later were determined to be fake.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2018}}

;Walam Olum hoax
The [[Walam Olum]] hoax had considerable influence on perceptions of the Mound Builders. In 1836, [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] published his translation of a text he claimed had been written in pictographs on wooden tablets. This text explained that the [[Lenape]] Indians originated in Asia, told of their passage over the [[Bering Strait]], and narrated their subsequent migration across the North American continent. This "Walam Olum" tells of battles with native peoples already in America before the Lenape arrived. People hearing of the account believed that the "original people" were the Mound Builders, and that the Lenape overthrew them and destroyed their culture. [[David Oestreicher]] later asserted that Rafinesque's account was a hoax. He argued that the Walam Olum glyphs derived from Chinese, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian]], and [[Maya script|Mayan]] alphabets. Meanwhile, the belief that the Native Americans destroyed the mound-builder culture had gained widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name="feder"/&gt;

;Kinderhook plates
Another hoax, the "[[Kinderhook plates]]" "discovered" in 1843, involved material planted by a contemporary in Native American mounds. This hoax aimed to discredit the account of the Mormon prophet [[Joseph Smith]] having translated an ancient book.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Stanley B. (Aug. 1981). "[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1981/08/kinderhook-plates-brought-to-joseph-smith-appear-to-be-a-nineteenth-century-hoax Kinderhook Plates Brought to Joseph Smith Appear to Be a Nineteenth-Century Hoax]".

{{Palestinians}}
'''Palestinian art''' is a term used to refer to [[painting]]s, [[poster]]s, [[installation art]] and other visual media produced by [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] artists.

While the term has also been used to refer to ancient art produced in the geographical region of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in its modern usage it generally refers to work of contemporary Palestinian artists.

Similar to the structure of Palestinian society, the Palestinian art field extends over four main geographic centers: the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]; [[Israel]]; the [[Palestinian diaspora]] in the [[Arab world]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Zvi&gt;{{cite web|title=''Hagar: Contemporary Palestinian Art''|author=Tal Ben Zvi|publisher=Hagar Association|year=2006|accessdate=06.05.2007|url=http://www.hagar-gallery.com/Catalogues/docs/PArt_eng_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Palestinian art finds its roots in [[folk art]] and traditional [[Christian]] and [[Islamic]] painting popular in Palestine over the ages. After the [[Nakba Day|Nakba]] of 1948, nationalistic themes have predominated as Palestinian artists use diverse media to express and explore their connection to identity and land.&lt;ref name=Ankori&gt;{{cite book|title=''Palestinian Art''|author=[[Gannit Ankori]]|year=1996|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1-86189-259-4|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SoagAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22palestinian+art%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Before 1948, most Palestinian artists were self-taught, painting landscapes and religious scenes in imitation of the European style. Art exhibitions were almost unheard of. Notable artists of this era include Khalil Halaby, Nahil Bishara and Faddoul Odeh. Jamal Badran (1909–1999) was a leading artist in the Islamic style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imeu.net/news/article00254.shtml Visual arts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214225723/http://imeu.net/news/article00254.shtml |date=2012-12-14 }}
IMEU, JAN 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie Halaby studied in France and Italy before returning to teach at the Schmidt Girls College in 1935-1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtualgallery.birzeit.edu/tour/cv?mart_id=71627 Sophie Halaby]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest artists to add a political dimension to his works was [[Nicola Saig]] (1863-1942). While most of the art in his day explored religious themes and non-controversial issues, Saig's work ventured into politics. Caliph Umar at Jerusalem Gates c. 1920, for example,  seems to recount a popular religious legend about Umar bloodlessly taking over Jerusalem and ushering centuries of peace between the local Christian and Jewish populations. However, upon closer look, the Christ-like stature given to the Caliph jab at what many Palestinians saw as divisive policies of the British during the Mandate Period which attempted to create friction between Muslims and Christian Arabs.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 33"/&gt;

After 1948, [[Ismail Shammout]], [[Naji al-ali]], [[Mustafa al-Hallaj]], [[Abdul Hay Mosallam Zarara|Abdul Hay Mosallam]]  and [[Paul Guiragossian]] tackled the painful memories of the Nabka showing massacres, refugees and clear political themes. Others such as Sophia Halaby, [[Ibrahim Ghannam]], and [[Juliana Seraphim]] focused more subtly on questions of identity including Palestinian cultural traditions, physical geography, and a surrealistic look at memories of childhood reverie.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pgs. 124 - 159&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tal Ben Zvi,  Palestinian artists after 1948 reside in four geographical territories and have no art colleges.
Thus unlike [[sovereign]] [[nation-states]] where art is based on "national borders, national museums and institutes of learning, he claims Palestinian art is based chiefly on artists operating within the frame of Palestinian identity.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

==Themes==

===Place===
[[File:Olive picking - Sliman Mansour.jpeg|thumb|220px|Olive picking, Sliman Mansour, Oil on canvas, 1988]]
Palestinian artist and art historian [[Kamal Boullata]] describes "place" as one of the major thematic components of Palestinian art throughout its history. Proximity and distance from the historical Palestinian homeland and the relationship between the artist and his current place of residence is the key element moving Palestinian art. For example, in art produced during the first decades following 1948, works created by Palestinian artists living in Israel are largely figurative, whereas those created by artists living outside the country are largely abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1948, Jerusalem was an important theme.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 32"&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt; After 1948, memory of place and distance from homeland became a central theme.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 32"/&gt;  Even Palestinian artists born and raised in Israel explore alienation and a sense of growing up as foreigners in the land of their ancestors. The question of cultural memory and belonging is a recurrent theme.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 33"&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nidaa Badwan]] is an artist from who created a beautiful space in her room where she could isolate herself and escape from reality of Gaza. She says living in a city where she "lost basic rights as a human being" inspired her to "create an alternative world" in her room. The self-portraits taken in that room during her period of retreat have won her international recognition.&lt;ref name=arabiya&gt;{{Cite web| title = Finding creativity under siege: Gazan artist isolates herself| accessdate = 2018-06-25| url = http://english.alarabiya.net/en/life-style/art-and-culture/2015/01/24/Finding-creativity-under-siege-Gazan-artist-isolates-herself-for-over-a-year-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alia Rayyan, director of the Al Hoash Gallery has said that Badwan is "talking about her own creation of the space, a dream actually, how life could be there, but this only works in combination with what happens outside".&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/world/middleeast/finding-gaza-unbearable-artist-creates-her-own-world-in-one-room.html|title=A Gaza Artist Creates 100 Square Feet of Beauty, and She's Not Budging|date=27 February 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
Key iconic symbols are keys and doors. Likewise the cactus tree plays a prominent role. According to Palestinian artist and art historian [[Samia Halaby]], "Liberation Art," or the art that resulted from the revolutionary period of Palestinian resistance that began in the late 1960s and continued through the First Intifada, "is symbolist, using images of things known to popular Palestinian culture – things that anyone experiencing Palestinian life could identify. The horse came to mean revolution. The flute came to mean the tune of the ongoing resistance. The wedding came to mean the entire Palestinian cause. The key came to mean the right of return. The sun came to mean freedom. The gun with a dove came to mean that peace would come after the struggle for liberation. Artists used the colors of the flag, patterns from embroidery, chains, etc. Village scenes, village dress, the prisoner, prison bars. There were special themes regarding the martyr. First there were generalized pictures of the martyr as well as pictures of specific individuals who had been killed by the Israelis. The second form was based on a popular practice of framing a collage of symbols representing the deceased's life then hanging it at their home or grave."&lt;ref&gt;Farhat, Maymanah. [http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/6084/on-liberation-art-and-revolutionary-aesthetics_an- "On 'Liberation Art' and Revolutionary Aesthetics: An Interview with Samia Halaby"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cactus====
The Cactus ({{lang-ar|الصبار}}) has been a motif in Palestinian art since the birth of Israel.  For Zionists, the indigenous plant became a national symbol of their attachment to the land, while Palestinians saw it as an incarnation of their national dispossession (see, for example, the Arabic version of Sahar Khalifa's '''Wild Thorns''', the Arabic title of which translates literally as '''Cactus''').  The plant served the practical function to designate territorial borders in peasant villages. In summer, the prickly pear was a common fruit eaten by people in the region. During the 1920s, the thorny tree was incorporated as a symbol of Israeli identity.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 184-186&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas Saig painted the prickly pear as one of the pleasures of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  The cactus has also become a symbol of Palestinian defiance and sumud. Villagers incorporated it into a dance song protesting the 1917 Balfour Declaration with the phrase "Ya'ayn kuni subbara - O eye, be a cactus tree!". {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Contemporary==

===Modernism===
Although the Palestinian struggle stands as a great source of inspiration for many artists, Palestinian art is not solely defined by the political character of Palestine. Palestinian modern art has become part of a successive process in which [[Culture of Palestine|Palestinian culture]] and heritage play an essential role. The post [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakbah]] period has affected a great deal of art work, however, new generations of Palestinian artists redefined new boundaries of representation and creativity. The new generations of Palestinian artists have presented their work in a new manner reshaping the traditional representation of Palestinian art, and challenged the understanding of international audiences of the Palestinian Art and narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farhat|first=Maymanah|title=The Unearthing of Secrets: Palestinian Art, 6+ and a Series of Transgressions|url=http://electronicintifada.net/content/unearthing-secrets-palestinian-art-6-and-series-transgressions/6879|publisher=The Electronic Intifada|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Palestinian narrative through Art===
The Palestinian Israeli conflict and the narratives surrounding it gives Palestinian Art a unique character. Palestinian art often touches on two major themes, one is the potential for contemporary art to affect people's understanding of the social, cultural, and political elements of the Palestinian narrative; and the contribution this art can make in the field of art history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kathy|first=Zarur|title=Palestinian Art and Possibility: Made in Palestine, an Examination|url=http://www.nobleworld.biz/images/Zarur.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vivid political message in Palestinian contemporary art led to the realization of the so-called  "liberation art of Palestine" where Palestinian artists use art to communicate their narrative beyond the level of straightforwardness that is presented by media. There is a deep connection between the visual production of Palestinian art and the physical makeup of the land of [[History of Palestine|historical Palestine]].

Palestinian art has gone through multiple phases where the Palestinian artists dealt with cycles of production, destruction, and reestablishment due their [[Palestinian diaspora|diaspora]] from one area to another. With the continuation of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the artists like any other segment of the Palestinian community in the [[Palestinian Territories|Occupied Palestinian Territory]] suffer from Israeli exaction such as confiscation of art work, refusal to license artists' organizations, arson of exhibit halls, surveillance, arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halaby|first=Samia|title=Liberation art of Palestine: Palestinian painting and sculpture in the second half of the 20th century|year=2001|publisher=H.T.T.B. Pub., S.A. Halaby|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Palestinian art narrative does not exclusively criticize the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]], it also speak of the neglect of the [[Arab States|Arab states]], and the world at large of their struggle. A famous short novel by the Palestinian writer [[Ghassan Kanafani]], ''[[Men in the Sun]]'', speaks of the Palestinian struggle and the astonishing neglect of the international community towards their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maymanah|first=Farhat|title=The Unearthing of Secrets: Palestinian Art, 6+ and a Series of Transgressions|url=http://electronicintifada.net/people/maymanah-farhat|publisher=The Electronic Intifada|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They participate in these artistic activities as tourists with foreign passports. Al-Ma'mal focusses on projects with youth and women. 
Al- Ma'mal is an Arabic word meaning workshop or a small factory. The name was given because of the initial home of the foundation which was in a small factory in the old city of Jerusalem built in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Ma'mal Foundation for Contemporary Art|url=http://www.almamalfoundation.org/index.php|accessdate=18 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724112033/http://almamalfoundation.org/index.php|archive-date=2013-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its aim is to develop a new generation of Palestinian artists to converse with contemporary debates and methods of artistic practise at the local and the international level. The academy is also keen to maintain a Palestinian collective memory, history, and identity through education and creative activities. The academy hosts a group of international students, artists, and visiting lecturers through its exchange programs.
The academy was funded by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during it first years 2006-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Art Academy Palestine|url=http://www.artacademy.ps/english/|access-date=2013-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409033652/http://www.artacademy.ps/english/|archive-date=2013-04-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Picasso in Palestine'''

One of the International Art Academy's main accomplishment was its co-operation with the Dutch [[Van Abbemuseum]] in [[Eindhoven]] in bringing a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] piece to Palestine in July, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tolan|first=Sandy|title=Picasso comes to Palestine|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/profile/sandy-tolan.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It took two years of planning until the "[[List of Picasso artworks 1901–1910|Buste de Femme]]" arrived to [[Ramallah]] in the [[West Bank]]. The piece is a [[Cubism|Cubist]] rendition of a woman painted in 1943 with a value of $7.2m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The paintbrush is mightier than the M16|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/06/picasso-ramallah|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Buste de Femme" is the first modernist masterpiece to make it to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] where it is exhibited to a Palestinian audience.  Palestinians see that the [[Picasso]] piece made it through protocols, peace agreements, and checkpoints to demonstrate Picasso's saying : Painting is not made to decorate houses, it is an instrument of offensive and defensive war against the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Susan|first=Cole|title=Picasso In Palestine: Art meets Politics|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=191264|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Now Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestinian artists in Israel==
There is a significant difference between the Palestinian artists beyond the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] and the ones called "the Palestinian artists of 48". The artists born after 1948 are usually divided between the older painters and sculptors who acted during the 1970s and the 1980s, and the younger generation of artists who became active in the 1990s. The first, older generation comprises about twenty painters and sculptors who were born into the period of military rule over the Palestinian minority (1948–1966) and who studied art in Israel and abroad in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Zvi|first=Tal|title=Landscape Representations in Palestinian Art and Israeli Art Discourse: The Case of Asim Abu Shaqra|journal=[[Journal of Levantine Studies]]|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|access-date=2014-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219010140/http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|archive-date=2014-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include artists such as [[Souad Nasr Makhoul]], Terese Nasr Azzam, [[Ibrahim Nubani]] and [[Abed Abdi]], the latter who is considered to be a pioneer in the Arab Israeli art movement. The younger generation of artists became active after the Oslo agreements and now amounts to more than 200 art school graduates creating mainly installations, photography, video art and performances. The last decade shows a noticeable increase in the number of Palestinian students in Israeli art academies such as in the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]].&lt;ref name="City Mouse Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halperin|first=Neta|title=The Palestinian art scene is flourishing|url=http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,416,209,67122,.aspx|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=City Mouse Magazine (Tel Aviv)|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hisham Zreiq]], [[Ahlam Shibli]], Sami Bukhari, Reida Adon, Ashraf Fawakhry, Ahlam Jomah, [[Jumana Emil Abboud]], and Anisa Ashkar are Palestinian artists — most of whom are graduates from art schools in Israel and form part of an entire generation of Palestinians, [[Arab citizens of Israel|citizens of Israel]] born after [[Six-Day War|1967]].&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

The issue of identity for Palestinian citizens of Israel is a key subject of importance to the artwork produced. This identity is described by [[Azmi Bishara]] as followed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From both the historical and theoretical perspectives, the Arabs in Israel are part of the Palestinian Arab people. Their definition as 'Israeli Arabs' was formed concurrent with the emergence of the issue of the [[Palestinian refugees]], and the establishment of the State of Israel on the ruins of the Palestinian people. Thus, the point of departure from which the history of the Palestinians in Israel is written is the very point in which the history of the Palestinians outside Israel was created. One cannot point at a nationality or national group called 'Israeli Arabs' or 'the Arabs of Israel'.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ben Zvi suggests that this definition pinpoints the dialectic underpinning the identity of this group of artists who are identified "on the one hand, as part of a broad Palestinian cultural system, and on the other — in a differentiated manner — as the Palestinian minority in Israel."&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

The issue of identity becomes particularly clear in an artwork of the Palestinian artist [[Raafat Hattab]] from [[Jaffa]]. The video performance "untitled" was part of the exhibition "Men in the Sun" in the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art in 2009. In the work, Raafat Hattab is seen as he poures water into a bucket in order to lengthily water an olive tree which is a sign for the lost paradise before [[1948 Palestinian exodus|1948]]. The scene is primed by the song ''Hob'' (Love) by the Lebanese [[Ahmad Kaabour]] which expresses the need for Palestinian solidarity. The chorus repeats the phrase "I left a place" and it seems as if the video is dealing with memory. But as the camera zooms out, the spectator realizes that Hattab and the olive tree both actually stand in the middle of the [[Rabin Square]], a main place in [[Tel Aviv]], and the water used for watering the tree comes from the nearby fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Raafat Hattab's work|url=http://www.men-in-the-sun.com/EN/raafat-hattab|publisher=The Men in the Sun|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"In my installations I appear in different identities that combined are my identity — a Palestinian minority in Israel and a queer minority in the Palestinian culture", explains Rafaat Hattab in an interview with the Tel Avivian City Mouse Magazine.&lt;ref name="City Mouse Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halperin|first=Neta|title=The Palestinian art scene is flourishing|url=http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,416,209,67122,.aspx|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=City Mouse Magazine (Tel Aviv)|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asim Abu Shaqra's focus of the sabra plant (prickly pear cactus) in his paintings is another example of the centrality of identity, especially vis-a-vie the Palestinian subject's Israeli counterpart, in Palestinian art. Tal Ben Zvi writes that Abu Shaqra is one of the very few Palestinian artists, who have succeeded in entering the canon of Israeli art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Zvi|first=Tal|title=Landscape Representations in Palestinian Art and Israeli Art Discourse: The Case of Asim Abu Shaqra|journal=Journal of Levantine Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=115|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|access-date=2014-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219010140/http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|archive-date=2014-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Abu Shaqra painted various paintings featuring the sabra, both a symbol for the Palestinian Nakba and a symbol for the new Israeli and his work stirred up a debate in the Israeli art discourse over the image of the sabra in Israeli culture and over questions of cultural appropriation and ownership of this image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Zvi|first=Tal|title=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|journal=Journal of Levantine Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=118|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|access-date=2014-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219010140/http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|archive-date=2014-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli art historian Gideon Ofrat argues that understanding Palestinian art requires familiarity with the complexities of Palestinian culture, language and history, and therefore attempts by Israeli art critics to analyze Palestinian art are doomed to failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/two-palestinians-make-guest-appearance-on-tel-aviv-s-art-scene.premium-1.482499 Two Palestinians make guest appearance on Tel Aviv's art scene, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Souad Nasr (Makhoul), Palestinian woman painter based in Haifa is very known artist, most of her works deal with women from universal point of view .Souad also is city and regional planner, her earlier works in art were inspired by the remains of the old Palestinian Arab demolished quarters and expressed them very strongly in her works, In addition to a large series of documentary works  : paintings, etchings and drawings of historical buildings and neighborhoods in Haifa and other cities, in which she expressed the significant urban design and architerctural motives.
Her current paintings mainly express woman's universal sentimentality and soul through the body language and the interaction with the nature in which she try to outline how aesthetic valuing is embedded in our relationship with nature, and its ecological aesthetic qualities such as variety, diversity and harmony. 
In her acrylic works she uses mostly to paint on recycled-environmental paper which has special texture effect, and as part of the debates about environmental protection.

==Exhibitions==

===Museums===
[[Image:L. A. Mayer Institute P4110089.JPG|thumb|right|220px|The [[L.A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art]]]]
In 2008, the [[L. A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art]] in Jerusalem, a museum mainly dedicated to antiquities and ethnographic works, presented the first show of local Arab contemporary artists in a public Israeli museum. It was also the first exhibition in an Israeli museum which was organised by an Arab curator, [[Farid Abu Shakra]].&lt;ref name="The Art Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond|title=First show of Arab contemporary art in Israeli museum|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/First-show-of-Arab-contemporary-art--in-Israeli-musem/16262|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of the exhibition, Correspondence, is dealing with the complex situation of [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab citizens in Israel]]. It can be seen as a reflexion on the different cultures to which Arab artists in Israel are exposed, on Western influences and Arab traditions, Jewish life, Palestinian cause and the search of a proper identity.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Forward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lando|first=Michal|title=Between Two Cultures: In Jerusalem, a Breakthrough Show of Works by Arab-Israelis|url=http://forward.com/articles/14176/between-two-cultures-/|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Forward|date=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although not all art works presented are political, many refer to collective experiences of the Palestinian people, showing lost Arab villages and divided landscapes and evoking thus the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]].&lt;ref name="The Art Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond|title=First show of Arab contemporary art in Israeli museum|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/First-show-of-Arab-contemporary-art--in-Israeli-musem/16262|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], some works question traditions and customs within the Arab culture by dealing with gender and superstition.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Forward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lando|first=Michal|title=Between Two Cultures: In Jerusalem, a Breakthrough Show of Works by Arab-Israelis|url=http://forward.com/articles/14176/between-two-cultures-/|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Forward|date=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the director of the Museum, the Jewish Israeli Rachel Hasson, it was rather difficult to raise funds for the exhibition among Jewish, Muslim or Arab communities. In the Art Newspaper she is quoted: "For Arabs, we are not Arab enough and for Jews, we are not Jewish enough."&lt;ref name="The Art Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond|title=First show of Arab contemporary art in Israeli museum|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/First-show-of-Arab-contemporary-art--in-Israeli-musem/16262|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2009, the [[Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art]] held the exhibition "Men in the Sun" presenting art works by 13 Palestinian contemporary artists who live and work in Israel. The name of the exhibition is borrowed from [[Ghassan Kanafani|Ghassan Kanafani's]] [[Men in the Sun|novel]] with the same title. The show was curated by the Palestinian artist and architect Hanna Farah-Kufer Bir'im and the Jewish Israeli art historian Tal Ben Zvi. The participating artists were from different generations and using different techniques from painting to video installations and architecture.&lt;ref name="Men in the Sun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition in Herzliya Museum|url=http://www.men-in-the-sun.com|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The leitmotif of the exhibition was location and territory. Most of the works deal with the sense of belonging to the Palestinian territory, some evoke the right to return or are about the forgotten history of places like in Jaffa.&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;{{cite news|last=Walder|first=Orit Hasson|title=Palestinian art show in Herzliya Museum|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3744709,00.html|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=ynet|date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery.JPG|thumb|left|widthpx|The [[Umm al-Fahm Art Gallery]]]]
In the beginning of 2012, the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] in a collaboration with the [[Um el-Fahem Art Gallery]] showed a retrospective of the Arab Israeli artists [[Walid Abu Shakra]]. The show was curated by the Jewish Israeli Irith Hadar and Walid's brother Farid Abu Shakra.&lt;ref name="Tel Aviv Museum of Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition Tel Aviv Museum|url=http://www.tamuseum.com/about-the-exhibition/walid-abu-shakra-mintarat-albatten|publisher=Tel Aviv Museum of Art|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Born in [[Umm al-Fahm|Umm el-Fahem]] in 1946 and now based in London, the exhibition shows the strong ties which Walid Abu Shakra holds with his birthplace. The name of the exhibition, "Mintarat al-Batten", refers to a hill near his hometown which, due to its strategic position, became the site of a watchtower.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25317|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the population explosion in the region, the picturesque landscapes are disappearing and the slopes of the watchtower hill are now covered with new residential neighbourhoods. The artist hoped that thanks to the exhibition, "all my friends, family and residents of the village who came to see the work will show more love and seriousness in their attitude toward the landscape that remains in the village."&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news|last=Azoulay|first=Ellie Armon|title=Distant Landscapes|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/distant-landscapes-1.407118|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the exhibition and its collaboration with the Um el-Fahrem Art Gallery was a fruit of the friendship between Mordechai Omer, the former director of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and the Abu Shakra family. Omer died before the opening of show.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25317|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Umm el-Fahem Museum of Contemporary Art project===

In 1996, Said Abu Shakra, the third brother of the Abu Shakra family, founded in his hometown [[Um al-Fahm|Umm el-Fahem]] the only art gallery for Palestinian and Arab art in Israel and has now plans for its extension. He wants to build a museum nearby the city which would be the first contemporary art museum of the Arab sector in Israel.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25661|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, worth 30 Million Dollar, is still at an early stage.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Israel to get first museum of Arab art and culture|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/mar/10/new-museum-umm-al-fahm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an international competition, Amnon Bar Or, Lior Tsionov, and Lior Vitkon, a team of Jewish architects, had been chosen. With the help of the [[American Friends of Umm el-Fahem]] (AFUEF) and the [[Middle East Center for the Arts]] (MECA), funds had been raised to secure the first phase of the project.&lt;ref name=MECA&gt;{{cite web|title=website MECA|url=http://www.themeca.org/blog/tag/umm-el-fahem-museum-of-contemporary-art/|publisher=Middle East Center for the Arts|accessdate=17 April 2013}}{{dead|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum shall not only host exhibitions but also an archive collecting testimonies of Arab "elders" who witnessed the conflicts of the 20th century. The oral testimonies – ranging from the British mandate period to the creation of the Israeli state and the Arab-Israeli wars – are transcribed in Arabic, Hebrew and English and photographs are taken.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Israel to get first museum of Arab art and culture|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/mar/10/new-museum-umm-al-fahm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2008, 250 testimonies are already recorded of which one third has died since. Along with the museum, there will be classrooms and an auditorium for Arab Israeli students, a library and a café.&lt;ref name="Friends of Umm el-Fahem"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Friends of Umm el-Fahem|url=http://www.friendsofummelfahem.com/about/archive.php|publisher=Friends of Umm el-Fahem|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing gallery has already begun to acquire a collection for the further museum through donations and gifts. Thus, works of artists like [[Fatma Abu Roumi]], [[Assam Abu Shakra]], [[Tyseer Barakat]], [[Assaf Evron]], [[Khalid Hourani]], [[Menashe Kadishman]], and [[Sliman Mansour]] are already in its possession. In addition to contemporary art, the museum will also expose traditional Arab embroidery works from the local region.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25661|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Guardian]], Said Abu Shakra wants to create thus "an inviting place, capable of embracing and enriching; bridging gaps and connecting different cultures. All of this in the heart of a troubled, war-weary region," where "Jewish people [have] the chance to touch the pain, the history and the culture of Arab people"&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Israel to get first museum of Arab art and culture|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/mar/10/new-museum-umm-al-fahm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project had to be inaugurated in 2013, but it was cancelled due to lack of budget, when sponsors from Gulf states found out the Israeli government is supporting the creation of the museum. Abu Shakra had to give up on the plan to build a new museum. He currently tries to receive an official recognition as a museum in the gallery’s present 1700 square meter building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/.premium-1.662641 | title=When Is an Arab Museum Not an Arab Museum? | publisher=Haaretz | accessdate=22 August 2016 | author=Shany Littman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galleries===

In 1996, after 25 years of police service, Said Abu Shakra decided to open the first art gallery in Israel entirely dedicated to contemporary Palestinian art in his hometown Umm el-Fahem, the [[Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery]]. Nevertheless, besides Palestinian and Arab artists, the gallery does also showcase Jewish and foreign artists. Indeed, when in 1999 [[Yoko Ono]] exhibited her art in the gallery, the institution came to public attention. According to the [[BBC]], the Japanese artist wanted "to "balance" a show of her work in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem". Some of her art work is still shown in the permanent exhibition of the gallery.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Patience|first=Martin|title=Israeli Arab gallery breaks taboos|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4790428.stm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News website|date=10 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gallery promotes mainly temporary shows, dealing with a wide range of subjects but sometimes with a special focus on memory and history of the region. This is in accordance with the 2008 started project of an archive collecting Palestinian testimonies (see [[Palestinian art#The Umm el-Fahem Museum of Contemporary Art project|The Umm el-Fahem Museum of Contemporary Art project]]).&lt;ref name=MECA /&gt; Besides the exhibitions and the archive, the gallery offers symposiums, activities and educational workshops around topics such as art but also sensitive issues such as the role of women or children at risk.{{cite web|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25323|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=17 April 2013}}

Umm el-Fahem, the biggest Arab city in Israel, is known for its conservative Islam but Said Abu Shakran says that he does not have any problems with anybody in the town. None of the exhibitions shows nudity and the gallery invites the town's religious leaders to its exhibition openings.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Patience|first=Martin|title=Israeli Arab gallery breaks taboos|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4790428.stm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News website|date=10 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Palestinian artist [[Ahmad Canaan]] and the Jewish Israeli entrepreneurs [[Amir Neuman Ahuvia]] and [[Yair Rothman]] established the [[Jaffa Art Salon]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Ariel|title=Dialogue by Way of Art in Israel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/arts/23iht-rartisrael23.html?pagewanted=1&amp;tntemail1=y&amp;emc=tnt&amp;_r=0|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; First planned as a contemporary exhibition and hosted by the [[Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality]], it turned thanks to its success into an established gallery. The gallery is located in an old warehouse in the [[Jaffa Port|Jaffa port]]. From 2010 to 2011, the gallery hosted shows from various Palestinian artists from within the Israeli territory and from beyond the [[Green Line (Israel)|Greenline]] and from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bogen|first=Amir|title=Palestinian gallery opens in Jaffa port|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3979577,00.html|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=ynet news|date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, the Art Salon opened it shows featuring both Jewish Israeli and Arab artists.&lt;ref name="Jaffa Art Salon"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Jaffa Art Salon|url=http://www.jaffaartsalon.com/gallery-info.html|publisher=Jaffa Art Salon|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestinian artists in the Arab world==
Originating from the Palestinian culture that crystallized in the refugee camps mainly in [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], Palestinian artists in the Arab world were among the first to put forward a vision of Palestinian contemporary art.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt; As the Palestinian Authority became more central to [[Palestinian nationalism]], their number and influence in the Palestinian art field has decreased, and diasporic Palestinian artists in Europe and the United States, have become increasingly prominent.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

One such artist whose works were exhibited in the ''Made in Palestine'' exhibit that toured the United States in 2005 is [[Mustafa Al-Hallaj]].&lt;ref name=Curiel&gt;{{cite web|title=Unknown face of Palestinian art|author=Jonathan Curiel|publisher=San Francisco Chronicler|date=April 3, 2005|accessdate=06.05.2007|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/04/03/ING74C1ATK1.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in what is now Israel, Al-Hallaj is known throughout the Arab world, where he has been described as "Syria's most famous artist" and an "icon of contemporary Arab graphic arts."&lt;ref name=Curiel/&gt; Al Hallaj died in 2002 in a fire at his home while trying to save his artwork.&lt;ref name=Curiel/&gt; In ''Self-Portrait as God, the Devil, and Man'', Al-Hallaj uses rows of overlapping images and intricate etchings that took 10 years to complete to present "an epic retelling of the history of Palestinians from the 11th century B.C. to the present."&lt;ref name=Curiel/&gt;

==Palestinian artists in the US and in Europe==
[[Image:Sama Alshaibi "Zero Sum Game".jpg|thumb|widthpx|[[Sama Alshaibi]]'s solo exhibition "Zero Sum Game" in London ]]
A number of prominent Palestinian artists live and work outside of the Arab world, namely in the US and in Europe. Notable among them are leading international conceptual artists [[Mona Hatoum]], who is based in London, and [[Emily Jacir]], who is based between New York and Ramallah. Prominent painters such as [[Jumana El Husseini]], [[Kamal Boullata]] and [[Hani Zurob]] are based in France, while pioneering abstract painter Samia Halaby has resided in New York since the late 1970s. Rising new media artists Larissa Sansour (based in Denmark), [[Bissan Rafe]] (based in USA and The Netherlands), and [[Sama Raena Alshaibi]] (based in USA); have also become one of the recent new names in the Palestinian daispora spotlight. Such artists have played a crucial role in developing and expanding contemporary Palestinian art by pushing for the acceptance of the Palestinian narrative in the mainstream art world despite apparent hostilities, controversies, and setbacks due to blatant censorship and various political contexts. While the subject of Palestine has remained paramount for such artists, especially in light of forced exiles, many in the diaspora have maintained cutting-edge approaches, gaining recognition for the new and innovative ways through which they approach Palestine's complex history, its current reality, and uncertain future.

In 2009, [[Steve Sabella]] researched the value of Palestinian art from a fiscal point of view as part of his master thesis at [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]] in London. He analysed how Palestinian artists needed to get connected with cultural institutions and influential curators to achieve international recognition and art market success outside of Palestine. They became the mediators and the connecting link between the artists and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sabella|first=Steve|title=RECONSIDERING THE VALUE OF PALESTINIAN ART &amp;ITS JOURNEY INTO THE ART MARKET|journal=Contemporary Practices Art Journal|year=2010 / 2011 (two parts)|volume=VII &amp; VIII|pages=80–100|url=http://stevesabella.com/reconsidering-the-value-of-Palestinian-art.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[New York Times]], collectors are reaching out for Palestinian art because prices are still comparably low ranging from $500 to $10,000. Yair Rothman, an Irsaeli art entrepreneur, is quoted that "prices have already tripled in the last three, four years, but there is still room for an increase."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Ariel|title=Dialogue by Way of Art in Israel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/arts/23iht-rartisrael23.html?pagewanted=2&amp;tntemail1=y&amp;_r=0&amp;emc=tnt|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5053">'''Peter Kivy''' (October 22, 1934 – May 6, 2017&lt;ref&gt;[https://aesthetics-online.site-ym.com/news/344130/Peter-Kivy-1934-2017.htm Tribute] at the [[American Society for Aesthetics]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinfoniavirtual.com/revista/032/joykivy.pdf James O. Young: In Memoriam Peter Kivy], bilingüal edition (English/Spanish, translation by Daniel Martín Sáez) at ''Sinfonía Virtual. Revista de Música Clásica'', nº 32 (2017), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;) was professor emeritus of musicology and philosophy at [[Rutgers University]]. He studied particularly the [[philosophy of music]].

==Biography==
Kivy earned master's degrees in both philosophy ([[University of Michigan]], 1958) and musicology ([[Yale University]], 1960). He earned his PhD at [[Columbia University]] in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

His early work was on the 18th-century British aesthetics, and was influenced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. From there he developed an interest in analytic aesthetics. From the late 1970s on, he had been interested mainly in music philosophy. His book ''The Corded Shell'' made him a central figure in music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Cumming&gt;Cumming.&lt;/ref&gt;

One preoccupation of his had been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to "express" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is followed by [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]].&lt;ref name=Cumming/&gt;

Some criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in ''Music, Philosophy, and Modernity'' (2007) by [[Andrew Bowie]] and ''Filosofía de la Música. Respuestas a Peter Kivy'' (2017, published in Spanish) by [[James O. Young]].

The '''Petäjävesi Old Church''' ({{lang-fi|Petäjäveden vanha kirkko}}) is a wooden church located in [[Petäjävesi]], [[Finland]]. It was built between 1763 and 1765, when [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] was still a part of [[Sweden]]. The bell tower was built in 1821. It was inscribed in 1994 on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. 

The church is located about {{convert|1|km}} to the west of the centre of Petäjävesi. The church went out of use in 1879 when the new church was built. The old church has retained its original appearance and its interior decoration exceptionally well. It is a popular church for weddings in the summer, and there is a church service on most Sundays.

==Construction==
The church was built as the chapel for the area of Petäjävesi, which has belonged to the congregation of Jämsä. The local people had been given the permission to build a graveyard and a small village church at their own expense by the crown as early as in 1728 because the trip to Jämsä was long, however it took about 35 years until the construction began. The church was planned and built by Jaakko Klemetinpoika Leppänen, a church builder from [[Vesanka]]. In 1821 the windows were enlarged and the sacristy was moved from the northern part of the church to the east. The bell tower was also added by Erkki Leppänen, the grandson of the original builder.

==Architecture==
The cross-type floor plan of the church came into use in the Nordic countries at the end of the 17th century and became common in the 18th century in the countryside churches {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. The high roof resembles the earlier [[gothic architecture|gothic style]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==From forgotten to world heritage==
After the new church was built, the old remained abandoned for a long time. Only the cemetery around the church and the belltower were in use. In the 1920s an Austrian art historian [[Josef Strzygowski]] noticed the architectural and historical value of the church and since 1929 it has been restored several times. In 1994 it was approved in the UNESCO's World Heritage Sites representing typical eastern Scandinavian wooden church tradition.

On April 10, 2010, Solomon's ''American Falls'' opened at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. The six-projection video/sound installation received great acclaim before closing in July 2010.  In conjunction with the Corcoran exhibition, Solomon's career as a filmmaker was explored in "Rhapsodies in Silver,"  a three-program survey at Washington's [[National Gallery of Art]].

A re-edited, feature-length, single-projection version of ''American Falls'' was featured at the New York Film Festival's "Views from the Avant Garde" on October 1, 2010. The single projection version of the film condenses the original multi-projector format into a triptych, placing three independent (yet associative) images next to one another. In Fall 2012, Solomon screened a three-channel version of ''American Falls'' at the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in Astoria, New York, as part of the exhibition "Film After Film."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2012/09/15/detail/phil-solomon-american-falls-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the May/June 2010  [[Film Comment]] poll, The Top 50 Avant-Garde Filmmakers of the Decade, Phil Solomon placed at number 5, tied with his late colleague, Stan Brakhage.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.filmlinc.com/film-comment/article/best-of-the-decade-avant-garde&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Originally from New York City, Solomon attended [[Binghamton University]]&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006"&gt;[http://www.cinemad.iblamesociety.com/2006/12/phil-solomon.html Cinemad: Interview with Phil Solomon]. Cinemad.iblamesociety.com (November 18, 2005). Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and received an MFA from the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]. One of Solomon's instructors was the experimental filmmaker [[Ken Jacobs]], who started his first class with a screening of [[Tony Conrad]]'s film ''[[The Flicker]]''. Solomon initially disliked the film, but the experience, followed by a screening of his future collaborator [[Stan Brakhage]]'s ''[[Blue Moses (film)|Blue Moses]]'', had a profound impact on his development as a filmmaker.&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt; Another formative experience came in the form of a lecture by critic [[Fred Camper]] on Brakhage's ''[[Anticipation of the Night]]''.&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt;

Solomon began making films in 1975. Solomon has since destroyed some of his early works,&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt; many of which were made in imitation of Brakhage.

Solomon has been teaching at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] since 1991.

A '''pinacotheca''' ({{lang-la|pinacotheca}} borrowed from {{lang-el|πινακοθήκη}}, πίναξ "(painted) board, tablet" + θήκη "box, chest") was a picture gallery in either [[ancient Greece]] or [[ancient Rome]]. The name is specifically used for the building containing pictures which formed the left wing of the [[Propylaea]] on the [[Acropolis]] at [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The Pinacotheca was located right by the [[temple of Athena Nike]]. Though [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (Bk. I., xxii. 6) speaks of the pictures "which time had not effaced," which seems to point to [[fresco painting]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}, the fact that there is no trace of preparation for [[stucco]] on the walls shows that the paintings were [[easel]] pictures ([[J. G. Frazer]], ''Pausanias's Description of Greece'', 1898, ii. 252). The Romans adopted the term for the room in a private house containing pictures, statues, and other works of art.

In the modern world the word is often used as a name for a public [[art gallery]] concentrating on paintings, mostly in Italy (as "Pinacoteca"), such as the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]] of the [[Vatican Museums]] (which is usually meant when the plain word is used), the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan (more often "the Brera" informally), with others in [[Bologna]], [[Siena]], and [[Turin]]. In [[Brazil]], there is the [[Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo]]. In [[Paris]], the [[Pinacothèque de Paris]]. In [[Munich]] the three main galleries are called the [[Alte Pinakothek]] ([[old master]]s), [[Neue Pinakothek]] (19th century) and [[Pinakothek der Moderne]]. At Hallbergmoos, near Munich Airport, there was the Pinakothek Hallbergmoos (20th and 21st century) between 2010 and 2014.

The '''Pink Decade in Malayalam Poetry''' is the term used by some literary critics to describe the period in [[Malayalam literature]] (roughly the late 1940s and early 1950s)  in which a brigade of young  poets inspired by the ideals of [[scientific socialism]] and [[Marxist]] world view were active in  creating ‘[[revolutionary]]’ poetry.

The term Pink Decade is to be taken as a figurative epithet rather than in its literal sense because these poets or their works cannot be confined within the span of a single decade.

Some poets belonging to this period are [[P. Bhaskaran]], [[Vayalar Ramavarma]]. [[Thirunalloor Karunakaran]], [[O N V Kurup]], [[Punaloor Balan]] and [[Puthussery Ramachandran]].

Though these writers initially shared some characteristics in common like a romantic vision of a [[classless society]], a simple style directly addressing the masses and themes picked from the daily life of the common man, they later developed distinct poetic identities of their own.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">The '''Porn Art Movement''' (Movimento de Arte Pornô) was a transgressive Brazilian [[avant-garde]] movement that started in 1980 and ended in 1982. The movement took place under a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]  and pioneered the use of pornography both as a form of political resistance and as an innovative art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Cunha, Maria C. “Arte Pornô, a última dos novos poetas.” ''Folha de S. Paulo'' (Ilustrada), February 10th, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word “porn” deliberately but it did not produce conventional pornography. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship,&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'' magazine started publication in Brazil in 1975, one of the harshest periods of the military dictatorship. This was a time of rampant police brutality, when political prisoners were tortured and killed with impunity. In 1982, the President of Brazil, General João Figueiredo, made headlines calling for a "crusade against pornography." See: "Figueiredo convoca a nação para combater pornografia." ''Jornal do Brasil'', March 16th, 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and subverted the logic of pornography to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and [[pansexuality]]. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The book ''Antolorgia'', published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement), also known as Poesia Pornô (Pornpoetry) or Pornismo (Pornism), was conceived by [[Eduardo Kac]] in January 1980 in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kac invited [[Cairo Trindade]]&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Dolores. “Poesia Pornô: Liberta, aberta e honesta”. ''ArteManha'', Rio de Janeiro, January/February 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop the movement together and they launched it publicly on March 30, 1980, through their Ipanema Beach intervention called ''Pelo Topless Literário'' (''Literary Topless'').&lt;ref&gt;''Gang'', n. 1, May 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a sudden invasion of the beach’s Lifeguard Post 9 (Posto Nove) with performances, poetry readings, demonstrations with banners featuring slogans, and distribution of publications. Lifeguard Post 9 was a strategic choice: it was considered at the time the epicenter of the beach (and, as a consequence, a major focal point of the city).

Soon after the ''Literary Topless'' intervention, Kac and Trindade invited Teresa Jardim to join them, thus forming the official performative arm of the movement, which they called Gang (The Gang). Braulio Tavares, Ana Miranda, Cynthia Dorneles and Sandra Terra also performed with The Gang.

Kac and Trindade wrote the ''Manifesto Pornô'' (''Porn Manifesto'') in May 1980 and first published it in the movement’s zine ''Gang'', n. 1, September 1980.  The movement published a total of three editions of the ''Gang'' zine, in addition to chapbooks, stickers, t-shirts, prints, comics, artist’s books and anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1982, every Friday night The Gang performed at [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]’s main square known as Cinelândia, a vibrant and busy area surrounded by the Municipal Theatre, the National Library, the Rio de Janeiro City Council and the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]. In front of a public that mixed intellectuals and popular audiences, the Gang read out loud the ''Porn Manifesto'' on September 9, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Cinelândia was also a strategic maneuver, since it is the heart of Rio de Janeiro.

On February 13, 1982, the Gang presented its last major public intervention, which took place in Ipanema Beach’s Lifeguard Post 9.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; This event, which Kac considers the formal end of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; mobilized 9 performers, explored the entire repertoire developed during the preceding two years, included a wide array of props and publications, climaxed with a nude demonstration along the beach (which was and still is forbidden by law&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, Rio de Janeiro Police arrested three Dutch tourists for being naked in Copacabana Beach.  [http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/naked-dutch-tourists-arrested-rio]&lt;/ref&gt;), mobilized public participation, and culminated with a collective dive in the ocean—a symbolic act meant to signify self-renewal, the beginning of a better path forward beyond the prevailing political and aesthetic conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Ronái, Cora. “A Caminhada Pornô,” ''Pasquim'', n. 660, February 18th to 24th, 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[videographer]] Belisario Franca, then a photographer, accompanied The Gang between 1980 and 1982, producing photographic documentation of many of its interventions.

The Brazilian Porn Art Movement anticipated the international use of pornography as a critical and imaginative art form, as later seen in the work of Jeff Koons, Annie Sprinkle, Sue Williams, Santiago Sierra, Shu Lea Cheang, Wim Delvoye and the artists featured in the 2006 DVD compilation entitled ''Destricted''.&lt;ref&gt;The DVD compilation ''Destricted'' was organized by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center curatorial adviser Neville Wakefield and featured artists such as Marina Abramović, Larry Clark, and Matthew Barney.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement started to be rediscovered in 2010, when the Laura Marsiaj Gallery, in Rio de Janeiro, exhibited Eduardo Kac’s series entitled ''Pornogramas'' (''Pornograms''), developed by the artist between 1980 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054235/http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} ; [http://www.canalcontemporaneo.art.br/_v3/site/evento.php?idioma=br&amp;id_evento=5278]&lt;/ref&gt; The first museum exhibition of the Brazilian Porn Art Movement took place at the Reina Sofía Museum, in Madrid, in the context of the group show ''Losing the Human Form'', realized in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/exposiciones/actuales/perder-forma-humana_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum published a catalogue that features the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nogueira, Fernanda; Henaro, Sol. “Overgoze,” in: ''Vv.Aa., Perder la forma humana. Una imagen sísmica de los años ochenta en América Latina'' (Madrid: Museo Reina Sofia, 2012), pp. 199-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art forms==

The Porn Art Movement produced work in a variety of media, including performance, poetry, [[graffiti]], drawing, photography, cartoon and the graphic arts. Glauco Mattoso created an innovative form that he called ''Jornal Dobrabil'', a self-printed double-sided sheet designed entirely on a typewriter that was visually provocative and mixed indiscriminately classic, experimental and popular pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;Glauco Mattoso, ''Jornal Dobrabil'' (São Paulo: Iluminuras, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Hudinilson Jr. created a visual vocabulary based on his systematic sampling of his own body through reprographic media, notably the photocopier. Leila Míccolis, Teresa Jardim and Cynthia Dorneles developed their respective poetic voices through a form of feminism that combined unabashed pornography and liberal political positions. Ota produced invitations, posters, cartoons and comics through which he advanced the movement’s agenda while inviting the movement’s participants and the public to laugh. The poetry of Braulio Tavares and the drawings of Siegbert Franklin were also significant contributions to the movement. Publicly forging a new subjectivity, Eduardo Kac wore a pink mini-skirt in his daily life. Kac also developed the innovative series entitled ''Pornograms'', hybrid of body art, design, political resistance, performance, publishing, activism, photography and poetry. In this series Kac uses photography to explore the possibilities of writing with the body and writing the body itself. Kac included two ''Pornograms'' in his artist’s book ''Escracho'', which he published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/jfabc/id/3079/rec/6]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrownlowasLt.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Wallace Brownlow]] portraying Richard Cholmondeley in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', 1888]]

'''Sir Richard Cholmondeley''' (or '''Cholmeley''') (c. 1460–1521) was an English farmer and soldier, who served as [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] from 1513 to 1520 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  He is remembered because of his tomb at the Tower of London and because he is fictionalized as a character in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s darkly [[comic opera]], ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]''.  Cholmeley's name is frequently misspelled as Cholmondeley because of its misspelling in the plaque on his tomb, which led to the misspelling of the character's name in the opera; other branches of Cholmeley's family use the longer spelling.

Knighted in 1497 for valour in battle against the Scots, Cholmeley continued to serve as a soldier until 1513, becoming entrusted with many positions of responsibility for security of castles and fortifications in England.  He was successful as a farmer and a shrewd investor in land, much increasing his family wealth.  As Lieutenant of the Tower of London, he drew criticism for his reaction to the [[Evil May Day]] riots of 1517, when he ordered the firing of some of the Tower's artillery at the city to suppress rioting.  He was also responsible for the rebuilding of the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]] at the Tower.   His illegitimate son, [[Roger Cholmeley]], became [[Lord Chief Justice]] of the court of [[King's Bench]].

==Life and career==
Cholmeley (pronounced "Chumley") was born at Chorley, a small settlement approximately six miles south west of [[Nantwich]], [[Cheshire]] near [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire|Cholmondeley]], the eldest son of Joan Eyton and John Cholmeley, wealthy sheep farmers and land owners.&lt;ref&gt;Heraldic Visitations Harl 1424 fo.36b, Harl 1505 fo.34b, Cholmondleigh vulgo Cholmeley of Chomley&lt;/ref&gt;  See the heading "Tomb and Family Name", below, regarding the family name.  While Richard was very young, his family moved to East [[Yorkshire]], where his maternal grandfather held extensive estates.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag&gt;{{cite journal| last=Chamley| first=Benson|date=June 2003| title=Sir Richard Cholmondeley, Cheshire's most famous unknown| journal=The Family History Society of Cheshire Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Cholmeley was appointed Bailiff of York in 1492 and [[High Sheriff of Northumberland]] in 1495. In 1497, he served under [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] to repel a [[Pedro de Ayala#The Sieges of Norham and Ayton Castles|Scots assault]] at [[Norham]] Castle, a stronghold of the Bishopric of [[Durham, England|Durham]].&lt;ref name=Fiction&gt;Chamley, Benson.  "''The Yeomen of the Guard'': Fact or Fiction", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 21, Summer 2007, pp. 648–57&lt;/ref&gt;  For his service, Cholmeley was knighted in the field at Ayton by Lord Surrey as representative of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, William A. ''The Knights of England'', vol. 2, Sherratt and Hughes (1906, reprinted 1971, {{ISBN|0-900455-11-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, he was appointed Lieutenant of [[Berwick upon Tweed]] and Governor of [[Kingston upon Hull]].  In 1499, Cholmeley and his younger brother Roger were appointed Constables of [[Pickering Castle]], [[North Yorkshire]] and Stewards of the Honour and Foresters of the Royal Forest.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  While Roger settled in the constable's lodgings at the castle, Sir Richard purchased a small estate and house at nearby Thornton on the Hill (now part of [[Thornton-le-Dale]]).  In 1506, Cholmeley was appointed Collector of the Great Custom in the [[Port of London]].&lt;ref&gt;25 April 1506 (Membrane 15 no. 847), Appointment of Richard Cholmeley, Knight, as collector of the great custom in the port of London and in all adjacent ports and places in the place of William Tystede, late collector&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1513, the Scots invaded England to meet their treaty obligations to France under the [[Auld Alliance]]. At the [[Battle of Flodden]], the English, including a Cheshire levy under Cholmeley's command, successfully repelled the Scots. He had brought with him the Citizen Yeomenry of Hull. With English victory, Lord Surrey was restored as [[Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

===Lieutenant of the Tower===
In October 1513, Cholmeley was appointed [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]] and Supervisor General of [[Richmond Castle]] and eleven other Yorkshire castles and manors.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources list Chomondeley's appointment as Lieutenant in 1509, but this is not consistent with the records of Cholmondeley's military service. See White, William. [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA62 ''Notes and Queries''], Oxford University Press, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; There was no suitable house for Cholmeley and his family within the Tower precincts, and so he purchased a house in nearby [[Barking, London|Barking]], where he lived while serving as Lieutenant of the Tower.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt; The Lieutenant served under the [[Constable of the Tower]], at the time [[Thomas Lovell]].&lt;ref&gt;White, William. [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA62 ''Notes and Queries''], Oxford University Press, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, p. 664&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of the Lieutenant included defence, maintenance, and custody of the prisoners at the Tower, including escorting prisoners of note to trial at [[Westminster Hall]] which, at that time, housed the courts of law.  Cholmeley's maintenance works included the complete rebuilding of the chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]], the parish church of the Tower of London, which had been largely destroyed by fire in 1512.  The construction was carried out in 1519&amp;ndash;20.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

[[File:Yeomen 1906.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene from ''The Yeomen of the Guard'']]
Cholmeley lost some favour with the City of London authorities because of his reaction to the [[Evil May Day]] riots of 1517. During the riots, he furiously ordered the firing of some of the Tower's artillery at the city during rioting by gangs of young Londoners, who attacked foreigners, especially the wealthy foreign merchants and bankers of [[Lombard Street, London]] and who took control of London for several days.  This drew the ire of the city elders.  In 1520, he resigned his post at the Tower due to ill health.  He died in March 1521 (1522 by the modern calendar system) in [[St Katharine's by the Tower]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

Cholmeley is the only historical character to appear in a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]''.  In the story of that opera, while serving as Lieutenant of the Tower, Cholmeley finds that a prominent prisoner, scheduled to be executed, has escaped.  He launches a full-scale investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Bradley|year=1996|title=The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=772|isbn = 0-19-816503-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Cholmeley became very wealthy by inheritance and shrewd property investments.  At the time of his death, he held extensive estates in [[Northumberland]], [[Cumberland]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Essex]], [[Middlesex]], [[Kent]] and Calais, along with several properties in London.  By his will dated 26 December 1521, he left the bulk of his estate to his widow Elizabeth (''nee'' Pennington), with bequests to his only issue, his illegitimate son, named [[Roger Cholmeley|Roger]].  Cholmeley willed specific items of value to his younger brother, also named Roger.&lt;ref name=Will&gt;National Archives Records: Consistory Court of Canterbury, Wills and Probates 1383-1558 vol. 1 &amp; 2 (J. G. Challenor Smith:) Will and probate for Sir Richard Cholmeley, December 1521 and March 1522, available online at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholmeley's widow, Elizabeth, later married her third husband, Sir William Gascoigne of [[Cardington, Bedfordshire]] (her first husband was Sir Walter Strickland of Sizergh).&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  She died in 1546.  His illegitimate son, [[Roger Cholmeley]], enrolled at [[Lincoln's Inn]] to study law in 1506, eventually becoming Recorder of the City of London (from 1535 to 1545), a [[member of parliament]] and Chief Baron of the Exchequer (from 1545).  He was knighted in 1534.  In May 1552, he was appointed as Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench]].  He was Lord Chief Justice for only a year because [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] would not reappoint him.  Also in 1552, he was imprisoned for six weeks in the [[Tower of London]] and fined for signing [[Lady Jane Grey]]'s instrument of succession as Queen.  He returned to work as a [[barrister]] and was a member of parliament for Middlesex in the early 1550s.  Roger died in 1565, survived by two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;"Cholmley, Sir Roger (c. 1485-1565)", ''The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;  He is possibly best remembered for his endowment to found a free grammar school, [[Highgate School]], at London.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. H. ''Cholmley, Sir Roger (c. 1485–1565), Judge'' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cholmeley's brother, Roger, had a son whom he named Richard, whose descendants are the Cholmeleys of Roxby, Bramston and [[Whitby]].  This is the line of the current [[Cholmeley baronets|7th Baronet]], Sir Frederick Sebastian Cholmeley of Easton Hall, [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]].  Cholmeley's cousin, Richard Cholmondeley of [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire]], was married to Elizabeth Brereton of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]], whose brother, [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]], was executed in 1536 on suspicion of being [[Anne Boleyn]]'s lover. That branch of the family's descendants, beginning with [[Hugh Cholmondeley (soldier)|Sir Hugh Cholmondeley]], included the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquesses and Earls of Cholmondeley]].&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

==Tomb and family name==
In 1522, after the rebuilding of St. Peter ad Vincula, a tomb was built in the church covered by effigies of Cholmeley and his wife. The monument is one of the oldest in the chapel, where many famous people who were executed at the Tower are buried.  The alabaster effigies lie fenced in ironwork under the central arcade.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

However, Cholmeley is not buried in this tomb.  In his will, he requests that he be buried "within the Chapel of our blessed Lady of Barking beside the Tower of London" (now called "All Hallows, Barking") and that if the Masters and Wardens would not agree, then "my body be buried in the Church of the Crutched Friars beside the Tower of London" (now called "St. Olaf's").  All Hallows was almost totally destroyed during the blitz of London during [[World War II]], and so it is not known whether he was buried there or at St. Olaf's.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;  There is some evidence that he may have been buried in one of the tombs of the Cholmondeley, Cheshire branch of his family.&lt;ref name=CheshireMag/&gt;

Cholmeley's family can be traced back to the 12th century Robert de Chelmundelegh, second son of William le Belward, who inherited parts of the Barony of Malpas (for which [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] is named), including Cholmondeley, Cheshire, previously held by Robert Fitzhugh.  Over the centuries, the family name was spelled in many variants as [[middle-English]] developed away from French influences.  Different branches of the family spell the name differently, and Cholmeley's most famous cousins, of Cholmondeley, Cheshire, spell the name "Cholmondeley".&lt;ref&gt;Thornber, Craig. [http://www.thornber.net/cheshire/htmlfiles/cholmond.html "Cholmondeley Castle Gardens: The Cholmondeley family"], Thornber.net, 19 July 2000, accessed 6 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, Sir Richard's tomb in St. Peter ad Vincula was relocated and had a new name panel fitted.  The panel states that the Lieutenant of the Tower was named Richard "Cholmondeley".  Thus, Gilbert and Sullivan called him "Sir Richard Cholmondeley".  However, Sir Richard's father was John Cholmeley, his grandfather was William Cholmeley, and his brother was Roger Cholmeley.  His will is signed Richard Cholmeley and his illegitimate son was Sir [[Roger Cholmeley]].  After the Cholmondeley branch became the more highly titled branch of the family, Sir Richard Cholmeley, Lieutenant of the Tower, was confused with his cousin, Richard Cholmondeley of Cholmondeley, Cheshire, or one of the five knights named Richard Cholmondeley, Chomondley or Cholmeley living around the same time.&lt;ref name=Fiction/&gt;

The '''Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark''' ({{lang-it|Basilica Cattedrale Patriarcale di San Marco}}), commonly known as '''Saint Mark's Basilica''' ({{lang-it|Basilica di San Marco}}; {{lang-vec|Baxéłega de San Marco}}), is the [[cathedral]] church of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice]], northern [[Italy]]. It is the most famous of the city's churches and one of the best known examples of Italo-[[Byzantine architecture]]. It lies at the eastern end of the [[Piazza San Marco]], adjacent and connected to the [[Doge's Palace]]. Originally it was the chapel of the Doge, and has been the city's cathedral only since 1807, when it became the seat of the [[Patriarch of Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 1&lt;/ref&gt; archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice]], formerly at [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|title =Basilica di San Marco|date =|access-date =10 February 2016|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150305102304/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|archivedate =5 March 2015|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its opulent design, gold ground [[mosaic]]s, and its status as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power, from the 11th century on the building has been known by the nickname '''Chiesa d'Oro''' (Church of gold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7ZNOt6-N0MC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=Chiesa+d'Oro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hh_lT4X7BYyk8ATCy_WaAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Chiesa%20d'Oro&amp;f=false|title=Fodor's Italy 2011 |publisher= Random House Digital, Inc.|date= May 31, 2011|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Earliest construction===
[[File:San Marko (reconstruction).JPG|thumb|Original [[facade]] of St. Mark's Basilica]]
[[File:1911 Britannica-Architecture-St Mark’s.png|thumb|Plan diagram, showing different phases of construction]]
The first St Mark's was a building next to the [[Doge's Palace]], ordered by the doge in 828, when Venetian merchants stole the supposed relics of [[Mark the Evangelist]] from [[Alexandria]], and completed by 832; from the same century dates the first [[St Mark's Campanile]] (bell tower). The church was burned in a rebellion in 976, when the populace locked [[Pietro IV Candiano]] inside to kill him, and restored or rebuilt in 978.  Nothing certain is known of the form of these early churches.  From perhaps 1063&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|title=Navigation path|website=www.basilicasanmarco.it|accessdate=10 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305102304/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/WAI/eng/basilica/architettura/interne/fasi_costrutt.bsm|archivedate=5 March 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the present [[basilica]] was constructed.  The consecration is variously recorded as being in 1084&amp;ndash;85, 1093 (the date most often taken), 1102 and 1117, probably reflecting a series of consecrations of different parts.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:San Marco cathedral in Venice.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the gable showing Venice's patron apostle St. Mark with angels. Underneath is a winged lion, the symbol of the saint and of Venice.]]
In 1094 the supposed body of Saint Mark was rediscovered in a [[Column|pillar]] by [[Vitale Faliero]], [[Doge of Venice|doge]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/storia_societa/sanmarco_ritrovamento.bsm?cat=2&amp;subcat=1 |title=Recovery |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233823/http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/storia_societa/sanmarco_ritrovamento.bsm?cat=2&amp;subcat=1 |archive-date=4 October 2013 |work=basilicasanmarco.it |access-date=28 July 2013 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building also incorporates a low tower (now housing St Mark’s Treasure), believed by some to have been part of the original Doge's Palace.  The [[Pala d'Oro]] ordered from Constantinople was installed on the [[high altar]] in 1105.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1106 the church, and especially its mosaics, were damaged by a serious fire in that part of the city; it is not entirely clear whether any surviving mosaics in the interior predate this, though there is some 11th-century work surviving in the main porch.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;  The main features of the present structure were all in place by then, except for the [[narthex]] or porch, and the [[facade]].

The basic shape of the church has a mixture of Italian and Byzantine features, notably "the treatment of the eastern arm as the termination of a basilican building with main apse and two side chapels rather than as an equal arm of a truly centralized structure".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new facade were constructed, most of the mosaics were completed and the [[dome]]s were covered with second much higher domes of lead-covered wood in order to blend in with the [[Gothic architecture]] of the redesigned Doge's Palace.—

===Later construction===
The basic structure of the building has not been much altered. Its decoration has changed greatly over time, though the overall impression of the interior with a dazzling display of gold ground mosaics on all ceilings and upper walls remains the same. The succeeding centuries, especially the period after the Venetian-led conquest of Constantinople in the [[Fourth Crusade]] of 1204 and the fourteenth century, all contributed to its adornment, with many elements being [[spolia]] brought in from ancient or Byzantine buildings, such as mosaics, [[column]]s, [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], or [[frieze]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Gradually, the exterior [[brickwork]] became covered with [[marble]] cladding and [[Stone carving|carvings]], some much older than the building itself, such as the statue of the Four Tetrarchs (below).
The latest structural additions include the closing-off of the Baptistery and [[Isidore of Chios|St Isidor's]] Chapel (1300s), the carvings on the upper facade and the Sacristy (1400s), and the closing-off of the Zen Chapel (1500s).

===Function and administration===
During the 13th century the emphasis of the church's function seems to have changed from being the private chapel of the Doge to that of a "state church", with increased power for the procurators.  It was the location for the great public ceremonies of the state, such as the installation and burials of Doges, though as space ran out and the demand for grander tombs increased, from the 15th century [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]] became the usual burial place. The function of the basilica remained the same until 1807, after the end of the [[Venetian Republic]], when the basilica finally became subject to the local [[bishop]], the [[Patriarch of Venice]], though from the 12th century he had had a throne there, opposite the doge's.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of the see was ordered by [[Napoleon]] during his period of control of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 68&lt;/ref&gt;  Before this, Venice's cathedral from 1451 was the much less grand [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]].

The ''procurators'', an important organ of the [[Republic of Venice]], were in charge of administration; their seats were the [[Procuratie]], in St Mark’s Square. All building and restoring works were directed by the ''protos'': great [[architect]]s such as [[Jacopo Sansovino]] and [[Baldassarre Longhena]] held the office. The doge himself appointed a special group of clergy led by the ''primicerio''.  Procurators and protos still exist and perform the same tasks for the Patriarchate.

==Exterior==
[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3341.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mark's, from the north side of the piazza ([[Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives]] - [[:c:Category:Photographs from the Goodyear Archival Collection|the Goodyear Archival Collection]]).]]
The exterior of the west facade of the basilica is divided in three registers: lower, upper, and [[dome]]s.
In the lower register of the façade, five round-arched [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], enveloped by polychrome marble columns, open into the narthex through bronze-fashioned doors.

The upper level of mosaics in the lunettes of the lateral ogee arches has scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] (all post-Renaissance replacements) culminating in a 19th-century replacement ''[[Last Judgment]]'' lower down over the main portal that replaced a damaged one with the same subject (during the centuries many mosaics had to be replaced inside and outside the basilica, but subjects were rarely changed).

Mosaics with scenes showing the history of the relics of Saint Mark from right to left fill the [[lunette]]s of the lateral portals; the first on the left is the only one on the façade still surviving from the 13th century. The formal subject is the ''Deposition of the Relics'', but it is probably depicted as the crowd leaving San Marco after the ceremonial installation of a new doge. The four bronze horses are shown in their place on the façade. We can for once get a good idea of the original compositions of the mosaics from paintings and other depictions, especially [[Gentile Bellini]]'s very large ''Procession in Piazza San Marco'' in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 183-187&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone sculpture is relatively limited at the lower level, where a forest of columns and patterned marble slabs are the main emphases. It includes relatively narrow bands of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] work on the portals, richly carved borders of foliage mixed with figures to the ogee arches and other elements, and large shallow [[relief]] saints between the arches. Along the roofline, by contrast, there is a line of statues, many in their own small pavilions, culminating in Saint Mark flanked by six angels in the centre, above a large gilded winged lion (his symbol, and that of Venice).

In the upper register, from the top of ogee [[arch]]es, statues of [[Theological virtues|Theological]] and [[Cardinal virtues|Cardinal Virtues]], four [[Military saint|Warrior Saints]], [[Constantine X Doukas|Constantine]], [[Demetrius]], [[George the Hagiorite|George]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Theodosius]] and St Mark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/eng/basilica_scult/coronamento_appr.bsm# |title=The Gothic Crowning|publisher=basilicasanmarco.it |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; watch over the city. Above the large central window of the façade, under St Mark, the Winged Lion (his symbol) holds the book quoting ''“Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Meus” (Peace to you Mark my evangelist) ''.  In the centre of the balcony the famous bronze horses face the square.

===Horses of Saint Mark-Lysippos===
[[File:Veneza38.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|The replica horses]]
The [[Horses of Saint Mark]] were installed on the balcony above the portal of the basilica in about 1254. They date to [[Classical Antiquity]], though their date remains a matter of debate, and presumably were originally the team pulling a [[quadriga]] chariot, probably containing an emperor. By some accounts they once adorned the Arch of [[Trajan]]{{clarify|date=November 2016 |reason=Which one?}}.

The horses were long displayed at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], and in 1204 Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] sent them back to Venice as part of the loot [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacked from Constantinople]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].

They were taken to Paris by [[Napoleon]] in 1797 but returned to Venice in 1815. After a long restoration, since the 1970s the originals have been kept in St Mark’s Museum inside the basilica and the horses now on the facade of the cathedral are bronze replicas.

[[File:Venice – The Tetrarchs 03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs]] {{3d alt|4 Tetrarchs.jpg}}]]

===The Tetrarchs===
In an attempt to stabilise the Roman Empire after the crisis of the third century, the Emperor [[Diocletian]] imposed a new Imperial office structure: a four co-emperor ruling plan called The [[Tetrarchy]]. The famous [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] statue [[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|of the Four Tetrarchs]] represents the interdependence of the four rulers. It was taken from [[Constantinople]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, and set into the south-west corner of the basilica (the above-mentioned low tower) at the level of the Piazza San Marco. Part of the missing foot of one of the figures was discovered in Istanbul (near the [[Bodrum Mosque]]) in the 1960s, where it is still on display, clarifying the original location of the work.

===Narthex or porch===
By the 13th century, the [[narthex]] or porch embraced the western arm of the basilica on the three sides; when it was first built is uncertain but was probably the 13th century. Later the southern part was closed to obtain the Baptistery (14th century) and the Zen Chapel (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The narthex prepares the visitors’ eyes for the atmosphere of the gilded interior, just as the [[Old Testament]] stories represented in its 13th-century mosaic ceiling prepare them for the New Testament decoration in the interior.  The main subjects are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the life of [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], Joseph, and [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, Chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt;  It has long been recognised that the compositions are very close to those of the [[Cotton Genesis]], an important 4th- or 5th-century Greek luxury [[illuminated manuscript]] copy of the Book of Genesis, now in the [[British Library]], though very badly damaged in a fire of 1731.  About a hundred of the 359 miniatures in the manuscript are used. It is presumed that this reached Venice after the Fourth Crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

On the wall above and at the sides of the main doorway are the [[Four Evangelists]] and saints, 11th-century mosaics, the oldest in the building, that decorated the old facade to St Mark’s even before the narthex was built.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
[[File:Veneto Venezia2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|View from the main crossing dome to the eastern apse]]
The interior is based on a Greek cross, with each arm divided into three naves with a dome of its own as well as the main dome above the crossing. The dome above the crossing and the western dome are bigger than the other three. This is based on Constantine's Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople.

The marble floor (12th century, but underwent many restorations) is entirely tessellated in geometric patterns and animal designs. One particular panel in the pavement shows two [[rooster|cock]]s carrying a trussed-up fox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/39911172@N08/3715513816/|title=Venice Basilica San Marco interior 07 Mural 2 cocks carrying a fox|publisher=[[Flickr]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been interpreted politically by some, as a reference to the French conquest of [[Milan]] in the [[Italian Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaHt76Uk2m8C&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=church+two+cocks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C3HEdx-atB&amp;sig=Gni4XJfAcPBUCS4P4y-OpdVhUao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QJCuTcSJAYLBtgeszcHdAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=cocks|title=Venice: A Documentary History, 1450-1630|first=David|last=Sanderson|last2=Chambers|first2=Jennifer|last3=Fletcher|first3=Brian S. Pullan|publisher=Renaissance Society of America|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see it as a sacred symbol of the faithful wish for immortality, with the victory of the cross, and "analogous to the hope of resurrection, the victory of the soul over death".&lt;ref&gt;The Theme of Cockfighting in Burgundian Romanesque Sculpture, Ilene H. Forsyth&amp;nbsp;– Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies Vol. 53, No. 2 (Apr., 1978), pp. 252–282&amp;nbsp;– Publisher: Medieval Academy of America&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques used were [[opus sectile]] and [[opus tessellatum]].

The lower register of walls and [[Column|pillars]] is completely covered with polychrome [[marble]] slabs. The transition between the lower and the upper register is delimited all around the basilica by passageways which largely substituted the former galleries.

===Mosaics===
The upper levels of the interior are completely covered with bright [[mosaic]]s covering an area of about 8000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The great majority use the traditional background of [[gold glass]] [[tesserae]], creating the shimmering overall effect.  Unfortunately, the Doge retained a workshop of mosaicists until the late 18th century, and in the 19th century contracted a mosaic workshop run by the [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]] glassmaking firm, and the majority of the medieval mosaics have been "restored" by removing and resetting, usually with a considerable loss of quality, so that "only about one-third of the mosaic surface can be regarded as original".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6-11, 10 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving work, in the main porch, perhaps dates to as early as 1070, and was probably by a workshop that had left Constantinople in the mid-11th century and worked at [[Torcello Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;  They are in "a fairly pure Byzantine style" but in succeeding phases of work Byzantine influence reflecting the latest style of the capital was reduced by stages, disappearing altogether by about the 1130s, after which the style was Italian in essentials, reflecting "a change from a colonial to a local art".&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 37-38, 189 (quoted)&lt;/ref&gt;  The main period of decoration was the 12th century, a period of deteriorating relations between Venice and Byzantium, but very little is known about the process or how it was affected by politics.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Veneza118.jpg|thumb|Overview of mosaics, looking east]]
[[File:Mosaico traslazione San Marco Venezia.JPG|thumb|Mosaic of the translation of the body of Saint Mark]]
[[File:Part of the Entrance to St Mark's Basilica in Venice.jpg|250px|thumb|Part of the mosaic at the entrance to St Mark's Basilica.]]
The main work on the interior mosaics was apparently complete by the 1270s, with work on the atrium continuing into the 1290s. After that the St Marks workshop seems to have been disbanded, so that when a fire in 1419 caused serious damage, the only Venetian capable of the work had just died and the [[Signoria of Florence]] had to be asked for help; they sent [[Paolo Uccello]].&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the restorations tried to retain the medieval compositions and replicate a medieval style, but from 1509 the policy changed and further work was in contemporary styles. From the 1520s a series of Venetian painters were able to get commissions for the replacement of undamaged areas in what was considered to be superior modern style, until from 1610 a number of conservation-minded decrees attempted to restrain the process.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The large and complicated programme of the decoration centres on the seated large [[Christ Pantocrator]] in the main apse (now a 15th-century recreation) above patron saints of Venice. The East dome over the high altar has a bust of Christ in the centre surrounded by standing prophets and the Virgin Mary, with the [[Four Evangelists]] in the [[pendentive]]s. A large and comprehensive cycle of the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] occupies much of the roof, with usually extensive coverage for the Middle Ages of his miracles, originally shown in 29 scenes in the transepts. It includes the [[Ascension of Christ]] in the central dome and [[Pentecost]] in the west dome.  The centre is an [[etimasia]] ("empty throne") with book and dove, with the [[twelve apostles]] seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne. Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the "nations", with ''tituli'', stand between the windows.  Similar images are found in the [[Chludov Psalter]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 55-57, and plate 13; also Parani, 196. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAUMM3cU_UoC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA240&amp;ots=hD-45Z7Svh&amp;dq=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;pg=RA1-PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=Hetoimasia%20Hagia%20Sophia&amp;f=false here] for further details]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the miracles the transepts contain cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]] before and during the Infancy of Christ.  As well as many saints, church fathers, virtues and angels, there are scenes from the lives of Saints Mark, Clement, Peter, and John (with many scenes in post-Renaissance versions). The west wall has a 13th-century [[deesis]] below a [[Last Judgement]] in the vault, and a huge [[Tree of Jesse]] was added to the end wall of the north transept in 1548.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 10-11 for summary, full coverage in later chapters.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the [[iconography]] of the Old Testament cycle in the porch in the Cotton Genesis manuscript has been described above; similar relationships have been traced for parts of the interior mosaics, in particular with the cycle of the Life of the Virgin and Infancy of Christ sharing a common Byzantine model with a [[fresco]] cycle in the cathedral at the [[Mirozhsky Monastery]] in [[Pskov]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, restorations and replacements were often necessary thereafter, or done even when not necessary, and great painters such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Andrea del Castagno]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Jacopo Tintoretto]] and his son [[Domenico Tintoretto|Domenico]] were among those who produced the designs for the mosaicists. [[Titian]] and the [[Padovanino]] prepared the [[cartoon]]s for the sacristy, built in the late 15th century. Other mosaics decorate the Baptistery, the Mascoli Chapel, St Isidor Chapel and the Zen Chapel, which has scenes from the life of St Mark, perhaps from the 1270s, and among the latest work of the original programme to be done.&lt;ref&gt;Demus, 179-182&lt;/ref&gt;

===The presbytery===
[[File:Meister der Ikone des Erzengels Michael 001 adjusted.jpg|thumb|10th-century gold and enamel Byzantine [[icon]] of [[St Michael]], in the treasury]]

The eastern arm has a raised [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]] with a [[crypt]] beneath. The presbytery is separated by an  [[Rood screen|altar screen]] formed by eight red marble columns crowned with a high Crucifix and statues by [[Pier Paolo Dalle Masegne|Pier Paolo]] and  [[Jacobello Dalle Masegne]], masterpiece of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] sculpture (late 14th century). Behind the screen, marble banisters with Sansovino's bronze statues of the Evangelists and [[Girolamo Paliari|Paliari]]'s of the Four Doctors mark the access to the high [[altar]], which contains St Mark’s relics. Above the high altar is a canopy (“[[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]]”) on columns decorated with fine [[relief]]s. The [[altarpiece]] is the famous [[Pala d'Oro]], a masterpiece of Byzantine craftsmanship, originally designed for an [[antependium]].This masterpiece incorporates 1,300 pearls, 300 sapphires, 300 emeralds, and 400 garnets. They are all original and highly polished, unfaceted gems. The original altar frontal is now in the treasury.  The choir stalls are embellished with inlay by Fra [[Sebastiano Schiavone]], and above them on both sides are three [[relief]]s by Sansovino.

Behind the presbytery are the [[sacristy]] and a 15th-century church consecrated to [[Theodore of Amasea|St Theodore]] (the first patron saint of Venice) where is displayed a painting (Child’s Adoration) by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].

===The treasury===
The treasury contains what is now a unique collection of Byzantine portable objects in metalwork, enamel and [[hardstone carving]], most looted from Constantinople after the Fourth Crusade (although there was a serious fire in the treasury in 1231), with probably a new influx after the "Franks" were expelled in 1261.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 65-66, 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter most objects were made locally, though there are also important Islamic works, especially in [[rock crystal]], and some from Northern Europe. Selections have toured internationally.

Most of the church plate was ordered to be surrendered to the state immediately after the end of the Venetian Republic in 1797, and was melted down for coining; there were only 141 objects in an inventory ordered by the Austrians in 1816, many in materials that could not be recycled for cash.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 67&lt;/ref&gt; The group of Byzantine hardstone vessels in various semi-precious stones is by the most important to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; A glass [[situla (vessel)|situla]] or bucket carved with [[Dionysus|Bacchic]] figures been dated to either the 4th or 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th-century "throne-reliquary" in rather crudely carved [[alabaster]], the ''Sedia di San Marco'', was moved from the high altar to the Treasury in 1534.  It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a "throne-lectern" or resting place for a [[gospel book]], making actual the [[hetoimasia]] ("empty throne") images with open books that are found in art of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 98-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The treasury "now houses the best single collection of Byzantine metalwork, and particularly of enameling, that survives", including two imperial chalices of antique [[sardonyx]] with Byzantine gold and enamel mounts, marked "Romanos", the name of four emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Buckton, 105&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:S03 06 01 027 image 3345.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mark's, interior looking diagonally to the left transept (Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives - the Goodyear Archival Collection).]]

===Right transept===
On the right of the screen is the platform from which the newly elected doge appeared. In the left aisle are [[Clement of Metz|St Clement]]’s chapel and the Holy Host altar. Here is the pillar where St Mark’s relics were rediscovered in 1094, as depicted in the interesting mosaics of the right aisle (where the entrance to St Mark’s Treasure is)..

===Left transept===
On the left of the screen is the platform for readings from Scripture; on the right aisle are [[St Peter]]’s chapel and the [[commons:File:Nicopeia.jpg|Madonna Nicopeia]], a venerated Byzantine icon. On the northern side are St Isidor’s chapel and the Mascoli chapel.

==Music==
[[File:Venice SMarco Vault2.jpg|thumb|Dome with [[Pentecost]] and [[pendentive]]s with angels]]
{{main|Cappella Marciana}}
The spacious interior of the building with its multiple choir lofts was the inspiration for the development of a [[Venetian polychoral style]] among the composers appointed [[maestro di cappella]] at the [[Cappella Marciana|choir of St Mark's]]. The style was first developed by a foreigner, [[Adrian Willaert]], and was continued by Italian organists and composers: [[Andrea Gabrieli]], his nephew [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]. Their music took advantage of the spacious architecture and led to the development of [[polychoral]] and [[antiphonal]] textures. An example of this technique is found in [[In Ecclesiis]] by Giovanni Gabrieli.

==In scientific discourse==
One of the most well-known and widely cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=8886524888381702203&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en|title=Google Scholar|publisher=Scholar.google.ca|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; papers in biology is "The [[Spandrel]]s of San Marco and the [[Panglossian]] Paradigm: A Critique of the [[Adaptationist]] Programme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=S.J.|author2=Lewontin, R.C. |authorlink2=Richard Lewontin|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould|title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: A critique of the adaptationist programme|year=1979|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=205|issue=1161|pages=581–598|doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|pmid=42062|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/205/1161/581.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on an analogy between the beautifully decorated spandrels spaced around the domes in the basilica, which sit on four arches (technically, the structures are [[pendentive]]s rather than spandrels), and various biological traits and features. The authors, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]], argue that the spandrels are the inevitable spaces that exist when a dome is placed above arches rather than design elements and that many biological traits are similarly the side effects of functional traits rather than adaptive traits in themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3530">'''Stanley Berkeley''' (1855–1909) was an [[English people|English]] [[Painting|painter]] of animal, sporting and historical subjects, especially military scenes. Born in London, he exhibited regularly at the [[Royal Academy]], the [[Grafton Galleries]], the New Watercolour Society, and elsewhere from 1878 until 1902, and many of his pictures were retrospective military scenes of the [[English Civil War]] and the [[Battle of Waterloo]], such as ''For God and King: An Incident in the Civil War'', and ''[[Gordon Highlanders|Gordons]] and [[Royal Scots Greys|Greys]] to the front: An Incident at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]''. Berkeley also depicted contemporary events and several were published as [[photogravures]] by [[Henry Graves (printseller and publisher)|Henry Graves]] including ''The Victory of [[Battle of Kandahar|Candahar]]'', ''Charge of the [[Gordon Highlanders]] at [[Dargai Heights|Dargai]]'', ''[[Battle of Atbara|Atbara]]'', and ''[[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]].'' Some of his most popular pictures were representations of dramatic events in the [[Boer War]]. He also provided illustrations for various books, magazines and newspapers, and produced many works in water-color and monochrome. In 1884, he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Painters and Etchers for his illustration work. Berkeley married the genre and landscape painter, Edith Berkeley and they lived at Surbiton Hill, in Surrey, where he died on 24 April 1909.

[[File:Steppenwolf theater Chicago.jpg|thumb|Steppenwolf Theatre Company]]
'''Steppenwolf Theatre Company''' is a [[Chicago theatre]] company founded in 1974 by [[Laurie Metcalf]], [[Terry Kinney]], [[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]], and [[Gary Sinise]] in the Unitarian church on Half Day Road in [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Steppenwolf.html?id=AOWDkQEACAAJ|title=Steppenwolf @ Twenty-Five|publisher=Steppenwolf Theater Company|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now located in Chicago's [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood on Halsted Street. Its name comes from the [[Hermann Hesse]] [[Steppenwolf (novel)|novel]] which original member Rick Argosh was reading during the company's inaugural production, ''[[And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little]]'', in January 1974.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.steppenwolf.org/ensemble/history/|title=History|publisher=Steppenwolf Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Steppenwolf incorporated as a [[nonprofit organization]], saving money by taking the name of a failed theater company that had already incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/magazine/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-roseanne.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1976, Steppenwolf took up residence in a vacant basement space of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icparish.org/contact|title=Contact Us |publisher=Immaculate Conception Catholic Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Highland Park, Illinois]] and produced its first full season of plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/08/steppenwolf-theatre-40-years|title=How Chicago’s Famed Steppenwolf Became the Apple of Theater|first=Donald|last=Liebenson|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steppenwolf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXmcDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=basement|title=Steppenwolf Theatre Company of Chicago: In Their Own Words|first=John|last=Mayer|date=August 11, 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the theater company moved into a 134-seat theater at the [[Hull House#Theater|Jane Addams Hull House Center]] on Broadway Avenue in Chicago.  Two years later, the company moved to a 211-seat facility at 2851 N. Halsted Street, which was their home until 1991, when construction was completed on the current theater complex at 1650 N. Halsted Street (with administrative offices at 1700 N. Halsted Street.)

In 1982, [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', starring Sinise and [[John Malkovich]], was the first of many Steppenwolf productions to travel to New York City. 

In 1994, the company made its Los Angeles debut with [[Steve Martin]]'s first play, ''[[Picasso at the Lapin Agile]]''.

In 1996, after successful runs in Chicago and New York, Lyle Kessler's [[Orphans (Lyle Kessler play)|Orphans]], directed by Gary Sinise, was the first Steppenwolf production to go international, debuting in London.

The [[MacArthur Foundation]] awarded Steppenwolf Theatre Company $2,260,000 between 1978 and 2017, in support of general operations, and growth of artistic and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/grantees/1408/|title=Steppenwolf Theatre Company — MacArthur Foundation|publisher=[[MacArthur Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Supplément au voyage de Bougainville, ou dialogue entre A et B sur l'inconvénient d'attacher des idées morales à certaines actions physiques qui n'en comportent pas.''''' ("''Addendum to the Journey of Bougainville, or dialogue between A and B on the drawback to binding moral ideas to certain physical actions which bear none''") is a set of philosophical dialogues written by [[Denis Diderot]], inspired by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]'s ''[[Voyage autour du monde]]''. It was written in 1772 for the journal ''[[Correspondance littéraire]]'', which commissioned him to review Bougainville's account of his travels, but not published until 1796.&lt;ref&gt;Wikisourcelang|fr|Supplément au voyage de Bougainville&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Bougainville, a contemporary of Diderot, was a French [[exploration|explorer]] whose 1771 book ''Voyage autour du monde'' (''A Voyage Around the World'') provided an account of an expedition that took him to [[Argentina]], [[Patagonia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Tahiti]]. It was the [[utopia]]n descriptions of the latter that inspired Diderot to write his review in the form of a fictional ''Supplement''.

==Structure==

The ''Supplement'' spans either four or five chapters, depending on the edition.&lt;ref name="mcdonald 1976"&gt;McDonald, Christie V. (1976). The Reading and Writing of Utopia in Denis Diderot's "Supplement au voyage de Bougainville". ''Science Fiction Studies, 3''(3): 248-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Each takes the form of a dialogue between two people, but the characters and setting varies. Chapter two features a Tahitian Elder addressing a hypothetical Bougainville; chapters three and four are between a villager named Orou and his European [[almoner]] guest; in chapters one and five, speakers known only as "A" and "B" speak in a literary space apart from Tahiti, commenting on and drawing lessons from the noted differences between Tahitian and European culture.

In each of the dialogues, Diderot aligns one character with European culture and the other with Tahitian culture for the purpose of contrasting the two. This kind of [[nature–culture divide]] was a common strategy to critique aspects of European culture during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="mcdonald 2000"&gt;Ansart, Guillaume. (2000). Aspects of Rationality in Diderot's "Supplement au voyage de Bougainville". ''Diderot Studies, 26'': 11-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Diderot touches upon many popular Enlightenment themes, for example: [[slavery]], [[colonisation]], the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, the relationship between [[morality]] and [[law]], ownership of [[private property]] and human sexuality.   

Two main areas of life arise from Diderot's "Supplement to Bougainville's Voyage" and oppose one another. First Diderot dissects Tahitian society and then compares it to an eighteenth-century French society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Dena|date=1983|title=The Structure of Political Argument in Diderot's Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40372573|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=21|pages=123–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The themes that stem from the comparison deal with the nature of man and the nature of what is known to be an advanced society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Christie V.|date=1976|title=The Reading and Writing of Utopia in Denis Diderot's "Supplément au voyage de Bougainville"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4239040|journal=Science Fiction Studies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=248–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these two societies, Diderot is able to produce moral statements about the way that people live. The issue of morality is one of Diderot's major themes. From morality Diderot moves to other themes of ownership and private property, specifically through marriage. Both societies seem extremely foreign to one another and think that each are better, but in reality they are just different.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Theme of Sexuality in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''[edit] ===
[[File:Paul Gauguin - Two Tahitian Women.jpg|thumb|''[[Two Tahitian Women]]'', 1899, [[Paul Gauguin]]]]

==== Origins[edit] ====
Because of his study of nature and the advancements in life sciences, [[Denis Diderot]] came to the conclusion that universal progress depends largely on Eros.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Alice|date=1986|title=Did/erotica: Diderot's Contribution to the History of Sexuality|url=|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=22|pages=89-106|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Diderot, [[Eros]] is “a priori existence of sexual energy that fuels the universe.”  This concept greatly influenced Diderot’s views on human sexuality.  His involvement in Enlightenment movements such as [[sensualism]], [[vitalism]] and [[materialism]] also helped him developed his ideas about human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He believed that nature had a moral end and encourages humans to have children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since nature favors procreation, laws and rules should not restrain the sexuality of men and women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   Since 18th century French society had many rules controlling people’s sexuality, Diderot believed that French society is not a suitable place for Eros because of its “artificiality and formalism.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For Claudia Moscovici, Diderot’s critique of 18th century French society, especially its rules controlling human sexuality, can especially be seen in the ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moscovici|first=Claudia|date=2001|title=An Ethics of Cultural Exchange: Diderot's Supplement au Voyage de Bougainville|url=|journal=Clio|volume=30|pages=289-307|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diderot’s Views on Human Sexuality[edit] ====
Diderot’s views on sexuality is contained in the ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''. In the book, Diderot uses a dialogue between Orou, a Tahitian man, and a chaplain in order to contrast the French and Tahitian societies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Double Dialectics: Between Universalism and Relativism in Enlightenment and Postmodern Thought|last=Moscovici|first=Claudia|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2002|isbn=|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tahitian people are governed by nature and portrayed as happy and content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They also have less restrictions on their sexual conduct because men and women are not obligated to marry before having a child together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  People can have sex with the opposite gender in order to procreate, which is nature’s intended purpose for humans.  In Tahiti, women are not considered property of any man and are not ridiculed for having a child before marriage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Claudia Moscovici argues that Diderot uses the Tahitian society to criticize the laws and norms regarding sexual behavior in 18th century French society and Western culture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Unlike the Tahitians, the French are governed by laws and convention.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  They had more restrictions on the sexual behavior of men and women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For instance, it was unacceptable to have a child with someone without being married in French society.  Once married, [[Women in France|family life]] for women was very constraining.  French women did not have much freedom to pursue jobs outside of the home and was considered the property of their husband. In this way, Claudia Moscovici argues that Diderot believed that marriage controlled human sexuality because women and men were bound to one another, prohibiting them from having children with others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For Alice Parker, Diderot also believed this idea because French women were no longer free to satisfy their own desires, especially sexual ones, and had to adhere to the commands of their  “bourgeois patriarchs.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Diderot’s Contradictory Views on Sexuality[edit] ====
While Diderot suggests that women should be liberated and not be property of men in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville'', Walter E. Rex argues that Diderot contradicts himself when he writes a letter to Angelique, his daughter, on her wedding day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rex|first=Walter E.|date=1998|title=Contrariety in the" Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville|url=|journal=Diderot Studies|volume=27|pages=149-168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this letter, Diderot discusses how his daughter should act once she is married to her husband.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Instead of reiterating that she is not the property of her husband, he tells her, in a sense, she is her husband’s property.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He asserts that a wife should obey and give pleasure to her husband.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  She should respect him at all times and keep him entertained in order to guarantee that he will not leave her.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Diderot even says that her whole existence is to ensure that her husband is satisfied.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In this way, according to Rex, Angelique does not have the same amount of sexual liberation as the Tahitians in Diderot’s ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Rex argues this idea because Diderot did not give Angelique the ability to act on her own accord but rather, dictated that her actions must conform to her husband’s wishes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  She was not free to act on her own natural instincts, especially those of the sexual kind.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Rex articulates that Diderot controlled his daughter's sexuality, which is contrary to the sexual liberation displayed in the Tahitian lifestyle in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Walter E. Rex argues that the contradiction occurred because Diderot’s enthrallment with the expedition accounts of Bougainville caused him to overlook the fact that his views on human sexuality contained in the letter to his daughter was different than those explained in ''Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
Given that the film is [[experimental film|experimental]], there is no proper narrative; rather, there is a guideline governing its development. The masked silhouettes climb stairs, and engage in various meetings on each level. This is a spiritual quest that doubles as a research on [[optical illusion]]s, Bokanowski recreating all the objectives of his cameras. This is a [[feature film]], which is rare for artisanal [[animation]] and [[experimental film|experimental]] films.

In the booklet that accompanies the [[DVD]] which contains Bokanowski's sole two documentaries (''La Part du Hasard'', [[1984 in film|1984]], on the painter Henri Dimier; and ''Le Rêve éveillé'', [[2003 in film|2003]]; dialogues between the psychotherapist Colette Aboulker-Muscat and her patients), editor Pip Chodorov wrote: "The search for the overrunning of perception, and thereby oneself, is an expression of the spirituality present in the lives of these two figures: inspiration that we also found in Bokanowski's films, which are also searches into abstraction in the real, mysterious blanks that recover the daily. In his film ''The Angel'', characters search for light, and rise in spirals towards beacons of white and pure light, the librarian-researchers conduct a fierce intellectual quest, hoping for an illuminating response buried under mountains of books. Light plays a central role for the filmmaker, just like it does for the painter and therapist, as a peak of dramatic pleasure. We are pulled forward, upward, through these leaks in the twilight towards the light."&lt;ref&gt;Kira B.M. Films et Re:Voir Vidéo, [[2008 in film|2008]], p. 6. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CD album containing the soundtrack accompanying the film, composed by [[Michèle Bokanowski]], the director's wife, was released during 2003 by the label trAace under the title ''L'Ange''.

==Report on the animation==
According to [[Raphaël Bassan]], in his article «''L'Ange'': Un météore dans le ciel de l'animation,» [[Patrick Bokanowski]]'s film, along with Piotr Kamler's film ''[[Chronopolis (film)|Chronopolis]]'', both having premiered in [[1982 in film|1982]] at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], can be considered the beginnings of contemporary [[animation]]. This remark is based on the technical means and the visual or philosophical sense employed by [[Patrick Bokanowski]]. The masks erase all human personality in the characters. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] would thus have total control over the "matter" of the image and its optical composition. This is especially noticeable throughout the film, with images taken through distorted objectives or a plastic work on the sets and costumes, for example in the scene of the designer.

==The ascent towards light==
Again according to [[Raphaël Bassan]], ''The Angel'' can be seen as a spiritual ascension. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] creates his own universe and obeys his own aesthetic logic. It takes us through a series of distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses, and synthetic objects. Indeed, in the film, the human may be viewed as a fetish object (for example, the doll hanging by a thread), with reference to [[Franz Kafka#"Kafkaesque"|Kafkaesque]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theories on [[automaton|automata]] and the fear of man faced with something as complex as him. The ascent of the stairs would be the liberation of the ideas of death, culture, and sex that makes us reach the emblematic figure of the angel.

==Creating a plastic universe==
For Jacques Kermabon, ''The Angel'' is a variation of [[optics]], as control and manipulation of light, as attested by the integration of plastic optical devices. Similarly, the effects on perspective diagrams emphasizes the relativity of this representation process. In the same gesture, the aesthetics of ''The Angel'', which opens up an infinity of possibilities, announces a cinema that would be before any movement, rhythm, rhyme, form, or work on the color and material: a cinema where the meaning is dissolved and effect predominates. In a way, [[Patrick Bokanowski]] brilliantly realized what some artists-filmmakers envisioned in the 1920s: an aesthetic for creations to come – the ''[[Cinéma pur]]'' and the [[French impressionist cinema|first avant-garde]].

==Premise==
[[File:The Goldbergs 2013 logo.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional poster used for the series' first season]]
''The Goldbergs'' is set in the 1980s in [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania]]. The show is loosely based on the showrunner's childhood, during which he videotaped events, many of which are reenacted throughout the program. It shows the reality of the 1980s through a young boy's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/the_ticket/item/meet_the_goldbergs_adam_goldberg_mines_his_familys_mishegoss_for_new_sitcom|title=Meet ‘The Goldbergs’: Adam Goldberg mines his family’s mishegoss for new sitcom|last=Pfefferman|first=Naomi|work=Jewish Journal|publisher=TRIBE Media Corp|date=September 6, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series stars [[Jeff Garlin]] as patriarch Murray and [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as matriarch Beverly. Their two older children are Erica ([[Hayley Orrantia]]) and Barry ([[Troy Gentile]]). The youngest child, Adam ([[Sean Giambrone]]), documents his family life with his video camera. Beverly's father, Albert "Pops" Solomon ([[George Segal]]), is frequently around to provide advice or to help out his grandchildren (often behind his daughter's back).

The present-day "Adult Adam" ([[Patton Oswalt]]) narrates every episode as taking place in "1980-something".

Many references to real-life Philadelphia-area businesses are made, including the [[Wawa Inc.]] convenience store chain, [[Gimbel's]] department store, [[Willow Grove Park Mall]], and Kremp's Florist of [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]].

* [[Sean Giambrone]] as [[Adam F. Goldberg|Adam Fredrick Goldberg]],&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the pop-culture obsessed youngest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and geeky, he often films his family's activities on a VHS camcorder. He often ends up having to use his middle initial to distinguish himself from another Adam Goldberg who attends the same school and is also an aspiring filmmaker.
** [[Patton Oswalt]] voices the adult Adam Goldberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=TV Review: ''The Goldbergs''|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/the-goldbergs-TV-review-1200613772/|work=Variety|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who narrates the show from the present day.
* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Murray Goldberg,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the gruff, somewhat asocial patriarch of the Goldbergs. Unlike Beverly, he is realistic about his children's abilities and believes she smothers them too much. Despite his apathetic tendencies at home, he values hard work and has held various full time positions since his teenage years. Though he does not always show affection for his children, calling them morons when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways, he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves. He runs his father-in-law's furniture business, loves sports, and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his  white [[briefs]].
* [[Troy Gentile]] as Barry Norman Goldberg,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the overconfident, slightly dim-witted middle child of the Goldbergs. Though seemingly untalented in every way (except in ice hockey and wrestling, at which he excels), he remains highly self-assured while trying to become popular in high school. He is determined to dominate everything he does, including sports; loves rap music; and is the leader of a crew called the Jenkintown Posse (abbreviated JTP, which fellow members repeat whenever the initials are spoken). In the fifth season finale, he proposes to Lainey and she accepts. By this point, he has also graduated.
* [[Hayley Orrantia]] as Erica Dorothy Goldberg,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; the somewhat bad-tempered oldest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and musically gifted but rebellious, she is popular in school and dominant over her younger brothers. In the fifth season, Erica left for college at [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts|DC. School of the Arts]] only to drop out at the end of the season to start a band with Lainey and Valley Erica. "Erica" is based on Adam's real-life brother, Eric Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wojciechowski |first=Michelle "Wojo" |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Goldbergs Creator Adam F.

* [[George Segal]] as Albert "Pops" Solomon,&lt;ref name="thefutoncritic"/&gt; Beverly's laid-back widower father. Though an elderly man with a number of comic eccentricities, he acts much younger than his age and often gives sage advice to his grandchildren. Adam considers him his best friend. He once owned a successful furniture store called Ottoman Empire that allowed him to retire comfortably, and he now lets his son-in-law Murray run the business.
* [[AJ Michalka]] as Lainey Lewis (Season 3–4; recurring 1–2, 5–present),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - AJ Michalka Not Returning as Series Regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-aj-michalka-not.html|website=SpoilerTV|publisher=SpoilerTV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erica's best friend and one of the most popular girls at school, whom Barry has had a lifelong crush on. To the surprise of many, Lainey kisses Barry at a party in the first-season finale, the two slowly grow closer together in season two, and eventually become an unlikely couple. Following the fourth season, she has gone to attend fashion school in Savannah, Georgia and ended her relationship with Barry. In season 5, she returns to Jenkintown after dropping out along with Erica to start a band. In the final seconds of the season finale she and Barry agree to wed.
* [[Sam Lerner]] as 'Madman' Geoff Schwartz (Season 5–present; recurring 2–4),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - Sam Lerner promoted to regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-sam-lerner.html|website=Spoiler TV|publisher=Spoiler TV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Barry's best friends. The nickname "Madman" is a form of ironic humor, given how well-behaved the character is, especially compared to Barry. He is infatuated with Erica and makes many futile attempts to win her affections. At the end of the third season, he begins dating Evelyn Silver just as Erica realizes she reciprocates Geoff's feelings. He later breaks up with Evey to be with Erica.
*Alison Rich as Erica "Valley Erica" Coolidge, Erica's [[Valley girl]] roommate at college; the two have the same first name, but decidedly different personalities. She dropped out of college with Erica and Lainey, and currently lives with the Goldbergs. (season 6; recurring 5)

==Spin-off==
{{Main|Schooled (TV series)}}
In November 2016, it was first reported that ABC was developing a spin-off that would centre around recurring character Rick Mellor, played by Bryan Callen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/11/08/development-update-tuesday-november-8-686012/11918/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Tuesday, November 8 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2017, Wendi McClendon-Covey's character was reported as appearing in the script in a guest appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/01/10/development-update-tuesday-january-10-201421/11970/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Tuesday, January 10 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was ordered to pilot on February 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/02/02/development-update-thursday-february-2-619121/11993/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Thursday, February 2 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2017, it was confirmed that [[Nia Long]] had been cast as the female lead in the role of Lucy Winston. At the same time it was confirmed that [[Tim Meadows]] would reprise his recurring role from ''The Goldbergs'' as Andre Glascott. Jay Chandrasekhar was also confirmed to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/03/09/development-update-thursday-march-9-66315/12027/|title=Breaking News - Development Update: Thursday, March 9 - TheFutonCritic.com|website=www.thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017, ABC passed on the spin-off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/adamfgoldberg/status/865011205139812352|title=Adam F. Goldberg Twitter|publisher=Adam F. Goldberg|date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite it reportedly testing very well - going as far to test better than the pilot of the original series.&lt;ref name="notsodead"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-1990s-set-pilot-air-abc-1073142|title='The Goldbergs' 1990s-Set Pilot to Air on ABC|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Adam F. Goldberg revealed the title of the failed spin-off - "Schooled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/adamfgoldberg/status/865012519265460225|title=Adam F. Goldberg Twitter|publisher=Adam F. Goldberg|date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2018, it was announced that the pilot would air as a special episode of ''The Goldbergs'' on January 24, 2018, under the episode title ''The Goldbergs: 1990-Something''. Along with Nia Long as Lucy Winston and Tim Meadows as teacher-turned-principal Andre Glascott (who is also revealed to be Lucy's brother), the pilot also starred [[Rachel Crow]] as Lucy's rebellious teenage daughter Felicia, and Summer Parker as Felicia's bubbly younger sister Gigi, with [[Octavia Spencer]] narrating as the present-day Felicia.

After the pilot aired, Goldberg had expressed hope that the airing would prompt discussions with ABC that could lead to the series being picked up for the [[2018–19 United States network television schedule|2018–19]] TV season.&lt;ref name="notsodead" /&gt; Three months later, on April 16, 2018, it was announced that ABC had officially picked up the spin-off, ''Schooled'', for a 13-episode season slated to air in 2019. It was also announced that AJ Michalka would reprise her role as Lainey Lewis from ''The Goldbergs'' in the new show, but Nia Long will not return to the spin-off due to being a regular cast member on the [[CBS]] drama series ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-1990s-set-spinoff-picked-up-series-at-abc-1090077|title='The Goldbergs' 1990s-Set Spinoff Picked Up to Series at ABC|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{see also|Lysine price-fixing conspiracy}}
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-1/informant-true-story-part-1 Part One of ''Booknotes'' interview with Kurt Eichenwald  on ''The Informant'', February 4, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]| video2 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-2/informant-true-story-part-2 Part Two of ''Booknotes'' interview, February 11, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]}}
In the early 1990s, at the [[agri-business]] conglomerate [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), [[Mark Whitacre]] is a corporate vice president and head of the bio-products division. In November 1992, under pressure from his wife, Whitacre confesses to an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent that he, along with other ADM executives, routinely met with competitors to fix the price of [[lysine]], a food additive. Afterwards, Whitacre assists in gathering evidence against the other conspirators by secretly taping their activities during overseas business meetings. Over the course of three years, the FBI collects hundreds of hours of video and audio tapes documenting the largest case of price-fixing in history.

Whitacre is revealed to have defrauded $9 million from ADM at the same time he was aiding the FBI. After federal agents stage raid on ADM, the company hits back with damning evidence against the government's star witness. Whitacre becomes delusional and engages in [[pathological lying]] to save himself, leading the FBI to learn that he suffers from [[bipolar disorder]]. Worst of all, he gives false stories to the media about being forced to destroy evidence by the FBI. Whitacre becomes extremely manic, stops sleeping, and exhibits bizarre behavior as his meltdown continues. He attempts suicide a few months later, but is saved by his groundskeeper.

After seeing the movie ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'', Whitacre's delusional fantasy causes him to record and collect his conversations with FBI agents. Because he violated his immunity agreement with the government, Whitacre is charged with price-fixing along with the other ADM conspirators. Whitacre's attorney, James Epstein, successfully convinces the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] officials that the government was culpable for Whitacre's behavior as he was emotionally unprepared for the case. Epstein manages to get a very light sentence for Whitacre. However, Whitacre, unwilling to serve any jail time, fires Epstein.

At his trial, Whitacre is convicted and receives a federal prison sentence three times longer than the other conspirators. Whitacre's FBI handlers, along with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], attempt to obtain a [[presidential pardon]] for Whitacre. With remarkable support from the FBI and his wife, Whitacre recovers from his mental problems and, after leaving prison, is promoted to COO and president of a California biotechnology company.&lt;ref name="News Blaze"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writers |title=Mark Whitacre, Ph.D. Promoted at Cypress Systems, Inc. and a Warner Bros.

'''''The Tale of the Four Dervishes''''' ({{lang-fa|قصه چهار درویش}} '''''Qissa-ye Chahār Darvēsh'''''; known in [[Urdu]] as '''''Bāgh-o Bahār''''' ({{Nastaliq|باغ و بہار}}, "Garden and Spring")) is a collection of allegorical stories by [[Amir Khusro]] written in [[Persian language|Persian]] in the early 13th century.

While legend says that Amir Khusro was the author, the tales were written long after his death.  Legend has it that [[Amir Khusro]]'s master and [[Sufi]] saint [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] had fallen ill.  To cheer him up, [[Amir Khusro]] started telling him a series of stories in the style of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.  By the end of the stories, [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] had recovered, and prayed that anyone who listened to these stories would also be cured.

==Style==
The book is in some ways similar to the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' in its method of framing and linking unfinished stories within each other. The central character is a king, Azad Bakht, who falls into depression after thinking about his own mortality, and so sets out from his palace seeking wise men. He comes upon four [[dervish]]es in a cemetery, and listens to their fantastical stories. Each Dervish narrates his own story, which is basically on love and fidelity in their own past lives. When the fourth dervish finishes his tale, the king Azadbakht suddenly learns that one of his wives has just born the son to him. Overwhelmed with joy, the king orders to arrange a great feast. With the help of the great king of jinns, Malik Syahpal, Azadbakht marries all the separated lovers to one another: the merchant’s son from Yemen to the princess of Damsyik, the prince of Fars to the princess of Basra, the prince of Ajam to the princess of Farang, the prince of Nimroz to the princess of jinns, and the prince of China to the daughter of the courtier, who was kidnapped by Malik Sadik. Everyone happily achieves the fulfilment of his or her desire

==Translations==
These stories were originally written in [[Persian Language|Persian]] by [[Amir Khusro]] as ''Qissa-ye Chahār Darvēsh'' (''The Tale of the Four Dervishes'').  It was initially translated by [[Mir Husain Ata Tehseen]] into [[Urdu language|Urdu]] as [[Nau Tarz-e-Murassa]] but the language was a highly literate one and was not understood by general public to enjoy.  In 1801, [[College of Fort William]] in Calcutta started a project translating Indian literature.  Mr. [[John Borthwick Gilchrist]], a famous scholar of literature, asked [[Mir Amman]], an employee of the college, to translate it into the [[Urdu]] language.  Mir Amman translated it from [[Persian Language|Persian]] into everyday [[Urdu]], under the title ''Bāgh o Bahār'' (''The Garden and the Spring Season'').  Later, in 1857, [[Duncan Forbes (linguist)|Duncan Forbes]] retranslated it into English.  The translation of Mir Amman is still enjoyed as a classical work of [[Urdu Literature]] for the common daily language of its time.

'''''The Temptation of St. Anthony''''' is a painting of disputed authorship, attributed to either [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or a follower. It is currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid.

==History==
The work was in the [[El Escorial|Escorial]] monastery, although it was not mentioned in inventories; later it was moved to the Prado. It is likely that the work was one of the ''Temptations'' sent to the monastery by [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1574. This painting has a more serene atmosphere than the [[triptych]] with the same theme now in the [[National Museum of Ancient Art|Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]] of [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book |first=Franca |last=Varallo |title=Bosch |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all Bosch's works, it cannot be dated with precision, although it is likely from his late production (1500–1516).&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt;

In 2016, the Bosch Research and Conservation project, after five years of researching all known Bosch paintings, announced that they had significant doubts about the attribution of the work to Bosch, instead attributing it to a follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/arts/design/prado-museum-rescinds-loan-of-downgraded-hieronymus-bosch-works.html|title = Prado Museum Rescinds Loan of Downgraded Hieronymus Bosch Works|last = Siegal|first = Nina|date = 2016-02-16|newspaper = The New York Times|issn = 0362-4331|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:J. Bosch Prado Temptation of St Anthony (detail).jpg|thumb|240px|left|Detail]]
[[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony the Abbot]] is portrayed in meditation, in a sunny landscape near the trunk of a dry tree. St. Anthony is a recurrent figure in Bosch's work, with up to 15 paintings of this subject, all inspired by legends told in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and in his ''Life'' by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. He is represented in a setting of solitude and temptation that the saint experienced over twenty years. Although this picture is significantly different from other works by Bosch of St. Anthony, such as the triptych painting of the same name, customary features of the abbot include his dark brown habit with the Greek letter "[[tau]]" and a pig by his side.&lt;ref name="Museodelprado"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Temptation of Saint Anthony |accessdate=2015-06-14 |publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado |location=Madrid, Spain |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-temptation-of-saint-anthony/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kren |first1=Emil |last2=Marx |first2=Daniel |url=http://www.wga.hu/html/b/bosch/5panels/07anthon.html |title=The Temptation of St Anthony |website=The Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the earlier paintings with St. Anthony, this version of the temptation of St. Anthony finds the abbot calmer from his meditative spirit. His surroundings are peaceful and evoke a sense of calm. The pig lies next to him like a pet. Once demons, the creatures of temptation are now more like goblins and do not disturb the peaceful feeling of the painting.

This painting, originally framed with a semi-circular arch, was one of Bosch's later works, from sometime after 1490. [[Philip II of Spain]] sent it to the Monastery of El Escorial near Madrid. From there the painting came to the Museo del Prado as part of the Royal Collection.&lt;ref name="Museodelprado" /&gt;
