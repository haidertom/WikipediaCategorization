'''''A Mediterranean Port''''' or '''''A Sea Port by Moonlight''''' refers to two 1771 paintings of the same subject by the French painter [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]. They are now in the [[Museo Soumaya]] in [[Mexico City]] and the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Palhares Meza, Héctor (junio de 2010). «Regalo de Luis XV a su bella y joven amante: Puerto mediterráneo de Claude-Joseph Vernet». Revistas Museo Soumaya (México: Museo Soumaya-Fundación Carso): 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The two paintings form part of a series of fifteen works by Vernet showing port scenes. It was commissioned by [[Madame du Barry]], who was trying to replace [[Madame de Pompadour]] as the greatest art patron among [[Louis XIV]]'s lovers. Vernet was one of a circle of artists which gathered around du Barry. The paintings were intended for a pavilion at the [[Chateau de Louveciennes]]. They resemble the same painter's ''Night: Mediterranean Coastal Scene with Fishermen and Boats'' (1753).

Schreiber Publishing ({{ISBN|1-887563-55-5}}), p. 45 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in Bonn, London and Stockholm. She studied in Stockholm and at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] in London, where her teachers included Vera Rozsa.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/05/classicalmusicandopera.proms2005 | title=Super von trouper | work=The Guardian | author=Stephen Moss | date=2005-08-05 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her professional operatic début in 1983 at the [[Basel Opera]], as Alcina in [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''[[Orlando paladino]]''.

== Career ==
Her recording of Grieg songs won the 1993 ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' Record of the Year, the first time in the award's history that it had gone to a song recording. In 2001, she released her album with [[Elvis Costello]], ''For the Stars'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/21/arts/worlds-mezzo-pop-star-meet-somewhere-between-anne-sofie-von-otter-fresh-start.html | title=Worlds of Mezzo and Pop Star Meet Somewhere in Between; Anne Sofie von Otter: Fresh Start | work=The New York Times | author=Neil Strauss | date=2001-05-21 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which she won an [[Edison Award]]. She was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo]] [[57th Annual Grammy Awards|in 2015]] for her album of French songs, ''Douce France''. She is a regular recital and recording partner with Swedish pianist [[Bengt Forsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/09/arts/music-review-von-otter-from-lieder-to-blues.html | title=Music Review: Von Otter, From Lieder to Blues | work=The New York Times | author=Anthony Tommasini | date=1998-05-09 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/19/arts/music/vibrant-singing-at-the-nice-price.html | title=Vibrant Singing at the Nice Price |work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]| date=2005-04-19 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/arts/music/05otte.html | title=Resilience of the Human Spirit, in Song | work=The New York Times | author=Steve Smith | date=2009-05-04 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, von Otter sang the Evangelist in the premiere of [[Sven-David Sandström]]'s ''[[Ordet – en passion]]''. Other work in contemporary music has included singing the role of The Woman in ''Senza Sangue'' of [[Péter Eötvös]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/arts/music/review-a-peter-eotvos-premiere-and-schubert-at-the-new-york-philharmonic.html|title=Review: A Peter Eotvos Premiere and Schubert at the New York Philharmonic|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=[[Anthony Tommasini]]|date=2015-05-10| accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other media, she appeared in the film ''[[A Late Quartet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/movies/a-late-quartet-directed-by-yaron-zilberman.html | title=The Strings Play On; The Bonds Tear Apart | work=The New York Times | author=Stephen Holden | date=2012-11-01 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she released an album of music written by composers imprisoned in the Nazi "model" ghetto of [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] (also known as Terezin) prior to their transportation to the death camp of Auschwitz. She collaborated on this project with [[Christian Gerhaher]] (baritone) and chamber musicians. She has stated that the material has special personal meaning for her as her father had attempted unsuccessfully during the war to spread information that he had received from SS officer [[Kurt Gerstein]] about the Nazi death camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://forward.com/culture/11634/a-different-aria-00490/ | title=A Different Aria | work=Forward | author=David Bartal | date=2007-09-17 | accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She created the principal role of Charlotte in [[Sebastian Fagerlund]]'s 2017 opera ''Autumn Sonata'', based on the [[Autumn Sonata|1979 film]] by [[Ingmar Bergman]] at the [[Finnish National Opera]] in Helsinki conducted by [[John Storgårds]].&lt;ref&gt;Dammann, Guy. The brilliant sound of gnawing anxiety. ''[[Financial Times]]'', Friday 15 September 2017, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">'''Arca Totok Kerot''' or '''Recå Thothokkerot''' IPA: [rətʃɔ ʈɔʈɔʔ kərɔt] is a statue (Jav. ''arcå'' or ''recå'' means "statue") located in Bulusari Village, Pagu District, [[Kediri Regency]], Indonesia; about 2 kilometers north-east of Simpang Lima Gumul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diskominfo.kedirikab.go.id/web/situs-arca-totok-kerot.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915173330/http://diskominfo.kedirikab.go.id/web/situs-arca-totok-kerot.html |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of [[andesite]] stone, depicting a giant with a terrifying face. The style is of a [[dvarapala]]. Based on the style, it is suggested that it was made in the 10th century.

==Physical features==
The face and other ornaments also suggest that it is a representation of a female ''butå''.&lt;ref&gt;ogre, demon, or giant&lt;/ref&gt; This is unusual since most dvarapala statues show male characteristics. Arca Totok Kerot is 3 meters tall.

The hair is matted, covering the upper part of the back. A kind of tiara with a glimpse of skull is seen above forehead, covering also the ears. The eyes are protruding, creating a terrifying effect, as if it were angry.

Like many other dvarapala statues, it kneels on one knee. The left knee touches the ground while the right knee is erected, on which the right hand is laid. The left hand is missing, so it is unknown if it originally held a ''gådå'' (mace) like other dvarapala statues. All hands and legs are wearing ''binggêl'' (bracelets).

The nipples are clearly shown on the breast, another indication that it is female. It wears a necklace of skulls, usually worn by worshippers of [[Durga]] or [[Shiva]]. A girdle is encircling its waist, on which some kind of skirt is hanging.

==Discovery and excavation==

The statue was discovered in 1981.

In 2013, due to an imminent plan by the local government to enlarge the road near Arca Totok Kerot, an excavation was hastily carried out searching for other archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;http://surabaya.tribunnews.com/2013/02/17/tak-ada-temuan-benda-purbakala-di-totok-kerot&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was conducted by East Java Hall of Cultural Heritage Preservation (''Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya Jawa Timur''). The possibility was considered because [[dvarapala]] statues were usually placed to guard a temple complex or other important sites.

The excavation took place for six days. The team dug with average 1.5 meters into the surrounding ground, in some points even 4 meters. However, no other archaeological remains were found. Eventually the excavation was terminated and the cavities were filled. The road in front of the statue was then enlarged.

==Folklore related to the statue==

Tales were abound surrounding the statue. Some were already documented and many others were still transmitted orally. Some tales related the statue to the legendary character [[Calon Arang]], but such connection was refuted by Timoer (1981). Others were connected to the legendary king [[Jayabaya]] (Santosa, 2005).

An '''aromachologist''' is a person who practices [[aromachology]], which is a method of using smells or [[essential oil]]s to create, either in isolation or through blending in formulations, essential oils that have behavioral, physical and emotional benefits. Smell is the least studied of the senses, but aromachology is being used increasingly in [[healthcare]] and building science, and also in the world of sports and in practical matters such as real estate sales.

While all aromachologists have a refined sense of smell, some employ other senses including sight, sound and hearing. These are [[Synesthesia|synesthetes]] and history documents famous synesthetes such as the British painter [[David Hockney]], the Russian artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]], the Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]] and the English poet [[William Blake]].

An aromachologist is a person who studies the effects of fragrance on human psychology and behavior and works with essential oils for their positive effects on behavior and feeling. An aromachologist is a practitioner of aromachology, which is a term coined in 1982 by the Olfactory Research Fund, now known as the [[Sense of Smell Institute]], a division of the Fragrance Foundation, which has funded numerous medical, university and individual studies on the effects of scents on sleep and performance. Aromachology differs from [[aromatherapy]].

An aromachologist is a formulator who works with essential oils for their aromatic and physical effects and is an expert in the way essential oils can be blended and articulated together to create “behavioral fragrances”&lt;ref&gt;Damian, Kate,'' Aromatherapy: Scent and Psyche'', page 120, 1995, Healing Arts Press, USA, {{ISBN|0-89281-530-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish the positive effects of aromas on human behavior including feelings and emotions.

The aims of aromachology are to “study the interrelationship of psychology and the latest in fragrance technology and to transmit through odor a variety of specific feelings (such as relaxation, exhilaration, sensuality, happiness and achievement) directly to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Lis-Balchin, ''Aromatherapy Science: A Guide for Healthcare Professionals'', page 3, 2006, Pharmaceutical Press, Publications Division of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, {{ISBN|0-85369-578-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When odors activate the [[olfactory]] pathways that lead to the [[limbic]] portion of the brain they trigger the release of [[neurotransmitters]] that affect the brain and mental state of the individual in a variety of ways. Further, stimuli transmitted to the limbic system cannot be consciously blocked and all olfactory stimuli therefore influence our [[emotion]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Smell as a sense is the last frontier of neuroscience and has not been studied in as much depth as vision and hearing. The brain is able to process small differences in smell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070428094824.htm "Brain Processes Sense of Smell Better Than Previously Thought"] "Science Daily", April 30, 2007, retrieved  2009-12-3&lt;/ref&gt; and the sense of smell may last longer in the aging process than sight and hearing. The olfactory bulb is that portion of the brain which processes smells information and its oscillations alter dynamically according to the tasks involved.

==Synesthesia==
There are some people who process smells differently, hearing them as sounds. Canadian aromachologist, Nadine Artemis, author and formulator for Living Libations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livinglibations.com&lt;/ref&gt; is one such [[Synesthesia|synestheste]].{{Failed verification|date=February 2010}}

When Artemis picks up a scent, she also sees colors. Therefore, when she is creating in aromachology, she is not only combining a palette of smells, she is also mixing a palette of colors to blend the purest, organic essential oils into an array of beneficial products. For example, when Artemis sniffs tainted or synthetic fragrances, she sees them as murky gray or muddy brown. Discovering this extraordinary sense of smell at a young age, Artemis sees different distillations of rose, one of the world’s most expensive essential oils, as hues and tones of pink and red. Calming chamomile comes across in hues varying from oceanic teals to deep royal blues.

==Universal synesthesia==
It is believed that we all possess a small degree of [[synesthesia]]&lt;ref&gt;Vintini, Leonardo,[https://archive.is/20130204100533/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/science-technology/synesthetic-synesthesia-patricia-duffy-dr-jamie-ward-dr-richard-cytowic-5912.html "We Could All Be a Little Synesthetic"], ''Epoch Times'', October 20, 2008, updated November 28, 2009, retrieved 2009-11-30&lt;/ref&gt; according to Dr Jamie Ward &amp;mdash; quality of intermixing images, sounds and other sensations. The Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]] is believed to have employed four senses of touch, smell, color and sound.

There are many instances of literature that may have portrayed synesthesia. For example, the famous poet [[William Blake]] (1757–1827) was probably a synesthete. In his poem “Wild Flower Song”, he writes: 
:As I wander'd the forest,
:The green leaves among,
:I heard a wild flower
:Singing a song

In the book ''Perfume'' by [[Patrick Süskind]], the main character, Grenouille, is born with a hyper-acute sense of smell but lacks his own bodily scent. He goes on a life quest, including many murders, to recreate the scent of innocence he sniffed on a beautiful girl.

==Effects of aromachology==

Studies have been conducted to show that those parts of the brain which govern alertness and concentration can be influenced positively or negatively by the olfactory substances used. [[Jasmine]] in a testing room enhanced the problem-solving cognitive skills of participants and also led to them demonstrating more interest and motivation for the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Rottman"&gt;Rottman, T. R. (1989). The effects of ambient odor on the cognitive performance, mood, and activation, of low and high impulsive individuals in a naturally arousing situation. ''Diss. Abstr. Int.'' 50:365B 1989&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of [[eucalyptus]], [[peppermint oil]] and [[ethanol]] has been shown to improve cognitive performance, and after a monotonous stressful task experimental subjects were shown to demonstrate greater motivation after being exposed to a blend of peppermint, [[bergamot essential oil|bergamot]], [[sandalwood]] and [[lavender]].&lt;ref name="Rottman"/&gt;

==Role of an aromachologist==

Pleasant aromas cause people to linger longer, a boon to [[retail]] stores, museums, spas and [[casino]]s. Pleasant smells have been shown to improve productivity, and improve physical performance, with athletes running faster, doing more pushups, and experiencing shorter recovery time after an extensive workout when the room was scented with either [[peppermint]] or [[lemon]].&lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, B., Corley, N., &amp; Eppich, W., Pages 156-160. Augmenting athletic performance through the administration of peppermint odor. ''Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology'', 23,(2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

By blending specific smells, an aromachologist can create a more restful environment and improve health conditions. A study in 1987&lt;ref name="Kempski"&gt;Kempski, Diotoma von, Page 63, "The Use of Olfactory Stimulants to Improve Air Quality", ''Journal of the Human Environmental System'', Vol 5; No.2 61-68, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the smells found in [[nutmeg oil]], maize extract, neroli oil, valerian oil, myristici, soelemcin and [[elemicin]] reduce stress in humans as well as reducing stress-related high blood pressure. The Mind Lab, an independent consultancy in the UK, studies the odor of a building as part of research on the brain’s responses to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;McCooey, Christopher, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3ac8eac6-cf93-11dc-854a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 Scenting Success], ''Financial Times'', Feb 02 2008, retrieved 2009-10-03&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate brokers have been recommending to their clients to have smells of freshly baked cookies or the aroma of coffee in the house when it is being presented to potential buyers to create a sense of home. By bottling and releasing appropriate smells to evoke comfort, safety and joy, an owner may be able to accelerate the sale of a house.

Worker productivity can be enhanced by improving the quality of air in a building, not just by removing the negative pollutants, but also by introducing through ventilation or air conditioning systems olfactory stimulation]s to get a mix of ventilated air and odor.

It is necessary to ensure that the dosage is such that the odor is not excessive and should be kept just above the detection level. Also, these olfactory substances are very different from perfume and should instead replicate the smell of natural outdoor air.&lt;ref name="Kempski"/&gt;

A skilled aromachologist can concoct combinations of oils to reduce [[road rage]], reduce fatigue and improve concentration while driving.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Peppermint decreases anxiety and fatigue while driving, and in combination with [[cinnamon]] it reduces the level of frustration encountered in traffic and also heightens alertness.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Jasmine is used as a sleep aid and the scent of [[vanilla]] is useful for those who want to cut the craving for sweets after lunch.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Linda, http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200711/the-hidden-force-fragrance?page=2, ''Psychology Today'', Nov 21 1008, Retrieved 2009-10-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beast of Bladenboro''' refers to the creature responsible for a string of deaths amongst [[Bladenboro, North Carolina]] animals in the winter of 1953-54. According to witnesses and trackers it was likely a [[wildcat]], but the uncertain nature of its identity lends itself to speculation. According to reports, the entity was known to most commonly crush or decapitate its victims, which were mostly dogs.

==Deaths==
Possibly related to the Bladenboro incidents, a dog was found dead in [[Clarkton, North Carolina]] (about eight miles from Bladenboro), killed by what Police Chief Roy Fores reported witnesses as describing as "sleek, black, about 5 feet long...." on December 29, 1953.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"&gt;('Vampire' Charges Woman, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, two dogs belonging to a Bladenboro man named Johnny Vause were found dead. There was reportedly a significant amount of blood at the scene near their kennels.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 4"&gt;(Mystery Beast Slays Dogs of Bladenboro, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; The two dogs were "torn into ribbons and crushed," according to Vause.
{{quotation | My dogs put up a good fight. There was blood all over the porch, big puddles of it. And there was a pool of saliva on the porch. It killed one dog at 10:30 and left it lying there. My dad wrapped the dog up in a blanket. That thing came back and got that dog and nobody's seen the dog since. At 1:30 in the morning, it came back and killed the other dog and took it off. We found it three days later in a hedgerow. The top of one of the dogs heads was torn off and its body was crushed and wet, like it had been in that thing's mouth. The other dog's lower jaw was torn off.&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"/&gt;|Johnny Vause}}
On the next day, January 1, 1954, two more dogs were found dead in Bladenboro at Woodie Storm's farm. One was "sort of eaten up," according to a witness.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 4"/&gt;

On the night of January 2, a farmer named Gary Callahan reported that a dog of his had been killed.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

Two more dogs were found dead on January 3. One of the dogs was autopsied, and according to Police Chief Roy Fores "...there wasn't more than two or three drops of blood in him [...] The victim's bottom lip had been broken open and his jawbone smashed back." Fores also said of the dogs found dead so far, "The ear of one dog was gnawed off and the tongues of two had been chewed out."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"&gt;(Vampire Tendencies Found In Bladenboro's 'Monsters', 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Charlotte News'', on the night of the 5th a pet rabbit was found "cleanly decapitated and still warm."&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"&gt;(The Beast Of Bladenboro - They All Know 'It'll Come Back', 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 7, a dead dog was found in a pasture near the Bladenboro swamp.&lt;ref name="WN Jan 8"&gt;(Fresh Dogs Seek 'Beast' At Bladenboro, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian "Tater" Shaw, who owned a local gas station, heard that a goat had died in a strange way and traveled to the edge of town to see for himself. According to him, "His head was flat as a fritter [...] it had a great big ol' track... It was weird." Shaw also claimed that whatever killed the goat killed cows and hogs.&lt;ref name = "SN Oct 2006"&gt;(The Beast Of Bladenboro, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encounters and descriptions==
Resident Malcolm Frank reported seeing the animal crossing the street. He described it as "about four and a half feet long, bushy, and resembling either a [[bear]] or a [[Panthera|panther]]," according to the January 4 edition of the ''Wilmington Morning Star''.&lt;ref name = "WMS Jan 4"/&gt; A son of a Bladenboro man named Carl Pate reported seeing the monster as well on the night of January 3. According to him, "it was small, and a little one just like it was running beside it."  A third sighting on January 3rd was reported by James Pittman: "[...] about 11:00 o'clock I heard a strange noise outside my window, like a baby crying." He went outside to follow the noise for "close to a mile [...] I saw bushes moving, but I never did actually see whatever it was. However, I think it must have been close to 150-pounds, the way it went through the bushes."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"/&gt;

Around 8 o'clock in the evening on January 4, Lloyd Clemmons claims to have seen the beast. The following account, reported in the ''Wilmington Morning Star'', contains a physical description.

{{quotation | I got two dogs, Niggy, the little black one, and Peewee, a brown one, that's bigger. Me and my wife were sitting here in the living room. We heard the dogs get awful restless. My front light was on and Larry Moore [...] had his back light on. I glanced out the window and saw this thing. It had me plumb spellbound. It was bout 20 inches high. It had a long tail, about 14 inches. The color of it was dark. It had a face exactly like a cat. Only I ain't ever seen a cat that big. It was walking around stealthy, sneaky, moving about trying to get to Niggy and Peewee. I jumped for my shotgun and loaded it and went out to shoot it, but it moved into the darkness right away and I couldn't find him again.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 6"&gt;(Bladen Beast Still Prowls, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; }}A group of hunters from Wilmington including S. W. Garret, G. V. Garret, and Joe Gore spent that night tracking the creature for three miles around swampland. According to them, the tracks showed claws at least an inch long and indicated an 80&amp;nbsp;lb. to 90&amp;nbsp;lb. animal. The beast's circling movement suggested it might have had offspring or a mate nearby, the hunters said.&lt;ref name = "RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

During the early hours of January 5, Chief Fores and one D.G. Pait witnessed the beast attacking a dog from a hundred or so feet away. According to them, the dog ran away, yelping, and was not found. Pait also reported seeing tracks along a creek bank near one of the attack sites. He said that there were two sets of prints, and one was smaller.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 6"/&gt; Later that day, in the early evening, Mrs. C. E. Kinlaw went to her front porch upon hearing whimpering dogs. She saw what she described as looking like "a big [[mountain lion]]" near the dogs, three houses down. The creature ran toward her, but turned and fled when she screamed. Outside her home, the tracks left in the dirt road were "bigger than a silver dollar" according to Police Chief Fores.&lt;ref name = "RNO Jan 6"/&gt; {{quotation | After we first saw it, and my husband [scared it away], it circled back and came running toward the porch where I was standing. I screamed and it stopped on all fours, turned and ran off. [...] You know, the Bible speaks of sights and wonders before the end of time. This could be one of them. The Bible's coming true, day by day.&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"/&gt;|C. E. Kinlaw}}

A young boy named Dalton Norton reported seeing what he called "a big cat" on January 6. According to him: "We heard a noise on the porch [...] whatever it was made a noise like a baby crying. It jumped off the porch and I watched it through the window. It went over to one house, then went off towards another and I didn't see it anymore."&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"/&gt;

On January 11, two cars stopped for an animal reported to be four feet long. Jeff Evers, one of the men in the cars, was quoted as saying the animal had "runty-looking ears" and being "brownish and tabby." Fores said the animal "really upset the women. They were wringing their hands and like that."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 12]"&gt;(Beast Takes Stroll; Frightens Autoists, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunt for the Beast==
[[File:Davis's Bobcat and Mayor Fussell.png|thumbnail|left|Luther Davis and Mayor Woodrow Fussell next to the bobcat Davis trapped.]]
The night of January 3, Police Chief Roy Fores searched for the creature with his dogs, but they reportedly would not follow the trail.&lt;ref name="WN Jan 4"&gt;(Mysterious Beast Still At Large, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

"A half-dozen brave youths" and their dogs spent January 4 searching for the creature responsible for the deaths. That night, Police Chief Roy Fores and eight to ten other officers conducted their own hunt.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"/&gt; Hunters who traveled to Bladenboro from Wilmington also searched for the beast that evening, reportedly tracking it for 3 miles around the swamp.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

On the night of January 5, more than 500 people and dogs hunted through the woods and swamps for the creature.&lt;ref name="RNO Jan 6"/&gt;

On January 6, more than 800 people turned out to hunt for the beast in the swamps. Fores planned to tie up dogs as bait to lure the creature in. This particular plan was called off, and the hunt itself was also ended by officials as safety became a concern.&lt;ref name="WN Jan 7"&gt;(Hunters, Dogs Tracking Bladen Mystery Killer, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, another 800 to 1,000 people gathered to hunt the creature.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 8"&gt;(Monster Strikes Again, Slays Dog, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the evening of the 8th, four fraternity brothers from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] were the only reported hunters. Mayor Fussell officially called off the hunt unless the creature made another obvious kill or there was a legitimate sighting. The armed hunting parties of previous nights had become too large for safety, and Fores received a telegram from a humane society in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] protesting his plan to stake out dogs as bait for the creature.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 9"&gt;(Vampire Beast Wins Battle Of Bladenboro, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Amy Hotz for ''Star News'', Julian "Tater" Shaw recalled, "Everybody was scared. Everybody, near ‘bout, that had a gun was carrying it. [...] Anyhow, it was getting so bad, it was getting in the newspapers and the radio [...] There came hunters from all over, I mean big hunters." Another gas station owner, Jabe Frink, said the panic "[...] kept snowballing and snowballing. It got so nobody would walk out on the street at night."&lt;ref name="SN Oct 2006"/&gt;

Luther Davis, a local farmer, produced a dead [[bobcat]] on January 13. He found the bobcat struggling with a steel trap in Big Swamp, four miles from the city, at 6:00AM. He proceeded to shoot it in the head at about 8:30AM.&lt;ref name = "WMS Jan 14"&gt;(Bladen Man Traps Bobcat; Is It The Ferocious Beast?, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Woodrow Fussell, the mayor of Bladenboro, told newspapers that the beast of Bladenboro had been found and killed. According to Gallehugh, however, it was unlikely that such a small cat could have killed and mangled the dogs.&lt;ref name="Gallehugh"&gt;(Gallehugh, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Bruce Soles from Tabor City was leaving Bladenboro when he hit a cat with his vehicle. According to reports, it was "spotted like a leopard," about 20 to 24 inches high, and weighed between 75 and 90 pounds. He took the cat home with him to Tabor City.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 14"/&gt; Yet a third man is credited in some newspapers as having killed the animal. There are conflicting newspaper reports about whether it was Davis's or "professional hunter and guide" Berry Lewis's cat that Mayor Fussell photographed and sent out to the press. According to Corey, from ''The Carolina Farmer'', Lewis was hunting in a different part of Bladen county when he shot and killed his bobcat.&lt;ref name="CF 1958"&gt;(Is The Beast Dead?, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculation==
Many reported accounts describe the Beast of Bladenboro as feline, but do not agree on any one species.

Malcolm Frank described the animal as "[...] resembling either a [[bear]] or a [[Panthera|panther]]." Wilmington hunter S.W. Garrett claimed to have heard the creature scream while hunting, and likened it to that of a [[Panthera|panther]].&lt;ref name = "WMS Jan 7"&gt;(Guns, Dogs Circle Blood-Lusty Beast, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Davis, curator at the Raleigh State Museum, has said that a panther "[...] never occurs in this country [...] We've checked on panther stories before. One turned out to be a big house cat." He was of the opinion that it might have actually been a [[coyote]]: "[...] they've been traded around quite a bit, brought East as pets and released after owners got tired of them."&lt;ref name="CF 1958"/&gt;

James Pittman claimed the beast had tracks like those of a dog, but he also said "only I've never seen a dog that large." Chief Fores was also reported as believing the beast to be a mad [[wolf]]. He said that "old folks say they remember seeing wolves in the bay-swamp area and talk about them every now and then."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 5"/&gt;

C.E. Kinlaw described the creature as looking like "a big [[mountain lion]]" when it charged her on January 5. ('Mountain lion' is another name for '[[cougar]]'.)
The January 7 edition of ''The Bladen Journal'' reports that some people described the animal as likely being a [[wolverine]]. The article goes on to mention that there is speculation the creature may have been a "wild police dog."&lt;ref name="BJ Jan 7"&gt;(Hunt Animal Blamed With Killing Eight Dogs At Bladenboro In Week, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

The game warden of [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]], Sam Culberth, said that the tracks he investigated indicated a "[[catamount]]."&lt;ref name="CN Jan 7"/&gt; (This is yet another name for a [[cougar]].)

A.R. Stanton, a man from [[Lumberton, North Carolina]] thought that the beast of Bladenboro was a German Shepherd and Hound mix named "Big Boy" that he gave to a Native American boy who lived along the edge of Big Swamp. Big Boy was dark and had a "long, bushy tail." Stanton was quoted as saying: "I raised him from a pup [...] but if I met him in the woods I wouldn't call him I'd kill him." He claimed Big Boy was capable of leaping over a six-foot fence and killed chickens from time to time.&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 13"&gt;(Thinks Bladen Killer Dog He Gave Indian, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; Lumberton veterinarian N.G. Baird said, in regards to Big Boy, that it was "very feasible" he was responsible for the attacks. Baird also said that it was possible Big Boy (or another dog) could have killed the other dogs and lapped up blood, rather than sucking it.&lt;ref name="ROB Jan 13"&gt;('Vampire' Theory Fails To Draw Comment From Officer, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor of ''The Robesonian'', Daisy Morris claimed to have heard a wild panther years before, and remarked "a dog can't scream or cry like a baby - and I can testify that towns mean nothing to a hungry panther and certainly not to a mad panther."&lt;ref name="ROB Jan 14"&gt;(Screams Of Panther Recalled; Likened to Bladenboro Beast, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Literature about the events of the winter of 1953-54 tends towards skepticism, particularly because of the publicity involved for the town through the sensational news reports.

Mayor Woodrow Fussell, who operated the town theater, went to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] on January 6 to book the film [[The Big Cat (1949 film)|''The Big Cat'']] for a day. Leaflets published by the theater proclaimed "Now you can see the 'Cat.' We've got him on our screen! And in Technicolor too! 'The Big Cat.' All day Saturday, Jan 9."&lt;ref name="WMS Jan 8 2"&gt;(Enterprise!, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with John Corey, Fussell said that he believed the creature to be a hoax, even though he was the one who called the Wilmington newspapers about the dead dogs. He found the manner of their deaths strange, and said that "a little publicity never hurts a town." What he didn't anticipate however, was how far the ''Wilmington Morning Star'', ''The Wilmington News'', and other newspapers would take the story.
{{quotation | We had to do something. The town was armed to the teeth. Even small boys carried guns. Chief of Police Roy Fores and I knew someone would be shot accidentally. [...] The animal was about 90 percent imagination, 10 percent truth. Newspaper reporters labeled it 'The Beast of Bladenboro' and called it a vampire.|Woodrow Fussell, mayor of Bladenboro during the Beast of Bladenboro incident}}

Corey writes that a "one-arm sign painter" tailored his art to fit the sensationalism surrounding the incidents in 1954, making bumper plates proclaiming "Home of the Beast of Bladenboro."&lt;ref name="CF 1958"/&gt;

On the morning of December 15, 1954 on a tenant farm near Robeson Memorial Hospital, a man named Marvin McLamb found "five mediumsized pigs and three chickens" dead. According to ''The Robesonian'', "[...] strewn around a sty approximately 10 by 15 feet in area. The animals were mutilated and four had crushed skulls. Three of the pigs had legs torn apart from their bodies. Strangely enough, no blood was evident, indicating the killer employed the same blood-sucking traits as the Bladenboro beast."&lt;ref name="ROB Dec 15"&gt;('Beast Of Bladenboro' Type Killer Strikes In Robeson, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a stray dog weighing 65 pounds was killed. Carol Freeman, the County Dog Warden, said it was "most probably" the killer from the day before, even though the tracks found at the farm were not compared to the dead dog's, and it was not explained how the dog could have reached the chickens, who McLamb said were roosting in a tree. According to Dog Warden Raymond Kinlaw, the feeding of raw meat to pet dogs "[...] definitely would cause a dog to become blood thirsty."&lt;ref name="ROB Dec 16"&gt;('Beast Of Bladenboro' Scare Ends In Death Of Large Dog, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boost The 'Boro, a community booster for Bladenboro, holds an annual "Beast Fest" in which the Beast of Bladenboro (or 'BOB', as they call him) serves as mascot. Boost The 'Boro makes use of the beast's sensational history amongst locals to generate excitement for the community event.&lt;ref name="Hester"&gt;(Hester, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

He becomes attracted to local girl Polly (Jaylene Riley) and, upon learning that Floyd is still involved in criminal activities, decides to leave and visit his mother. Determined to stay out of trouble, Doug buys back his father's old property, Yetticup, which has [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia|traditional roots]].

An '''architectural brief''' is a statement of a client's requirements, which form the basis for appointing an [[architect]]. The brief describes the requirements that need to be reconciled and accommodated, and is developed first as a design which is submitted for approval, and subsequently constructed as a building or other structure. A brief is a written document that might be anything from a single page to a multiple volume set of documents. 
The term '''program''' is often used today, in conjunction with, and in part as a [[synonym]] of, an "architectural brief". "Program" is used more often in the United States whereas 'brief' is used more outside the United States, internationally. An architect's design is considered the response to the building program.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/o/ogorman-abc.html |title=ABC of Architecture |last1=O'Gorman |first1=James |date=1998 |work=New York Times |access-date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the brief==
The architectural brief is often formulated by, or in collaboration with, the architect. It often includes [[SWOT analysis|opportunities assessed, constraints identified]] and needs for further investigation clarified.

In the early stages of the design process the brief may be continuously reappraised as the requirements become clearer - this is known as 'firming up the brief'. Ultimately, a clear set of instructions setting out the overarching goals and  detailed requirements will emerge which form the starting point of the architect's designs and will be continually tested against, as designs are progressed.

==Schedule of accommodation==
In the later stages of writing a brief, a '''schedule of accommodation''' is sometimes drawn up that will specify precisely the number and size of rooms that will be required, the relationships between rooms and groups of rooms, the finishes, equipment, furniture that will fit the room for its functional purpose and the environmental conditions that will assist the purpose. Environmental conditions might include temperature range, humidity, air movement, acoustic isolation, etc..The schedule of accommodation is prepared by an expert to help in determining the minimum space required on site to develop and finish a given design .The schedule of accommodation is guided by the brief analysis of every space since every space have set standards and requirement.

==Complex briefs==
For complex facilities, the brief may be prepared by a specialist consultant, separate from the design architect. In such projects, workshops are often employed with project participants: owners, users, customers, [[Facility management|facility experts]], [[General contractor|builders/contractors]] and other designers brought together for an intensive one- or two-day period to devise the critical aspects of the brief.

If the brief will provide a large number of similar spaces, for example, in a hospital, then room/space 'types' might be defined, as a type of 'space dictionary' that is then used to inform room or space groupings. These space groupings are then assembled into related sets of rooms to meet a functional or service requirement. The critical component of the related sets is that the interactions between rooms are set out, with details as to the type of interaction. For example, if escorted patients, beds and medical equipment are to be moved, or if individuals or groups of people will move between spaces, the architect's design will need to acknowledge the different design responses to be made.

The information used to assemble a 'space dictionary' can be quite detailed, with a schedule produced that lists, for each room, parameters, the requirement against the parameter, and any particular performance needs.

Parameters might include: population (median and peak), area, minimum height, floor [[Structural load|loading]], [[Flooring#Flooring materials|floor finish]] and [[Skirting board|skirting]] requirements, including any plinths, hobs or set-downs, wall finishes, including wall protection needs (pertinent in hospitals, warehouses, etc.), ceiling finish, including acoustic needs, engineering services required: power, lighting, [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]], water, drainage, communications, etc.; environmental conditions: air temperature, humidity, noise level, air movement; access and security needs; FFE (furniture, fittings and equipment), with note made of mass, dimensions, power requirements, energy evolved, noise produced, ventilation and extraction needed, service and operating clearances; fire safety.

A thorough brief will start with a definition of the services or functions to be accommodated, decomposing these functions into specific sub-functions and then to activities. A '[[functional brief]]' is thus compiled. This brief is used to, in turn, create the architectural brief, that sets out the accommodation specifics for preparation of design options.

==Evaluation==
For critical facilities, the [[project manager]] or owner may require the architect to validate the design against the brief, producing a report that shows in tabular form, how and where, the design meets the brief. This avoids misunderstanding of drawings that can arise when non-experts are asked to review them. A graphical validation might include demonstration of the movement expected between spaces, and show how a proximity diagram is modeled onto the design layout.

The '''Chipstone Foundation''' is a [[Wisconsin]]-based foundation dedicated to promoting American decorative arts scholarship. Originating from the private collection of Stanley and Polly Stone, the foundation uses its objects and resources to support decorative arts projects and publications at other institutions, seeking to find "newer ways to look at old things.".&lt;ref&gt;Chipstone Foundation website, www.chipstone.org, March 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1999, the Chipstone Foundation partnered with the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], thereby making many of Chipstone's significant holdings on view for public display.

The Chipstone Foundation publishes two significant annual scholarly journals: ''American Furniture'' and ''Ceramics in America''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chipstone.org/framesetpublications.html The Chipstone Journals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107102445/http://www.chipstone.org/framesetpublications.html |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also has an association with the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Together they created an academic program that explores multiple approaches to the study of American material culture by bringing together scholars from other departments at the University, including history, art, African studies, design, and literature.

A '''creative director''' is a position often found within the [[graphic design]], [[film]], [[music]], [[video game industry|video game]], [[fashion]], [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], or [[Show business|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well.

A creative director is a vital role in all of the arts and entertainment industries. In another sense, they can be seen as another element in any product development process. The creative director may also assume the roles of an art director, copywriter, or lead designer. The responsibilities of a creative director include leading the communication design, interactive design, and concept forward in any work assigned. For example, this responsibility is often seen in industries related to advertisement. The creative director is known to guide a team of employees with skills and experience related to graphic design, fine arts, motion graphics, and other creative industry fields. Some example works can include visual layout, brainstorming, and copywriting. To assume the role of a creative director, one must already have an existing set of skills and expertise in many areas. Often, these types of artists start up from the very beginning in fields that can relate to motion graphics, advertisement in television, and/or book (or magazine) publishing.

==Communication design==

===Advertising===
In the advertising industry, a creative director is determined to develop various marketing schemes and strategies for a company or client that he or she is hired by. Assuming one is hired by a company that is fairly well known and established, there would be some type of creative department or management that the director would work with. The creative director would also serve as the project manager that works directly with employers, and in most circumstances, they would be responsible for designing concepts for advertisements and other promotional needs for their client(s). Some examples of their duties involve [[copywriting]] and laying out chronological advertisement plans which explain the ongoing process of a project. It is important for an advertisement creative director to meet their goals at specific deadline with maximum efficiency as possible. To do so, they must be able to guide the creative department effectively from start to finish. Educational requirements of this position involve a blending of skills in business and journalism. To even be considered as a creative director, one would need to have a couple of years of experience in advertising (as little as five to as many as ten years).&lt;ref&gt;"Advertising Creative Director Job Description, Salary, and Training Information." 300+ Job Descriptions: Find Your Dream Job in 2011. N.p., n.d. Web. 1 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.jobdescriptions.net/business/advertising-creative-director/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copy writing or art directing positions. Familiarity with film-making techniques is also common. Creative directors rise to become executive creative directors or chief creative officers, a position with executive responsibility for the entire creative department, and some progress to chairman of a firm.

Creative directors usually possess a [[communication design]] or [[fine art]]s &amp; animation degree. Copywriters may have degrees in [[journalism]], [[language arts]], or media innovation, or may develop more emphasis on advertising copy writing while pursuing a communication design degree.

==Video games==
{{main|Video game producer}}
With the increased team sizes and more specialised disciplines in the games industry, certain game designers are titled as 'creative director', 'executive designer', or 'game director'. A creative director in a video game company is usually responsible for product development across a number of titles and is generally regarded as the prime design authority across the company's product range. Some examples are [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Sam Lake]], [[Neil Druckmann]], or [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] whose influence extends across more than one project.

The creative director has an important responsibility in this industry. The director must devise ideas to lead a video game project forward and many responsibilities involve working with various individuals or teams spread out within the entire project/video game production. This can include cross-functional collaboration with the various disciplines involved in games development. Academically speaking, a creative director is usually degree educated but there are some circumstances where a high school education strongly focusing on aspects such as art, graphics, [[computer science]], and math can be acceptable and provide some valuable insight to students who hope to aspire in this field of work. Some skills that a creative director working in the video game industry may have include proficiency in [[computer programming]] and graphic development (illustrations, fine art) and have excellent interpersonal and writing skills (since they deal with many other clients and management leaders). The exact skills a game director possesses will depend on their background in the industry. Creative director, or game director, is not usually an entry level position, but in a smaller studio it can be. This is more common in start up companies for instance though normally one would have to earn that role by showing their skills and development over a period of years. The entertainment industry is not always a meritocracy, however, and sometimes people just luck into or inherit such positions. Creative directors have often done their share of lower level startup positions such as internships or assisting other directors in art related work fields. It is all about advancing through the career chain, and once one has earned the position a creative director, they may be eligible to work for larger and more popular game developing companies depending on how successful they have been with past collaborative projects.&lt;ref&gt;Careers in focus:computer and video game design. 2nd ed. New York: Ferguson, 2009. p.17-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

{{Main|Production designer}}

The creative director in the film industry is referred to as the [[production designer]]. A production designer carries a large responsibility of designing the look of a movie. The job is similar to a creative director's role in the video game industry in that he or she manages a team of employees and has to consistently develop new ideas and methods of working. It is vital that designers in this field are able to produce expressive/creative ideas and translate them into something cinematic. Usually a certain sum of funds is distributed among different departments in the production of a film (in this case, the art department). Creative directors must decide on how to distribute and use the funds in the most efficient and effective way to ensure maximum quality in the films art department. An example can include the structuring of scenes and sets once a film begins to undergo the shooting process. During this process, it is important for creative directors to understand what props and effects should be used and how they should be used among various sets and scenes of the film. Some important qualifications that one should have include being able to manage teams, having expertise in design (specifically in theatre, interior sets and art design), being open minded to new ideas and methods in regards to organizing film sets, and having an understanding of coordinating among different departments in order to move a project towards success. A creative director in the film industry usually starts out in lower ranks of the chain, such as an assistant to other art directors and/or as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Department – Skillset." Welcome to Skillset – Skillset. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.skillset.org/film/jobs/productiondesign&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|Music director}}
Creative directors in the field of music can be broken down into various key roles that make up the whole (it may be said that one can be known as a 'music director'). It is in this artistic field where the individual, the director, must master tasks that are relatable to one another. An orchestral conductor is a prime example (but not exclusive) of this role and how one would direct music and harmonize symphonies as well as guide/direct other musician’s in an ensemble. The three roles in this sense can consist of: the active [[musician]], the musical art director, and the instructor that teaches and informs music for society. The main requirements one would need to have is an extensive background and knowledge of music (being able to master one or more instrument), understanding the principles and theories behind music composition, developing an understanding and connection with musicians that the director would be working with to communicate music in a harmonic and creative sense, and most importantly being able to develop leadership skills among other musicians.&lt;ref&gt;"Traits and Skills of a Music Director – League of American Orchestras."

==Fashion==
Creative director is the highest creative position in a [[Fashion design|fashion house]]. The creative director does not design clothes, but instead formulates and impresses upon the designers an overarching concept or concepts for a certain collection and the label as a whole. 
A fashion creative director's main role is to establish what designs should be created, what will appeal to the target market, and how the concepts will be applied and distributed in collaboration with fashion designers who are responsible for creating the clothing and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Director: Inside Jobs."

'''David de Coninck''' or '''David de Koninck''', also known as '''Rammelaer''' (ca. 1644, [[Antwerp]] – after 1701, probably [[City of Brussels|Brussels]]) was a [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] painter who specialised in [[still life]]s and [[Landscape painting|landscapes]] with animals and hunting scenes.  Recognised as a leading animal painter, de Coninck was able to develop an international career which caused him to work for extended periods in Paris, Rome and Vienna.

==Life==
He was apprenticed to [[Pieter Boel]] in 1659.  Pieter Boel was an accomplished animal painter who had been trained by [[Jan Fyt]], the leading Flemish animal painter of the mid 17th century.&lt;ref name=dor&gt;[https://www.dorotheum.com/en/auctions/current-auctions/kataloge/list-lots-detail/auktion/11131-old-master-paintings/lotID/86/lot/1861446-david-de-coninck.html David de Coninck (Antwerp c. 1645 – after 1701 Brussels), ''A landscape with a buzzard attacking ducks''], at Dorotheum&lt;/ref&gt;  De Coninck became a master in the Antwerp [[Guild of Saint Luke]] in 1663.
[[File:Ajaccio de Coninck fruits fleurs animaux.JPG|thumb|left|''Still life of fruit and flowers with animals'']]

He moved to Paris where he worked with the prominent Flemish animal painter [[Nicasius Bernaerts]] for several years, probably until 1669.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;  Nicasius Bernaerts was an influential Flemish animal painter who worked for the royal court and was a member of the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=con&gt;[http://www.connaissancesdeversailles.org/t2746-nicasius-bernaerts-peintre-de-la-menagerie-de-versailles Nicasius (ou Nicaise) Bernaerts] (Anvers 1620 - Paris 1678) {{link language|fr|French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Coninck subsequently travelled to [[Rome]] where he lived from 1671 to 1694.  Here he became a member of the [[Bentvueghels]], an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome, and took the nickname (the so-called 'bent name') 'Rammelaer' (which means 'rattle').  His name was inscribed in a niche in the [[Santa Costanza]] church in Rome where the Bentvueghels used to congregate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadrianus.it/people/david-de-coninck David de Coninck] at Hadrianus&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to the north he stayed for a time in [[Vienna]]. He returned to Antwerp in 1687. He moved to Brussels at some time between 1699 and 1701.  The last record of de Coninck is his registration as a became a member of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1701.  It is not known when or when he died.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/17943 David de Coninck] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:David de Coninck - River Scene with Ducks and Geese Being Attacked by Hawks.jpg|thumb|''River Scene with Ducks and Geese Being Attacked by Hawks'']]
De Coninck painted still lifes, including fruit still lifes and hunting still lifes, landscapes with hunting scenes and architectural paintings.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;  De Coninck's stylistic development is unclear and it is difficult to date his paintings with any precision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/david-de-coninck-dead-birds-and-game-with-gun-dogs-and-a-little-owl Dead Birds and Game with Gun Dogs and a Little Owl], probably about 1672-94, David de Coninck at the [[National Gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that early in his career he painted fruit still lifes, since there is a record that in 1668 two fruit still lifes made by a 'Koninck' were exported to Vienna.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

De Coninck's teacher Pieter Boel was a pupil of Jan Fyt, the leading Flemish animal painter of the mid 17th century. This explains the influence of Jan Fyt's style on de Coninck's work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Koninck,_David_de David de Koninck in Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon] Band XX, 1998, Seite 518 {{link language|de|German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some works of David de Coninck and Pieter Boel are still attributed to Fyt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T030296 Arnout Balis. "Fyt , Jan."] Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 Apr. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  As David de Coninck rarely signed his works, which are generally of a high quality and similar style they have often been confused with the works of Boel, Fyt and even Frans Snijders, the leading Flemish animal painter of the first half of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=dor/&gt;

His fruit still lifes of fruits and flowers painted on large canvases are complex Baroque compositions, which often include animals in an outdoor setting. Large, Italianate fruit still lifes in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes]] can likely also be attributed to de Coninck.  An example of his fruit still lifes is the ''Still life of fruit and flowers with animals'' ([[Musée Fesch]]), which shows a still life with fruits and flowers near an outdoor fountain and a landscape in the distance.  A monkey, two rabbits and a parrot enliven the painting.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;
[[File:David de Coninck - Poultry and Cat.jpg|thumb|''Poultry and cat'']]

De Coninck was an accomplished painter of scenes with animals, mainly birds, in a garden or against a landscape background. He painted lively action scenes of fighting cats and dogs, packs of dogs attacking game and birds of prey or cats attacking birds or poultry.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erfgoedplus.be/collectie/24062A51 |title=Attacking dogs|website=erfgoedplus.be}} {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Coninck's work influenced other artists in Italy such as [[Baldassare De Caro]], Giovanni Crivelli (named 'il Crivellino'), [[Nicola Malinconico]], [[Franz Werner von Tamm]] and [[Jacob Xavier Vermoelen]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

'''Dhon Cholechā''' ([[Devanagari]]: धों चोलेचा) is a Nepalese folk tale about a little girl and an old nanny goat. It is the most well known children's story in [[Newar]] society of the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. It tells about a little girl named Punkhu Mainchā (पुन्खु मैंचा) and the ill treatment she suffers at the hands of her cruel step-mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.reocities.com/rajumaha/dabu/vol1no5/story.htm |title= The Story of Dhon Cholecha|publisher=Dabu|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Folk tales of Nepal: First series|chapter=The Story of Dhon Cholecha|last=Vaidya|first=Karuna Kar |year=1961 |publisher=Himalayan Pioneer Pubs|url=https://books.google.com.np/books/about/Folk_tales_of_Nepal.html?id=5aLYAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhon Cholechā means "old nanny goat" in [[Nepal Bhasa]]. 

==The story==
===Punkhu Maincha===
There was a little girl named Punkhu Maincha whose mother died when she was very young. Her father remarried and a daughter was born. Punkhu Maincha's life became hard after that. Her step-mother was a cruel woman, she would make her do all the household chores and give her very little to eat. Punkhu Maincha also had to take their old nanny goat, Dhon Cholecha, out to graze.

===Dhon Cholecha===
Despite the hard work and bad food, Punkhu Maincha always looked healthy and well fed. So the step-mother told her daughter to spy on her elder sister when she took Dhon Cholecha to graze. The nanny goat knew what a hard life Punkhu Maincha led, and so loved her very much. When the two reached the grazing spot, the goat would vomit out a delicious meal for Punkhu Maincha, which was why she looked so well.

The step-sister reported to her mother what she had seen. The jealous woman made a plan to kill Dhon Cholecha so that Punkhu Maincha wouldn't get any more food. Punkhu Maincha was distressed when she learnt that her beloved Dhon Cholecha was going to be slaughtered for a family feast. The old nanny goat tried to console her, and instructed her to bury the bones in their garden. A fig tree would grow on the spot, and she could enjoy the fruits. 

===The demons===
Punkhu Maincha did not go to the feast pretending to be ill. Later, she collected the bones and buried them in the garden. A fig tree grew there as Dhon Cholecha had said. One day, as she was sitting on a branch eating the tree's fruits, two [[Lakhey]]s (demons) disguised as an old couple came and asked her to throw them down some fruits. She did so, but the demons said they landed on dirt, and asked her to pick some more and come down herself.      

When Punkhu Maincha got down from the tree, they carried her off to their home. There the demons told Punkhu Maincha to prepare [[flatbread]]s for dinner while they went to wash up. 

===The mouse===
As she was cooking flatbreads, a mouse scurried out of a hole and said, "If you want to hear something, give me a flatbread." So Punkhu Maincha gave the mouse a flatbread. It reappeared and said the same thing. And she gave it another one. The mouse came for the third time, and she gave it another one. 

Then the mouse said, "These people are really Lakheys, and they are preparing to eat you. Pack up as much gold, silver, gems and other treasures as you can, and run away. Before you go, spit on each step of the staircase, and also leave a piece of charcoal on each one."

The demons returned and knocked on the door and called, but each time the glob of spit and the piece of charcoal replied "Yes" and "Okay". Finally, the demons forced their way in, and found that she had gone. Punkhu Maincha reached home with the treasures, and told her astounded family all that had happened. The greedy step-mother decided to send her daughter too to get more riches.

===The impatient daughter===
So the daughter sat on the tree and the demons came as expected. They took her home and told her to prepare flatbreads while they went to wash up. When the mouse came repeatedly asking for a flatbread, she became irritated and touched it with a red hot shovel, sending it running back into its hole. Since the mouse didn't tell her anything, she had no idea what was going to happen. The demons returned and the three ate flatbreads and went to bed, with the girl sleeping in the middle. 

When she was fast asleep, the male demon cut away a piece of her flesh with his knife. When she cried in pain, the female demon said, "Did grandfather pinch you?" and caressed her. A little later, she cut away a piece of her flesh too. The male demon then said, "Did grandmother pinch you? Come, lie next to me." This went on until only her bones were left.

The next day, the step-mother was combing her hair as she waited expectantly for her daughter to return with gold and silver. A crow perched on the roof and kept saying, "The mother is beautifying herself while the daughter is a skeleton." Wondering what the crow was trying to say, she went up to the roof and looked into the distance. She saw her daughter's bones kept out to dry in the demon's house. Then she beat her breast and cried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.reocities.com/rajumaha/dabu/vol1no5/story.htm |title= The Story of Dhon Cholecha|publisher=Dabu|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Kansakar, Prem Bahadur (1966).

A '''dresser''' is a [[Stagecraft|theatrical]] [[stagehand]] who is involved with maintaining [[costume]] quality at each [[performance]]. They are hired by either the [[theatre director|director]], [[theatrical producer|producer]], or [[Wardrobe Supervisor|wardrobe supervisor]]. They report directly to the wardrobe supervisor and are usually paid by the hour.

Dressers are responsible for assisting cast members with costume changes backstage, when necessary. They are often used to assist primarily with quick costume changes, where a character exits and must enter again very quickly wearing a different costume.

'''''A Faust Symphony in three character pictures''''' ({{lang-de|Eine Faust-Symphonie in drei Charakterbildern}}), [[List of compositions by Franz Liszt (S.1 - S.350)|S.108]], or simply the "'''''Faust Symphony'''''", was written by Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]] and was inspired by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s drama, ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. The symphony was premiered in Weimar on September 5, 1857, for the inauguration of the [[Goethe–Schiller Monument]] there.

==Structure==
The first clue as to the work's structure is in Liszt's title: "A Faust Symphony in Three Character Sketches after Goethe: (1) Faust, (2) Gretchen, (3) Mephistopheles." Liszt does not attempt to tell the story of Goethe's drama. Rather, he creates musical portraits of the three main protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, ''New Grove 2'', 14:772–3.&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, though this symphony is a multi-movement work and employs a [[choir|chorus]] in its final moments, Liszt adopts the same aesthetic position as in [[Symphonic Poems (Liszt)|his symphonic poems]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, 18:429.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is approximately seventy-five minutes in duration.

===Faust===
This large-scale movement (usually lasting around 30 minutes) is a very loose sonata-form with a short central development and a protracted recapitulation. One might say that this movement represents the very synthesis of the whole symphony, since many of its themes and motives appear throughout the score in various guises, a process of [[thematic transformation]] which Liszt mastered to the highest level during his Weimar years. The basic key of the symphony ([[C minor]]) is already rather blurred by the opening theme made up of [[augmented triad]]s and containing all twelve notes of the chromatic scale consecutively (this is the first published use of a twelve-tone row, other than a simple chromatic scale, in any music). This theme evokes the gloomy Faust, a dreamer, in everlasting search for truth and knowledge. Next follows the so-called 'Nostalgia' theme introduced by the [[oboe]]. At the end of a slow [[crescendo]], there appears a violent Allegro agitato ed appassionato theme, depicting Faust's insatiable appetite for the pleasures of life – this theme establishes a gingery [[C minor]] threatened with collapse under the weight of highly [[chromaticism|chromatic]] elements. A melody of the oboe and clarinet represents the hero's 'painful delights'. The last theme is pentatonic and resolute. From all these elements Liszt weaves a musical structure of power and grandeur, in which some critics recognise the composer's self-portrait.

===Gretchen===
This slow movement is in the key of [[A-flat major]]. Following the introduction on the [[flute]]s and [[clarinet]]s, we are given the pure [[oboe]]'s melody figurated by the [[viola]]'s tender decorations, which expresses Gretchen's virginal innocence. A dialogue between clarinet and [[violin]]s describes her naively plucking the petals of a flower, in a game of 'he loves me, he loves me not'. She is obsessed by Faust, and therefore we may hear Faust's themes being introduced progressively into the music, until his and Gretchen's themes form a passionate love duet. This draws the second movement to a peaceful and short [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]].

An alternative interpretation of the Gretchen movement is that, as [[Lawrence Kramer (musicologist)|Lawrence Kramer]] writes, "What we have been calling Gretchen's music is really Faust's."&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, 108, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Gretchen movement could be seen as representing her from the perspective of Faust. Consequently, the listener really learns more about Faust than about Gretchen. In Goethe's drama, she is a complex heroine. In Liszt's symphony, she is innocent and one-dimensional—a simplification that could arguably exist exclusively in Faust's imagination. The listener becomes aware of this masquerade when the "Gretchen" mask Faust is wearing slips with the appearance of the Faustian themes in bars 44 through 51 and bar 111 to the end of the movement.&lt;ref name="Shulstad, 217"&gt;Shulstad, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mephistopheles===
Some critics suggest that, like Gretchen, Mephistopheles can be seen as an abstraction—in this case, one of the destructive aspects of Faust's character, with Faust mocking his humanity by taking on Mephistopheles' character.&lt;ref name="Shulstad, 217"/&gt; Regardless of which interpretation a listener chooses, since Mephistopheles, Satan, the Spirit of Negation, is not capable of creating his own themes, he takes all of Faust's themes from the first movement and mutilates them into ironic and diabolical distortions. Here Liszt's mastery of thematic metamorphosis shows itself in its full power – therefore we may understand this movement as a modified [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] of the first one. The music is pushed to the very verge of [[atonality]] by use of high [[chromaticism]], rhythmic leaps and fantastic scherzo-like sections. A modified version of Faust's second and third themes then creates an infernal [[fugue]]. Mephistopheles is, however, powerless when faced with Gretchen's innocence, so her theme remains intact. It even pushes the Spirit of Negation away towards the end of the work.

===Text of the revised ending===
It is here that the two versions of the ''Faust'' Symphony merit different interpretations. Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to Gretchen and an optimistic peroration in [[C (musical note)|C major]], based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. Some critics suggest this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination.&lt;ref name="Shulstad, 217"/&gt; When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a 'chorus mysticus', tranquil and positive. The male chorus sings the words from Goethe's ''Faust'':
{|  
! &lt;div style='text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 6em;'&gt;Original German&lt;/div&gt;
! &lt;div style='text-align: left; direction: ltr; margin-left: 9em;'&gt;English Translation&lt;/div&gt;
|-
|  style="padding-right: 6em;" | 
:::''Alles Vergängliche &lt;!--restored capitalisation of original German test --&gt;
:::''Ist nur ein Gleichnis;''
:::''Das Unzulängliche, ''
:::''Hier wird's Ereignis;''
:::''Das Unbeschreibliche,''
:::''Hier ist es getan; ''
:::''Das Ewigweibliche''
:::''Zieht uns hinan.''
|  style="padding-left: 3em;" | 
:::Everything transitory
:::Is only an allegory;
:::What cannot be achieved, &lt;!--lit: 'The unachievable', with no sense of past tense 'could' --&gt;
:::Here it will come to pass; &lt;!--wird=werden=will (aux.)/to become ie future tense --&gt;
:::What cannot be described, &lt;!--lit: 'The indescribable' --&gt; 
:::Here it is accomplished; &lt;!-- As in line 4, G emphasises the 'es', where 'hier ist getan' would probably have sufficed--&gt;
:::The eternal feminine &lt;!-- I wish English used capitals for Very Important Ideas, but sadly it doesn't. --&gt;
:::Draws us aloft.
|}
The tenor soloist then rises above the murmur of the chorus and starts to sing the last two lines of the text, emphasizing the power of salvation through the [[eternal feminine]]. The symphony ends in a glorious blaze of the choir and orchestra, backed up by sustained chords on the organ. With this direct association to the final scene of Goethe's drama we escape Faust's imaginings and hear another voice commenting on his striving and redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Shulstad, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;
The text of the chorus is also the end of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|eighth symphony]].

==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for an orchestral complement of [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[harp]], and [[string section|strings]].  A tenor soloist and male TTB choir are also employed.

==Overview==

===Composition===
[[Hector Berlioz]], who wrote his own version of ''Faust'' and became the eventual dedicatee of Liszt's ''Faust'' Symphony, introduced Liszt to Goethe's ''Faust'' in the 1830s through the French translation of [[Gérard de Nerval]]. Although sketches exist from the 1840s, he was hesitant about composing this work. He commented wryly to one correspondent, "The worst Jesuit is dearer to me than the whole of your Goethe."&lt;ref name=SearleOrch304&gt;Quoted in Searle, "Orchestral", 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1869 letter, Liszt makes a revealing comparison between Faust and [[Manfred]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my youth I passionately admired Manfred and valued him much more than Faust, who, between you and me, in spite of his marvellous prestige in poetry, seemed to me a decidedly [[bourgeois]] character. For that reason he becomes more varied, more complete, richer, more communicative ... (than Manfred) ... Faust's personality scatters and dissipates itself; he takes no action, lets himself be driven, hesitates, experiments, loses his way, considers, bargains, and is interested in his own little happiness. Manfred could certainly not have thought of putting up with the bad company of Mephistopheles, and if he had loved Marguerite he would have been able to kill her, but never abandon her in a cowardly manner like Faust.&lt;ref name=SearleOrch304/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite Liszt's apparent antipathy toward the character of Faust, his residency in [[Weimar]] surrounded him with Goethe and the Faust legend at practically every turn. He had barely served out his first year as Kapellmeister when Grand Duke Carl Alexander decreed that the city would celebrate the centennial of Goethe's birth on August 28, 1849. During this celebration Liszt conducted, among other things, excerpts from [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' for orchestra and choir. After the centennial remembrance, he helped in the creation of a Goethe Foundation; this culminated in the publication of Liszt's brochure ''De la Fondation-Goethe à Weimar''. In the summer of 1850 Gérard de Nerval himself stayed as Liszt's guest. There was much talk about ''Faust'' and the topic would spill over into their subsequent correspondence&lt;ref name="Walker, Weimar, 327"&gt;Walker, ''Weimar'', 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of Berlioz's ''[[La Damnation de Faust]]'' in 1852, conducted by the composer, encouraged Liszt further, though he still hesitated, writing [[Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein|Princess Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein]], "Anything having to do with Goethe is dangerous for me to handle." However, the final catalyst for the symphony came in a two-month period between August and October 1854. This period coincided with a visit to Weimar by [[England|English]] [[novelist]] Mary Ann (Marian) Evans, better known by her [[pen name]] [[George Eliot]]. Her consort [[George Henry Lewes]] was gathering information for his biography of Goethe. During visits to Liszt's residence, the Altenburg, Lewes and Eliot had several discussions with both him and Princess Carolyne about Goethe and his place in German literature. Once Liszt began writing, it was all-consuming; the work was produced in a white heat of inspiration.&lt;ref name="Walker, Weimar, 327"/&gt;

The symphony was revised three years after it was completed. Additional parts for heavy brass were added, as was a ''Chorus Mysticus'' to the finale; in the latter, words from Faust Part II are sung by a male chorus and a tenor soloist to music from the middle movement. Other minor changes were made but much of the original score remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, ''Weimar'', 328.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Liszt added some ten bars to the second movement.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, ''New Grove'', 11:43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance history===
After its première under Liszt's baton in 1857, the symphony (in its revised version with final chorus and tenor solo) received a second performance under [[Hans von Bülow]] in 1861, the year the score was published. [[Richard Wagner]] witnessed the performance in Weimar: "Bülow, who had been chosen to conduct Liszt’s Faust Symphony, seemed to me the wildest of all.  His activity was extraordinary.  He had learned the entire score by heart, and gave us an unusually precise, intelligent, and spirited performance with an orchestra composed of anything but the pick of German players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Wagner |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Wagner |title=My Life, Vol II |place=New York |others=([[Mein Leben (Wagner)|Mein Leben]]) |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |date=1911 |page=788 |url=https://archive.org/stream/myliferichwagner02wagnuoft#page/788/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years von Bülow was highly critical of the work: "I have given that nonsense a thorough going-over! It was indescribably painful. It's sheer rubbish, absolute non-music! I don't know which was greater, my horror or my disgust! Suffice it to say that to cleanse my palate I picked up [[List of compositions by Anton Rubinstein|Ivan the Terrible]] [by [[Anton Rubinstein]]] - it seemed like pure [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], by comparison! No, ''Faust'' is an aberration: let us drop the subject once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birkin|2011|p=358}}, citing Hans Von Bülow: ''Briefe und Schriften'', Vol. VII.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, apart from one or two sporadic performances, the symphony was neglected for roughly 50 years. Lack of interest was so great that the orchestral parts were not published until 1874. [[Felix Weingartner]] became the work's first modern interpreter (giving a performance with the [[Berlin Staatskapelle]] in 1892){{sfn|Birkin|2011|p=358n}} but he stood practically alone in his advocacy of the score until modern times, when [[Thomas Beecham]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]], among others, began championing the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, ''Weimar'', 335–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcriptions===
Liszt transcribed the complete score for two pianos, and the middle movement alone ("Gretchen") for solo piano.&lt;ref&gt;See IMSLP e.g.&lt;/ref&gt;  The transcription of 'Gretchen' was recorded by [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]] as part of his set of complete recordings of Liszt's solo piano music.

Following Liszt's tradition of transcribing orchestral works such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s nine symphonies, the Hungarian pianist [[Ervin Nyiregyházi]] transcribed the Faust Symphony for solo piano, which he performed at a recital in [[Novato, California]] on April 30, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpBX5uR0-zo&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=28D1247A71D89E8E&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=55 Performance on Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, part of [[August Stradal]]'s solo piano arrangement of the Faust Symphony has been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|829395697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a response to feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]]'s term, "[[Male gaze|the male gaze]]", which represents not only the gaze of the male viewer but also the gaze of the male character and the male creator of the film.  In contemporary usage, the ''female gaze'' has been used to refer to the perspective a female filmmaker (screenwriter/director/producer) brings to a film that would be different from a male view of the subject.   

== History ==
Mulvey discusses aspects of voyeurism and fetishism in the Male Gaze in her article, "[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]".  She draws from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Alfred Hitchcock's]] film, ''[[Rear Window]]'', applying terms from [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] theories of psychoanalysis to discuss camera angle, narrative choice, and props in the movie while focusing on the concept of the male gaze. From what Jeffries, the protagonist in ''Rear Window'', looks at through his camera to the camera angles in his discussion with his girlfriend, the Male Gaze is accentuated by each move in Mulvey's article. Mulvey's article focused on the concept of "scopophilia", or a pleasure in gazing and placed women as spectacles to be objectified and viewed, unable to return a gaze and dismissing women in film as adequate representations of human beings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|journal=Screen|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical implementation ==
The female gaze looks at three viewpoints.
# The individual filming
# The characters within the film
# The spectator 
These three viewpoints also concern Mulvey's male gaze but focuses, instead, on females. Viewpoints expanded alongside diversity in film genres. [[Woman's film]]s were a genre that focused on female leads, showing the female as a diegetic story-teller rather than that of a spectacle. Movies such as ''[[Rebecca]]'' and [[Stella Dallas (1925 film)|''Stella Dallas'']] are examples of such films in which the traditional narrative is told through the female protagonist. This genre of film has evolved into modern day "chick flicks" such as ''[[27 Dresses]]'' and ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''. The films are meant to represent the desires of female protagonists and, therefore, are to represent the desires of the female movie-viewer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Zoe Dirse looks at the female gaze through the [[documentary film]] genre, analyzing aspects of pleasure and viewer identification. She analyzes the gaze at the points of production and reception. She notes that if the cinematographer is female and the subject is also female, the object of the film takes on a different role.  Dirse argues that by having a female cinematographer allows females to be viewed as they really are and not the voyeuristic spectacle that the male gaze makes them out to be. While filming in [[Cairo]], Dirse was in a crowd and observed being noticed by the males around her. At first they seemed curious, and Dirse wondered if it was because of her gender or the fact that she had a camera. It was not long before they began to push past her, and she felt a sense of danger that she felt other females in Cairo shared. This is depicted in her film, ''Shadow Maker''. She said that her gender allowed her to be an unobtrusive observer – unlike a man – when filming gypsies singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dirse|first=Zoe|title=Gender in Cinematography|journal=Journal of Research in Gender Studies|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Marantz Cohen]] discusses the female gaze in the [[chick flick]] genre, with specific attention to the attire women wear. Spectacle overrules plot in films such as ''[[The Awful Truth]]''. [[Irene Dunne|Irene Dunne's]] wardrobe is regarded as a central aspect of the film. The different dresses that Dunn wears are extravagant but not sexualized. While the clothing may be regarded as comical, they are also supportive to Dunn's independence and femininity. Cohen notes that in the film ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'', [[Jennifer Lopez]] is fully clothed throughout the entire film. The clothes, as in ''The Awful Truth'', are regarded as comical yet they catch the viewer's eye without sexualizing her. Cohen also analyzes the relationship between the female lead stars of these films and their male co-stars. She states that these films truly depict what women want, that they are accentualized in a positive manner and have a partner who amplifies this accentuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Paula Marantz|title=What Have Clothes Got to Do with It?: Romantic Comedy and the Female Gaze|journal=Southwest Review|volume=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage == 

Critics have focused attention on the presence of the female gaze in cinema and television, in works such as ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[I Love Dick (TV series)|I Love Dick]]'' and ''[[Fleabag]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Meredith|title=From 'The Handmaid's Tale' to 'I Love Dick,' the female gaze is thriving on television|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-female-gaze-television-20170505-htmlstory.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial [[lesbian]] drama film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]]'' received considerable critical comment for the dominance of the [[male gaze]] and lack of female gaze, with some reviewers calling it a "patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/blue-is-the-warmest-color-the-male-gaze-reigns-supreme-203158/|title=Blue Is The Warmest Color: The Male Gaze Reigns Supreme|date=2013-11-06|work=Autostraddle|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/11/08/blue_is_the_warmest_color_gets_lesbian_sex_wrong_partner/|title=“Blue Is the Warmest Color” gets lesbian sex wrong|last=Juergen|first=Michelle|date=2013-11-08|website=Salon|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/10/feminists-debate-cannes-winner-blue-is-the-warmest-colors-patriarchal-gaze-195397/|title=Feminists Debate Cannes-Winner ‘Blue is the Warmest Color”s Patriarchal Gaze {{!}} IndieWire|last=Hanna|first=Anne Thompson,Beth|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/movies/the-trouble-with-blue-is-the-warmest-color.html|title=The Trouble With ‘Blue Is the Warmest Color’|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=2013-10-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the book upon which the film was based was among the harshest critics, saying, "It appears to me this was what was missing on the set: lesbians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/05/blue-is-the-warmest-color-author-julie-maroh-not-pleased-with-graphic-sex-in-film-calls-it-porn-97557/|title=‘Blue Is The Warmest Color’ Author Julie Maroh Not Pleased With Graphic Sex In Film, Calls It “Porn” {{!}} IndieWire|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|website=www.indiewire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[April Mullen]] has said, "Women have this vulnerability and connection to a depth of emotions that I can see and feel in certain moments of truth in the films we create. To me, the female gaze is transparency – the veil between audience and filmmaker is thin, and that allows people in more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/511655-director-april-mullen-mouth-female-gaze|title=Director April Mullen on how “Below Her Mouth” is all about the female gaze - AfterEllen|date=2016-09-12|work=AfterEllen|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://girltalkhq.com/below-her-mouth-dir-april-mullen-talks-about-the-female-gaze-working-with-an-all-female-crew/|title='Below Her Mouth' Dir.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3938">'''Feminist Art Gallery''' (or '''FAG''') is an art gallery and collective based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], described as a “geographical footprint” co-founded by artists [[Allyson Mitchell]] and Deirdre Logue in 2010.&lt;ref name="Allyson Mitchell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allysonmitchell.com/html/fagGallery.html |title=Allyson Mitchell |publisher=Allyson Mitchell |date= |accessdate=2015-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929051023/http://www.allysonmitchell.com/html/fagGallery.html |archivedate=2015-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Allyson Mitchell]] and [[Deirdre Logue]] founded the Feminist Art Gallery (FAG) in 2010."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ago.net/fag-feminist-art-gallery |title=FAG Feminist Art Gallery &amp;#124; AGO Art Gallery of Ontario |publisher=Ago.net |date= |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAG’s mission is to grow sustainable [[feminist]] and [[queer]] art that proposes an alternative model for artist-run centres by not depending on formal funding sources such as government and corporate institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accessgallery.ca/archive/fag-satellite/ |title=Access Gallery FAG Satellite |publisher=Accessgallery.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAG provides a space for art exhibitions, and opportunities for artists who are emerging, and invisible such as queer artists and [[People of color|POC]].

Their mandate states that it "is a response, a process, a site, a protest, an outcry, an exhibition, a performance, an economy, a conceptual framework, a place and an opportunity. We host we fund we advocate we support we claim."&lt;ref name="Allyson Mitchell"/&gt; The gallery operates alternatively to traditional galleries in the sense that artists do not submit proposals, and Mitchell and Logue act as "feral curators", which means they look to friends and peers to suggest which artists to show.&lt;ref name="Macleans.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/feminist-art-gallery-fights-back-with-fabric/ |title=The Feminist Art Gallery fights back with fabric |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art is also not for sale, rather the artists receive a fee from private donations raised through its "matronage program".&lt;ref name="Macleans.ca"/&gt;

Their most notable project are a series of banners funded by the [[University of Brighton]] for an Exhibition called "Civil Partnerships-Queer &amp; Feminist Art &amp; Activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/projects/irn/civil-partnerships-event/exhibition |title=Exhibition &amp;#124; Civil Partnerships Programme &amp;#124; Arts and Humanities |publisher=Arts.brighton.ac.uk |date=2012-05-21 |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series of four banners made of crochet granny squares read: "WE CAN’T COMPETE", "WE WON’T COMPETE", "WE CAN’T KEEP UP", "WE WON’T KEEP DOWN". These slogans are central to FAG’s mandate in which they ask " "Why would you want to be a winner in this hierarchical structure?" and "How do we both resist and reconcile our participation in this oppressive system?".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

FAG has collaborated with institutions such as [[SFMOMA]], [[Tate Modern]], and were the artists in residence in 2015 at [[The Art Gallery of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Art Gallery of Ontario|title=AGO Artists in Residence, 2011-2016|date=2017|publisher=Art Gallery of Ontario|location=Toronto|isbn=9781894243940|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also done projects with the Whippersnapper Gallery,  [[The Power Plant]], The Gallery of York University, Access Gallery, and Artists Independent Archives .&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A '''figure painting''' is a work of [[fine art]] in any of the [[Painting#Painting media|painting media]] with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or [[Nude (art)|nude]].
Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the constant subjects of art since the first stone age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.
==Depicting figures==
Unlike [[figure drawing]]s which are usually nudes, figure paintings are often [[historical]], [[mythological]], [[allegorical]] or [[Imagination|imaginary]] depictions that may have figures in appropriate costumes. A [[portrait painting]] is a figure painting that focuses on the creation of a likeness of a particular individual or group.

The nude has been a theme in [[Western art]] since [[classical antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Western Art and its Beginnings in Antiquity,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the [[Renaissance]], after being largely absent during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- {{quotebox|source=Willem de Kooning|quote=Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented}} --&gt;
Oil paint historically has been the ideal media for depicting the figure. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. "Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another."&lt;ref&gt;Scala, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although working from [[Model (art)|live models]] is preferred, the length of time needed to complete a painting has led most modern painters to use photographs as references at least part of the time if not for the entire work.

Figure painting is not synonymous with [[figurative art]], which may depict real objects of any kind (including humans and animals).

A '''graphics coordinator''', '''GC''', or '''font assist''' is an individual who works, usually on a [[television]] show, as a [[Television producer|producer]] of on-air [[graphics|still]] and [[motion graphics]].  The graphics coordinator decides what content should be displayed on-air - such as on a fullpage (a full-screen graphic) or a [[lower third]] (a bar graphic appearing in the lower third of the screen).  The GC should not be confused with the [[Operator (profession)|Operator]], who usually operates a [[character generator]] (CG) and is part of a [[television crew]], or a [[broadcast designer]] who physically creates the graphics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://study.com/articles/Graphics_Coordinator_Job_Information_for_Students_Considering_a_Career_as_a_Graphics_Coordinator.html study.com Graphics Coordinator: Job &amp; Career Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

A CG ([[3D computer graphics]]) coordinator or supervisor plays an important role in [[film]] and television productions.  His or her role is to supervise, manage, and administer the [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) digital production [[computer animation]] [[workflow]] for the film or [[television show]].  He or she is also there at client meetings and [[conference call]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mymajors.com/career/graphics-coordinator/ mymajors.com Graphics Coordinator: Career]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CG supervisor generally is in charge or has senior input regarding artist management and resource planning, and also plays a senior role in digital productions.  While it is a creative role, most supervisors possess a strong technical background and are capable of making informed decisions about the most efficient and effective techniques to employ in order to solve the problem at hand.  Often, a supervisor will work in tandem with a [[visual effects producer]], [[VFX creative director]] and [[visual effects supervisor]].

Specific responsibilities vary somewhat, depending on the nature of the production; however, most supervisors:
* Handle a CG project from conception through to completion;
* Manage and direct the technical, artistic, and production staff;
* Possess a knowledge of various computer graphic techniques, with emphasis on technical aspects, pipelines, and general film knowledge; 
* Constantly improve workflow and artist training, with an eye on efficiency;
* Collaborate on the bidding and negotiation processes.

There is no union for CG supervisors; however, the [[Visual Effects Society]] is a prominent [[trade organization]] representing the interests of visual effects [[professional]]s.

'''''The Holy Trinity, with the Virgin and Saint John and donors''''' ({{lang-it|Santa Trinità }}) is a [[fresco]] by the Early [[Italian Renaissance]] painter [[Masaccio]]. It is located in the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], in [[Florence]].

==History==

The ''Trinity'' is thought to have been created by Masaccio sometime between 1425-1427.  He died in late 1428 at the age of 26, or having just turned 27, leaving behind a relatively small body of work.  This painting was one of his last major commissions, and is considered to be one of his masterpieces. 
===Location===
The fresco is located along the middle of the basilica's left aisle.  Although the configuration of this space has changed since the artwork was created, there are clear indications that the fresco was aligned ''very'' precisely in relationship with the sight-lines and perspective arrangement of the room at the time; particularly a former entrance-way facing the painting; in order to enhance the [[tromp l'oeil]] effect. There was also an altar, mounted as a shelf-ledge between the upper and lower sections of the fresco, further emphasizing the "reality" of the artifice.

===Commissioners and donors===
Not much is known about the details of the commission; no contemporaneous documents naming the altar-piece's patron(s) have been found.  The two [[donor portraits]] included in the fresco, one figure kneeling on either side of the archway, have not been positively identified.  The persons depicted are almost certainly contemporary Florentines; either the persons who funded the work, or relatives or close associates.  According to the established conventions of such depictions, it is generally, but not universally, assumed that they were probably still alive at the time of the artwork's commissioning.  Presumably, the representations in the painting serve as relatively accurate likenesses of their actual appearance at the time when their portraits were created.

The leading theories as to their identity favour two local families; either the Lenzi or, for at least one of the figures, a member of the Berti, who were a working-class family from the Santa Maria Novella quarter of Florence.  According to recently discovered (as of 2012) records of the Berti family, they owned a tomb at the foot of the fresco,&lt;ref name="Rita Maria Comanducci 2003"&gt;Rita Maria Comanducci, "'L'altare Nostro de la Trinità': Masaccio's Trinity and the Berti Family," ''The Burlington Magazine,'' 145 (2003) 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that they might have had a particular "devotional loyalty" to veneration of the Holy Trinity.  Other sources mention a Lenzi tomb near the altar, with the inscription "Domenico di Lenzo, et Suorum 1426", as well as other Lenzi decorations in the chapel at that time, and assume the donor portraits to be posthumous images of Domenico (and his spouse?); based on the full-profile pose used for the figures.  In the Florentine dating system of that time, the new year began on March 25; and factoring in the conversion from Julian to Gregorian calendars Domenico's death, as recorded, would have been on 19 January 1427.

It has been hypothesized that [[Fra' Alessio Strozzi]] and/or [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] may have been involved, or at least consulted, in the creation of ''Trinity''.  Brunelleschi's work on linear perspective and architecture certainly inspired the painting, and this is clearly demonstrated within Massacio's work.  Fra' Alessio's involvement has been posited more on the matter of the appropriate depiction of the Holy Trinity, according to the preferences and sensibilities of the [[Dominican order]].  However, there is, to date, no concrete evidence for the direct involvement of either of these 2 persons, and due to the lack of documentation about the exact circumstances of the piece's creation, theories about 3rd party involvement in the creative process remain speculative.

===Giorgio Vasari and Cosimo I===

Around 1568 [[Cosimo I]], then Duke of Florence, commissioned [[Giorgio Vasari]] to undertake extensive renovation work at Santa Maria Novella; in keeping with the tastes and religious politics of the time.  This work included reconfiguring and redecoration of the chapel-area in which Masaccio's fresco was located.

Vasari had already written about Masaccio, including a highly favourable mention of this specific work, in his [[Vite]].  When it came time to implement the planned renovations of the chapel containing ''Trinity'', circa 1570, Vasari chose to leave the fresco intact and construct a new altar and screen ''in front'' of Masaccio's painting; leaving a small gap, and effectively concealing and protecting the earlier work.  While it seems reasonably clear that it was Vasari's deliberate intention to preserve Masaccio's painting, it is unclear to what extent Duke Cosimo and/or other "concerned parties" were involved in this decision.  To decorate the new altar, Vasari painted a Madonna of the Rosary; the image is still extant, but has been moved to a different location within the church.

===Rediscovery and subsequent history===

Masaccio's ''Holy Trinity'' was rediscovered when Vasari's altar was dismantled during renovations in 1860.  The [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], the upper part of the fresco, was subsequently transferred to canvas, and relocated to a different part of the church.  It is unclear from available sources whether the lower section of the fresco, the [[cadaver tomb]], remained unknown or was deliberately omitted (and possibly plastered over) during the 1860s construction work.

Restoration was done to the Crucifixion section of the painting at that time, to replace missing areas of the design; mostly architectural details around the perimeter of the work.  While the painting was in damaged condition when rediscovered, it is also likely that further damage was caused by the transfer from plaster to canvas.

In the 20th century, the cadaver tomb portion of the work was rediscovered still ''in situ'', and the two halves were re-united in their original location in 1952.  Leonetto Tintori undertook restoration work on the combined whole during 1950-1954.

==Description==

[[File:Masaccio. Trinity. Scheme of linear perspective..jpg|thumb|left|(note that this line-drawing does not include adequate spacing for the altar-ledge between upper and lower sections)]]

===Dimensions===
The painting is approximately 317&amp;nbsp;cm (125&amp;nbsp;in) wide, and 667&amp;nbsp;cm (263&amp;nbsp;in) high.  This gives an overall vertical-to-horizontal proportion of about 2:1.  The ratio between the upper and lower sections of the work is very roughly 3:1.

===Altar===
Originally, the design included an actual ledge, used as an altar, physically projecting outward from the now-blank band between the upper and lower sections of the fresco; further enhancing the sense of depth and reality in the work.  Constructed as a pillared-shelf ~5&amp;nbsp;ft. above the floor, and estimated to be about 60&amp;nbsp;cm. wide, the altar-table's appearance would have been intended to match and/or complement the painted architecture.  Its facing-edge and upper surface integrating with the fresco's steps and archway; and its supporting pillars, both real and illusory, combining with the shadows caused by the over-hang to create a crypt-like effect for the tomb beneath.  The upper section of the fresco still retains traces of candle-smoke and heat-effects from use of this altar.

===Figures===
The painted figures are roughly life-sized.  For an adult of average height facing the painting, their eye-line would have been slightly above 'ground-level' in the work; with Death in the form of the crypt and skeleton directly front of them, and the promise of Salvation above.

===Damaging and restoring===
Over the course of time and events (see above), the fresco has been damaged and subsequently restored.  Much of the outer edge of the upper section, mainly architectural detail, is replacement work.  Some regions of "new" paint can be clearly identified by differences in colour, visual texture and detail; and in certain places, by apparent "cracks" along the boundary between the original fresco surface, and areas of the design where the original surface is entirely absent and was repainted.

===Lower section===
The lower section, depicting a [[memento mori]], in the form of a [[cadaver tomb]], has also lost significant paint; but the restoration work there has been more restrained and less extensive.  This is probably due, at least in part, to the fact that the lower half of the fresco was not recovered until the mid-20th century.  By this time, "standard practice" in restoration had become more conservative, with a stronger emphasis on preserving and revealing the authentic work of the original artist; whereas earlier restorations tended to have more focus on producing an aesthetically pleasing "recreation" of the artwork.

As far as can be determined from available records, at the time when this painting was created no large-scale Roman-style [[coffered]] [[barrel vault]], Triumphal arch or otherwise, had been constructed in Western [[Christendom]] since [[late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Giedion, in ''Space, Time and Architecture'', points out that the first would be [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s interior and external barrel vaults at Sant'Andrea, Mantua, begun nearly five decades after Masaccio's premature death.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable characteristics===
The ''Trinity'' is noteworthy for its inspiration taken from ancient Roman [[triumphal arch]]es and the strict adherence to recently developed perspective techniques, with a [[vanishing point]] at the viewer's eye level, so that, as Vasari describes it&lt;ref&gt;''Le [[vite]]...'':"Masaccio"&lt;/ref&gt;"a barrel vault drawn in perspective, and divided into squares with rosettes that diminish and are foreshortened so well that there seems to be a hole in the wall." This artistic technique is called ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'', which means "deceives the eye," in French. The fresco had a transforming effect on generations of Florentine painters and visiting artists.  The sole figure without a fully realized three-dimensional occupation of space is the majestic God supporting the Cross, considered an immeasurable being. The kneeling patrons represent another important novelty, occupying the viewer's own space, "in front of" the picture plane, which is represented by the Ionic columns and the Corinthian pilasters from which the feigned vault appears to spring; they are depicted in the traditional prayerful pose of [[donor portrait]]s, but on the same scale as the central figures, rather than the more usual 'diminution', and with noteworthy attention to realism and volume.

Several diverse interpretations of the fresco have been proposed.  Most scholars have seen it as a traditional kind of image, intended for personal devotions and commemorations of the dead, although explanations of how the painting reflects these functions differ in their details.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Schlegel, "Observations on Masaccio's Trinity Fresco in Santa Maria Novella," ''Art Bulletin,'' 45 (1963) 19-34; Otto von Simson, "Uber die Bedeutung von Masaccios Trinitätfresko in Santa Maria Novella," ''Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen,'' 8 (1966) 119-159; Rona Goffen, "Masaccio's ''Trinity'' and the Letter to the Hebrews," ''Memorie domenicane,'' n.s/ 11 (1980) 489-504; Alessandro Cortesi, "Una lettura teologica," in ''La Trinità di Masaccio:  il restauro dell'anno duemila,'' ed. Cristina Danti, Florence, 2002, 49-56; Timothy Verdon, "Masaccio's ''Trinity,''" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 158-176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The iconography of the [[Trinity]], flanked by Mary and John or including donors, is not uncommon in Italian art of the late 14th and early 15th centuries, and the association of the Trinity with a tomb also has precedents.  No precedent for the exact iconography of Masaccio's fresco, combining all these elements, has been discovered, however.

The figures of the two patrons have most often been identified as members of the Lenzi family or, more recently, a member of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella quarter of Florence.&lt;ref name="Rita Maria Comanducci 2003"/&gt;  They serve as models of religious devotion for viewers but, because they are located closer to the sacred figures than the viewers are, they also lay claim to special status.

The [[cadaver tomb]] consists of a sarcophagus on which lies a skeleton.  "Carved" in the wall above the skeleton is an inscription:  "IO FU[I] G[I]A QUEL CHE VOI S[I]ETE E QUEL CH['] I[O] SONO VO[I] A[N]CO[R] SARETE" (I once was what you are and what I am you also will be).  This ''[[memento mori]]'' underlines that the painting was intended to serve as a lesson to the viewers. At the simplest level the imagery must have suggested to the 15th-century faithful that, since they all would die, only their faith in the Trinity and Christ's sacrifice would allow them to overcome their transitory existences.

According to American art historian Mary McCarthy:

{{quote|text=The fresco, with its terrible logic, is like a proof in philosophy or mathematics, God the Father, with His unrelenting eyes, being the axiom from which everything else irrevocably flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Mary|date=August 22, 1959|title=A City of Stone|journal=The New Yorker|location=New York|pages=48|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1959/08/22/1959_08_22_038_TNY_CARDS_000258040|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">In [[film theory]], the '''institutional mode of representation''' ('''IMR''') is the dominant mode of film construction, which developed in the years after the turn of the century, becoming the norm by about 1914.  Although virtually all films produced today are made within the IMR, it is not the only possible mode of representation.  Other possibilities include the '''primitive mode of representation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which was dominant before being replaced by the IMR; certain [[avant-garde film]]s that constitute a “[[deconstructionist]]” challenge to the IMR; and various non-western modes, notably pre-war Japanese film,&lt;ref&gt;Noël Burch (1979). ''[http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.aaq5060.0001.001 To the Distant Observer: Form and Meaning in Japanese Cinema]''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that were possible before the IMR became the worldwide norm.   [[Classical Hollywood cinema]] is the dominant style within the IMR, but other styles such as [[art house]], [[independent film|independent]], and most (current) foreign styles fall no less under the IMR.  

==Overview==
The concept was developed by [[Noël Burch]] in his 1969 book ''Praxis du cinéma''.  Burch’s goal is to show that the IMR was a class-determined practice, developed out of the bourgeois desire for totalizing illusionistic representation.  [[André Bazin]] had identified the “myth of total cinema,” or a constant desire to represent reality as completely as possible, which he claimed as the root of cinema innovations (both technology such as sound, color, and widescreen as well as techniques such as more elaborate editing).  Burch, on the other hand, argues that IMR is no more elaborate or realistic a system than its alternatives.  

The IMR is characterized by the attempt to create an entirely closed fictional world on screen.  The audience is completely imaginatively involved in the film, instead of being distant from it and seeing it as an object to be examined.  Burch argues that the key to the IMR is "spectatorial identification with a ubiquitous camera."&lt;ref&gt;Noël Burch (1986).  "Primitivism and the Avant-Gardes: A Dialectical Approach" in ''Narrative-Apparatus-Ideology'', ed. Phil Rosen.  New York: Columbia UP. p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;  Various techniques (often referred to as the “language of cinema”) were developed in order to accomplish this identification:

* Films are constructed out of a sequence of shots, each of which presents the viewer with one clear piece of information.  In contrast to the Primitive Mode, IMR therefore uses close-ups.
* A three-dimensional space is created, using Renaissance rules of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] as well as new [[cinematic techniques]] such as [[editing]] and [[lighting]].  To preserve the illusion of spatial integrity, which was lost with the introduction of close-ups, eye-line and directional matches were introduced.  The film is thus perceived as taking place in an environment around the viewer.
* Characters are psychologically individuated, through close-ups on faces and acting methods borrowed from (bourgeois) theater.  Psychological depth is prized, and the narrative is driven by character psychology.  The audience is therefore invited to interpret the motivations of the characters, and thus involve itself with the film.

'''Jason's Tomb''' (Kever Yason) is a [[rock-cut tombs|rock-cut tomb]] dating to the [[Maccabean]] period discovered in the [[Rehavia]] neighborhood in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. It has been identified as the burial site of Jason, possibly a naval commander, based on the charcoal drawing of two warships discovered in the cave.

An inscription states that Jason sailed to the coast of Egypt. Inside the cave are eight burial niches. To make room for additional burials the bones were later removed to the charnel space in front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/47mag/jerusalemtombs/jerusalemtombs.htm Jerusalem tombs]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The building consists of a courtyard and a single [[Doric order|Doric]] column decorating the entrance to the burial chamber, topped with a reconstructed pyramid-shaped roof. Among the carved inscriptions in Greek and Aramaic is one that laments the deceased Jason: "A powerful lament make for Jason, son of P.....(my brother) peace ...... who hast built thyself a tomb, Elder rest in peace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Archaeological%20Sites%20in%20Israel%20-%20Jerusalem-%20Burial Archaeological Sites in Israel - Jerusalem: Burial Sites and Tombs of the Second Temple Period&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10650">The '''Kilkenny Design Workshops''' (KDW) were a government-funded research and development centre of excellence for [[design]] (and design advocacy, research and promotion) which was established in [[Ireland]] in 1963. It was created to inspire, support and demonstrate to industry how design could be the key factor in change and lead to economic success. This was a new departure, up to this point no model had existed anywhere in the world for this type of practice. Teamwork is common today in design practices but this method was new for its time. KDW operated from the converted Ormonde Stables in [[Kilkenny|Kilkenny City]] from its official opening in 1965 until its closure in 1988.

==History==
William H. Walsh was the founder of KDW and Chief Executive of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta (CTT) or [[Irish Export Board]]. He had a vision for improving standards of design in industry to encourage commerce, trade and export. Walsh also realised the importance of design for the Irish market and how the existing situation in Ireland in the early 1960s  (including protective tariffs) meant that a strategy would be required to encourage appreciation and promotion of good design.

Steps had been taken to ensure that the design situation in Ireland was carefully assessed. A group of selected [[Scandinavia]]n designers were commissioned to compile the ''Design in Ireland'' report (also known as ''The Scandinavian Report''), auditing the standards of design in Ireland. William H. Walsh spearheaded the establishment of Kilkenny Design Workshops, itself a revolutionary move as this was to be the first state agency established outside [[Dublin]].

The early workshops in Kilkenny were Ceramics, Candle making, Precious Metals and Metalwork Woodturning and Textiles; which comprised weaving and printed textile departments. Graphic Design was added to in 1969 and 3D work included Furniture Design. Designers also contributed to packaging production and exhibition’s design. Industrial Design and Design Consultancy services were offered to clients as the shift moved from traditional industry to engineering based production industries.

Workshops were staffed with teams of creatives; artists designers, craftspeople, apprentices, graduates and students, including technicians and chemists to assist with research and development. The management team also consisted of a creative and active board that included artists Louis le Brocquy, Pat Scott and Sir Basil Goulding.

Retail was seen as an opportunity from the early days of KDW and the KDW shop was used to sell prototypes, promote design and provide manufacturers with a working example of the business opportunities around well designed and promoted Irish products. Links were forged with buyers from American and UK retailers. KDW opened a shop in [[Ghirardelli Square|Ghiradelli Square]] in [[San Francisco]] and participated in in-store promotions in [[B. Altman and Company|Altman's]] in New York, [[Heal's]] in London and [[Neiman Marcus]] in [[Dallas]].

Design advocacy included seminars and exhibitions, the education of the designers in the workshops led to the potential for good design to spread out of the Kilkenny Graduate Programmes which refined the skills of young designers. Many of those who partook in programmes ran by KDW went on to establish their own creative enterprises or teach in design departments at second and third level in Ireland. KDW also had participation in and representation on international design organisations including the [[World Crafts Council]], the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)]] and the International Council of Design ([[Ico-D]]), formerly known as International Council of Graphic Design Associations (ICOGRADA). Later KDW itself became an inspiration and a model for design development in other countries, its legacy spread to several countries around the world interested in building up design for industry and using KDW’s example as a template for establishing this approach in their own country.

Although Kilkenny Design Workshops ceased operation in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/5999n9755|title=Kilkenny Design Workshop|last=|first=|date=|website=Digital Depository of Ireland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; their output had transformed the visual culture of Ireland. KDW demonstrated the importance of design for efficient manufacturing processes and well designed marketing material to communicate the quality of products, it also endorsed the creation of beautiful products that could be both functional and visually appealing.

==Legacy==
In 2013, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the KDW, the Design &amp; Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI) held a conference titled "KDW@21C" that sought to investigate the continuing legacy and acknowledge the influence of the KDW on Irish design practice and culture.&lt;ref name=21C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcraftgallery.ie/kdw21C|title=KDW@21C|publisher=National Craft Gallery (Ireland)|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the conference was a "Remembering KDW" event, a reunion for former KDW participants.&lt;ref name=21C/&gt;

In 2015, the DCCoI released an [[iOS]] [[mobile app|app]] titled "Kilkenny Design Workshops" highlighting the work of the KDW.&lt;ref&gt;

===Irish Design 2015 (ID2015)===
2015 marked 50 years since KDW officially opened. To commemorate this event, the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2013 conceived of ID2015, a year-long programme celebrating the history of Irish design. ID2015 was a major government backed initiative that explored, promoted and celebrated Irish design through events and activities on the island of Ireland and in renowned international capitals of design and commerce.

The initiative sought to:
* raise the profile of Irish design, at home and abroad
* increase awareness of the value of design in all aspects of life
* build on the international reputation of Irish design
* encourage links between local and global Irish designers
* showcase the importance of design to success in business and as a driver of economic growth

The all-island initiative was convened by the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI), in collaboration with partner organisations, on behalf of the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]], the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] and [[Enterprise Ireland]].  President of Ireland [[Michael D. Higgins]] was the Patron of Irish Design 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishdesign2015.ie|title=Irish Design 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of ID2015, [[Dublin]] was designated World Design Hub 2015 by the International Association of Designers, providing Ireland with a platform to promote the skills and talents of Irish designers to a worldwide audience.

The achievements and impact of ID2015 are discussed in ''Irish Design 2015 - Making Design Matter''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1906691509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485027341&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=irish+design+2015+making+design+matter&lt;/ref&gt; a book that offers a comprehensive examination of the year of Irish design. Through a series of essays by key participants in the initiative, spotlight reports on the different projects mounted throughout the year, and group discussions featuring leading Irish and international figures from the sector, ''Making Design Matter'' captures the why and the how of the landmark initiative that was Irish Design 2015 (ID2015). Edited by Professor Alex Milton, ID2015 Programme Director;&lt;ref&gt;https://alexmiltondesign.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Hennessy, CEO of ID2015 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dccoi.ie/about/our-team/&lt;/ref&gt; and DCCoI and Rachel Donnelly, ID2015 Content Editor, the publication takes a broad view of the design sector in Ireland, reflecting on key moments in its past, engaging with its vibrant present, and speculating about its optimistic future. The publication also presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of the year's activities, alongside statistics representing the economic footprint of the design sector in Ireland. ID2015 was pioneering in its target-focused approach to making design matter, with the result that this is the first ever quantitative analysis of the impact of design activity mounted on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishdesign2015.ie/news/single/minister-mitchell-oconnor-officially-launches-report-on-irish-design-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Key outcomes of the initiative were:
* 370 newly registered design companies
* 476 designers supported to attend international design-based trade events
* 50 companies supported to undertake design training
* €24.1 million in design-based exports generated
* 28.5 million people engaged with ID2015 through exhibitions and events
* €20.1 million+ PR value generated
* 3 design accelerators launched

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''Komafest''' (Norwegian: Coma party) was an [[urban art]] and [[graffiti]] event organized in [[Vardø]], Norway. Tens of mostly abandoned buildings were decorated by international artists in the period 5–21 July 2012, culminating in a grand opening and a guided town tour attended by hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6159982.ece] Finnmarken: Fiskerens gudinne ble til kunst&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was curated by noted Norwegian urban artist "[[Pøbel]]". Participating artists were [[Steve Powers (artist)|Stephen Powers]] (United States), "[[Vhils]]" ([[Portugal]]), "[[ROA (artist)|Roa]]" (Belgium), Atle Østrem (Norway), "Ethos" ([[Brazil]]), "E. B. Itso", "Husk mit navn" (both Denmark), "Horfe", Ken Sortais, "Remed" (all France) and Conor Harrington (Ireland).

==Background==

Vardø is Norway's north-easternmost town. Traditionally a vibrant fishing community, the town's population halved between the 1960s and 2000s. As per 2012, depopulation had balanced out and Vardø had 2,122 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssb.no/emner/02/02/folkendrhist/tabeller/tab/2002.html] Statistics Norway (''Statistisk sentralbyrå'')&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the population decline, Vardø was left with many empty buildings in various stages of disrepair. "Pøbel" wanted to organize a larger scale continuation of the "Getto spedalsk" ("Ghetto leperous") project, where he and collaborator "[[DOLK (artist)|Dolk]]" painted abandoned buildings in at the [[Lofoten islands]].

After securing the cooperation of local developers in spring 2012, the project started getting permission from individual property owners to decorate buildings. The name "Komafest" plays on the notion of the houses being roused from their sleep by the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6124905.ece] Finnmarken: Tar street art til verdens ende&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moving bus Vardø komafest.jpg|thumb|right|Vardø mayor Lasse Haughom ([[Progress Party (Norway)|FRP)]] beside the moving-bus installation]] --&gt;

==The festival==

Although substantial financing had been secured from, among others, the Northern Norway Artists' Centre, much of the daily activity relied on volunteer work and free use of privately owned heavy equipment, including lifts and cranes. "Pøbel" himself insisted the festival was as much about the locals and the town as it was the art, saying he hoped that the festival would be a catalyst for renovation and increased enthusiasm for local history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/troms_og_finnmark/1.8241059] NRK: I denne byen har Pøbel frie tøyler&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, the 100-year-old municipal cinema, closed for over 20 years and used as a warehouse, was cleared and used to host a lecture by author Tristan Manco and screen street art films.

After the opening weekend, the festival secured financing, equipment and political permission to realise the long-planned idea of planting an old bus next to the underwater tunnel that leads to Vardø. The bus was previously used to transport families and their belongings out of Vardø during the era of mass de-population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/kulturliv/article6164378.ece] Finnmarken: Setter punktum for Vardøs fraflytting&lt;/ref&gt;

This list documents all 998 mythical, historical and notable women whose names are displayed on the handmade white tiles of the ''Heritage Floor'' as part of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' art installation (1979); there is also one man listed, [[Kresilas]], who was mistakenly included in the installation as he was thought to have been a woman called Cresilla. The names appear as they are spelled on the floor. Since 2007 the installation has been on permanent exhibition in the [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York.

'''MacDougall's''' is a privately owned international [[auction house]] based in [[London]], [[England]]. Founded in 2004, it is one of Britain's youngest, but fastest growing auction houses.&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;[http://www.macdougallauction.com/media/telegraphfeb10.pdf Daily Telegraph 23 Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125035928/http://macdougallauction.com/media/telegraphfeb10.pdf |date=2010-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With around 20 million pounds per year in auction sales, MacDougall's is now the 5th or 6th largest auction house in Britain, and consistently one of the three largest in the world for its speciality: Russian Art.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt;  The firm has its salerooms in [[London]] and representatives in [[Paris]], [[Moscow]], and [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name="WS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041209033204/http://macdougallauction.com/ Company Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

As it held its first auction in November 2004, the firm is relatively young.  However, with most of the staff speaking Russian, with leading art experts based in Russia, and given the founders' experience as Russian Art collectors, it has been able to exploit this specialist niche and grow quickly.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt; 
 
Two seasons of Russian Art Sales in London - June and December - dominate the world market for Russian Art, with specialised sales at [[Sotheby's]], [[Christie's]], MacDougall's and [[Bonham's]].  In 2008 MacDougall's reached second place behind Sotheby's, while in December 2009, it outsold all three competitors in Russian paintings.&lt;ref name="DT" /&gt; 
 
In June 2010, MacDougall's sold 900,000 pounds' worth of [[icon]]s, the largest icon sale of the year, and held its inaugural auction of Russian Works on Paper, the world's first specialist sale in this sector, raising over 1.5m pounds.&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101125082814/http://macdougallauction.com/media/bloomberg11june.htm "Battling Russian Billionaires Push London Art Auctions Up 90%", Bloomberg, June 11 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Uncle Oswald''''' is an adult novel written by [[Roald Dahl]].

The novel stars [[Uncle Oswald]], a character who previously appeared in "[[The Visitor (Roald Dahl)|The Visitor]]" and "[[Bitch (short story)|Bitch]]", two short stories also written by Roald Dahl (and which can be both found in the book ''[[Switch Bitch]]''). Dahl's novel was published in 1979.

== Plot summary==
{{expand section|date=March 2012}}
Oswald Hendryks Cornelius, an extremely attractive and wealthy bounder, was the greatest fornicator of his time. In this instalment of his scorchingly frank memoirs, Uncle Oswald recounts his discovery of the sexually invigorating properties of the Sudanese Blister Beetle, and his cunning plan to steal what men are most willing to give away. Oswald and his partner in crime, the seductive and beautiful Yasmin Howcomely, travel all over Europe to retrieve the sperm of powerful, rich and artistic men.

They freeze the sperm with the plan of selling it to rich women who wish to create children using the genes of the rich and intelligent.

Oswald's accomplice tried to use the aphrodisiac on [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]] of Norway, but her plan misfires when she accidentally eats the aphrodisiac carrying chocolate she intended to serve the king. She gets thrown out of the king's castle after she falls into a temporary state of [[nymphomania]] and tries to rape him.

==Characters==
===Uncle Oswald===
{{main|Uncle Oswald}}
''Oswald Hendryks Cornelius'': The nameless narrator has revealed snippets of the lovable, lascivious Uncle Oswald's life in other collections, but this is the only novel—brief though it is—dedicated solely to the diaries of "the greatest fornicator of all time." Inspired by stories of the aphrodisiac powers of the Sudanese blister beetle, the palpable seductiveness of the lovely Yasmin Howcomely, and the scientific know-how of Professor A. R. Woresley, Uncle Oswald anticipates the concept of the Nobel sperm bank by some 40 years, flim-flamming crowned heads, great artists, and eccentric geniuses into making "donations." The life of a commercial sperm broker has a few surprises even for a sophisticated bon vivant, and Dahl manages his signature sting-in-the-tail ending even in one of his lightest comic works.

==Reception==
In his 1980 review, [[Vance Bourjaily]] said:&lt;ref&gt;Bourjaily, Vance (1980), "Civilized Ribaldry," ''The New York Times,'' 20 April 1980, p. BR4&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|What can be said is that "My Uncle Oswald" provides four or five hours of effortless reading and some amusing scenes, mostly of the kind film makers have taught us to call soft porn—so soft, indeed, that at times they turn out almost fluffy.

The tone is that of a gentleman telling ribald anecdotes to his male guests after dinner. The leer is civilized... the dialog gets mean and raunchy, but the physical detail is kept decorous.... Mr. Dahl's guests are not invited to vicarious orgy, then, nor will they hear a disguised lecture by a wicked satirist of morals and manners.... Summer reading.}}

[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] called it "a festival of bad taste that is at heart so innocent that we soon forgive it and enjoy ourselves," "thoroughly juvenile fun," and said "I haven't had so much fun of this sort since my last all-night joke-telling session at summer camp."&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher (1980), "Books of the Times," ''The New York Times,'' 29 April 1980, p. C9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Memoirs from Beyond the Grave'''}}) is the [[memoir]] of [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] (1768–1848), collected and published posthumously in two volumes in 1849 and 1850, respectively. Chateaubriand was a writer, politician, diplomat, and historian who is regarded as the founder of French [[Romanticism]].

Although the work shares characteristics with earlier French "memoirs" (like the ''Memoirs'' of [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]), the ''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe'' are also inspired by the ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: in addition to providing a record of political and historical events, Chateaubriand includes details of his private life and his personal aspirations.

The work abounds in instances of the poetic prose at which Chateaubriand excelled. On the other hand, the melancholy of the autobiography helped establish Chateaubriand as the idol of the young French Romantics; a young [[Victor Hugo]] wrote: "I will be Chateaubriand or nothing."

== Genesis of the work ==
[[Image:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|''Chateaubriand Meditating on the Ruins of Rome'' (c. 1810s) by [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]. Oil on canvas.]]
	
It was while in [[Rome]] at the close of 1803 that Chateaubriand decided to write his memoirs; however, he did not begin writing them until 1809, and even then demands from other projects slowed his progress. In 1817 he returned to the memoirs. The first manuscript, probably written while he was serving as ambassador to [[London]], did not reach completion until 1826. At this point, he intended to entitle the book ''Memories of My Life''.

In 1830, however, Chateaubriand decided to change the scope of the work, revising the title to ''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe'', making a thorough revision of the original text, and writing several new volumes. He divided his life before 1830 into three periods: soldier and traveler, novelist, and statesman. The project had by now become more ambitious; indeed, he tried to reproduce not only his personal exploits, but the epic historical and political events of the era.

==Publication==
After fragmented public readings of his work in [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s, in 1836 Chateaubriand yielded the rights to his work to a society that published it until his death, paying him accordingly. Having obtained this economic stability, he completed the work with a fourth set of volumes. In 1841 he wrote an ample conclusion.

Chateaubriand originally intended for the work to be published at least fifty years after his death, but his financial troubles forced him, in his words, "to mortgage [his] tomb".

==English translations==
There have been a number of English translations. British author Anthony Kline published a complete translation in 2005 that is freely available for non-commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/MEMOIRESDOUTRETOMBE |title=Memoires D'Outre Tomb |publisher= |author=François de Chateaubriand |year=2005 |page= |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Chateaubriand/Chathome.php |title=Mémoires d’Outre-Tombe |work=Poetry in Translation |author=Anthony Kline |date=2005 |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged translation by Robert Baldick was first published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1961, and later, in paperback, by Penguin books in 1972. A [[New York Review of Books]] edition translated by Alex Andriesse was published in 2018, covering the years 1768-1800 (first 12 of 42 books).

The '''National Institute on Media and the Family''' ('''NIMF'''), founded by psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] in 1996 and closed in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/national-institute-media-family-closing |title=1up.com |access-date=2010-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016091843/http://www.1up.com/news/national-institute-media-family-closing |archive-date=2012-10-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. It was a nonsectarian [[advocacy group]] which sought to monitor [[mass media]] for content that it deemed is harmful to children and families. The group characterized itself as "an international resource center for cutting-edge research and information" and denied playing any role in media [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mediafamily.org/about/index.shtml |title= Who We Are |accessdate=2007-01-16 |publisher= National Institute on Media and the Family |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061228181421/http://www.mediafamily.org/about/index.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MediaWise movement ==
The '''MediaWise''' movement is the publicity and community outreach arm of the NIMF. Through it the organization sponsors speaking engagements given by its staff throughout the country, although most events take place at educational and religious institutions in the state of [[Minnesota]]. David Walsh is notable as the spokesperson for the NIMF, having given numerous interviews to national news programs and newspapers in this capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mediafamily.org/about/biodavew.shtml |title= David Walsh, Ph.D. Bio |accessdate=2007-01-16 |publisher= National Institute on Media and the Family |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209104445/http://www.mediafamily.org/about/biodavew.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video Game Report Cards ===
The primary publication of the MediaWise movement is an annual report on the marketing, distribution, and impact of video games to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mediafamily.org/research/vgrc_index.shtml |title= Video Game Report Cards |accessdate= 2007-01-16 |publisher= National Institute on Media and the Family |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070116170309/http://www.mediafamily.org/research/vgrc_index.shtml |archivedate= 2007-01-16 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Video Game Report Card" comprises results to national surveys, summaries of recently completed research projects, and a [[Academic grading in North America|grade]]-based assessment of the [[Entertainment Software Association]]'s efforts to regulate the sales of video games to minors.

The 2005 MediaWise Video Game Report Card criticized the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]'s system of rating video games for age-appropriate conduct in its annual series of report cards, noting the scarcity of "Adults-Only" rated games and citing the perceived inadequacy in retailer enforcement. Several days after the report was released, the [[Parent-Teacher Association|United States National Parent Teacher Association]] issued a press release condemning it, stating that "[the report card] contained erroneous statements about National PTA's position on the Entertainment Software Rating Board's (ESRB) rating system. In fact, National PTA does not endorse NIMF's report. Further, it does not agree with the report's characterization of ESRB and its rating system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pta.org/ne_press_release_detail_1133460190390.html | title = National PTA Statement on Video Game Report Card | accessdate = 2006-10-14 | date = 2005-12-01 | work = pta.org }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

In 2005 the NIMF made the controversial claim that the video game industry was promoting cannibalism after analyzing stills and video clips from a [[zombie]]-themed game titled ''[[Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse]]''. Dr. Walsh was asked about this in a podcast interview with Dennis McCauley, owner of [[gamepolitics.com]]. During the interview Dr. Walsh did not acknowledge the NIMF's apparent error, instead claiming that video gamers tricked him into thinking there was cannibalism in the game.

In late 2003 Walsh proposed the coining of a [[neologism]] to fill what he sees is a gap in English vocabulary: ''killographic'', to be defined as the "graphic depiction of brutal violence."  This is intended as an analogy to "[[pornography|pornographic]]", which he defines as the "graphic depiction of sexual acts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mediafamily.org/mediawisecolumns/ke_mw.shtml | title = Killographic Entertainment | accessdate = 2006-09-02 | last = Walsh | first = David | authorlink=Dr. David Walsh |date = 2003 | publisher = National Institute on Media and the Family |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061213144323/http://www.mediafamily.org/mediawisecolumns/ke_mw.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This term has been the subject of considerable public debate.  Doug Lowenstein, head of the [[Entertainment Software Association]], described it as a "clever phrase", but noted that the average age of video gamers is 28, and that "as adults they should be allowed to pick their entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/fun.games/12/09/warning.videogames.reut/index.html | title = Group warns parents about 'killographic' games | accessdate = 2006-09-02 | date = 2003-12-09 | work = [[CNN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2005, The ESRB assigned a failing grade of "F" to NIMF for its seriously flawed Video Game Report Card released the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/about/news/12062005.jsp ESRB gives NIMFa failing grade]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESRB cited inaccuracies, incomplete and misleading statements, omission of material facts, and flawed research as key factors in assigning the failing grade. In addition to the overall failing grade, NIMF was given a demerit for elevating its political and media agenda over their stated concerns for consumer welfare, particularly those of kids and teens.

'''''New Directions for Women''''' was an important early [[feminism|feminist]] newspaper.  It began as a [[mimeograph]]ed newsletter in 1972 in [[New Jersey]], but soon expanded into a tabloid-sized quarterly newspaper. Edited by Paula Kassell of Dover, a member of the Morristown chapter of [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW), the paper offered news reports from a feminist perspective as well as book reviews, [[women's history]] articles, and editorials, and was the first national feminist newspaper in the United States. After years of struggling to attain financial stability, the newspaper discontinued publishing in 1993.&lt;ref name="shs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/invent/4031.pdf|title=Records of New Directions for Women|publisher=[[State Historical Society of Missouri]]|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Cara.

A straight line joining unmoved points defines a unique axis of rotation, unless symmetry operations do not allow any rotation at all, such as mirror symmetry, in which case, the polar direction must be parallel to any mirror planes.

The term '''pop-up book''' is often applied to any [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] or movable book, although properly the umbrella term '''''movable book''''' covers ''pop-ups'', ''transformations'', ''tunnel books'', ''volvelles'', ''flaps'', ''pull-tabs'', ''pop-outs'', ''pull-downs'', and more, each of which performs in a different manner.  Also included, because they employ the same techniques, are three-dimensional [[greeting card]]s.

== Pop-up types ==
[[File:Popup-diagram.svg|thumb|A geometric diagram of the basic principle of a pop-up book: the [[parallelogram]].]]
Design and creation of such books in arts is sometimes called "paper engineering".  This usage should not be confused with traditional [[paper engineering]], the engineering of systems to mass-produce paper products.

The artistic aspect of paper engineering is related to [[origami]] in that the two arts both employ folded paper. However, origami in its simplest form doesn't use scissors or glue and tends to be made with very foldable paper; by contrast, pop-ups rely more on glue, cutting, and stiff card stock.  What they have in common is folding.

=== Animated books===
Animated books combine three elements: story, colored illustrations which include text, and "two or more animated illustrations with their movement mechanisms working between a doubled page.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wehr|first1=Paul|title=Moving Illustrations: The Paper Engineering of Julian Wehr|url=http://www.wehranimations.com/moving.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2016|page=2|date=September 17, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501150315/http://wehranimations.com/moving.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Julian Wehr]]'s animations for children's books were patented as "moving illustrations" that move the picture up and down and horizontally at the same time with a single movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to the Papers of Julian Wehr, 1885-2004, n.d.

=== Transformations===
'''Transformations''' show a scene made up of vertical slats. When a reader pulls a tab on the side, the slats slide under and over one another to "transform" into a totally different scene. [[Ernest Nister]], one of the early English children's book authors, often produced books solely of transformations. Many of these have been reproduced by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

===Volvelles===
{{main article|Volvelle}}
'''Volvelles''' are paper constructions with rotating parts. An early example is the ''Astronomicum Caesareum'', by [[Petrus Apianus]], which was made for the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] in 1540. The book is full of nested circular pieces revolving on grommets.

===Tunnel books===
[[File:Lane's Telescopic View - The Ceremony of Her Majesty Opening the Great Exhibition (open).jpg|thumb|upright|Tunnel book]]

'''Tunnel books''' (also called '''peepshow books''') consist of a set of pages bound with two folded concertina strips on each side and viewed through a hole in the cover. Openings in each page allow the viewer to see through the entire book to the back, and images on each page work together to create a dimensional scene inside. This type of book dates from the mid-18th century and was inspired by theatrical stage sets. Traditionally, these books were often created to commemorate special events or sold as souvenirs of tourist attractions. (The term "tunnel book" derives from the fact that many of these books were made to commemorate the building of the tunnel under the [[Thames River]] in London in the mid-19th century.) In the United States, tunnel books were made for such attractions as [[World's Fair]]s and the [[New York Botanical Gardens]].

Recently the tunnel book format has been resurrected by book artist [[Carol Barton]] and others as a sculptural book form. Artists are interested not only in the book's interior views, but also in treating the side accordions and covers as informational and visual surfaces
A selection of tunnel books by [[Carol Barton]] is archived in the special collections of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]'s James Branch Cabell Library.

== History ==
The audience for early movable books were adults, not children. The first known movable in a book was created by Benedictine monk [[Matthew Paris]] in his ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', which covers a period beginning in 1240. Paris attached volvelles onto some of the pages which were used by the monks to help calculate holy days. It is speculated that the Catalan mystic and poet [[Ramon Llull]], of Majorca, also used volvelles to illustrate his theories in the early 14th century,&lt;ref name=AllTIME&gt;Allie Townsend, [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2049243_2048646_2048993,00.html Pop-Up Book], in "All-TIME 100 Greatest Toys," ''Time'', February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but no physical example of a paper volvelle created by him has ever been documented.  Throughout the centuries volvelles have been used for such diverse purposes as teaching [[anatomy]], making [[astronomical]] predictions, creating secret code, and [[fortune-telling|telling fortunes]]. By 1564 another movable [[astrological]] book titled ''Cosmographia Petri Apiani'' had been published. In the following years, the medical profession made use of this format, illustrating anatomical books with layers and flaps showing the human body. The English landscape designer [[Capability Brown]] made use of flaps to illustrate "before and after" views of his designs.

While it can be documented that books with movable parts had been used for centuries, they were almost always used in scholarly works. In 1775 [[Thomas Malton]] published ''A Compleat Treatise on Perspective in Theory and Practice, on the Principles of Dr. Brook Taylor''. ''A Compleat Treatise on Perspective'' is the earliest known commercially produced pop-up book since it contains three-dimensional paper mechanisms. The pop-ups are activated by pulling string and form geometric shapes used to aid the reader in understanding the concept of perspective.

It was not until the very late 18th century that these techniques were applied to books designed for entertainment, particularly for children.

Some of the first three-dimensional and tab activated books were produced by Ernest Nister and [[Lothar Meggendorfer]].  These books were popular in Germany and Britain during the 19th century.

The great leap forward in the field of pop-up books came in 1929 with the publication of the ''Daily Express Children's Annual'' Number 1 "with pictures that spring up in model form".  This was produced by Louis Giraud and Theodore Brown.  Four more ''Daily Express Annuals'' followed and then Giraud setup his own publishing house, Strand Publications, this produced the groundbreaking series of Bookano books.  The Bookano books are considered the first, true pop-up books for children because the pop-ups can be viewed from a full 360 degrees, not just the front side facing the viewer. There were seventeen Bookanos before the series came to an end with the death of Giraud in 1949.

In the United States, in the 1930s, Harold Lentz followed Giraud's lead with the production of the Blue Ribbon books in New York.  He was the first publisher to use the term "pop-up" to describe their movable illustrations.&lt;ref name=KingWSJ&gt;Steven Miller, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125902884513660749 Waldo Hunt, 1920-2009; The 'King of the Pop-Ups' Made Books Spring to Life], ''The Wall Street Journal'', November 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montanaro&gt;Ann Montanaro, [http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/libs/scua/montanar/p-intro.htm "A Concise History of Pop-up and Movable Books"], ''The Pop-up World of Ann Montanaro'' (exhibition), Rutgers University Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next advance in the field was made by the astoundingly prolific [[Vojtěch Kubašta]] working in Prague in the 1960s. His lead was followed by [[Waldo Hunt]] in the US with his founding of Graphics International.&lt;ref name=KingWSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; He and two companies he established, Graphics International and Intervisual Books, produced hundreds of pop-up books for children between the 1960s and 1990s. Although intended for US audiences, these books were assembled in areas with lower labor costs: initially in [[Japan]] and later in [[Singapore]] and [[Latin America]]n countries such as [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]].  Hunt's first pop-up book was ''Bennett Cerf's Pop-Up Riddle Book'', published by [[Random House]] as a promotion for [[Maxwell House|Maxwell House Coffee]] and showcasing the work of humorist [[Bennett Cerf]], who was then president of Random House.&lt;ref name=KingWSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; The team of Waldo Hunt and [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] created a total of 30 more children's pop-up books for publication by Random House, including books that featured ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters. According to Bennett Cerf (in his book ''At Random''), pop-up books were profitable for Random House.&lt;ref name=KingWSJ/&gt;

In addition to his collaborations with Christopher Cerf at Random House, Hunt produced pop-up books for [[Walt Disney]], a series of pop-up books based on [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], and titles such as ''Haunted House'' by [[Jan Pienkowski]] and ''The Human Body'' by [[David Pelham]].&lt;ref name=KingWSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Valerie J.

An exhibition of pop-up books curated by [[Carol Barton]] was shown at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's]] [[Cooper-Hewitt Museum]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olmert|first1=Michael|title=The Smithsonian book of books|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89599-030-X|page=233|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her pop-up books, movable books, and tunnel books are in the collections of [[The Getty Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert Museum in London]], [[The Smithsonian Institution]], and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

==Notable works==
Some pop-up books receive attention as literary works for the degree of artistry or sophistication which they entail. One example is ''[[Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy]]'', by [[Matthew Reinhart]]. This book received literary attention for its elaborate pop-ups, and the skill of its imagery, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' saying that "calling this sophisticated piece of engineering a 'pop-up book' is like calling the Great Wall of China a partition".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/Pogue-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=authors&amp;oref=slogin "A Galaxy in Your Face"], ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', November 11, 2007, children's book section.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1967 Random House publication ''[[Andy Warhol's Index]]'', was produced by [[Andy Warhol]], Chris Cerf and Alan Rinzler, and included photos of celebrities together with pop-up versions of Warholesque images such as a cardboard [[tin can|can]] of [[tomato paste]],&lt;ref name=KingWSJ/&gt; as well as a plastic tear-out recording, an inflatable silver balloon, and other novelties.

Pop-up book artist [[Colette Fu]] designed China's largest pop-up book. In 2008, she was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to create pop-up books of the 25 ethnic minorities residing in Yunnan Province, China. Her work can be found in the Library of Congress, Metropolitan Museum of Art and National Museum of Women in the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/11/an-elaborate-pop-up-book-about-life-in-china/|title=A Mind-Blowing Pop-Up Book Shows China’s Vanishing Tribes|last=Stinson|first=Liz|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==
Since 1993, the [[Movable Book Society]] has provided a forum for artists, book sellers, book producers, collectors, curators, and others to share enthusiasm and exchange information about pop-up and movable books.  The organization also awards industry prizes for best paper engineer (trade and artists’ book) and excellence in paper engineering by an undergraduate or graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Movable Book Society|url=http://www.movablebooksociety.org/|website=www.movablebooksociety.org|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pretty Little Mistakes''''' is a book written by [[Heather McElhatton]] and published on May 1, 2007 by [[HarperCollins]].

The novel is written in [[Second-person narrative]] and allows the reader to direct where the story will go, similar to the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] book series.  The book has more than 150 possible endings.  50% of the endings are "good" and 50% are "bad".  After an introduction to the story, the reader is asked to determine the protagonist's next course of action. After the reader makes a choice, the plot branches out leading to more decisions and eventually multiple possible endings.  Endings include the death of the protagonist and/or companions of the main character.

{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa. ''Introduction to Public Speaking.''{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Although there is evidence of public speech training in ancient [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Womack|first1=Morris M.|last2=Bernstein|first2=Elinor|title=Speech for Foreign Students|date=1990|publisher=C.C.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

'''''Sunset at Montmajour''''' is a landscape in [[oil painting|oils]] painted by the Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] on July 4, 1888.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24014186 |title=New Vincent Van Gogh painting identified |accessdate=9 September 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Long-lost Van Gogh painting unveiled in Amsterdam|url=http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/long-lost-van-gogh-painting-unveiled-amsterdam|work=AFP|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911233449/http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/long-lost-van-gogh-painting-unveiled-amsterdam|archivedate=11 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Van Gogh Painting Unveiled in Amsterdam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/design/new-van-gogh-painting-discovered-in-amsterdam.html?_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted while the artist was at [[Arles]], France and depicts a landscape of [[garrigue]] with the ruins of [[Montmajour Abbey]] in the background.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The painting is {{convert|73.3|x|93.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} and was on display from 24 September 2013 until 12 January 2014 as part of an exhibition at the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

Its authenticity was questioned several times before it was confirmed as a genuine van Gogh work in 2013. It is the first full-sized painting by Van Gogh to be newly confirmed since 1928.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite news|last=Sapa-AFP|title=Long lost Van Gogh discovered|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2013/09/10/long-lost-van-gogh-discovered|accessdate=11 September 2013|newspaper=Sunday Times|date=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting was inventoried among [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]]'s collection of his brother's works in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;The painting bears Theo's inventory number: 180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VGmus/&gt; It was sold in 1901,&lt;ref name=VGmus&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Gogh Museum discovers new painting by Vincent van Gogh: Sunset at Montmajour|url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=330726&amp;lang=en|work=Van Gogh Museum|accessdate=9 September 2013|authorlink=Van Gogh Museum|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which there is no enduring record of its ownership or [[provenance]]. The painting seemingly became "lost" though it was purchased shortly thereafter.

In 1908 a [[Norway|Norwegian]] industrialist, [[Christian Nicolai Mustad]], who believed it to be the work of van Gogh,&lt;ref name=AFP1/&gt; purchased and displayed the painting at his home. According to Mustad's family, the French ambassador to [[Sweden]], while a guest at Mustad's home, advised that it probably was not by van Gogh.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; At that time Mustad took it down from display. The painting remained stored in his attic until Mustad's death, when it reappeared as part of his estate.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott|first=Mark|title='New' Van Gogh Painting Identified; Was in a Norwegian Attic|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/09/220625774/|date=9 September 2013|publisher=NPR|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the painting was shown to staff at the Van Gogh Museum, but it was dismissed as not the work of van Gogh because it was not signed.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; With the development of improved investigative techniques, however, in 2011 a two-year investigation was launched by the Van Gogh Museum to examine the possible authenticity of the painting.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegal|first=Nina|title=Museum Identifies New Van Gogh Painting in Amsterdam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/design/new-van-gogh-painting-discovered-in-amsterdam.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1378733687-TfBqJ4zhlBSFDSOo/0huDw|work=New York Times|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was subjected to a detailed investigation of style and materials. It was discovered to have been painted in the same range of paints that appears in works by van Gogh at that period,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; which led to further research. Among the evidence that confirmed the painting's authenticity was [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|a letter]] written by Vincent van Gogh to his brother Theo on 5 July 1888, describing a landscape that he had painted the previous day: 
{{quote|"Yesterday, at sunset, I was on a stony heath where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill, and wheatfields in the valley. It was romantic, it couldn’t be more so, à la [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Monticelli]], the sun was pouring its very yellow rays over the bushes and the ground, absolutely a shower of gold. And all the lines were beautiful, the whole scene had a charming nobility. You wouldn’t have been at all surprised to see knights and ladies suddenly appear, returning from hunting with hawks, or to hear the voice of an old Provençal troubadour. The fields seemed purple, the distances blue.

'''''The Diary of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''''' is a record of [[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]]'s thoughts during 1964, a year that included his [[hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]] and two trips to Africa. The diary was scheduled for publication in 2013, but a legal dispute between the publisher and some of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's daughters resulted in a delay.

==Diary==
The diary is part of the collection of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's papers that his daughters loaned to the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]], a division of the [[New York Public Library]], in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/10/malcolm-x-diary-publication-lawsuit-family |title=Family of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Sues to Prevent Publication of Diary |first=Karen |last=McVeigh |date=November 10, 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the private journal kept by the human rights leader during 1964, a year he largely spent traveling in Africa and the Middle East,&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2013/1113/Malcolm-X-s-diary-Can-it-be-published-without-his-family-s-permission |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's Diary: Can It Be Published Without His Family's Permission? |first=Husna |last=Haq |date=November 13, 2013 |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and scholars consider it "a document of incalculable historical importance".&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/60091-diary-of-malcolm-x-delayed-by-court-order.html |title='Diary of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X' Delayed by Court Order |first=Eugene |last=Holley Jr. |date=November 21, 2013 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Third World Press]] launched an [[Indiegogo]] campaign to raise money to help publish the diary, which was edited by journalist [[Herb Boyd]] and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's daughter [[Ilyasah Shabazz]]. Publication was expected on November 15, 2013.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

==Lawsuit==
Days before the scheduled publication date, Third World Press was sued by X&amp;nbsp;Legacy LLC, a corporation that represents the daughters of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. X&amp;nbsp;Legacy won a temporary restraining order, claiming Third World Press did not have the right to publish the book. Third World Press said it had a valid, signed contract. An unnamed source familiar with the suit said the plaintiffs were "probably [Ilyasah’s sisters] [[Attallah Shabazz|Attallah]], [[Qubilah Shabazz|Quibilah]], and Gamela Shabazz", adding that of the remaining sisters, Malaak supported Ilyasah and Malikah was not involved.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;

At a hearing on November 22, Judge [[Laura Taylor Swain]] extended the restraining order until a hearing can be held in January 2014. Lawyers for X&amp;nbsp;Legacy said that there had been reports that Third World Press was selling the diary online despite the restraining order, a claim denied by the publisher's lawyer. The publisher's lawyer argued at the hearing that they had a contract with one of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's daughter's to publish the diary; a lawyer for X&amp;nbsp;Legacy said that no contract was valid unless all six daughters agreed.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegrio.com/2013/11/25/malcolm-x-diary-sale-ban-extended-indefinitely/ |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Diary Sale Ban Extended Indefinitely |first=Larry |last=Neumeister |date=November 25, 2013 |publisher=[[Associated Press]], via [[The Grio]] |accessdate=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

X&amp;nbsp;Legacy said it intends to publish the diary in February 2015, the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; After this announcement, the final disputes were resolved and the diary went on sale in the fall of 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8751">'''The Pastellists''' was an organization of artists that formed in [[New York City|New York]] at the end of 1910 for the purpose of exhibiting artwork produced in the medium of [[pastel]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Artist's Society", American Art News (December 17, 1910) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;  The group helped organize four exhibitions in New York between 1910 and 1914 before disbanding in 1915.  Some  Pastellist members are credited with the initial idea for the exhibition that later became the 1913 [[Armory Show]], the first major exhibition of European modernism in America.&lt;ref name=lehman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Robert Lehman Collection|last=Pope-Hennessy|first=John Wyndham|year=1987|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York |oclc=13642651 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Leon Dabo in his studio.jpg|thumb|''[[Leon Dabo]] in his studio,'' c. 1910]]
Many artists worked in pastel but few organizations were promoting or including pastel works in their annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Pastels in the Metropolitan Museum of Art | first=Doreen (Editor) | last=Bolger | publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York | year=1989 | ISBN=0-87099-547-2 | page=20 | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=PGRWSZbbB5bCyQTDnvwi&amp;client=safari&amp;id=fKNQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22american+pastels+in+the+metropolitan%22&amp;q=dabo&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibit at the [[Rand School]], organized by [[Leon Dabo]] in 1909 and the [[Exhibition of Independent Artists]], organized by [[Robert Henri]], in 1910, had fostered a desire among artists to present more personal work and exhibit irrespective of the expectations of conservative organizations like the [[National Academy]].&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{cite book | title=Robert Henri: His Life and Art |  first=Bennard B. | last=Perlman |  publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=1991 | ISBN=0-486-26722-9 | page=94 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOCYTyD2_cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Robert+Henri&amp;ei=KRNXSbe1KZfUzATGnoA_&amp;client=safari#PPA94,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Dabo became leader of The Pastellists.&lt;ref&gt;"Pastellists," ''American Art Annual'' (1911), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

A diary kept by the secretary/treasurer of the Pastellists, artist [[Elmer Livingston MacRae]], records the activities of the young group during their first two exhibitions.  The president was Leon Dabo and the Board of Control included [[Jerome Myers]], [[Everett Shinn]], and [[Juliet Thompson]].  Mr. Dabo engaged his lawyer and artist friend Henry Wellington Wack to draw up the papers for incorporation, which were agreed upon at a members meeting on February 15, 1911.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; There are no known records by MacRae or other artists of the member meetings or the later exhibitions.&lt;ref name="AP b"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Pastels in the Metropolitan Museum of Art | first=Doreen (Editor) | last=Bolger | publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York | year=1989 | ISBN=0-87099-547-2 | page=30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=PGRWSZbbB5bCyQTDnvwi&amp;client=safari&amp;id=fKNQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22american+pastels+in+the+metropolitan%22&amp;q=dabo&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two exhibitions, were held at the Folsom Galleries and according to the MacRae diaries, met with good reviews and high attendance. ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the second show "surpasses in interest its predecessor, which certainly was sufficiently charming."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;"Art at Home and Abroad", ''[[The New York Times]]'', Magazine Section Part Five, Page SM15, December 17, 1911. Available online at ''[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/17/104886838.pdf The New York Times]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A "striking and important" work was ''L'enfant a l'orange'' by [[Mary Cassatt]]; ''Big Wave Design'' by [[Arthur Bowen Davies]] had "vigor and free handling, with the addition of a feeling for great rhythms".&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

[[File:National-arts-club.jpg|thumb|left|The [[National Arts Club]], 15 [[Gramercy Park]], [[New York City]], venue for the fourth exhibition.]]

The daily newspapers chronicled the activities of the Pastellists and we do know that the third exhibition was held at Powell Art Gallery and artists like [[Arthur B. Davies]], [[Walt Kuhn]], and Edward Adam Kramer had become regular exhibitors. Guests like [[Gutzon Borglum]] showing some large figure works and [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]] with "his cube forms, his weird women, his astonishing color schemes", caused such a stir that one critic wrote that the show was “the best exhibition yet held by the progressive and gifted artists constituting this group.”&lt;ref&gt;"The Pastellists' Show", ''The Evening Mail'', February 24, 1912, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth exhibition, held at the [[National Arts Club]], was a sister exhibit to a Contemporary Art Exhibition held in the main galleries at the same time.

[[File:Flowers in a Green Vase by Leon Dabo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leon Dabo]], ''Flowers in a Green Vase'', pastel]]By 1915 the [[American Art Annual]] listed the Pastellists as "Inactive."&lt;ref name="AP c"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Pastels in the Metropolitan Museum of Art | first=Doreen (Editor) | last=Bolger | publisher=Harry N.

An account states that one evening after a successful day at the second Pastellist exhibition, a few of the artists began to discuss forming a larger organization of artists, that would include not only easel painter but sculptors as well.&lt;ref name="AP c"/&gt;  The new organization was to exist for the express purpose of mounting large scale exhibitions, using the same progressive ideas of the Pastellists and the MacDowell exhibits, creating shows that would rival the more conservative juried exhibitions of the [[National Academy]].&lt;ref name="RH"/&gt;  Like the American Painters and Sculptors, the Pastellists may not have been in existence very long but the impact they had on the American art scene, reached far into the future.

==Pastel==
{{main|Pastel}}

Pastel is an [[art medium]] in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered [[pigment]] and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]]. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph. The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques. Viking Adult; 5th revised and updated edition, 1991. {{ISBN|0-670-83701-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tribute in Light in 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|In 2010, as seen from [[Brooklyn]].]]
The '''''Tribute in Light''''' is an art installation of 88 [[searchlight]]s placed six blocks south of the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]] on top of the Battery Parking Garage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tribute in Light|url=https://www.911memorial.org/tribute-light|website= 9/11 Memorial||publisher= National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|accessdate= June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]] to create two vertical columns of light to represent the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] in remembrance of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref name=godark&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/will-the-tribute-in-light-go-dark-after-08/|publisher=New York Times|title=Will ''Tribute in Light'' Go Dark After ’08?|date=September 11, 2007|first=Sewell|last=Chan|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tribute in Light'' began initially as a temporary commemoration of the attacks in early 2002 but became an annual commemoration, currently produced on September 11th by the [[Municipal Art Society]] of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html|website=creativetime.org|publisher=Creative Time, Inc.|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute in Light|url=https://www.mas.org/programs/tribute-in-light/|website=mas.org|publisher=The Municipal Art Society of New York|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On clear nights, the lights can be seen from over {{Convert|60|mi}} away, visible in all of [[New York City]] and most of suburban [[North Jersey|Northern New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]]. The lights can also be seen in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], as well as [[Westchester County|Westchester]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties in [[New York State|New York]]. The beams have been clearly visible as far north as the terrace at Century Country Club in [[Purchase, New York]], from at least as far west as western [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], in [[Flanders, New Jersey]], at least as far east as the barrier beach of [[Fire Island]] in [[Suffolk County, New York]] on Long Island, and as far south near [[Trenton, New Jersey]] in nearby [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035010/9-11-anniversary-Tribute-Light-rises-New-York.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Lee | last=Moran | title=Twinkling tribute to the Twin Towers: World Trade Center rises in poignant pillars of light as New York makes final preparations for 9/11 anniversary | date=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two beams cost approximately $1,626 (assuming $0.11 per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]) to run for 24 hours. There are 88 xenon spotlights (44 for each tower) which each consume 7,000 [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chaban|first1=Matt|title=The End of Tribute in Light: Memorial Goes Dark Forever on 9/12|url=http://observer.com/2011/08/the-end-of-tribute-in-light-memorial-goes-dark-forever-on-912/|website=observer.com|publisher=Observer|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Tribute in Light (10092).jpg|thumb|Tribute in Light set up atop Battery Parking Garage in 2018]]
The idea of two vertical beams of light was first suggested by Ezra Orion, an Israeli sculptor, in 1997. Orion proposed an art installation in which 120 Xenon searchlights were to be placed on the tops of the Twin Towers for the 1998 [[4th of July]] celebration.  On September 25th, 1997, Orion met with Richard Hart, the president of Xenotech Lighting, and the municipal art adviser, at the top of the south tower.  Although the response to Orion’s suggestion was enthusiastic, it was deemed too expensive. 

The ''Tribute in Light'' initially ran as a temporary installation from March 11 to April 14, 2002, and ran again on September 11, 2003 to mark the second anniversary of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/tribute_in_light_shines_bright_every_year_since_20.html | location= | work=NJ.com | first=John | last=Munson | title=Tribute in Light shines bright every year since 2002 | date=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been repeated every year on September 11. It was announced that 2008 would be its final year,&lt;ref name=godark&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but the tribute was continued in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=NY1.com|title=September 11th Tribute Lights Up Again|url=http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx"|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914135857/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx|archivedate=September 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009, it was confirmed that the tribute would continue through to the tenth anniversary of the attacks in 2011, but continued again in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/tribute-in-light-will-keep-shining-this-year-and-the-next//|publisher=New York Times|title=‘Tribute in Light’ Will Keep Shining, This Year and the Next|date=September 10, 2010|first=David W.|last=Dunlap|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 23, 2012, plans are underway for the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] to assume the lease for the MTA property used during this tribute, and to begin transitioning operation of the tribute from the Municipal Art Society to the memorial foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Ted|title='Tribute' Handover|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443437504577545520666491842|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those working on the project came up with the concept in the week following the attack.  On September 13, 2001, the concept was introduced by John Englehart in a meeting with the crisis communications task force at the electric utility [[Consolidated Edison]], as a signal of support for the community.  Architects John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi of PROUN Space Studio distributed their "Project for the Immediate Reconstruction of Manhattan's Skyline". Artists Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda, who before September 11 were working on the 91st floor of the World Trade Center north tower on a proposed light sculpture on the giant radio antenna with [[Creative Time]], conceived of a project called "Phantom Towers". They were commissioned by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]],'' ([[Janet Froelich]], art director) to create an image of the project for its September 23 cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRIBUTE IN LIGHT|url=http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html|website=creativetime.org|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Nash Gould, a New York architect, presented the concept to the [[Municipal Art Society]]. On September 19, Municipal Art Society chairman [[Philip K. Howard]] wrote to Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], asking him "to consider placing two large searchlights near the disaster site, projecting their light straight up into the sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825172813/http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 25, 2010|title=Tribute In Light –  The Municipal Art Society of New York|publisher=|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some consideration, it was decided to contact lighting experts in the field of high intensity light displays. A [[Las Vegas]]-based company, Light America, was chosen because of their vast knowledge of high intensity light displays. Gary Evans, the VP of Light America, and Michael Burns, the designer of the ''Tribute in Light'', said that the company did testing of the lighting fixtures in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] before bringing the fixtures to the World Trade Center site.

The project was originally going to be named ''Towers of Light'', but the victims' families felt that the name emphasized the buildings destroyed instead of the people killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1857699.stm|title=Tribute in light to New York victims|accessdate=April 27, 2008 | work=BBC News | date=March 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A permanent fixture of the ''Tribute in Light'' was at one point intended to be installed on the roof of [[One World Trade Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom Tower rendering Time-lapse|url=http://www.wtc.com/media/videos|publisher=Silverstein Properties Inc.|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOM Freedom Tower Fact Sheet|url=http://www.renewnyc.com/content/pdfs/freedom_tower_fact_sheet.pdf|publisher=Lower Manhattan Development Corporation|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not included in the finished design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design changes to base, spire of 1 World Trade Center|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|publisher=''Fox New York''|accessdate=March 22, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317171748/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19229185/new-renderings-of-1-wtc-show-design-changes|archivedate=March 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, the generators that power ''Tribute in Light'' have been fueled with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected from local restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bevill|first1=Kris|title=Tri-State Biodiesel fuels Sept. 11 memorial|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/2726/tri-state-biodiesel-fuels-sept.-11-memorial/|publisher=Biodiesel Magazine|accessdate=September 12, 2017|date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on birds==
The [[light pollution]] from ''Tribute in Light'' has caused confusion for thousands of migrating birds, trapping them in the beams.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doren|first=Benjamin M.

==Media appearances==
''Tribute in Light'' was featured in [[Boyz II Men]]'s music video for "Color of Love". It made a notable appearance during the opening credits of [[Spike Lee]]'s 2002 film ''[[25th Hour]]''. It also appeared as a virtual memorial in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game for Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The tribute was also shown and referenced in the [[CBS]] series ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''.

[[File:Willie Warde-ILN-14Jan1911-p56.jpg|right|thumb|Warde in 1911]]
'''Willie Warde''' (1857 – 18 August 1943) was an English actor, dancer, singer and choreographer. The son of a dancer, his first theatre work was with a dance company. He was engaged to arrange dances for London productions and was later cast as a comic actor in musical theatre. He was associated for over two decades with the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Daly's Theatre|Daly's]] theatres under the management of [[George Edwardes]], playing in and choreographing [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and, later, [[Edwardian musical comedies]]. In later years he played character roles in [[West End theatre|West End]] comic plays.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Warde was born in [[Great Yarmouth]], Norfolk, in the east of England, the second son and third child of William Warde (died 1859), a professional dancer, actor and author&lt;ref name=mg&gt;''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', obituary, 28 August 1943, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and director of the Winchester [[music hall]] in south London.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 27 November 1859, p. 10; and 13 January 1894, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Warde's older siblings were John and Emma, both of whom were also dancers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'' 27 March 1853, p. 1; and 13 January 1894, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Warde followed his father's profession, and joined a dance troupe led by his brother-in-law [[John D'Auban]] (who choreographed many [[W. S. Gilbert]] works and had married Warde's sister Emma in 1871), with whom he appeared in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 27 January 1878, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Warde was choreographer for [[Ivan Caryll]]'s ''The Lily of Leoville'' at the [[Comedy Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 May 1886, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888, Warde was appearing as an actor. [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]] cast him in a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''[[Atalanta]]'' at the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] with [[Frank Wyatt (singer)|Frank Wyatt]] and Tom Squire.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' 26 December 1888, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; For the next twenty years, Warde maintained a dual career as choreographer and actor, as the Victorian musical theatre evolved from burlesque into [[Edwardian musical comedy]]. Away from the West End, he also occasionally undertook the stage direction of musical shows in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 20 September 1890, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting career===

For the Christmas season of 1889, Warde appeared at the [[Avenue Theatre]] in ''The Field of the Cloth of Gold''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 14 December 1889, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, he played the Bishop of Bovril in a burlesque entitled ''Joan of Arc, or the Merry Maid of Orleans'' (by [[Adrian Ross]] and J. L. Shine), under the management of [[George Edwardes]].

Warde participated in many of Edwardes's hit musical productions for more than twenty years thereafter, both as actor and choreographer.&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; At the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], he appeared in Edwardes's productions of ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894), ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 May 1898, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900)&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 February 1900, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901).  When Edwardes moved to [[Daly's Theatre]], Warde appeared in ''[[A Country Girl]]'' (1902), ''[[Les p'tites Michu|The Little Michus]]'' (1905),&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 22 February 1906, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 September 1909, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1910),&lt;ref name=Waltz&gt;''The Times'', 9 January 1911, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 22 May 1911, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Of Warde's performance in ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Mr Willie Warde's few, almost surreptitious, steps made Tantalus of us all.  Mr Willie Warde without a dance is like a hired Christmas cake that is to be looked at, not eaten",&lt;ref name=Waltz/&gt; Among other shows in which Warde appeared for different managements were [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''Pantaloon'' (1905), in which he created the role of [[Harlequin]],&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; and ''The Three Kisses'' (1907) by [[Percy Greenbank]], Leedham Bantock and [[Howard Talbot]], in which he appeared with [[Walter Passmore]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 25 August 1907, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choreography===
The term "choreographer" was not generally used at the time of Warde's career. Theatre programmes usually read, "The dances arranged by ...".  Shows for which Warde arranged the dances included the burlesques ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), in which he also appeared, and ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891).  In 1889, he arranged the dances for [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Savoy Theatre playbill, ''The Gondoliers'', 7 December 1889&lt;/ref&gt; The musical comedies that he choreographed included ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893);&lt;ref&gt;Daly's Theatre programme, 1894&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894);&lt;ref&gt;Gaiety Theatre programme, 1894&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896);&lt;ref&gt;Playbill, Daly's Theatre, 27 April 1896&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898);&lt;ref&gt;Playbill, Daly's Theatre, 8 June 1898&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Gaiety Girl'' (revival, 1899);&lt;ref&gt;Playbill, Daly's Theatre, 6 June 1899&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]] (1899);&lt;ref&gt;Savoy Theatre playbill, 26 May 1899&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[San Toy]]'' (1900);&lt;ref&gt;Playbill, Daly's Theatre, 16 February 1900&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Three Little Maids]]'' (1902); ''[[The Duchess of Dantzic]]'' (1903); and ''[[The Cingalee]]'' (1904), in which he also appeared.  He also arranged the dances for the hit English première of ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907)&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; and the Gaiety musical ''[[The Sunshine Girl]]'' (1912).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 25 February 1912, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
After [[World War I]], Warde played character roles in comedy, appearing with [[Ralph Lynn]] and [[Yvonne Arnaud]] in ''[[Tons of Money (play)|Tons of Money]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 16 April 1922, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; This was [[Tons of Money (1930 film)|filmed in 1930]], with Warde reprising his stage role of Giles. He later appeared with [[Seymour Hicks]] in [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''The Guardsman'' in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 22 June 1925, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks called Warde "One of the greatest artists I have ever met in my life. ... His pantomime was of the simplest but perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Powell, David. "The Savoy Choreographers (II)," ''The Savoyard'', Vol. XX, No. 2, September 1981, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In retirement, he took part in a [[BBC]] radio history of George Edwardes and the Gaiety in 1938, along with Hicks and [[Ellaline Terriss]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 14 June 1939, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Warde died in London at the age of 86.

'''''Young Ladies Beside the Seine (Summer)''''' (French - ''Les Demoiselles des bords de la Seine (été)'') is an oil on canvas painting by [[Gustave Courbet]]. He painted it between late 1856 and early 1857 and presented it to the [[Paris Salon]] jury, which accepted it and exhibited it on 15 June 1857 with two portraits and three landscapes by the same artist. It was bought by Courbet's friend and patron [[Étienne Baudry]] (1830-1908), then left by him to the painter's daughter Juliette, who left it to the French state in 1906. It now hangs in the [[Petit Palais]] in Paris. A smaller (96.5 x 130 cm) sketch version is now in the [[National Gallery, London]].
