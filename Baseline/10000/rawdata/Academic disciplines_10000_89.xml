      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10665">{{Technical|date=September 2018}}In [[political theory|political]] and [[social theory]], '''accelerationism''' is the idea that either the prevailing system of [[capitalism]], or certain technosocial processes that have historically characterised it, should be expanded, repurposed, or accelerated in order to generate radical social change. Some contemporary accelerationist philosophy takes as its starting point the [[Deleuze and Guattari|Deleuzo-Guattarian]] theory of [[deterritorialisation]], aiming to identify, deepen, and radicalise the forces of deterritorialisation with a view to overcoming the [[reterritorialization|countervailing tendencies]] that suppress the possibility of far-reaching social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolfendale |first=Peter |url=http://deontologistics.tumblr.com/post/91953882443/so-accelerationism-whats-all-that-about| title=So, Accelerationism, what's all that about? |website=Dialectical Insurgency&lt;!--Peter Wolfendale's personal blog --&gt; |year= 2014|access-date= 5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=November 2015}} Accelerationism may also refer more broadly, and usually pejoratively, to support for the deepening of capitalism in the belief that this will hasten its self-destructive tendencies and ultimately lead to its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaviro |first=Steven |year=2010 |title=Post Cinematic Affect |url= |location=Ropley |publisher=O Books |page= 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Jason |year=2013 |title=Occupy Time: Technoculture, Immediacy, and Resistance After Occupy Wall Street |url= |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page= 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerationist theory has been divided into mutually contradictory [[left-wing]] and [[right-wing]] variants.  "Left-accelerationism" attempts to press "the process of technological evolution" beyond the constrictive horizon of capitalism, for example by repurposing modern technology for socially beneficial and emancipatory ends; "right-accelerationism" supports the indefinite intensification of capitalism itself, possibly in order to bring about a [[technological singularity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/article_el-vertigen-acceleracionista-ii-entrevista-a-robin-mackay/|title=The Accelerationist Vertigo (II): Interview with Robin Mackay|first=Roc|last=Jiménez de Cisneros|publisher=[[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona]]|date=5 November 2014|access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/|title=#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO for an Accelerationist Politics|publisher=Critical Legal Thinking|first1=Alex|last1=Williams|first2=Nick|last2=Srnicek|date=14 May 2013|access-date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufblog.net/accelerate/|title=#Accelerate|date=13 February 2014|access-date=5 February 2015|first1=Nick|last1=Land|website=Urban Future (2.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

A number of philosophers have expressed apparently accelerationist attitudes, including [[Karl Marx]] in his 1848 speech "On the Question of Free Trade":
:But, in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/free-trade/ On the question of free trade], Speech to the Democratic Association of Brussels, 9 January 1848.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar vein, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] argued that "the leveling process of European man is the great process which should not be checked: one should even accelerate it...",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book |last=Strong |first=Tracy |year=1988 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of Transfiguration |url= |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |page= 211}} Original in ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' §898.&lt;/ref&gt; a statement often simplified, following Deleuze and Guattari, to a command to "accelerate the process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deleuze |first1=Gilles |last2=Guattari |first2=Félix |year=2004 |title=Anti-Oedipus |url= |location=London |publisher=Continuum |page= 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary accelerationism==

Prominent theorists include right-accelerationist [[Nick Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Quick-and-Dirty Introduction to Accelerationism|url = https://jacobitemag.com/2017/05/25/a-quick-and-dirty-introduction-to-accelerationism/|website = Jacobite Magazine|accessdate = 2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cybernetic Culture Research Unit]] (CCRU), an unofficial research unit at the [[University of Warwick]] from 1995–2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCRU|url = http://v2.nl/archive/organizations/ccru|website = V2_Institute for the Unstable Media|accessdate = 2015-10-09|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which Land was a member, is considered a key progenitor in both left- and right-accelerationist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwarz |first1=Jonas Andersson |year=2013 |title=Online File Sharing: Innovations in Media Consumption |url= |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent contemporary left-accelerationists include [[Nick Srnicek]] and Alex Williams, authors of the "Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = #ACCELERATE MANIFESTO for an Accelerationist Politics|url = http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/|website = Critical Legal Thinking|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Laboria Cuboniks collective, who authored the manifesto "Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = After Accelerationism: The Xenofeminist manifesto|url = http://tripleampersand.org/after-accelerationism-the-xenofeminist-manifesto/|website = &amp;&amp;&amp; Journal|accessdate = 2015-10-09|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along accelerationist lines, [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], in works such as ''[[PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future]]'', has tried to speculate about futures after capitalism. He declares that "[a]s with the end of feudalism 500 years ago, capitalism’s replacement by postcapitalism will be accelerated by external shocks and shaped by the emergence of a new kind of human being. And it has started." He considers that the rise of collaborative production will eventually help capitalism to kill itself.

Focusing on how information technology infrastructures undermine modern political geographies, and proposing an open-ended "design brief",  [[Benjamin H. Bratton]]'s book ''The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty'' is associated with accelerationism. [[Tiziana Terranova]]'s "Red Stack Attack!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euronomade.info/?p=2268|title=Red Stack Attack! Algorithms, Capital and the Automation of the Common {{!}} EuroNomade|website=www.euronomade.info|language=it-IT|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; links Bratton's stack model and left accelerationism.

'''Alan Marshall''' is a [[New Zealand]] author, artist and scholar working within the discipline of [[environmental studies]]. He is noted as a key scholar in [[environmental ethics|environmental philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, J.

For his research on these topics, the [[University of Wollongong]] awarded Marshall a doctorate and ''National Geographic'' assigned him as an explorer. Marshall has undertaken projects within institutes all around Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, he's held fellowships at [http://www.ifz.at/ias/IAS-STS/Fellows-and-Alumni/Alumni/Alan-Marshall IAS-STS] (Austria), the [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|State University of Nizhny Novgorod]] (Russia), [[University of Prešov|Prešov Universit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y &amp; [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik University|UPJŠ]] (Slovakia), [[Masaryk University]] (Czech Republic), [[Khalifa University|KUSTAR]] (Abu Dhabi), [[Nirex|Nirex UK]] (Great Britain), [[Curtin University|Curtin University of Technology]] (Australia), and [[Mahidol University]] (Thailand).





==Major projects==
In the 1990s Alan Marshall developed a [[postmodern]] version of the Human–Nature relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A (1998) 'A Postmodern Natural History of the World, Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science', Part C, Vol. 34 Part C, No 1, 137-164&lt;/ref&gt; one that throws into doubt the very concepts of 'Humanity' and 'Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A (2002) [https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p268 'The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science'], Imperial College Press/World Scientific: London &amp; Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Marshall's approach is heavily influenced by the science of [[ecology]] but has been criticized as privileging one school of ecology, i.e., '[[community ecology]]', over others such as [[systems ecology]] and the ecology of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]].&lt;ref&gt;de Laplante, K. (2004) Environmental Alchemy: How to turn Ecological Science into Ecological Philosophy, Environmental Ethics, Vol 26, Winter Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  His book ''The Unity of Nature''&lt;ref&gt;Alan Marshall (2002) ''[https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p268 The Unity of Nature]'', Imperial College Press/World Scientific: London &amp; Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the fiercest critiques of [[Systems theory|Systems Theory]] in general, and [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Theory]] and [[Chaos theory|Chaos Theory]] in particular.

In 2006, Alan Marshall founded The [[appropedia:Ecomimicry|Ecomimicry]] Project which tries to meld ecology with Green [[innovation]], sustainable art, and the ethics of [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance: A. Marshall (2007) ‘The Theory and Practice of Ecomimicry’, ''Sustaining Gondwana Working Paper Series'', Issue 3, publlished by Curtin University of Technology: Perth, or A. Marshall (2009) ''‘Wild Design: The Ecomimicry Project’'', published by North Atlantic Books: Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of designs that emerged from this project include:

* a Hemp Sail Battle Cruiser for the Royal Australian Navy (in which a navy ship had its engines 'designed-out' and in their stead it is powered by [[Sail|sails]] made from eco-friendly [[hemp]])
* a [[manure]]-powered swimming pool heating system (in which a luxury pool is heated by the composted [[Feces|body waste]] of the swimmers)
* a hairy-roofed [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain]] village where the architecture is adorned with an engineered protective material that mimics the fur of local [[Brown bear|brown bears.]]

These designs were compiled into Marshall's ''[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/107954/wild-design-by-alan-marshall/ Wild Design]'' book and then praised by the Australian art &amp; design media.&lt;ref&gt;Downton, P. (2009) Review of Wild Design, Artlink, Vol. 29, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wakely, M (2009) [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/bydesign/design-inspired-by-nature/3159490 Design Inspired By Nature], ABC Radio National's ''By Design'' program.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Marshall started the '[http://www.ecotopia2121.com/#!project-cities/c66t Ecotopia 2121]' project; which (as noted by ''CNN''&lt;ref&gt;CNN (2017) [https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/utopian-cities/index.html Utopian cities of the future re-imagine life on Earth], CNN Style/Architecture, January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;'', Vanity Fair''&lt;ref&gt;D'Alessio, O.

In 2015, the master-class part of this project conducted at Mahidol University was awarded the 2015 [[Kenneth Roemer|Kenneth M. Roemer]] Innovative Course Design Award by the [[Society for Utopian Studies]].

In early 2016, Marshall began a new project in urban ecology called [http://www.frankencities.com Frankencities]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strochlic|first=N.|date=2018|title=Voici à quoi pourraient ressembler nos villes en 2121|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.fr/sciences/2018/01/voici-quoi-pourraient-ressembler-nos-villes-en-2121|journal=National Geographic|volume=233|issue=2|pages=28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micu, A.

In response, he has explained he is a 'science critic' and not 'anti-science' (in the same manner that a 'film critic' is not 'anti-film').

For the Frankencities project and for the Ecotopia 2121 project, Marshall developed a novel urban design [[methodology]] known as [http://www.ecotopia2121.com/single-post/2016/09/13/The-Fantasy-Method-of-Urban-Design 'The Literary Method of Urban Design'], which is not so much about design but more about inventing new social change strategies. 

==Fiction==
Alan Marshall is an award-winning writer of fiction. His works of fiction include an historical novel, ''Lancewood'', about an iconic New Zealand plant, and a [[science fiction]] radio drama called ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' that was broadcast on [[NPR]] and XM Satellite Radio in the USA. In 2001 ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' received the "Silver Award" from the Mark Time Awards by a panel that included Grammy-award winner [[Phil Proctor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Time/Ogle Award winners|year=2001|url=http://www.greatnorthernaudio.com/MarkTime/MarkTime-winners.html|work=Mark Time Awards|publisher=Jerry Stearns, David Ossman|accessdate=22 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Peter Jackson's ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' movie trilogy, ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' was nominated for a [[Sir Julius Vogel Award|Vogel Award]] in the category "Best Long Form dramatic science fiction and fantasy production made in New Zealand in the year 2002".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffanz.org.nz/sjv/sjvNominations-2002.shtml|title=Sir Julius Vogel Award Nominations - 2002|publisher=SFFANZ|accessdate=22 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/SirJuliusVogelNomList.html#3363-2001 |title=Sir Julius Vogel Nominees List |work=The LOCUS Index to SF Awards |publisher=Mark R.

'''Animal communication''' is the transfer of information from one or a group of animals (sender or senders) to one or more other animals (receiver or receivers) that affects the current or future behavior of the receivers. Information may be sent intentionally, as in a courtship display, or unintentionally, as in the transfer of scent from predator to prey. Information may be transferred to an "audience" of several receivers. Animal communication is a rapidly growing area of study in disciplines including [[ethology|animal behavior]], sociology, neurology and [[animal cognition]]. Many aspects of animal behavior, such as symbolic name use, emotional expression, learning and [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], are being understood in new ways.

When the information from the sender changes the behavior of a receiver, the information is referred to as a "signal". [[Signalling theory]] predicts that for a signal to be maintained in the population, both the sender and receiver should usually receive some benefit from the interaction. Signal production by senders and the perception and subsequent response of receivers are thought to [[coevolve]].&lt;ref name="Maynard-Smith and Harper, 2003"&gt;Maynard-Smith and Harper, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Signals often involve multiple mechanisms, e.g. both visual and auditory, and for a signal to be understood the coordinated behaviour of both sender and receiver require careful study.

==Modes==

===Visual===
{{for|information on the perception of visual signals|Visual perception}}

* '''[[Gesture]]s:''' The best known form of communication involves the display of distinctive body parts, or distinctive bodily movements; often these occur in combination, so a movement acts to reveal or emphasize a body part. A notable example is the presentation of a parent [[European herring gull|herring gull]]’s bill to its chick as a signal for feeding. Like many [[gulls]], the herring gull has a brightly coloured bill, yellow with a red spot on the lower mandible near the tip. When the parent returns to the nest with food, it stands over its chick and taps the bill on the ground; this elicits a  [[Begging behavior in animals|begging response]] from a hungry chick (pecking at the red spot), which stimulates the parent to regurgitate food. The complete signal therefore involves a distinctive morphological feature (body part), the red-spotted bill, and a distinctive movement (tapping towards the ground) which makes the red spot highly visible to the chick.  While all primates use some form of gesture,&lt;ref&gt;de Waal&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frans de Waal]] concluded that apes and humans are unique in that only they use intentional gestures to communicate. He tested the hypothesis that gestures evolve into language by studying the gestures of [[bonobo]]s and [[chimpanzee|chimps]].
[[File:Military Working Dog Unit Training Camp Lemonier DVIDS165231.jpg|thumb|upright|A dog's visual tooth-baring threat display, accompanied by an auditory signal, growling]]
* '''[[Facial expression]]:''' Facial gestures play an important role in animal communication.  Often a facial gesture is a signal of [[emotion in animals|emotion]].  Dogs, for example, express anger through snarling and showing their teeth. In alarm their ears perk up, in fear the ears flatten while the dogs expose their teeth slightly and squint their eyes. Jeffrey Mogil studied the facial expressions of mice during increments of increasing pain; there were five recognizable facial expressions; orbital tightening, nose and cheek bulge, and changes in ear and whisker carriage.&lt;ref name="Langford, D.J. et al., (2010)"&gt;Langford, D.J. et al., (2010).  Coding of facial expressions of pain in the laboratory mouse. Nature Methods, May 9th. pp. 1-3. {{doi|10.1038/nmeth.1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gaze]]-following:''' Social animals coordinate their communication by monitoring of each other's head and eye orientation. Such behaviour has long been recognized as an important component of communication during human development, and gaze-following has recently received much attention in animals. Studies have been conducted on apes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bräuer|first=Juliane|last2=Call|first2=Josep|last3=Tomasello|first3=Michael|date=2005|title=All Great Ape Species Follow Gaze to Distant Locations and Around Barriers.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.145|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|language=en|volume=119|issue=2|pages=145–154|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.145|issn=1939-2087}}&lt;/ref&gt;, monkeys, dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Téglás|first=Ernő|last2=Gergely|first2=Anna|last3=Kupán|first3=Krisztina|last4=Miklósi|first4=Ádám|last5=Topál|first5=József|date=2012|title=Dogs' Gaze Following Is Tuned to Human Communicative Signals|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.12.018|journal=Current Biology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=209–212|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.12.018|issn=0960-9822|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, birds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schloegl|first=Christian|last2=Kotrschal|first2=Kurt|last3=Bugnyar|first3=Thomas|date=2007|title=Gaze following in common ravens, Corvus corax: ontogeny and habituation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.017|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=74|issue=4|pages=769–778|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.017|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, wolves and tortoises, and have focused on two different tasks: "follow[ing] another’s gaze into distant space" and "follow[ing] another’s gaze geometrically around a visual barrier e.g. by repositioning themselves to follow a gaze cue when faced with a barrier blocking their view". The first ability has been found among a broad range of animals, while the second has been demonstrated only for apes, dogs, wolves, and corvids (ravens); attempts to demonstrate this "geometric gaze following" in [[marmosets|marmoset]] and [[ibis]] gave negative results.  Researchers do not yet have a clear picture of the cognitive basis of gaze following, but developmental evidence indicates that "simple" gaze following and "geometric" gaze following probably rely on different cognitive mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Range | first1 = F. | last2 = Virányi | first2 = Z. | year = 2011 | title = Development of gaze following abilities in wolves (Canis Lupus) | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 2| page = e16888 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0016888 | pmid=21373192 | pmc=3044139| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...616888R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Color change:''' Color change can be separated into changes that occur during growth and development, and those triggered by mood, social context, or abiotic factors such as temperature.  The latter are seen in many taxa.  Some [[cephalopod]]s, such as the [[octopus]] and the [[cuttlefish]], have specialized skin cells ([[chromatophores]]) that can change the apparent colour, opacity, and reflectiveness of their skin.&lt;ref name=cephalopod1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cloney | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Florey | first2 = E. | year = 1968 | title = Ultrastructure of cephalopod chromatophore organs | url = | journal = Z.

For example, when a female olive baboon begins to ovulate, her anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. This signals to males that she is ready to mate.&lt;ref name=Motluk&gt;{{cite journal | author = Motluk, Alison | title = Big Bottom | journal = New Scientist | volume = 19 | issue = 7|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn494-big-bottom.html | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bioluminescence|Bioluminescent communication]]:''' Communication by the production of light occurs commonly in vertebrates and invertebrates in the oceans, particularly at depths (e.g. [[angler fish]]).  Two well known forms of land bioluminescence occur in [[Firefly|fireflies]] and [[Phengodidae|glow worms]]. Other insects, insect [[larva]]e, [[annelid]]s, [[arachnid]]s and even species of [[fungus|fungi]] possess bioluminescent abilities.  Some bioluminescent animals produce the light themselves whereas others have a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with bioluminescent bacteria. (See also: [[List of bioluminescent organisms]])

Many animals communicate through vocalization. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including mating rituals, warning calls, conveying location of food sources, and social learning. In a number of species, males perform calls during mating rituals as a form of competition against other males and to signal females. Examples include [[frogs]], [[hammer-headed bat]]s, [[red deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[elephant seal]]s, and [[songbird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Slabbekoorn, Hans, Smith, Thomas B. "Bird song, ecology and speciation."  Philosophical Transactions: Biology Sciences  357.1420 (2002). 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of vocal communication include the [[alarm call]]s of the [[Campbell monkey]],&lt;ref&gt;Zuberbühler, Klause. "Predator-specific alarm calls in Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 50.5 (2001). 414-442&lt;/ref&gt; the [[territory (animal)|territorial]] calls of [[gibbon]]s, and the use of frequency in [[greater spear-nosed bat]]s to distinguish between groups.&lt;ref&gt;Boughman, Janette W. "Vocal learning by greater spear-nosed bats." Proceedings: Biological Sciences 265.1392 (1998). 227-233&lt;/ref&gt; The [[vervet monkey]] gives a distinct alarm call for each of its four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary appropriately according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the "eagle" alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. [[Prairie dogs]] also use complex calls that signal predator differences. According to [[Con Slobodchikoff]] and others, prairie dog calls communicate the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jabr|first1=Ferris|title=Can Prairie Dogs Talk?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/magazine/can-prairie-dogs-talk.html|work=The New York Times|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/132650631/new-language-discovered-prairiedogese |title=New Language Discovered: Prairiedogese |last1=Krulwich |first1=Robert |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=20 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petroglyphsnm.org/wildsides/pdlanguage.html |title=Yips, barks and chirps: the language of prairie dogs  |last1=DeMello |first1=Margo |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |website= |publisher= |access-date=20 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/prairie-dogs-language-decoded-by-scientists-1.1322230 |title=Prairie dogs' language decoded by scientists |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=21 June 2013 |website= |publisher=[[CBC News]] |access-date=20 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Whale vocalization]]s have been found to have different dialects based on region.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Bjorn. [http://www.livescience.com/animals/060103_whale_noises.html Whales Found to Speak in Dialects.] ''Live Science.'' 3 Jan. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all animals use vocalization as a means of auditory communication. Many [[arthropod]]s rub specialized body parts together to produce sound. This is known as [[stridulation]]. [[Cricket]]s and [[grasshopper]]s are well known for this, but many others use stridulation as well, including [[crustacean]]s, [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[ant]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[moth]]s, [[millipede]]s, and [[centipede]]s. Another means of auditory communication is the vibration of [[swim bladder]]s in [[bony fish]]. The structure of swim bladders and the attached sonic muscles varies greatly across bony fish families, resulting in a wide variety of sounds. Striking body parts together can also produce auditory signals. A well-known example of this is the tail tip vibration of [[rattlesnake]]s as a warning signal. Other examples include bill clacking in birds, wing clapping in [[manakin]] courtship displays, and chest beating in [[gorillas]].&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"&gt;Bradbury, J.W., and S.L.

===Olfactory===
{{main article|Olfaction}}

Despite being the oldest method of communication, chemical communication is one of the least understood forms due in part to the sheer abundance of chemicals in our environment and the difficulty of detecting and measuring all the chemicals in a sample.&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"/&gt;  The ability to detect chemicals in the environment serves many functions, a crucial one being the detection of food, a function that first arose in single-celled organisms ([[bacteria]]) living in the oceans during the early days of life on Earth.&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"/&gt; As this function evolved, organisms began to differentiate between chemicals compounds emanating from resources, conspecifics (same species; i.e., mates and kin), and heterospecifics (different species; i.e., competitors and predators).&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"/&gt;   For instance, a small minnow species may do well to avoid habitat with a detectable concentration of chemical cue associated with a predator species such as northern pike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = G.E. | last2 = Chivers | first2 = D.P. | last3 = Smith | first3 = R.J.F. | year = 1995 | title = Localized defecation by pike: A response to labelling by cyprinid alarm pheromone? | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 105–110 | doi=10.1007/s002650050130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnows with the ability to perceive the presence of predators before they are close enough to be seen and then respond with adaptive behaviour (such as hiding) are more likely to survive and reproduce.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} [[Scent marking]] and [[scent rubbing]] are common forms of olfactory communication in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Gosling, L.

===Electric===
{{Main article|Electrocommunication}}

Electrocommunication is a rare form of communication in animals. It is seen primarily in aquatic animals, though some land mammals, notably the [[platypus]] and [[echidna]]s, sense electric fields that might be used for communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2003/Wilson/Communication.htm |title=Electrocommunication |publisher=Davidson College |archive-url=https://archive.fo/20120529130443/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2003/Wilson/Communication.htm |archive-date=2012-05-29 |access-date=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[electric fish|Weakly electric fishes]] provide an example of electrocommunication, together with [[electrolocation]].  These fish use an electric organ to generate an electric field, which is detected by [[electroreception|electroreceptors]].  Differences in the waveform and frequency of changes in the field convey information on species, sex, and identity.  These electric signals can be generated in response to hormones, circadian rhythms, and interactions with other fish.  Some predators, such as sharks and rays, are able to eavesdrop on these electrogenic fish through passive electroreception.

===Touch===
: ''For more on the mechanism for touch, see [[Somatosensory system]] and [[Mechanoreceptor]]s''

Touch is a key factor in many social interactions. Here are some examples:
*Fighting: In a fight, touch may be used to challenge an opponent and to coordinate movements during the fight. It may also be used by the loser to indicate submission. 
*Mating: Mammals often initiate mating by grooming, stroking or rubbing against each other. This provides the opportunity to apply chemical signals and to assess those excreted by the potential mate. Touch may also announce the intention of the male to mount the female, as when a male kangaroo grabs the tail of a female. During mating, touch stimuli are important for pair positioning, coordination and genital stimulation.
*Social integration: Touch is widely used for social integration, a use that is typified by the social grooming of one animal by another. Social grooming has several functions; it removes parasites and debris from the groomed animal, it reaffirms the social bond or hierarchical relationship between the animals, and it gives the groomer an opportunity to examine [[Olfaction|olfactory]] cues on the groomed individual, perhaps adding additional ones. This behaviour has been observed in social insects, birds and mammals.
*Foraging: Some ant species recruit fellow workers to new food finds by first tapping them with their antennae and forelegs, then leading them to the food source while keeping physical contact. Another example of this is the [[Waggle dance|waggle dance of honey bees]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, J.W., and S.L. Vehrencamp. Principles of Animal Communication. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates Inc., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Huddling: Prolonged physical contact or [[Huddle|huddling]] also serves social integration. Huddling promotes heat exchange, together with the transfer of olfactory or tactile information. Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals. When individuals are linked tightly in this way an entire colony can react on the aversive or alarm movements made by only a few individuals. In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there is prolonged contact play a major role in group coordination. These aggregations may take the form of a procession or a rosette.

===Seismic===
{{main article|Seismic communication}}

Seismic communication is the exchange of information using self-generated vibrational signals transmitted via a substrate such as the soil, water, spider webs, plant stems, or a blade of grass.  This form of communication has several advantages, for example it can be sent regardless of light and noise levels, and it usually has a short range and short persistence, which may reduce the danger of detection by predators.  The use of seismic communication is found in many taxa, including frogs, kangaroo rats, mole rats, bees, nematode worms, and others.  Tetrapods usually make seismic waves by drumming on the ground with a body part, a signal that is sensed by the [[sacculus]] of the receiver.  The sacculus is an organ in the inner ear containing a membranous sac that is used for balance, but can also detect seismic waves in animals that use this form of communication. Vibrations may be combined with other sorts of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Narins, Peter M. "Seismic Communication in Anuran Amphibians." BioScience40.4 (1990): 268. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal===
{{Main article|Thermoreception}}
[[Image:The Pit Organs of Two Different Snakes.jpg|thumb|A python (top) and rattlesnake illustrating the positions of the pit organs. Red arrows indicate the pit organs whereas black arrows indicate the nostril.]] A number of different snakes have the ability to sense [[infrared]] (IR) thermal radiation, which allows these reptiles to derive thermal images from the radiant heat emitted by predators or prey at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[μm]]. The accuracy of this sense is such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target its strike to the vulnerable body parts of a prey animal.&lt;ref&gt;(Kardong &amp; Mackessy 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously thought that the pit organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that they may also be used to control body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;(Krochmal et al. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The facial pits enabling thermoregulation underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.&lt;ref&gt;(Pough et al. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between lineages, but it differs in gross structure [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure.  Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily [[Crotalinae]]: the pitvipers. Despite the detection of IR radiation, the pits’ IR mechanism is dissimilar to photoreceptors; while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the facial pits of snakes is a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"&gt;(Gracheva et al. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original “resting” or “inactive” temperature.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"/&gt;

[[Common vampire bat]]s (''Desmodus rotundus'') have specialized IR sensors in their nose-leaf.&lt;ref name="Kurten"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kürten, L., Schmidt, U. and Schäfer, K.|year=1984|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00396621|title=Warm and cold receptors in the nose of the vampire bat, ''Desmodus rotundus''|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=71|pages=327–328.|doi=10.1007/BF00396621|bibcode=1984NW.....71..327K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vampire bats are the only mammals that feed exclusively on blood. The IR sense enables Desmodus to localize [[homeothermic]] animals such as cattle and horses within a range of about 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm. This [[Infrared sensing in vampire bats|infrared perception]] may be used in detecting regions of maximal blood flow on targeted prey.

==Autocommunication==
[[Autocommunication]] is a type of communication in which the sender and receiver are the same individual. The sender emits a signal that is altered by the environment and eventually is received by the same individual. The altered signal provides information that can indicate food, predators or conspecifics. Because the sender and receiver are the same animal, [[selection pressure]] maximizes signal efficacy, i.e. the degree to which an emitted signal is correctly identified by a receiver despite propagation distortion and noise.  There are two types of autocommunication.  The first is active [[electrolocation]] found in the [[electric fish]] [[Gymnotiformes]] (knifefishes) and [[Mormyridae]] (elephantfish) and also in the [[platypus]] (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'').  The second type of autocommunication is [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]], found in [[bats]] and [[Odontoceti|toothed whales]].

==Functions==
There are many functions of animal communication.  However, some have been studied in more detail than others.  This includes:

* '''Communication during contests''': Animal communication plays a vital role in determining the winner of contest over a resource.  Many species have distinct signals that signal aggression or willingness to attack or signals to convey retreat during competitions over food, territories, or mates.
[[file:Red_Deer_(Cervus_elaphus)_(W1CDR0001424_BD3).ogg|right|thumb|Two ''Red Deer'' roaring most likely to establish dominance during a rut.  However, males also use loud roaring to keep track of harems of females.]]
* '''[[Mating]] rituals''':  Animals produce signals to attract the attention of a possible mate or to solidify pair bonds.  These signals frequently involve the display of body parts or postures.  For example, a gazelle will assume characteristic poses to initiate mating.  Mating signals can also include the use of [[olfactory]] signals or [[mating call]]s unique to a species.  Animals that form lasting [[pair bond]]s often have symmetrical displays that they make to each other.  Famous examples are the mutual presentation of reeds by great crested grebes studied by [[Julian Huxley]], the triumph displays shown by many species of [[geese]] and [[penguins]] on their nest sites, and the spectacular courtship displays by [[birds of paradise]].
* '''Ownership/territorial''': Signals used to claim or defend a territory, food, or a mate.

* '''Food-related signals''': Many animals make "food calls" to attract a mate, offspring, or other members of a social group to a food source.  Perhaps the most elaborate food-related signal is the [[Waggle dance]] of [[honeybees]] studied by [[Karl von Frisch]].  One well-known example of begging of offspring in a clutch or litter is [[altricial]] songbirds. Young ravens will signal to older ravens when they encounter new or untested food.  [[Rhesus macaques]] will send food calls to inform other monkeys of a food source to avoid punishment.   [[Pheromones]] are released by many social insects to lead the other members of the society to the food source. For example, [[ants]] leave a pheromone trail on the ground that can be followed by other ants to lead them to the food source.
* '''[[Alarm calls]]''': Alarm calls communicate the threat of a predator.  This allows all members of a social group (and sometimes other species) to respond accordingly.  This may include running for cover, becoming immobile, or gathering into a group to reduce the risk of attack. Alarm signals are not always vocalizations. Crushed ants will release an alarm pheromone to attract more ants and send them into an attack state.
* '''[[Meta-communication]]''': Signals that will modify the meaning of subsequent signals. One example is the 'play face' in [[dogs]] which signals that a subsequent aggressive signal is part of a play fight rather than a serious aggressive episode.

==Interpretation of animal behaviour==
As described above, many animal gestures, postures, and sounds, convey meaning to nearby animals. These signals are often easier to describe than to interpret. It is tempting, especially with domesticated animals and apes, to [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]], that is, to interpret animal actions in human terms, but this can be quite misleading; for example, an ape's "smile" is often a sign of aggression. Also, the same gesture may have different meanings depending on context within which it occurs.  For example, a domestic [[dog]]'s tail wag and posture may be used in different ways to convey many meanings as illustrated in [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]] published in 1872. Some of Darwin's illustrations are reproduced here.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Interspecific communication==
{{main|Interspecies communication}}
Much animal communication is intraspecific, that is, it occurs between members of the same species. As for interspecific communication, that between predator and prey is of particular interest.

===Prey to predator===
If a prey animal moves, makes a noise or vibrations, or emits a smell in such a way that a predator can detect it, this is consistent with the definition of "communication" given above. This type of communication is known as interceptive eavesdropping if a predator intercepts a message intended for conspecifics.

There are however, some actions of prey species are clearly directed to actual or potential predators. A good example is [[warning coloration]]: species such as [[wasp]]s that are capable of harming potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behaviour of the predator, who either instinctively or as the result of experience will avoid attacking such an animal. Some forms of [[mimicry]] fall in the same category: for example [[hoverfly|hoverflies]] are coloured in the same way as wasps, and although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some protection. There are also behavioural changes that act in a similar way to warning colouration. For example, canines such as [[wolf|wolves]] and [[coyote]]s may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and [[rattlesnake]]s use their well-known rattle to warn potential predators of their venomous bite. Sometimes, a behavioural change and warning colouration will be combined, as in certain species of [[amphibia]]ns which have most of their body coloured to blend with their surroundings, except for a brightly coloured belly. When confronted with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.

Another example of prey to predator communication is the pursuit-deterrent signal. Pursuit-deterrent signals occur when prey indicates to a predator that pursuit would be unprofitable because the signaler is prepared to escape. Pursuit-deterrent signals provide a benefit to both the signaler and receiver; they prevent the sender from wasting time and energy fleeing, and they prevent the receiver from investing in a costly pursuit that is unlikely to result in capture. Such signals can advertise prey’s ability to escape, and reflect phenotypic condition (quality advertisement), or can advertise that the prey has detected the predator (perception advertisement). Pursuit-deterrent signals have been reported for a wide variety of taxa, including fish (Godin and Davis, 1995), lizards (Cooper et al., 2004), ungulates (Caro, 1995), rabbits (Holley 1993), primates (Zuberbuhler et al. 1997), rodents (Shelley and Blumstein 2005, Clark, 2005), and birds (Alvarez, 1993, Murphy, 2006, 2007). A familiar example of quality advertisement pursuit-deterrent signal is ''[[stotting]]'' (sometimes called ''pronking''), a pronounced combination of stiff-legged running while simultaneously jumping shown by some [[antelope]]s such as [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the presence of a predator. At least 11 hypotheses for stotting have been proposed. A leading theory today is that it alerts predators that the element of surprise has been lost. Predators like cheetahs rely on surprise attacks, proven by the fact that chases are rarely successful when antelope stot. Predators do not waste energy on a chase that will likely be unsuccessful (optimal foraging behaviour).  Quality advertisement can be communicated by modes other than visual.  The [[banner-tailed kangaroo rat]] produces several complex foot-drumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake.  The foot-drumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys vibrations through the ground that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_458_Vibrational-communication-in-animals/|title=Web of Life:Vibrational communication in animals|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predator to prey===
[[File:Humpback anglerfish.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[humpback anglerfish]] angles for small fish by deceptively dangling a bioluminescent [[Fishing lure|lure]] in front of its jaws.]]
{{further|Deception in animals}}

Typically, predators attempt to reduce communication to prey as this will generally reduce the effectiveness of their hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behaviour of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. [[Deception in animals|deception]] by the predator. A well-known example is the [[angler fish]], an [[ambush predator]] which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves in a better position for the angler fish to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders ([[Myrmarachne]]). These spiders are commonly referred to as “[[Ant mimicry|antmimicking]] spiders” because of the way they wave their front legs in the air to simulate [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].

===Human/animal===
{{main article|Human–animal communication}}
Various ways in which humans interpret the behaviour of animals, or give commands to them, are consistent with the definition of [[interspecies communication]]. Skillful interpretation of animal communications may be critical to the welfare of animals that are being cared for or trained by humans. For example, behaviours indicating pain need to be recognized. Indeed, the survival of both the animal and its human caretaker may be at stake if, for example, a human fails to recognize a signal for imminent attack. It is also important to take into account that non-human animal species may interpret the signals of humans differently than humans themselves. For instance, a pointing command refers to a location rather than an object in dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Csík|first2=Andor|last3=Kis|first3=Anna|last4=Topál|first4=József|date=2015|title=What or where? The meaning of referential human pointing for dogs (Canis familiaris).|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0039462|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|language=en|volume=129|issue=4|pages=334–338|doi=10.1037/a0039462|issn=1939-2087}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Since the late 1990s, one scientist, [[Sean Senechal]], has been developing, studying, and using the learned visible, expressive language in dogs and horses. By teaching these animals a gestural (human made) [[American Sign Language]]-like language, the animals have been found to use the new signs on their own to get what they need.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Senechal: ''Dogs can sign, too. A breakthrough method of teaching your dog to communicate to you'', 2009, Random House/Crown/TenSpeed Press&lt;/ref&gt; The recent experiments on [[animal language]] are perhaps the most sophisticated attempt yet to establish human/animal communication, though their relation to natural animal communication is uncertain.

==Other aspects==

===Evolution===
{{further|Signalling theory}}

The importance of communication is evident from the highly elaborate morphology, behaviour and physiology that some animals have evolved to facilitate this. These include some of the most striking structures in the animal kingdom, such as the [[peacock]]'s tail, the antlers of a [[Deer|stag]] and the frill of the [[frill-necked lizard]], but also include even the modest red spot on a [[European herring gull]]'s bill.  Highly elaborate behaviours have evolved for communication such as the dancing of [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], the pattern changes of [[cuttlefish]], and the gathering and arranging of materials by [[bowerbird]]s.  Other evidence for the importance of communication in animals is the prioritisation of physiological features to this function, for example, [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] appears to have brain structures entirely devoted to its production. All these adaptations require evolutionary explanation.

There are two aspects to the required explanation:

* identifying a route by which an animal that lacked the relevant feature or behaviour could acquire it;
* identifying the selective pressure that makes it adaptive for animals to develop structures that facilitate communication, emit communications, and respond to them.

Significant contributions to the first of these problems were made by [[Konrad Lorenz]] and other early [[ethologist]]s. By comparing related species within groups, they showed that movements and body parts that in the primitive forms had no communicative function could be "captured" in a context where communication would be functional for one or both partners, and could evolve into a more elaborate, specialised form. For example, [[Desmond Morris]] showed in a study of grass [[finch]]es{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} that a beak-wiping response occurred in a range of species, serving a [[personal grooming|preening]] function, but that in some species this had been elaborated into a [[courtship]] signal.

The second problem has been more controversial. The early ethologists assumed that communication occurred for the good of the species as a whole, but this would require a process of [[group selection]] which is believed to be mathematically impossible in the [[evolution]] of sexually reproducing animals. Altruism towards an unrelated group is not widely accepted in the scientific community, but rather can be seen as reciprocal altruism, expecting the same behaviour from others, a benefit of living in a group. [[sociobiology|Sociobiologists]] argued that behaviours that benefited a whole group of animals might emerge as a result of selection pressures acting solely on the individual. A [[gene-centered view of evolution]] proposes that behaviours that enabled a [[gene]] to become wider established within a population would become positively selected for, even if their effect on individuals or the species as a whole was detrimental;&lt;ref&gt;discussed at length by [[Richard Dawkins]] under the subject of his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peacock in Toronto.jpg|thumb|right|The apparently excessive eye-spot signalling by the male peacock tail may be [[runaway selection]]]]

In the case of communication, an important discussion by [[John Krebs]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] established hypotheses for the evolution of such apparently [[altruism|altruistic]] or mutualistic communications as alarm calls and courtship signals to emerge under individual selection. This led to the realization that communication might not always be "honest" (indeed, there are some obvious examples where it is not, as in [[mimic]]ry). The possibility of evolutionarily stable dishonest communication has been the subject of much controversy, with [[Amotz Zahavi]] in particular arguing that it cannot exist in the long term. Sociobiologists have also been concerned with the evolution of apparently excessive signaling structures such as the peacock's tail; it is widely thought that these can only emerge as a result of [[sexual selection]], which can create a [[positive feedback]] process that leads to the rapid exaggeration of a characteristic that confers an advantage in a competitive mate-selection situation.

One theory to explain the evolution of traits like a peacock's tail is 'runaway selection'. This requires two traits—a trait that exists, like the bright tail, and a prexisting bias in the female to select for that trait. Females prefer the more elaborate tails, and thus those males are able to mate successfully. Exploiting the psychology of the female, a positive feedback loop is enacted and the tail becomes bigger and brighter. Eventually, the evolution will level off because the survival costs to the male do not allow for the trait to be elaborated any further. Two theories exist to explain runaway selection. The first is the good genes hypothesis. This theory states that an elaborate display is an honest signal of fitness and truly is a better mate. The second is the handicap hypothesis. This explains that the peacock's tail is a handicap, requiring energy to keep and makes it more visible to predators. Thus, the signal is costly to maintain, and remains an honest indicator of the signaler's condition. Another assumption is that the signal is more costly for low quality males to produce than for higher quality males to produce. This is simply because the higher quality males have more energy reserves available to allocate to costly signaling.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Smith and Harper, 2003"/&gt;

===Cognitive aspects===
Ethologists and sociobiologists have characteristically analysed animal communication in terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising the question of whether the animals concerned understand the meaning of the signals they emit and receive. That is a key question in [[animal cognition]]. There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by [[vervet monkey]]s. Robert Seyfarth and [[Dorothy Cheney (scientist)|Dorothy Cheney]] showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators ([[leopard]]s, [[eagle]]s, and [[snake]]s), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately—but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call. Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.

It has been reported &lt;ref name="PNAS-2006"&gt;V. M. Janik, L. S. Sayigh, and R. S. Wells: "Signature whistle shape conveys identity information to bottlenose dolphins", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', vol. 103 no 21, May 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that bottlenose dolphins can recognize identity information from whistles even when otherwise stripped of the characteristics of the whistle; making dolphins the only animals other than humans that have been shown to transmit identity information independent of the caller’s voice or location. The paper concludes that:
{{"
 |The fact that signature whistle shape carries identity information independent from voice features presents the possibility to use these whistles as referential signals, either addressing individuals or referring to them, similar to the use of names in humans. Given the cognitive abilities of bottlenose dolphins, their vocal learning and copying skills, and their fission–fusion social structure, this possibility is an intriguing one that demands further investigation.|V. M. Janik, ''et al.'' &lt;ref name="PNAS-2006"/&gt;}}

===Human behaviour===
Another controversial issue is the extent to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared as a result of our linguistic capacity. Some of our bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as [[Eibl-Eibesfeldt|Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]] have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the ''eyebrow flash'' on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other [[primate]]s. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human [[body language]] does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.

Humans also often seek to mimic animals' communicative signals in order to interact with them. For example, cats have a mild affiliative response of slowly closing their eyes; humans often mimic this signal towards a [[pet]] cat to establish a tolerant relationship. Stroking, petting and rubbing pet animals are all actions that probably work through their natural patterns of interspecific communication.

Dogs have shown an ability to understand human communication. In object choice tasks, dogs utilize human communicative gestures such as pointing and direction of gaze in order to locate hidden food and toys.&lt;ref name="EOC-1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Communication of food location between human and dog (Canis familiaris) | url = | journal = Evolution of Communication | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 137–159 | doi=10.1075/eoc.2.1.06har}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that dogs exhibit a left gaze bias when looking at human faces, indicating that they are capable of reading human emotions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Guo, K. Meints, C. Hall, S. Hall &amp; D. Mills: "Left gaze bias in humans, rhesus monkeys and rhesus domestic dogs." "Animal Cognition", vol. 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs do not make use of direction of gaze or exhibit left gaze bias with other dogs.

A new approach in the 21st century in the field of animal communication uses [[applied behavioural analysis]], specifically functional communication training. This form of training previously has been used in schools and clinics with humans with special needs, such as children with autism, to help them develop language. [[Sean Senechal]] at the AnimalSign Center has been using an approach similar to functional communication training with domesticated animals, such as dogs since 2004 and horses since 2000, with encouraging results and benefits to the animals and people. Functional communication training for animals, Senechal calls "AnimalSign Language". This includes teaching communication through gestures (like simplified [[American sign language]]), [[Picture Exchange Communication System]], tapping, and vocalisation. The process for animals includes simplified and modified techniques.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Linguistics===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1FY5kL_zXU Do animals have language? - Michele Bishop], [[TED (conference)|TED Ed]], 4:54, September 10, 2015&lt;ref name="teded"&gt;{{cite web | title =Do animals have language? - Michele Bishop | work = | publisher =[[TED (conference)|TED Ed]] | date =10 September 2015 | url =http://ed.ted.com/lessons/do-animals-have-language-michele-bishop | accessdate =11 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{Main article|Animal language}}
For [[linguistics]], the interest of animal communication systems lies in their similarities to and differences from human language:

# Human languages are characterized for having a '''[[double articulation]]''' (in the characterization of French linguist [[André Martinet]]). It means that complex linguistic expressions can be broken down in meaningful elements (such as [[morpheme]]s and [[word]]s), which in turn are composed of smallest phonetic elements that affect meaning, called [[phoneme]]s. Animal signals, however, do not exhibit this dual structure.
# In general, animal utterances are responses to external stimuli, and do not refer to matters removed in time and space. Matters of relevance at a distance, such as distant food sources, tend to be indicated to other individuals by [[body language]] instead, for example [[wolf]] activity before a hunt, or the information conveyed in [[Bee learning and communication|honeybee dance language]].It is therefore unclear to what extent utterances are automatic responses and to what extent deliberate intent plays a part.
# In contrast to human [[language]], animal communication systems are usually not able to express conceptual generalizations. ([[Cetacean]]s and some [[primate]]s may be notable exceptions).
# Human languages combine elements to produce new messages (a property known as '''creativity'''). One factor in this is that much human language growth is based upon conceptual ideas and hypothetical structures, both being far greater capabilities in humans than animals. This appears far less common in animal communication systems, although current research into [[animal culture]] is still an ongoing process with many new discoveries.

In 2009 it was reported that affixation may play a role in the call meanings of [[Campbell's mona monkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/12/monkey-talk/|author=Brandon Kiem|title=Rudiments of Language Discovered in Monkeys|publisher=Wiredscience|date=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Errors in communication ==
There becomes possibility for error within communication between animals when certain circumstances apply. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vzrZsbCR8gcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=animal+communication&amp;ots=oXXuOL3BvO&amp;sig=tarsflz8ECN8ApJWgoYnxcLtMsA#v=onepage&amp;q=animal%20communication&amp;f=false|title=Behavioral Mechanisms in Evolutionary Ecology|last=Real|first=Leslie A.|date=1994-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226705958|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;These circumstances could include distance between the two communicating subjects, as well as the complexity of the signal that is being communicated to the "listener" of the situation. It may not always be clear to the "listener" where the location of the communication is coming from, as the "singer" can sometimes deceive them and create more error.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Parygin boris dmitrievitch.jpg|thumb|alt="Photo of Russian scientist Boris Parygin."|'''Boris Parygin'''.]]

'''Boris Dmitrievitch Parygin''' (Russian: Борис Дмитриевич Парыгин) (19 June 1930 – 9 April 2012) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Russian philosopher, sociologist and one of the founders of [[social psychology]] and member of a wide range of international academies. Parygin was a specialist in a sphere of philosophical and psychological problems of social psychology – its history, methodology, theory and [[praxeology]].

== Biography ==
Parygin was born in [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]], where he survived the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. After school he attended [[Saint Petersburg State University]] where he studied philosophy (1948—1953, diploma with distinction). In 1961 he defended a theses about a problem of the social mood. In 1967 defended a doctoral theses ''Social Psychology as a science (questions of history, methodology and theory)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childpsy.ru/upload/dissertations/%CF%E0%F0%FB%E3%E8%ED_%C1_%C4_8_1967.htm Парыгин_Б_Д_8_1967&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
After graduation he was teaching philosophy at [[Saint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy]] (1957–1962). In 1965, Saint Petersburg State University publishing house had released Parygin’s first monograph "Social Psychology as a Science", which became a bibliographical rarity. In 1967, a revised edition of the monograph (15,000 copies) was translated into Czech, Bulgarian and Spanish. 

From 1968 Parygin was at the head of the Philosophy Department of a [[Herzen University]]. There he created the laboratory of the social and psychologic studies and social psychology faculty which was the first one in the Soviet Union. Many first-rate scientists lectured there and books edited by Boris Parygin were published. 

In 1971, Parygin’s work titled ''The Basics of Socio-Psychological Theory'' was published (20,000 printed copies). In his book, Parygin presented the concept of the main social and psychological problems and first of all—the question of personality and human communication. This book drew a wide response in a scientific sphere of the Soviet Union and abroad. The monograph was republished in Germany (Cologne, 1975, Berlin, 1976) and in Japan (Tokyo, 1977).

At the meeting of [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (1972), however, Parygin was called a leader of international [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] of [[Marxism]] because of his independent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html Parygin Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206173745/http://www.unlv.edu/centers/cdclv/archives/Interviews/parygin.html |date=6 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was accused of the intention to substitute Marxist philosophy by the Philosophy of Personality. Due to this, he had got a different job in a Social and Economic Problems Institute, where he organized and led the department of socio-psychologic problems of the labor collectives. The results of his work have found reflection in his books ''The Scientific-Technical Revolution and personality'' (1978),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/415493?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20Boris%20Dmitrievich%22&amp;offset=2&amp;max=2 NLA catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; “Social and psychological climate of the collective” (1981),&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Parygin,%20B.%20D.%20%28Boris%20Dmitrievich%29,%201930-%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 National Library of Austria&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social psychology of  territorial self-government'' (1993) and others.
Parygin was the head of the Research Committee of a Social Association, coordinated international researches within a [[Comecon]].

== Publications ==

He was the author of 10 prominent monographs and more than 400 articles, which were translated into many foreign languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Lettish and others).

Main publications:

{{psychoanalysis}}
The '''Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute''' is a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] research, training, education facility that is affiliated with the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[International Psychoanalytic Association]]. There were no psychoanalytic societies devoted to [[Sigmund Freud]] in Boston prior to his visit to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1909, though after 1909 there were individuals interested in Freud's writings, including [[James Jackson Putnam]], [[L. Eugene Emerson]], [[Isador Coriat]], [[William Healy (physician)|William Healy]], and [[Augusta Bronner]]. The present society and institute (abbreviated BPSI) was founded by psychoanalyst [[Franz Alexander]] only after 1931.  The BPSI is the third oldest psychoanalytic institute in the United States; only the [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]] and [[Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis]] are older.  

Major psychoanalysts who have been associated with the institute include [[Franz Alexander]], [[Hans Sachs]], [[Helene Deutsch]], [[Felix Deutsch]], Hans and [[Greta Bibring]], [[Ives Hendrix]], and more recently [[Philip Holzman]] and [[Arnold Modell]].  In its early years, the Department of Psychiatry at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] was strongly associated with BPSI, especially through its first chief [[Stanley Cobb]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10387">'''Bounded emotionality''' is a [[communications studies]] approach to dealing with [[emotional control]] in the workplace. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotional control simply refers to how [[Employment|employers and employees]] handle the range of emotions that naturally occur in the [[workplace]]. These emotions can occur because of work, or they can be brought into work from an employee's home life. Bounded emotionality was proposed by [[Dennis K. Mumby]] and [[Linda L. Putnam]]. Mumby and Putnam (1992) stress that bounded emotionality encourages the [[Emotional expression|expression]] of a wide range of emotions. Their theory encourages expression of emotions because it is a way to maintain [[interpersonal relationships]] and [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] among people in the organization. Additionally, the expression of emotions strengthens work relations because people bond over mutual feelings. Bounded emotionality is a broad framework for organizations to use when dealing with emotions.  It has six defining characteristics. The characteristics are: [[intersubjective]] limitations, spontaneously emergent work feelings, tolerance of [[ambiguity]], [[heterarchy]] of values, integrated [[self identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], and [[Sense of community|community]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Origins ==
Prior to Mumby and Putnam's specific articulation of bounded emotionality research and the role it plays in what is known about organizational emotion regulation, workplace emotion research focused on the relationship between emotion regulation, [[work performance]] and general attitudes towards work. Traditionally, two concepts, '''[[bounded rationality]]''' and '''[[emotional labor]]''' were used to describe conventional organizational theory pertaining to emotional regulation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Bounded Rationality:''' Whereas bounded emotionality encourages the expression of a large spectrum of emotions in organizational communication, bounded rationality advocates for the “control” or tempering of any emotion or [[Personality|personal characteristics]] that may interfere with [[rational]] organizational decision making. Simon introduced the term bounded rationality and cast it as “bounded” because he viewed highly emotion-based forms of reasoning such as [[intuition]] and [[judgement]] as [[irrational]] and thus unhelpful in reaching organizational goals. Bounded rationality approaches to emotional regulation not only devalue individual emotion in the workplace but also view excessive emotional expression as [[inappropriate]] for the work setting. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Emotional Labor:''' Emotional labor refers to the way in which individuals manage emotions based on what is perceived as “appropriate” in specific social or environmental situations. Human beings often pay close attention to their surroundings and how they should act in certain social situations. A variety of organizational factors as well as personal factors may impact emotional regulation including: [[socialization]], [[Interpersonal_communication#Situational_milieu|channels of communication]], departmental differences (e.g. sales vs. packaging), etc. In an organization that deploys a bounded emotionality approach to emotional regulation, much less emotional labor will be required than an organization that deploys a bounded rationality approach.

Mumby and Putnam introduced the concept of bounded emotionality as an alternative organizational concept to bounded rationality and emotional labor in order to demonstrate the instability of traditional understandings and highlight what they believe to be the importance of emotions in organizational decision-making. In an organization framed by bounded emotionality (as opposed to bounded rationality and emotional labor), hierarchical goals and values are flexible as emotion and the physical self are not isolated from the process of organizing. In other words, emotions are “bounded” in organizations to protect [[interpersonal relationships]] and mutual understandings, two organizational aspects that Mumby and Putnam argue as important to success. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Bounded emotionality vs. Unbounded emotionality ==

'''Unbounded Emotionality''' should be enacted not for the instrumental gain of the organization, but to enhance the well-being of the individual organizational members. [[Work stress]] is a political, organizational and community issue that can be difficult to implement in large organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Bounded Emotionality''' is a limited, pragmatic approach to the problem of emotional control in organizations. It focuses on work related emotions, defined as, “feelings, sensations, and affective responses to organizational sensations”. However, it is acknowledged that such work feelings stem from and affect emotions that come from one’s [[personal life]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Encourages the expression of a wider range of emotions than is usually condoned in traditional and [[normative]] organizations

* Stresses the importance of maintaining interpersonally sensitive, variable boundaries between what is felt and what is expressed

* The goal of bounded emotionality to build interpersonal relationships through mutual understanding of work related feelings

* Six defining characteristics &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Defining characteristics ==
'''Intersubjective Limitations''': This is a necessary restriction known by individuals in the organization that helps them adequately work with and respond to one another . Just as individuals do in personal relationships, they need to respect emotional boundaries in professional ones. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If a coworker feels certain emotional expressions or topics are inappropriate, you will not discuss them. Similarly, they will respect what you find inappropriate. Those [[personal boundaries]] are the intersubjective limitations of the work relationship.  For instance, a cabin crew member may be absolutely repulsed by vomit, but when a passenger vomits that cabin crew member controls the disgust and helps calms the passenger down. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Spontaneously emergent work feelings''': Feelings about work emerge in response to work tasks. Generally these form around the organizations [[Organisation climate|climate]] and [[workplace|environment]]. This is natural and [[management]] should not try to ascribe feelings to employees. When spontaneous feelings emerge they should be dealt with within the previously set intersubjective limitations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An example of this would be a study done on [[hair stylists]]. The study found that for the employee they found enjoyment when a [[customer]] confided in them about a private matter. That consumer as well would find it satisfying, therefore more likely to return. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tolerance of [[ambiguity]]''': Complex emotions are likely to occur because of emotional labor (the process of controlling emotions during interactions at work). Bounded emotionality entails tolerance of these complex emotions. Contradictory feelings must coexist. This constitutes a new norm that wants to be aware of different positions, and even those directly opposite among its organizational members. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: People with low tolerance of ambiguity experience stress react prematurely and avoid ambiguous stimuli. The person with high tolerance will look at ambiguous situations as desirable, challenging, and interesting. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Heterarchy]] of [[values]]''': The opposite of [[hierarchy]] of values, or placing certain values as more important than others. A heterarchy of values means that no one is set above another. The context of situations and individual preferences determines what values may be prioritized in a given moment. There is not just one universal set of values guiding one's life choices. Heterarchy is designed for handling the innovative side of things therefore it requires a different form of conflict management. This helps prevent undermining the governing logic. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An individual may highly value human life but be against abortion rights, but maybe be for the death penalty, or the other way around. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Integrated [[Self-concept|Self Identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]]''': Bounded emotionality assumes that people have one single [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. This means that that their [[personality]], their [[values]], and their actions are the same no matter where they are physically. The goal of bounded emotionality is to make it easy to be one's [[true self]] while at work. It means you are part of a social collective working toward obtaining goals for your organization. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If an [[actor]] brings in private experiences to create an original character presentation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Sense of community|Community]]''': The purpose of bounded emotionality is to create a strong sense of community among its members. There is a need for connections within freedom and for diversity within individuality.  Research has shown this structure works best in smaller organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: When a director encourages questions and then the director discusses performance related critiques with them afterwards developing a sense of togetherness. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''brand''' is a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes an organization or product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Marketing Association]] [http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=B Dictionary]. Retrieved 2011-06-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Marketing|publisher=fahy&amp; jobber|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brands are used in [[business]], [[marketing]], and [[advertising]]. '''Name brands''' are sometimes distinguished from generic or [[store brand]]s.

The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who were known to have engaged in [[livestock branding]] as early as 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, H., ''The Miracle Of Man,'' London, Longacre, 1946, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Branding was used to differentiate one person’s cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal’s skin with a hot [[branding iron]]. If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. However, the term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that ‘brand’ now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics and fish sauce.

'''Branding''' is a set of [[marketing]] and communication methods that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand’s identity, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 |title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=17 |pages=4 |year=2008 |last1=Ghodeswar |first1=Bhimrao M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, and therefore branding is one of a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;ranchhod, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by assessing the effectiveness of these branding components.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin Lane|date=1993-01-01|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|jstor=1252054|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.2307/1252054}}&lt;/ref&gt; As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is a marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; When a customer is familiar with a brand, or favours it incomparably to its competitors, this is when a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation’s balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and [[brand valuation]] is an important management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.

The word ‘brand’ is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''commodity brand'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].

==Etymology==
The word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|publication-date=1983|publication-place=Springfield, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with branding irons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandingirons.com/index.html |title=The Evolution of Branding | publisher=Branding Irons Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/slave2.html The branding of slaves.] ''The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities''&lt;/ref&gt;  The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current meaning.

==History==
[[File:Amphorae for wine and oil, Archaeological Museum, Dion (6934667366).jpg|thumb |In pre-literate society, the distinctive shape of amphorae provided potential consumers with information about goods and quality. Pictured: Amphorae for wine and oil, [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|Archaeological Museum, Dion]].]] 
Branding and labelling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice of [[Livestock branding|branding livestock]] in order to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref name=KhanMufti2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Khan |first1= Saif Ullah |last2= Mufti |first2= Owais |title= The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands |journal= Journal of Managerial Sciences |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |year= 2007 |pages= 75–87 |url= http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, purchasers realised that the brand provided information about origin as well as about ownership, and could serve as a guide to quality. Branding was adapted by farmers, potters and traders for use on other types of goods such as pottery and ceramics. Forms of branding or proto-branding emerged spontaneously and independently throughout Africa, Asia and Europe at different times, depending on local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seals, which acted as quasi-brands, have been found on early Chinese products of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE); large numbers of seals survive from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the Indus Valley (3,300–1,300 BCE) where the local community depended heavily on trade; cylinder seals came into use in [[Ur]] in Mesopotamia in around 3,000 BCE and facilitated the labelling of goods and property; and the use of maker's marks on pottery was commonplace in both ancient Greece and Rome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The origin and historical development of branding and advertising in the old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity marks, such as stamps on ceramics, were also used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Starcevic, S., "The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old Civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe," ''Marketing,'' Vol. 46, No, 3, 2015, pp 29-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Twede has argued that the "consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |page= 107 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1,500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which consumers used to glean information about the type of goods and the quality. Systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer, which were understood to convey information about product quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |pages= 98 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the [[urban revolution]] in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality-control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, gave way to clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/523676 |title= Prehistories of Commodity Branding |journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 49 |pages= 7 |year= 2008 |last1= Wengrow |first1= David }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all historians agree that these markings are comparable with modern brands or labels, with some suggesting that the early pictorial brands or simple thumbprints used in pottery should be termed ''proto-brands''&lt;ref name=MooreReid2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/00076790802106299 |title= The birth of brand: 4000 years of branding |journal= Business History |volume= 50 |issue= 4 |pages= 419 |year= 2008 |last1= Moore |first1= Karl |last2= Reid |first2= Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other historians argue that the presence of these simple markings does not imply that mature [[brand management]] practices operated.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G.

In [[ancient Rome]], a commercial brand or inscription applied to objects offered for sale was known as a [[titulus pictus]]. The inscription typically specified information such as place of origin, destination, type of product and occasionally quality claims or the name of the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: Latin Words and Phrases, http://www.2qk.net/latin-words-and-phrases.html - "Titulus pictus[:] A titulus pictus is a commercial inscription made on the surface of certain artefacts.

One merchant who made good use of the [[titulus pictus]] was Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii, circa 35 CE. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house feature images of [[amphora]]e bearing his personal brand and quality claims.

Scauras' fish sauce was known by people across the Mediterranean to be of very high quality, and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In both Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use across a broad range of goods. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius"; probably references to the name of the producer.

The use of identity marks on products declined following the fall of the Roman Empire. However, in the European Middle Ages, [[heraldry]] developed a language of visual symbolism which would feed into the evolution of branding,&lt;ref&gt;

and with the rise of the [[merchant]]'s [[guild]]s the use of marks resurfaced and was applied to specific types of goods. By the 13th century the use of maker's marks had become evident on a broad range of goods. In 1266 makers' marks on bread became compulsory in England.&lt;ref&gt;Martino, T., ''Trademark Dilution,'' Clarendon Press, 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians used brands in the form of [[watermark]]s on paper in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Colapinto|first= John|title= Famous Names |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_colapinto |accessdate= 9 October 2011|newspaper= The New Yorker|date= 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blind stamp]]s, [[hallmark]]s, and silver-makers' marks - all types of brand - became widely used across Europe during this period.

Factories established following the [[Industrial Revolution]] introduced mass-produced goods and needed to sell their products to a wider market - that is, to customers previously familiar only with locally produced goods. &lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993, Chapter 2; scholars describe this period as the era of "mass marketing"&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar, local products. Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realise that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands. &lt;ref&gt;Arnold E. J. and Thompson C. J., "Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research," Journal of Consumer Research,'' vol. 31, 2005, pp 868-882&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] with [[personality]] traits such as youthfulness, fun, sex appeal, luxury or the "cool" factor. This began the modern practice now known as ''branding'', where the consumers buy ''the brand'' instead of the product and rely on the brand name instead of a retailer's recommendation.

The process of giving a brand "human" characteristics represented, at least in part, a response to consumer concerns about mass-produced goods.&lt;ref&gt;Haig, M., ''Brand Failures: The truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time,'' London, Kogan-Page, 2005, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quaker Oats Company]] began using the image of the ''Quaker man'' in place of a trademark from the late 1870s, with great success.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 104; Martino, T., ''Trademark Dilution,''  Clarendon Press, 1996, pp 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pears (soap)|Pears' soap]], [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's soup]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Juicy Fruit| Juicy Fruit chewing gum]] and [[Aunt Jemima]] pancake mix were also among the first products to be "branded" in an effort to increase the consumer's familiarity with the product's merits. Other brands which date from that era, such as [[Uncle Ben's]] rice and [[Kellogg's]] breakfast cereal, furnish illustrations of the trend.

[[File:Quaker Oats (3092914571).jpg|thumb|right|The Quaker Company was one of the earliest to use a character on its packaging, branding and advertising. Pictured: The Quaker Man, c. 1900]]

By the early 1900s, [[trade press|trade-press]] publications, [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] and advertising [[expert]]s began producing books and pamphlets exhorting manufacturers to bypass retailers and to advertise direct to consumers with strongly branded messages. Around 1900, advertising guru [[James Walter Thompson]] published a house advertisement explaining [[trademark]] advertising. This was an early commercial explanation of what scholars now recognize as modern branding and the beginnings of brand management.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, pp 106-08.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued to the 1980s, and {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} is quantified in concepts such as [[value (ethics)|brand value]] and [[brand equity]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Naomi Klein]] has described this development as "brand equity mania".&lt;ref name="nologo" /&gt; In 1988, for example, [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] purchased [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] for six times what the company was worth on paper. Business analysts reported that what they really purchased was the brand name.

With the rise of [[mass media]] in the early 20th century, companies soon adopted techniques that would allow their messages to stand out; [[slogan]]s, [[mascot]]s, and [[jingle]]s began to appear on [[radio]] in the 1920s and in early [[television]] broadcasting in the 1930s. Soap manufacturers sponsored many of the earliest [[radio drama|radio-drama]] series, and the genre became known as ''[[soap opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers had started to develop relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Mildred Pierce, [http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm Newmediagroup.co.uk] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206032132/http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm |date= December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers began to use [[motivational research]] and [[consumer research]] to gather insights into consumer purchasing. Strong branded campaigns for Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn from research into psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing", in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt; Brand advertisers began to imbue goods and services with a personality, based on the insight that consumers searched for brands with personalities that matched their own.&lt;ref&gt;

==Concepts==

Effective branding can result in higher sales of not only one product, but of other products associated with that brand.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} If a customer loves Pillsbury biscuits and trusts the brand, he or she is more likely to try other products offered by the company - such as chocolate-chip cookies, for example. Brand development, often the task of a [[design]] [[team]], takes time to produce.

===Brand names and trademarks===
{{See|Trademark|Trademark symbol}}
[[File:CocaColaBottle.jpg|thumb|''Coca-Cola'' is a brand name, while the distinctive Spencerian script and the contour bottle are trademarked]]
A brand name is the part of a brand that can be spoken or written and ''identifies'' a product, service or company  and sets it apart from other comparable products within a category. A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a "memory heuristic"; a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.

===Corporate brand identity===
Simply, the brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler,|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''. However, that expansion of the meaning of brand identity causes some confusion because it overlaps with other common branding terms, such as brand image, brand personality, and brand meaning. [...] ''Brand identity'' and ''brand image'' are only two of the buzz words that are used and confused by brand experts and brand managers.

&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for a company to exude a strong sense of brand identity, it must have an in-depth understanding of its target market, competitors and the surrounding business environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brand identity includes both the core identity and the extended identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The core identity reflects consistent long-term associations with the brand; whereas the extended identity involves the intricate details of the brand that help generate a constant motif.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Kotler et al. (2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:

# attributes
# benefits
# values
# personality

A brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a "just do it" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value. Even more extensive than its perceived values is a brand's '''personality'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quite literally, one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining long-lasting relationships with consumers, as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639213 |title=INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATION (IMC) AND BRAND IDENTITY AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF BRAND EQUITY STRATEGY: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=69 |year=2005 |last1=Madhavaram |first1=Sreedhar |last2=Badrinarayanan |first2=Vishag |last3=McDonald |first3=Robert E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish, and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Brand personality===

'''Brand personality''' refers to “the set of human personality traits that are both applicable to and relevant for brands.” &lt;ref&gt;Azoulay, A and  Kapferer, J.N., "Do Brand Personality Scales Really Measure Brand Personality?" ''Journal of Brand Management,'' Vol. 11, No. 2, 2003 p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Marketers and consumer researchers often argue that brands can be imbued with human-like characteristics which resonate with potential consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610421011033467 |title=Impact of brand personality on three major relational consequences (trust, attachment, and commitment to the brand) |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=114 |year=2010 |last1=Louis |first1=Didier |last2=Lombart |first2=Cindy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such personality traits can assist marketers to create unique, brands that are differentiated from rival brands. Aaker conceptualised brand personality as consisting of five broad dimensions, namely: sincerity (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful), excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up to date), competence (reliable, intelligent, and successful), sophistication (glamorous, upper class, charming), and ruggedness (outdoorsy and tough).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151897 |jstor=3151897 |title=Dimensions of Brand Personality |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=347 |year=1997 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research studies have suggested that Aaker's dimensions of brand personality are relatively stable across different industries, market segments and over time. Much of the literature on branding suggests that consumers prefer brands with personalities that are congruent with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151914 |jstor=3151914 |title=The Malleable Self: The Role of Self-Expression in Persuasion |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=36 |pages=45 |year=1999 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.07.031 |title=Moderators of the self-congruity effect on consumer decision-making: A meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1179 |year=2012 |last1=Aguirre-Rodriguez |first1=Alexandra |last2=Bosnjak |first2=Michael |last3=Sirgy |first3=M. Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may distinguish the psychological aspect (brand associations like thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, attitudes, and so on that become linked to the brand) of a brand from the experiential aspect. The experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is termed the consumer's ''[[brand experience]]''. The brand is often intended to create an emotional response and recognition, leading to potential loyalty and repeat purchases. The brand experience is a brand's action perceived by a person.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The psychological aspect, sometimes referred to as the ''brand image'', is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people, consisting of all the information and expectations associated with a product, with a service, or with the companies providing them.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Marketers or product managers responsible for branding seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience, creating the impression that a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics that make it special or unique.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A brand can therefore become one of the most valuable elements in an [[advertising theme]], as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the [[market (place)|marketplace]].{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The art of creating and maintaining a brand is called [[brand management]]. Orientation of an entire organization towards its brand is called [[brand orientation]]. Brand orientation develops in response to [[market intelligence]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Careful brand management seeks to make products or services relevant and meaningful to a [[target audience]]. Marketers tend to treat brands as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price; rather brands represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer and are often treated as the total investment in brand building activities including marketing communications.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, pp  295-97&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic (see also [[#Brand promise|brand promise]]). From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.

===Brand awareness===

{{Main|Brand awareness}}
[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos and branded advertising. Brands helps customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers &amp; potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.

Brand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing. That is, customers will not consider a brand if they are not aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Donald (2010). "Success Factors In Establishing Your Brand" Franchising and Licensing Association. Retrieved from http://www.flasingapore.org/info_branding.php&lt;/ref&gt; Brand awareness is a key component in understanding the effectiveness both of a brand's identity and of its communication methods.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title= integrated marketing communications|last= Chitty|first= Williams|publisher= Thomson|year= 2005|isbn= 0 17 012008 2|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful brands are those that consistently generate a high level of brand awareness, as this can often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} be the pivotal factor in securing customer transactions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1002/mar.4220090402|title= A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal= Psychology and Marketing|volume= 9|issue= 4|pages= 263|year= 1992|last1= Percy|first1= Larry|last2= Rossiter|first2= John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various forms of brand awareness can be identified. Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Marketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.

* Most companies aim for "'''Top-of-Mind'''" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, "Kleenex", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.
* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category
* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.
* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.

===Brand recognition===

'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product: |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263–274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.

Brand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's "signature" logo), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].

=== Brand recall===

Unlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market. Thus, brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding [[touchpoint]]s have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Marketing mix modeling|Marketing-mix modeling]] can help [[marketing leader]]s optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales. Managing brands for [[Value proposition|value creation]] will often involve applying marketing-mix modeling techniques in conjunction with [[brand valuation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Brand communication===

{{See|Advertising management|Integrated marketing communications|Marketing communications|Promotion (marketing)}}
Although brand identity is regarded{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the most fundamental asset to a brand's [[brand equity|equity]], the worth of a brand's identity would become obsolete without ongoing brand communication.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi A, Lorestani HZ, Mazidi AK. Investigating the effects of brand identity on customer loyalty from social identity perspective. Iranian Journal of Management Studies. 2013;6(2):153-78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrated marketing communications]] (IMC) relates to how a brand transmits a clear consistent message to its [[stakeholder (disambiguation)|stakeholder]]s .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Five key components comprise IMC:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# advertising
# sales promotions
# direct marketing
# personal selling
# public relations

The effectiveness of a brand's communication is determined by how accurately the customer perceives the brand's intended message through its IMC. Although IMC is a broad strategic concept, the most crucial brand communication elements are pinpointed{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to how the brand sends a message and what touch points the brand uses to connect with its customers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One can analyse the traditional communication model into several consecutive steps:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Firstly, a source/sender wishes to convey a message to a receiver. This source must encode the intended message in a way that the receiver will potentially understand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* After the encoding stage, the forming of the message is complete and is portrayed through a selected channel.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Advertising and promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last= Belch|first= G .E|publisher= McGrawHill Irwin|year= 2012|isbn= |location= New York, NY United States of America|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In IMC, channels may include media elements such as advertising, public relations, sales promotions, etc.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* It is at this point where the message can often deter from its original purpose as the message must go through the process of being decoded, which can often lead to unintended misinterpretation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* Finally, the receiver retrieves the message and attempts to understand what the sender was aiming to render. Often, a message may be incorrectly received due to noise in the market, which is caused by "…unplanned static or distortion during the communication process".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The final stage of this process is when the receiver responds to the message, which is received by the original sender as feedback.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

When a brand communicates a brand identity to a receiver, it runs the risk of the receiver incorrectly interpreting the message. Therefore, a brand should use appropriate communication channels to positively "…affect how the psychological and physical aspects of a brand are perceived" &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Dahlen M, Lange F, Smith T. Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for brands to effectively communicate to customers, marketers must "…consider all [[touchpoint|touch point]]s, or sources of contact, that a customer has with the brand".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Shimp TA. Integrated marketing communications in advertising and promotion. 8 ed. Mason, OH United States of America: South Western, Cengage Learning; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Touch points represent the channel stage in the traditional communication model, where a message travels from the sender to the receiver. Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate - defines a touch point. According to Dalen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the "…potential to add positive - or suppress negative - associations to the brand's equity" &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thus a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilising the best communication channel, is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Brand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 |title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=592 |year=2014 |last1=Uzunoğlu |first1=Ebru |last2=Misci Kip |first2=Sema }}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of brand communication which companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM). EWoM is a relatively new{{when|date=August 2016}} approach identified{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to communicate with consumers. One popular method of eWOM involves [[Social networking service|social networking sites]] (SNSs) such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, E., Sung, Y. and Kang, H., 2014. Brand followers' retweeting behavior on Twitter: How brand relationships influence brand electronic word-of-mouth. Computers in Human Behavior, 37, pp.18–25&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that consumers classed their relationship with a brand as closer if that brand was active on a specific social media site (Twitter). Research further found that the more consumers "retweeted" and communicated with a brand, the more they trusted the brand. This suggests that a company could look to employ a [[social-media marketing|social-media campaign]] to gain consumer trust and loyalty as well as in the pursuit of communicating brand messages.

McKee (2014) also looked into brand communication and states that when communicating a brand, a company should look to simplify its message as this will lead to more value being portrayed as well as an increased chance of target consumers recalling and recognizing the brand.&lt;ref&gt;.McKee, S., 2014. Branding Made Simple. [online] Bloomberg Business. Available at: &lt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-13/branding-made-simple&gt; [Accessed 6 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Riefler stated that if the company communicating a brand is a global organisation or has future global aims, that company should look to employ a method of communication which is globally appealing to their consumers, and subsequently choose a method of communication with will be internationally understood.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2011.11.001 |title=Why consumers do (not) like global brands: The role of globalization attitude, GCO and global brand origin |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=29 |pages=25 |year=2012 |last1=Riefler |first1=Petra }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way a company can do this involves choosing a product or service's brand name, as this name will need to be suitable for the marketplace that it aims to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/296297 |title=To Brand or Not to Brand? A Theoretical and Empirical Question |journal=The Journal of Business |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=279 |year=1985 |last1=Sappington |first1=David E. M |last2=Wernerfelt |first2=Birger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that if a company wishes to develop a global market, the company name will also need to be suitable in different cultures and not cause offense or be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., 2009. Idea Branding. [online] ''The Economist''. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/14126533&gt; [Accessed 1 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found{{by whom|date=August 2016}} that when communicating a brand a company needs to be aware that they must not just visually communicate their brand message and should take advantage of portraying their message through multi-sensory information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2011.09.005 |title=The consumer psychology of brands |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |volume=22 |pages=7 |year=2012 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Bernd }}&lt;/ref&gt; One article suggests that other senses, apart from vision, need to be targeted when trying to communicate a brand with consumers.&lt;ref&gt;
Anon., 2007. Sensory branding Sound effects. [online] The Economist. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/9079881&gt; [Accessed 5 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a jingle or background music can have a positive effect on brand recognition, purchasing behaviour and brand recall.

Therefore, when looking to communicate a brand with chosen consumers, companies should investigate a channel of communication which is most suitable for their short-term and long-term aims and should choose a method of communication which is most likely to be adhered to{{clarify|date=August 2016}} by their chosen consumers.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"/&gt; The match-up between the product, the [[consumer lifestyle]], and the endorser is important for effectiveness of brand communication.

==Global brand variables==

===Brand name===
[[File:Relationships trade marks – brand.svg|thumb|Relationship between trade marks and brand]]
The term "brand name" is quite often used interchangeably with "brand", although it is more correctly used to specifically denote written or spoken linguistic elements of any product. In this context a "brand name" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through trademark registration - such trademarks are called "Registered Trademarks"{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].

====Types of brand names====
Brand names come in many styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few include:
* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as "UPS" or "IBM"
* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as "Whole Foods" or "Toys R' Us"
* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as "Reese's Pieces" or "[[Dunkin' Donuts]]"
* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as "Amazon" or "Crest"
* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as "Wii" or "[[Häagen-Dazs]]"
* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as "Volvo" or "Samsung"
* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as "[[Hewlett-Packard]]", "Dell", "Disney", "Stussy" or "Mars"
* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as "[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]" or "[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]"
* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|"Nike"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as "[[Betty Crocker]]"
* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as "[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]", "Wok on Water" or "Eggs Eggscetera"
* '''combination''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as "[[Microsoft]]" ("microcomputer" and "software"), "[[Comcast]]" ("communications" and "broadcast"), "[[Evernote]]" ("forever" and "note"), "[[Vodafone]]" ("voice", "data", "telephone")

The act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]—which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word "copy".

===Brand line===
A brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].


[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.

===Brand identity===
{{Main|Corporate identity}}
The outward expression of a brand – including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance – is brand identity.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand"&gt;Neumeier, Marty (2004), ''The Dictionary of Brand''. {{ISBN|1-884081-06-1}}, pp.20&lt;/ref&gt; Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand – and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand" /&gt; The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.

Brand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.

====Visual brand identity====
[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]

A brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement – simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of "Less is more") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [Lippincott and Margulies], [[Paul Rand]], and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.

Color is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/col.20594 |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=36 |pages=55 |year=2011 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Zena }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brand trust===
Brand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Brand management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33–58 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.

''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is a syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of action, behavior, communication and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. Action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in the transferring the trust experience to audiences which have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.

===Brand parity===
Brand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=28 |year=1994 |last1=Richardson |first1=Paul S |last2=Dick |first2=Alan S |last3=Jain |first3=Arun K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.

==Expanding role of brands==
The original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.

Today, brands play a much bigger role. Brands have been co-opted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as powerful symbols in larger debates about economics, social issues, and politics. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Bianca |url= http://merriamassociates.com/2010/12/wikileaks-hacktivism-and-brands-as-political-symbols/ |title= Wikileaks, Hacktivism and Brands as Political Symbols « Merriam Associates, Inc.

===Company name===
Often, especially in the industrial sector, it is just the company's name which is promoted (leading to{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} one of the most powerful statements of branding: saying just before the company's downgrading. This approach has not worked as well for [[General Motors]], which recently overhauled how its corporate brand relates to the product brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |title=General Motors: A Reorganized Brand Architecture for a Reorganized Company « Merriam Associates, Inc. Brand Strategies |publisher=Merriamassociates.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604181905/http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |archivedate=2012-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Exactly how the company name relates to product and services names is known as [[brand architecture]]. Decisions about company names and [[Product naming|product names]] and their relationship depends on more than a dozen strategic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nisha Roy (nisharoy) – Pearltrees |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |title=Brand Architecture: Strategic Considerations « Merriam Associates, Inc. Brand Strategies |publisher=Merriamassociates.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520102618/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |archivedate=2013-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, a strong brand name (or company name) is made the vehicle for a range of products (for example, [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[Black &amp; Decker]]) or a range of subsidiary brands (such as [[Cadbury]] Dairy Milk, Cadbury Flake, or [[Cadbury Fingers]] in the UK).

===Individual branding===
{{Main|Individual branding}}
Each brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]]), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).

===Challenger brands===
{{main|Challenger brand}}
A challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader or a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset which sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.

===Multiproduct branding strategy===
Multiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all their products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  
Other examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church &amp; Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church &amp; Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. Multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.

====Product line extension====
{{main|Product line extension}}
Product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in a lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.

====Subbranding====
{{main|Subbranding}}
Subbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].

====Brand extension====
{{main|Brand extension}}
Brand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.

====Co-branding====
{{main|Co-branding}}
Co-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.

===Multibranding strategy===
Multibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestlé]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].

This approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.

====Fighting brands====
{{main|Fighter brand}}
The main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.

===Private branding strategy===

{{main|Store brand}}
Private branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.

In Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.

===Mixed branding strategy===
Mixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. 
For example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the "skin simple" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.

===Attitude branding and iconic brands===
Attitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 2000 book ''[[No Logo]]'',&lt;ref name="nologo"&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} [[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2000) ''[[No logo]]'', Canada: Random House, {{ISBN|0-676-97282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a "fetish strategy".

&lt;blockquote&gt;A great brand raises the bar – it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. – [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Iconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be "identity brands". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them "iconic brands". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.

There are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):
# "Necessary conditions" – The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.
# "Myth-making" – A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.
# "Cultural contradictions" – Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.
# "The cultural brand management process" – Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.

Schaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015.

==="No-brand" branding===
Recently, a number of companies have successfully pursued "no-brand" strategies by creating packaging that imitates [[generic brand]] simplicity. Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means "No label" in English (from 無印良品 – "Mujirushi Ryohin" – literally, "No brand quality goods"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, a simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Heig, Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive and Survive, pg.216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130122022144/http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|deadurl=yes|title=The ‘no brand’ brand - EMEASEE|date=22 January 2013|archivedate=22 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"No brand" branding may be construed as a type of branding as the product is made conspicuous through the absence of a brand name.
"Tapa Amarilla" or "Yellow Cap" in Venezuela during the 1980s is another good example of no-brand strategy. It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.

{{See|Derived demand}}
In this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) "[[Intel Inside]]".

===Brand extension and brand dilution===

{{See|brand extension}}
The existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;
for example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.

Mars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.

There is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.
When [[Coca-Cola]] launched "Diet Coke" and "Cherry Coke", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.

The risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Social media brands===
In 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. "We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us – but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see." &lt;ref name="Media Democracy"&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Better-Mousetrap-Invention-Democracy/dp/0749466219], 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2013) Simon Pont. Kogan Page. {{ISBN|978-0749466213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-brands===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Alternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the share of the market which will in any case go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as multi-brand strategy.

Individual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what
business the company is in or diluting higher quality products.

[[Procter &amp; Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of "facings" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate—from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).

[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.

===Private labels===

{{See|Private label}}
[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this "own brand" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.

'''Designer Private Labels'''

A relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer’s budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.

In Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and ‘L’ for Lisa Ho.&lt;ref&gt;Schetzer, A., "Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers ‘Collette’ for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research,"Private Label Could be the New Black" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337&lt;/ref&gt; Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her “Petites’ range.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research, "Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion," Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520&lt;/ref&gt; Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frames designed by Peter Morrissey.

===Individual and organizational brands===
With the development of brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.&lt;ref name="The Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is leave social impact so their brand become associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims. Organizational brands have well determined brand guidelines and logo variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|title=AIESEC BLUE BOOK Brand Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625183605/http://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowd sourced branding===
These are brands that are created by "the public" for the business, which is opposite to the traditional method where the business create a brand.

===Personalised branding===

Many businesses have started to use elements of personalisation in their branding strategies, offering the client or consumer the ability to choose from various brand options or have direct control over the brand. Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people. [[AirBNB]] has created the facility for users to create their own symbol for the software to replace the brand's mark known as The Bélo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |title=Airbnb says its new logo belongs to everyone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921204457/http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |archivedate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation branding (place branding and public diplomacy)===
{{See|Place branding}}
[[Nation branding]] is a field of theory and practice which aims to measure, build and manage the reputation of countries (closely related to [[place branding]]). Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state "and the successful transference of this image to its exports – is just as important as what they actually produce and sell."

===Destination branding===

Destination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote to themselves. This work is designed to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations. The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization.

==Doppelgänger brand image (DBI)==
{{Main|Doppelgänger brand image}}
A doppelgänger brand image or "DBI"  is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture. DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands. The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.&lt;ref name="Thompson 50–64"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''gänger'' (walker).

Doppelgänger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.

Due to the ability of Doppelgänger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand. Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re-position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism.

Examples include:
* '''Joe Chemo''' campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Chemo: A Camel Who Wishes He'd Never Smoked|url=http://www.joechemo.org/|website = www.joechemo.org|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Version of the '''Coca-Cola''' logo crafted to protest their sponsorship of the '''2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar''' and associated human rights abuses (see citation for original Reddit thread featuring the image).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coke's slogan is "Share Happiness". So I made an ad to remind them of the kind of happiness they're sharing in Qatar. • /r/sports|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/36voua/cokes_slogan_is_share_happiness_so_i_made_an_ad/|website=Reddit|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parody of the '''Pepsi logo as an obese man''' to highlight the relationship between soft drink consumption and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Designer Makes Fun Of Pepsi, Turns Its Logo Into A Fat Man - DesignTAXI.com|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/360382/Designer-Makes-Fun-Of-Pepsi-Turns-Its-Logo-Into-A-Fat-Man/|website=designtaxi.com|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''FUH2 campaign''' protesting the Hummer SUV as a symbol of corporate and consumer irresponsibility toward public safety and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FUH2 {{!}} Fuck You And Your H2|url = http://www.fuh2.com |website = www.fuh2.com|accessdate = 2015-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319105357/http://www.fuh2.com/|archivedate=2016-03-19|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2006 article "Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image", Thompson, Rindfleisch, and Arsel suggest that a doppelgänger brand image can be a benefit to a brand if taken as an early warning sign that the brand is losing emotional authenticity with its market.&lt;ref name="Thompson 50–64"/&gt;

Animals that are held by humans and prevented from escaping are said to be in '''captivity'''.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions, 1911 CHAPTER 27 1 and 2 Geo 5; "...the expression “captive animal” means any animal (not being a domestic animal) of whatsoever kind or species, and whether a quadruped or not, including any bird, fish, or reptile, which is in captivity, or confinement, or which is maimed, pinioned, or subjected to any appliance or contrivance for the purpose of hindering or preventing its escape from captivity or confinement..."; Protection of Animals Act 1911; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/27&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually applied to wild animals that are held in confinement, but may also be used generally to describe the keeping of [[domesticate]]d [[animal]]s such as [[livestock]] or [[pet]]s. This may include, for example, animals in [[farm]]s, private homes, [[zoo]]s and laboratories. Animal captivity may be categorized according to the particular motives, objectives and conditions of the confinement.

==History==

Throughout history not only domestic animals as pets and [[livestock]] were kept in captivity and under human care, but also wild animals. Some were failed domestication attempts. Also, in past times, primarily the wealthy, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and kings collected wild animals for various reasons. Contrary to domestication, the ferociousness and natural behaviour of the wild animals were preserved and exhibited. Today's zoos claim other reasons for keeping animals under human care: [[conservation biology|conservation]], [[education]] and [[science]].

[[Image:Mexican wolf lounging.jpg|right|thumb|An [[endangered]] [[Mexican wolf|Mexican gray wolf]] is kept in captivity for breeding purposes.]]

== Behavior of animals in captivity ==
Captive animals, especially those not domesticated, sometimes develop [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviours]].

One type of abnormal behaviour is ''[[stereotypical behavior]]s'', i.e. repetitive and apparently purposeless motor behaviors. Examples of stereotypical behaviours include pacing, self-injury, route tracing and excessive self-grooming. These behaviors are associated with stress and lack of stimulation. Many who keep animals in captivity attempt to prevent or decrease stereotypical behavior by introducing stimuli, a process known as [[Behavioral enrichment|environmental enrichment]].

A type of abnormal behavior shown in captive animals is self-injurious behavior (SIB). Self-injurious behavior indicates any activity that involves biting, scratching, hitting, hair plucking, or [[eye poke]] that may result in injuring oneself.&lt;ref name=Rommeck&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rommeck |first1=Ina |first2=Kristen |last2=Anderson |first3=Allison |last3=Heagerty |first4=Ashley |last4=Cameron |first5=Brenda |last5=McCowan |title=Risk factors and remediation of self-injurious and self-abuse behavior in rhesus macaques |journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science |year=2009 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10888700802536798 |doi=10.1080/10888700802536798|pmc=4443667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its reported incidence is low, self-injurious behavior is observed across a range of primate species, especially when they experience [[social isolation]] in infancy.&lt;ref name=Hosey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosey |first1=Geoff R. |first2=Lindsay J. |last2=Skyner |title=Self-injurious behavior in zoo primates |journal=International Journal of Primatology |year=2007 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1431–1437 |doi=10.1007/s10764-007-9203-z |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10764-007-9203-z |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the arms, legs, shoulders, or genitals. Threat bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the hand, wrist, or forearm—while staring at the observer, conspecific, or mirror in a threatening manner. Self-hit involves striking oneself on any part of the body. Eye poking is a behavior (widely observed in [[primates]]) that presses the knuckle or finger into the orbital space above the eye socket. [[Hair plucking]] is a jerking motion applied to one’s own hair with hands or teeth, resulting in its excessive removal.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt;

The proximal causes of self-injurious behavior have been widely studied in captive [[primates]]; either social or nonsocial factors can trigger this type of behavior. Social factors include changes in group composition, stress, separation from the group, approaches by or aggression from members of other groups, [[conspecific]] male individuals nearby, separation from females, and removal from the group.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; [[Social isolation]], particularly disruptions of early mother-rearing experiences, is an important risk factor.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Studies have suggested that, although mother-reared [[rhesus macaques]] still exhibit some self-injurious behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Erwin |first2=G. |last2=Mitchell |first3=Terry |last3=Maple |title=Abnormal behavior in non-isolate-reared rhesus monkeys |journal=Psychological Reports |year=1973 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=515–523 |url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; nursery-reared rhesus macaques are much more likely to self-abuse than mother-reared ones.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Nonsocial factors include the presence of a small cut, a wound or irritant, cold weather, human contact, and frequent zoo visitors.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; For example, a study has shown that zoo visitor density positively correlates with the number of gorillas banging on the barrier, and that low zoo visitor density caused gorillas to behave in a more relaxed way. Captive animals often cannot escape the attention and disruption caused by the general public, and the stress resulting from this lack of environmental control may lead to an increased rate of self-injurious behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Deborah L. |title=A note on the influence of visitors on the behavior and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2005 |volume=93 |issue=1-2 |pages=13–17 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(05)00181-4/pdf |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.019 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of self inflicted harm, some animals exhibit harm towards others and internal psychological harm. This can be exhibited in various forma, such as Orca whales, which never have killed a human in the wild, killing two of its own trainers. Psychological tics can also be identified, ranging from swaying to head bobbing to pacing. Continuous inbreeding is also bringing out mental disadvantages, such as crossed eyes and infertility.

Studies suggest that many abnormal captive behaviors, including [[Self-injurious behavior#Other animals|self-injurious behavior]], can be successfully treated by pair housing. Pair housing provides a previously single-housed animal with a same-sex social partner;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Kate C. |first2=Mollie A. |last2=Bloomsmith |first3=Brooke |last3=Oettinger |first4=Kimberly |last4=Neu |first5=Caroline |last5=Griffis |first6=Valérie |last6=Schoof |first7=Margaret |last7=Maloney |title=Benefits of pair housing are consistent across a diverse population of rhesus macaques |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2012 |volume=137 |issue=3-4 |pages=148–156 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2011.09.010 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(11)00304-2/pdf |subscription=yes|pmc=4307811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this method is especially effective with primates, which are widely known to be [[social animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.L. |last=Weed |first2=P.O. |last2=Wagner |first3=R. |last3=Byrum |first4=S. |last4=Parrish |first5=M. |last5=Knezevich |first6=D.A. |last6=Powell |title=Treatment of persistent self-injurious behavior in rhesus monkeys through socialization: A preliminary report |journal=Contemporary Topics in Laboratory Animal Science |year=2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=21–23 |pmid=14510519 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social companionship provided by pair housing encourages social interaction, thus reducing abnormal and anxiety-related behavior in captive animals as well as increasing their [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]].&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

'''Chalk River Laboratories''' ({{lang-fr|Laboratoires de Chalk River}}; also known as '''CRL''', '''Chalk River Labs''' and formerly '''Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories''') is a Canadian [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] research facility in [[Deep River, Ontario|Deep River]], [[Renfrew County]], [[Ontario]], near [[Chalk River]], about {{cvt|180|km}} north-west of [[Ottawa]].

CRL is a site of major research and development to support and advance nuclear technology, in particular [[CANDU reactor]] technology. CRL has expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology, and engineering and unique research facilities. For example, [[Bertram Brockhouse]], a professor at [[McMaster University]], received the 1994 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics for his pioneering work in [[neutron spectroscopy]] while at CRL from 1950-1962.  Sir [[John Cockcroft]] was an early director of CRL and also a [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]]. CRL produces a large share of the world's supply of [[Nuclear medicine|medical radioisotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chalk River makes 1st isotopes in 15 months|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=August 18, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606061302/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned by the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories subsidiary of [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] and operated under contract by the Canadian National Energy Alliance, a private-sector consortium led by [[SNC-Lavalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marowits|first1=Ross|title=SNC-Lavalin consortium chosen to run Chalk River nuclear lab|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|accessdate=February 9, 2017|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=June 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415135343/http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|archivedate=April 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:NRX_Pile_Building_and_ZEEP_Building-_Cooling_Tanks_1945.jpg|thumb|right|NRX and Zeep buildings, Chalk River Laboratories, 1945]] The facility arose out of a 1942 collaboration between British and Canadian nuclear researchers which saw a [[Montreal Laboratory|Montreal research laboratory]] established under the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC).  By 1944 the Chalk River Laboratories were opened and in September, 1945 the facility saw the first nuclear reactor outside of the United States become operational (see [[Lew Kowarski]]).  In 1946, NRC closed the Montreal laboratory and focused its resources on Chalk River.

In 1952, [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) was created by the government to promote peaceful use of nuclear energy.  AECL also took over operation of Chalk River from the NRC.  Throughout the 1950s-2000s various nuclear research reactors have been operated by AECL for production of nuclear material for medical and scientific applications.  The Laboratories produce about one-third of the world's [[Nuclear medicine|medical isotopes]], and about half of the North American supply. Despite the declaration of peaceful use, from 1955 to 1976, Chalk River facilities supplied about 250&amp;nbsp;kg of [[plutonium]], in the form of spent reactor fuel, to the U.S. Department of Energy to be used in the production of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;letter from Dept. of Energy official, March 4, 1996, published at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628205542/http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki]], Japan, used about 6.4&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.)

Canada's first [[nuclear power plant]], a partnership between AECL and [[Ontario Hydro|Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], went online in 1962 near the site of Chalk River Laboratories. This reactor, [[Nuclear Power Demonstration]] (NPD), was a demonstration of the [[CANDU reactor]] design, one of the world's safest and most successful nuclear reactors.

The Deep River [[neutron monitor]] operated once in Chalk river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081714/http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952 NRX incident===
Chalk River was also the site of two nuclear accidents in the 1950s. The first incident occurred in 1952, when there was a [[Criticality accident|power excursion]] and partial loss of coolant in the [[NRX]] reactor, which resulted in significant damage to the core. The control rods could not be lowered into the core because of mechanical problems and human errors. Three rods did not reach their destination and were taken out again by accident. The fuel rods were overheated, resulting in a meltdown. The reactor and the reactor building were seriously damaged by hydrogen explosions. The seal of the reactor vessel was blown up four feet. In the cellar of the building, some 4,500 tons of radioactive water was found. This water was dumped in ditches around 1600 meters from the border of the [[Ottawa River]]. During this accident some 10,000 [[curies]] or 370 TBq of radioactive material was released.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Nuclear Society'' (1989) [http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/nrx.html The NRX Incident by Peter Jedicke]&lt;/ref&gt; Future [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Jimmy Carter]], then a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] officer, was part of the cleanup crew.&lt;ref name="paulson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|title=Reactor Accidents: The Human Fallout|author=|date=|website=www.ccnr.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923232909/http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|title=Jimmy Carter timeline|author=|date=|website=pbs.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329152940/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|archivedate=29 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the reactor was in use again.&lt;ref name="CNF1952"&gt;{{en icon}} ''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRX reactor in 1952?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958 NRU incident===
The second accident, in 1958, involved a fuel rupture and fire in the [[National Research Universal reactor]] (NRU) reactor building. Some fuel rods were overheated. With a robotic crane, one of the rods with metallic [[uranium]] was pulled out of the reactor vessel. When the arm of the crane moved away from the vessel, the uranium caught fire and the rod broke. The largest part of the rod fell down into the containment vessel, still burning. The whole building was contaminated. The valves of the ventilation system were opened, and a large area outside the building was contaminated. The fire was extinguished by scientists and maintenance men in protective clothing running along the hole in the containment vessel with buckets of wet sand, throwing the sand down at the moment they passed the smoking entrance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both accidents required a major cleanup effort involving many civilian and military personnel.  Follow-up health monitoring of these workers has not revealed any adverse impacts from the two accidents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }} What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|title=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability|author=|date=|website=www.nuclearfaq.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006022038/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Anti-nuclear movement in Canada#Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility|Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility]], an [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] watchdog group, notes that some cleanup workers who were part of the military contingent assigned to the NRU reactor building unsuccessfully applied for a military disability pension due to health damages.&lt;ref name="paulson"/&gt;

Chalk River Laboratories remain an AECL facility to this day and are used as both a research (in partnership with the NRC) and production facility (on behalf of AECL) in support of other Canadian electrical utilities.

=== 2007 shutdown ===
On November 18, 2007, the NRU, which makes medical radioisotopes, was shut down for routine maintenance. This shutdown was extended when AECL, in consultation with the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC), decided to connect seismically-qualified emergency power supplies (EPS) to two of the reactor's cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), which had been required as part of its August 2006 operating licence issued by the CNSC.  This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because Chalk River makes the majority of the world's supply of medical radioisotopes, including two-thirds of the world's [[technetium-99m]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402220916/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2007, the [[House of Commons of Canada]], acting on independent expert advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor and its operation for 120 days (counter to the decision of the CNSC), which was passed by the Senate and received [[Royal Assent]] on December 12. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] criticized the CNSC for this shutdown which "jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians", insisting that there was no risk, contrary to the testimony of then CNSC President &amp; CEO Linda Keen. She would later be fired for ignoring a decision by Parliament to restart the reactor, reflecting its policy that the safety of citizens requiring essential [[nuclear medicine]] should be taken into account in assessing the overall safety concerns of the reactor's operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090931/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Ljunggren |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |title=Canadian parliament orders isotope reactor restart |journal=Reuters |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603180453/http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |archivedate=2009-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sunday, May 5, 2013 3:49 PM EDT Facebook Twitter RSS |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |title=Much more at stake than medical isotopes &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002154837/http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |title=Chalk River plant to begin making radioisotopes in a week - Canada - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926071822/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |title=Harper government fires Linda Keen over isotope crisis |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110071829/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

===2008 radioactive leakage===
On December 5, 2008, [[heavy water]] containing tritium leaked from the NRU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |title=Current Issues - CNSC Report to Minister of Natural Resources regarding recent events at National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055045/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaked water was contained within the facility, and the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC) was notified immediately, as required.

In its formal report to the CNSC, filed on December 9, 2008 (when the volume of leakage was determined to meet the requirement for such a report) [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]] mentioned that 47 litres of heavy water were released from the reactor, about 10% of which evaporated and the rest contained, but affirmed that the spill was not serious and did not present a threat to public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |title=Agency says it was told of nuke leak within hours &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604012750/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount that evaporated to the atmosphere is considered to be minor, accounting for less than a thousandth of the regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615020303/http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public was informed of the shutdown at the reactor, but not the details of the leakage since it was not deemed to pose a risk to the public or environment.  The leak stopped before the source could be identified, and the reactor was restarted on December 11, 2008 with the approval of the CNSC, after a strategy for dealing with the leak (should it reappear) was put in place.

In an unrelated incident, the same reactor had been leaking 7,001 litres of light water per day from a crack in a weld of the reactor's reflector system.  This water has been systematically collected, purified in an on-site Waste Treatment Centre, and eventually released to the Ottawa River in accordance with CNSC, Health Canada, and Ministry of the Environment regulations.  Although the leakage is not a concern to the CNSC from a health, safety or environmental perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |title=News Releases |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229170842/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; AECL has plans for a repair to reduce the current leakage rate for operational reasons.

===2009 NRU reactor shutdown===
{{Main|National Research Universal reactor#2009 Shutdown|l1=National Research Universal reactor&amp;nbsp;— 2009 Shutdown}}
In mid-May 2009 the heavy water leak at the base of the NRU reactor vessel, first detected in 2008 (see above), returned at a greater rate and prompted another temporary shutdown that lasted until August 2010.  The lengthy shutdown was necessary to first completely defuel the entire reactor, then ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairs&amp;nbsp;— all with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of 8 metres due to the residual radioactive fields in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage. {{citation-needed|date=December 2016}}

==NRU shutdown in March 2018==
The NRU reactor licence expired in 2016, however the licence was extended to March 31 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|title=Canada's NRU reactor in Chalk River is being turned off for good  - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409162437/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|archivedate=9 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10679">{{short description|Measure of the amount of oxygen that can be consumed by reactions in a solution}}
In [[environmental chemistry]], the '''chemical oxygen demand''' ('''COD''') is an indicative measure of the amount of [[oxygen]] that can be consumed by [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] in a measured [[solution]]. It is commonly expressed in [[mass]] of oxygen consumed over [[volume]] of solution which in SI units is milligrams per litre ([[milligram|mg]]/[[Litre|L]]). A COD test can be used to easily quantify the amount of [[organic compound|organics]] in [[water]]. The most common application of COD is in quantifying the amount of oxidizable [[pollutant]]s found in [[surface water]] (e.g. [[lake]]s and [[river]]s) or [[wastewater]]. COD is useful in terms of [[water quality]] by providing a metric to determine the effect an [[effluent]] will have on the receiving body, much like [[Biochemical oxygen demand|biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)]].

==Overview ==
The basis for the COD test is that nearly all organic compounds can be fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] with a strong [[oxidizing agent]] under [[acid]]ic conditions. The amount of [[oxygen]] required to oxidize an organic compound to carbon dioxide, [[ammonia]], and water is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{C}_n\mbox{H}_a\mbox{O}_b\mbox{N}_c + \left( n + \frac{a}{4} - \frac{b}{2} - \frac{3}{4}c \right)\mbox{O}_2 \rightarrow n\mbox{CO}_2 + \left( \frac{a}{2} - \frac{3}{2}c \right)\mbox{H}_2\mbox{O} + c\mbox{NH}_3&lt;/math&gt;
This expression does not include the oxygen demand caused by [[nitrification]], the oxidation of ammonia into [[nitrate]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{N}\mbox{H}_3 + 2\mbox{O}_2 \rightarrow \mbox{N}\mbox{O}_3^- + \mbox{H}_3\mbox{O}^+&lt;/math&gt;
[[Chromate and dichromate|Dichromate]], the oxidizing agent for COD determination, does not oxidize ammonia into nitrate, so nitrification is not included in the standard COD test.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] describes a standard method for measuring chemical oxygen demand in ISO 6060 [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=12260&amp;ICS1=13&amp;ICS2=60&amp;ICS3=50].

== Using potassium dichromate==
[[Potassium dichromate]] is a strong oxidizing agent under acidic conditions. Acidity is usually achieved by the addition of [[sulfuric acid]]. The reaction of potassium dichromate with organic compounds is given by:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{C}_n\ce{H}_a\ce{O}_b\ce{N}_c\ +\ d\ce{Cr2O7^2-}\ +\ (8d\ +\ c)\ce{H+ -&gt; }n\ce{CO2}\ +\ \frac {a + 8d - 3c}{2}\ce{H2O}\ +\ c\ce{NH4+}\ + 2d\ce{Cr^3+}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d = 2n/3 + a/6 - b/3 - c/2&lt;/math&gt;. Most commonly, a 0.25 [[normality (chemistry)|N]] solution of potassium dichromate is used for COD determination, although for samples with COD below 50&amp;nbsp;mg/L, a lower concentration of potassium dichromate is preferred.

In the process of oxidizing the organic substances found in the water sample, potassium dichromate is reduced (since in all [[redox]] reactions, one reagent is oxidized and the other is reduced), forming Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The amount of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is determined after oxidization is complete, and is used as an indirect measure of the organic contents of the water sample.

===Measurement of excess===
For all organic matter to be completely oxidized, an excess amount of potassium dichromate (or any oxidizing agent) must be present. Once oxidation is complete, the amount of excess potassium dichromate must be measured to ensure that the amount of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be determined with accuracy. To do so, the excess potassium dichromate is [[titration|titrated]] with [[ferrous ammonium sulfate]] (FAS) until all of the excess oxidizing agent has been reduced to Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Typically, the oxidation-reduction indicator [[ferroin]] is added during this titration step as well. Once all the excess dichromate has been reduced, the ferroin indicator changes from blue-green to a reddish brown. The amount of [[ferrous ammonium sulfate]] added is equivalent to the amount of excess potassium dichromate added to the original sample. Note: Ferroin indicator is bright red from commercially prepared sources, but when added to a digested sample containing potassium dichromate it exhibits a green hue. During the titration the color of the indicator changes from a green hue to a bright blue hue to a reddish brown upon reaching the endpoint. Ferroin indicator changes from red to pale blue when oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/f.shtml|title=General Chemistry Online: Glossary:|author=|date=|website=antoine.frostburg.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation of ferroin indicator reagent==
A solution of 1.485 g 1,10-[[phenanthroline]] monohydrate is added to a solution of 695&amp;nbsp;mg FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in distilled water, and the resulting red solution is diluted to 100 mL.

===Calculations===
The following formula is used to calculate COD:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COD} = \frac{8000 (b - s)n}\text{sample volume}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is the volume of FAS used in the blank sample, ''s'' is the volume of FAS in the original sample, and ''n'' is the normality of FAS. If milliliters are used consistently for volume measurements, the result of the COD calculation is given in mg/L.

The COD can also be estimated from the concentration of oxidizable compound in the sample, based on its stoichiometric reaction with oxygen to yield CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (assume all C goes to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (assume all H goes to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (assume all N goes to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following formula:

:COD = (''C''/FW)&amp;middot;(RMO)&amp;middot;32

Where 
:''C'' = Concentration of oxidizable compound in the sample,
:FW = Formula weight of the oxidizable compound in the sample,
:RMO = Ratio of the # of moles of oxygen to # of moles of oxidizable compound in their reaction to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, water, and ammonia

For example, if a sample has 500 Wppm (Weight Parts per Million) of phenol:

:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 7O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 6CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:COD = (500/94)&amp;middot;7&amp;middot;32 = 1191 Wppm

==Inorganic interference==
Some samples of water contain high levels of oxidizable inorganic materials which may interfere with the determination of COD. Because of its high concentration in most [[wastewater]], [[chloride]] is often the most serious source of interference. Its reaction with potassium dichromate follows the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{6Cl^- + Cr_2O_7^{2-} + 14H^+ \rightarrow 3Cl_2 + 2Cr^{3+} + 7H_2O}&lt;/math&gt;

Prior to the addition of other reagents, [[mercuric sulfate]] can be added to the sample to eliminate chloride interference.

The following table lists a number of other inorganic substances that may cause interference. The table also lists chemicals that may be used to eliminate such interference, and the compounds formed when the inorganic molecule is eliminated.

==Government regulation==
Many governments impose strict regulations regarding the maximum chemical oxygen demand allowed in waste water before they can be returned to the environment. For example, in [[Switzerland]], a maximum oxygen demand between 200 and 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/L must be reached before waste water or [[industrial water]] can be returned to the environment [https://web.archive.org/web/20040310122559/http://www.csem.ch/corporate/Report2002/pdf/p56.pdf].

==History==
For many years, the strong [[oxidizing agent]] [[potassium permanganate]] ([[potassium|K]][[manganese|Mn]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was used for measuring chemical oxygen demand. Measurements were called ''oxygen consumed'' from permanganate, rather than the ''oxygen demand'' of organic substances. Potassium permanganate's effectiveness at oxidizing organic compounds varied widely, and in many cases [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) measurements were often much greater than results from COD measurements. This indicated that potassium permanganate was not able to effectively oxidize all organic compounds in water, rendering it a relatively poor oxidizing agent for determining COD.

Since then, other oxidizing agents such as [[ceric sulphate]], [[potassium iodate]], and [[potassium dichromate]] have been used to determine COD. Of these, potassium dichromate ([[Potassium_dichromate|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]) has been shown to be the most effective: it is relatively cheap, easy to [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purify]], and is able to nearly completely oxidize almost all organic compounds.

In these methods, a fixed volume with a known excess amount of the oxidant is added to a sample of the solution being analyzed. After a refluxing digestion step, the initial concentration of organic substances in the sample is calculated from a titrimetric or spectrophotometric determination of the oxidant still remaining in the sample. As with all colorimetric methods [[blank (solution)|blanks]] are used to control for contamination by outside material.

'''Comic timing''' is the use of rhythm, tempo, and pausing to enhance [[comedy]] and [[humour]]. The pacing of the delivery of a [[joke]] can have a strong impact on its comedic effect, even altering its meaning; the same can also be true of more physical comedy such as [[slapstick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Capture Your Flag|title=Matt Ruby on How to Improve Comic Timing|date=2011-10-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ljIlqGNp0|accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''beat''' is a pause taken for the purposes of comic timing, often to allow the audience time to recognize the joke and react, or to heighten the suspense before delivery of the expected [[punch line]]. Pauses, sometimes called "dramatic pauses" in this context, can be used to discern subtext or even unconscious content&amp;mdash;that is, what the speaker is really thinking about. A pause can also be used to heighten a switch in direction. As a speaker talks, the audience naturally "fills in the blanks", finishing the expected end of the thought. The pause allows this to happen before the comedian delivers a different outcome, surprising the listener and (hopefully) evoking laughter.

[[Jack Benny]] and [[Victor Borge]] are two comedians known for using the extended beat, allowing the pause itself to become a source of humour beyond the original joke. [[George Carlin]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]] are two other stand-up comedians considered{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} to have superior timing.

== Some examples ==
{{Synthesis|section|date=March 2014}}

=== George Carlin ===

[[George Carlin|Carlin]]'s most famous routine was his "[[Seven Words You Can't Say On Television]]", in which much of the humour is derived from a sudden, rapid-fire delivery of the seven words. The remainder of the routine was a mock-scholarly analysis of why these words are not as bad as the world would have us believe. Here, comic timing is used again as Carlin moved from the rapid list to a more reasoned dissection of the words.

=== Rowan Atkinson ===

[[Rowan Atkinson|Atkinson]] is another example of timing in this regard. His "No One Called Jones" routine involves his reading a class roll of students at what we can assume is an exclusive English boarding school. In one version of this routine, each name is a [[double entendre]]. In this sort of routine, it is very important to use beats, as simply racing through the list would spoil the effect of many of the jokes.

=== Victor Borge ===

Commonly recognized as a master of comic timing,{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=|https://books.google.com.au/books?id=YA3cCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63&amp;lpg=PT63&amp;dq=victor+borge+master+of+comic+timing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hq_yT8bvJI&amp;sig=s3cySJT7UMole11tvtYJmLsN0O8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwizt_Omv4zdAhWKMN4KHcprBEYQ6AEwDHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=victor%20borge%20master%20of%20comic%20timing&amp;f=false=}} Danish-American comedian [[Victor Borge]] provides even more examples of this art. Much of his routine involved references to particular pieces of [[european classical music|classical music]], [[opera]] and [[composer]]s. Having learned English as a second language, Borge was known for frequently playing around with its conventions. A prime example is his question to his audience, "Is there anyone who would like to hear the famous ''Polonaise'' in A Flat by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]?" After hearing the inevitable calls of "Yes, yes", Borge would respond, "Very well, is there anyone here who can play it?" Another famous line is his explanation for the third pedal on a grand piano&amp;mdash;"The pedal in the middle is there to separate the other two pedals...(''beat'')...which could be a problem for those of you who have three feet."

Borge, therefore, builds his audience up to the joke, but only delivers the actual punchline when he is fully aware that they are silent and prepared to hear it. His famous "[[Inflationary Language]]" routine demonstrates the other side of this statement. In this routine, Borge adds one to every "number in the language", (making "wonderful" into "two-derful" and so on) and his "Phonetic Punctuation" routine, wherein he assigns a sound to every punctuation mark. These routines then consist of Borge reading a story under one of these systems. The comic timing is seen by the way that he reads alternately slowly and rapidly, in keeping with the action of the story.

=== Sacha Baron Cohen ===
In [[Sacha Baron Cohen|Cohen]]'s mockumentary ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', the character Borat is coached on the importance of comic timing. He is to state "That suit is black (pause) NOT!" However, he does it with both no pause, with too long a pause, and [[Use-mention distinction|even the word "pause."]]

==Farce==
The [[farce]] is another example of comic timing. Here, the humour is derived both from rapid speech and rapid movement&amp;mdash;people running into and out of rooms at breakneck speed and managing to cause havoc in the process as commonly used in the series ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.

==Pregnant pause==
A pregnant pause (as in the [[wiktionary:pregnant|classical definition]], "many possibilities") is a technique of comic timing used to accentuate a comedy element, which uses comic pauses at the end of a phrase to build up [[suspense]]. It's often used at the end of a comically awkward statement or in the silence after a seemingly non-comic phrase to build up a comeback. Refined by [[Jack Benny]] who introduced specific body language and a phrase in his pregnant pauses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Well! Jack's Back : HBO tribute remembers the late comedian |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-04/news/tv-632_1_jack-benny-show |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pregnant pause has become a staple of [[stand-up comedy]].

'''Conceptual history''' (also the '''history of concepts''' or, from German, '''''Begriffsgeschichte''''') is a branch of historical and cultural studies that deals with the historical [[semantics]] of terms. It sees the [[etymology]] and the change in meaning of terms as forming a crucial basis for contemporary cultural, conceptual and linguistic understanding. Conceptual history deals with the evolution of paradigmatic ideas and value systems over time, such as "liberty" or "reform." It argues that [[social history]] – indeed all historical reflection – must begin with an understanding of historically contingent cultural values and practices in their particular contexts over time, not merely as unchanging ideologies or processes.

Interest in conceptual history was given a particular boost in the 20th century through the publication of the ''Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie'', the ''Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe'' and the journal [[Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte]].

Conceptual history is an [[interdisciplinary]] methodology. Alongside the [[philosopher]] [[Joachim Ritter]], the [[historian]]s [[Otto Brunner]] and  [[Reinhart Koselleck]] and the [[sociologist]] [[Erich Rothacker]] are viewed as the leading scholars of the research area in the German-speaking world and internationally. [[Raymond Williams]] is the leading scholar in the English-speaking world. Examples of conceptual histories include a genealogy of the concept of globalization drawing on the approach of Williams written by Manfred B. Steger and Paul James:

{{cquote|Although keywords represent a critical mass of the vocabulary of any given era, the history of their meaning construction often remains obscure. ‘Globalization’ is no exception. While the meanings of other seminal ‘keywords’ such as ‘economics’, ‘culture’, or ‘modernity’ evolved rather slowly and built upon a relatively continuous base, ‘globalization’ has had a very short and discontinuous history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Steger | first2= Manfred B. | title= A Genealogy of Globalization: The Career of a Concept | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rglo20/11/4#.VR0vDzuUdPM | journal= Globalizations | volume=  11 | issue=  4 | pages= 418–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"'''Do it yourself'''" ("'''DIY'''") is the method of building, modifying, or [[repair]]ing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals. Academic research describes DIY as behaviors where "individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)".&lt;ref&gt;Wolf &amp; McQuitty (2011). Understanding the Do-It-Yourself Consumer: DIY Motivation and Outcomes. ''Academy of Marketing Science Review''&lt;/ref&gt; DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as [[market economy|marketplace]] motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and [[identity (social science)|identity]] enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness).&lt;ref&gt;Wolf &amp; McQuitty (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "do-it-yourself" has been associated with consumers since at least 1912 primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber (1997). Do-It-Yourself: Construction, Repairing and Maintaining Domestic Masculinity. ''American Quarterly''. doi:[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/american_quarterly/v049/49.1gelber.html 10.1353/aq.1997.0007]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "do it yourself" had come into common usage (in standard English) by the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Constructing Contemporary: Common sense approaches to 'going modern in the 1950s"&gt;{{cite book|editors=McKellar, S.; Sparke, P. |title=Interior Design and Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking [[home improvement]] and various other [http://cradiori.com/guide-to-paper-quilling-everything-you-need-to-know-get-started/ small craft] and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity.

Subsequently, the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets. DIY is associated with the international [[alternative rock]], [[punk rock]], and [[indie rock]] music scenes; [[indymedia]] networks, [[pirate radio]] stations, and the [[zine]] community. In this context, DIY is related to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in that it offers an alternative to modern [[consumer culture]]'s emphasis on relying on others to satisfy needs. It has also become prevalent in the personal finance. When investing in the stock one can utilize a professional advisor or partake in [[do-it-yourself investing]].

==History==
Italian archaeologists unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an "ancient [[IKEA]] building". The structure was a [[Greek temple|temple-like]] building discovered at [[Tito, Basilicata|Torre Satriano]], near the southern city of [[Potenza]], in [[Basilicata]], a region where local people mingled with [[Greeks]] who settled along the southern coast known as [[Magna Graecia]] and in [[Sicily]] from the 8th century BC onwards. Professor Christopher Smith, director of the [[British School at Rome]], said that the discovery was "the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way". Much like the instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the [[Sparta]]n colony of [[Taranto]] in [[Apulia]].&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter of the Hellenic Society of Archaeometry, N.110, May 2010, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-came-with-diy-instructions.html Ancient Building Came With DIY Instructions], Discovery News, Mon Apr 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-greek-temple-do-it-yourself-photos.html Ancient Building Comes with Assembly Instructions, (photos)], Discovery News&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, there was a DIY magazine publishing niche in the first half of the twentieth century. Magazines such as ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' (founded in 1902) and ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'' (founded in 1928) offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills, techniques, tools, and materials. As many readers lived in rural or semi-rural regions, initially much of the material related to their needs on the farm or in a small town.

== Home improvement ==

[[File:Movable shelves built on discarded toy vehicle.jpg|thumb|150px|Shelves attached to a toy vehicle]]
The DIY movement is a re-introduction (often to urban and suburban dwellers) of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in the upkeep of a house or apartment, making clothes; maintenance of cars, computers, websites; or any material aspect of living. The philosopher [[Alan Watts]] (from the "[[Houseboat Summit]]" panel discussion in a 1967 edition of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'') reflected a growing sentiment:

{{Quotation|Our educational system, in its entirety, does nothing to give us any kind of material competence. In other words, we don't learn how to cook, how to make clothes, how to build houses, how to make love, or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life. The whole education that we get for our children in school is entirely in terms of abstractions. It trains you to be an insurance salesman or a bureaucrat, or some kind of cerebral character.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan et al. "Houseboat Summit" in ''The San Francisco Oracle'', issue #7.  San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1970s, DIY spread through the North American population of college- and recent-college-graduate age groups. In part, this movement involved the renovation of affordable, rundown older homes. But it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s. The young visionary [[Stewart Brand]], working with friends and family, and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools, published the first edition of ''The [[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' (subtitled ''Access to Tools'') in late 1968.

[[File:California-dome-house.jpg|thumb|left|Fiberglass dome house, California, in style of the Whole Earth Catalog building techniques]]

The first ''Catalog'', and its successors, used a broad definition of the term "tools". There were informational tools, such as books (often technical in nature), professional journals, courses, classes, and the like. There were specialized, designed items, such as [[carpenters]]' and [[Stonemasonry|masons]]' tools, [[garden tools]], [[welding]] equipment, [[chainsaws]], fiberglass materials and so on; even early personal computers. The designer [[J. Baldwin]] acted as editor to include such items, writing many of the reviews. The ''Catalog'''s publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism, convention-breaking, and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s. Often copied, the ''Catalog'' appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence.

DIY home improvement books burgeoned in the 1970s, first created as collections of magazine articles. An early, extensive line of DIY how-to books was created by [[Sunset Books]], based upon previously published articles from their magazine, ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'', based in California. [[Time-Life]], [[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]], [http://balconygardenweb.com/ Balcony Garden Web] and other publishers soon followed suit.

[[File:Electronics World Sep 1959.jpg|thumb|150px|''Electronics World'' 1959, home assembled amplifier]]
In the mid-1990s, DIY [[home-improvement]] content began to find its way onto the [[World Wide Web]]. HouseNet was the earliest bulletin-board style site where users could share information. HomeTips.com, established in early 1995, was among the first Web-based sites to deliver free extensive DIY home-improvement content created by expert authors.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Since the late 1990s, DIY has exploded on the Web through thousands of sites.

In the 1970s, when home video ([[VCR]]s) came along, DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means.  In 1979, the [[PBS]] television series ''[[This Old House]]'', starring [[Bob Vila]], premiered and this spurred a DIY television revolution. The show was immensely popular, educating people on how to improve their living conditions (and the value of their house) without the expense of paying someone else to do (as much of) the work. In 1994, the [[HGTV]] Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada, followed in 1999 by the [[DIY Network]] cable television channel. Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics, from [[home renovation|home improvement]] to [[knitting]]. Such channels have multiple shows showing how to stretch one's budget to achieve professional-looking results (''[[Design Cents]]'', ''[[Design on a Dime]]'', etc.) while doing the work yourself. ''[[Toolbelt Diva]]'' specifically caters to female DIYers.

Beyond magazines and television, the scope of home improvement DIY continues to grow online where most mainstream media outlets now have extensive DIY-focused informational websites such as ''[[This Old House]]'', [[Martha Stewart]], [[Hometalk]], and the [[DIY Network]]. These are often extensions of their magazine or television brand. The growth of independent online DIY resources is also spiking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119074337787638918 ''Wall Street Journal'', September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of homeowners who [[blog]] about their experiences continues to grow, along with DIY websites from smaller organizations.

==Fashion==
[[File:Mennonite Women Dressmaking Pennsylvania 1942.jpg|thumb|180px|Mennonite farmer's wife [[dressmaking]] (1942)]]
DIY amongst the [[fashion]] community is popular, with ideas being shared on social media such as [[YouTube]] about clothing, jewellery, makeup and hair styles. Techniques include [[distressing]] jeans, bleaching jeans, redesigning an old shirt, and studding [[denim]]. This trend is becoming popular.

DIY as a subculture could be said to have begun with the [[punk movement]] of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote = "Yet, it remains within the subculture of punk music where the homemade, A4, stapled and photocopied fanzines of the late 1970s fostered the "do-it-yourself" (DIY) production techniques of cut-n-paste letterforms, photocopied and collaged images, hand-scrawled and typewritten texts, to create a recognizable graphic design aesthetic."|url = http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/1/69|title = Triggs, Teal (2006) Scissors and Glue: Punk Fanzines and the Creation of a DIY Aesthetic, in "Journal of Design History", vo. 19, n. 1, pp. 69-83.|accessdate = 2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of traditional means of bands reaching their audiences through large music labels, bands began recording, manufacturing albums and merchandise, booking their own tours, and creating opportunities for smaller bands to get wider recognition and gain cult status through repetitive low-cost DIY touring. The burgeoning [[zine]] movement took up coverage of and promotion of the [[Underground music|underground]] punk scenes, and significantly altered the way fans interacted with musicians. Zines quickly branched off from being hand-made music magazines to become more personal; they quickly became one of the youth culture's gateways to [[DIY culture]]. This led to tutorial zines showing others how to make their own shirts, posters, zines, books, food, etc.

The Rev. '''Edmond La Beaume Cherbonnier''' (February 11, 1918 – March 7, 2017) was an American scholar in the field of religious studies.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.philosophy-religion.org/cherbonnier/pdfs/EDMOND-LaB.pdf A Brief Biography of Edmond La B. Cherbonnier]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Professor of Religion at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College, Connecticut]], and as a [[deacon]] in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]].

==Early life==
Edmond Cherbonnier was born on February 11, 1918, in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]].  His father, Edward Goodwin Cherbonnier, was a vice president of the [[Ralston Purina Company]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1138F934A25756C0A961948260 Laurie Goodwin Cherbonnier Marries John Christopher Nielsen in Hartford]", ''The New York Times'', May 17, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from [[St. Louis Country Day School]], Cherbonnier entered [[Harvard University]], where he majored in [[geology]].&lt;ref name="barnardarchive1"&gt;"Cherbonnier talks at noon meeting", ''[http://barnardcollege.newspaperarchive.com/ Barnard Bulletin]'', November 2, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts ''[[cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name="commentary1"&gt;Cherbonnier, E. La B., "[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/a--j--heschel-and-the-philosophy-of-the-bible-br-em-mystic-or-rationalist-em-2943 Abstract - A. J. Heschel and the Philosophy of the Bible: Mystic or Rationalist?]", ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' (January 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; During his undergraduate years, when associated with Harvard’s [[Winthrop House]], (one of twelve undergraduate residences)&lt;ref name="crimson1"&gt;"[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=458563 Cherbonnier elected next P.B.H. President]", ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', March 08, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; he was elected President of the [[Phillips Brooks House Association]] (a student-run public service organization).&lt;ref name="crimson1" /&gt; He was a member of the [[Winthrop House]] Committee and the Harvard [[Glee Club]], and an active participant for several years in social service work at the [[Phillips Brooks House Association]].&lt;ref name="crimson1" /&gt;

==Professional career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:cherbonnier.jpg|upright|thumb|Cherbonnier in the 1970s]] --&gt;
Cherbonnier held a brief post as teacher of [[Latin]] at [[Avon Old Farms School]] in [[Avon, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, Cherbonnier enrolled at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City|New York]]; his graduate studies were interrupted while he served as a naval aviator during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="commentary1" /&gt; After his wartime service, he resumed his [[theological]] studies and in 1947 received the degree of [[Bachelor of Divinity]] from Union. In the same year he was ordained a deacon by the Episcopal Bishop of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diocesemo.org/whoweare/clergydirectory.htm Clergy from The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent study on a Fiske Fellowship from Harvard&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=471828 Fellowships Awarded for Travel, Study]", ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', June 19, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; led to the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] (1948) and [[Master of Arts]] (1952) from [[Cambridge University]], England. Additionally, from 1948-1949 Cherbonnier was in residence as a Union Seminary Traveling Fellow at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and the [[University of Zurich]].

Cherbonnier entered the doctoral program at [[Columbia University]]; while studying during the 1949-1950 school year, Cherbonnier was a tutor-assistant to Henry P. Van Dusen at Union. He held a one-year appointment as assistant professor of religion at [[Vassar College|Vassar]] (1950–1951)&lt;ref&gt;[http://specialcollections.vassar.edu/findingaids/biographical_files.html#series3 Guide to the Vassar College Biographical Files, 1900-1983]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in a [[Ph.D.]] degree in religion conferred by Columbia. His doctoral thesis was entitled "[http://www.philosophy-religion.org/cherbonnier/pdfs/Freedom-and-Time.pdf Freedom and Time: A Study in Some Recent Contributions to the Problem]".

From Vassar, Cherbonnier joined the faculty of [[Barnard College]] of Columbia University,&lt;ref name="barnardarchive1" /&gt; where he remained until the spring of 1955 as assistant and associate professor of religion. In addition, from 1952 to 1955 he served as Deacon at the nearby [[Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine]], during the Deanship of the later controversial Bishop of California [[James A. Pike]]. On May 31, 1954, ''[[The New York Times]]'' highlighted one of his cathedral sermons in an article "Worship Of Ideals Held Destructive".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1954/05/31/archives/worship-of-ideals-held-destructive-st-johns-deacon-warns-on.html?sq=Worship%2520Of%2520Idols%2520Held%2520Destructive&amp;scp=1&amp;st=cse Worship Of Ideals Held Destructive - St. John's Deacon Warns on Idolatry of Democracy as a Danger of Our Time]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 31, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherbonnier received praise for his efforts early in his career. In 1952, [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] expressed gratitude to Cherbonnier in his Preface to ''The Irony Of American History'' "for careful reading of my manuscript and for many suggestions for its improvement".&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, Reinhold (1952). ''The Irony Of American History'' p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Cherbonnier’s book ''Hardness of Heart'' was published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. A volume in the “Christian Faith Series” edited by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], the study provided a contemporary interpretation of the doctrine of sin. During the next year it was also published by London’s [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]. Psychiatrist [[Karl Menninger|Karl Menninger, M.D.]] presented a synopsis of the book in his ''The Vital Balance'': “Cherbonnier in his beautiful essay, Hardness of Heart, describes the forms of [[idolatry]] indulged in by the hardhearted. He lists the hidden gods of cynicism as nationalism, [[humanism]], [[phallicism]], [[promiscuity]], the glorification of money, and the various euphemisms such as frugality, shrewdness, and sound economy. Cherbonnier also lists [[iconoclasm]], existentialist despair, and a so-called state of “adjustment” and “relatedness” toward which some psychiatrists are believed to steer their patients.”&lt;ref&gt;Menninger, Karl (1963). ''The Vital Balance'' p.375&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1955, Cherbonnier was invited by [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], to establish a religion department. After serving two years as an associate professor, he was promoted to full professor and was then joined by a second department member, Dr. Theodor Marcus Mauch.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wickedlocal.com/brewster/archive/x857471503 Obituaries for October 19]." ''The Cape Codder'', October 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cherbonnier’s chairmanship, the department was enlarged to a staff of five full-time professors plus adjunct faculty.

Professor Cherbonnier was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]], [[honoris causa]] by the [[University of Vermont]] in 1959. He took a sabbatical leave in 1962-63 to London, England, which was partially underwritten by a Lilly Post-Doctoral Fellowship.  He spent his sabbatical performing further work on distinctions between mystical and biblical thought.  Dr. Cherbonnier took another leave for the 1970-1972 academic years plus the first semester of 1972-1973, which he also spent in England. He retired from his Trinity position in 1983.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Dr. Cherbonnier's interests include the [[Shroud of Turin]] and the life of [[Saint Joan of Arc]] (1412-1431 C.E.).

He is a [[chaplain]] in the [[Venerable Order of Saint John#The Priory in the United States of America|Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem - Priory in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintjohn.org/usapriory/2005_memberlist_eh.asp Members List of Priory of St John]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|Not to be confused with dates [[anno Mundi]],  abbreviated 'AM'.}}
The '''Era of the Martyrs''' ({{lang-la|anno martyrum}}), also known as the '''Diocletian era''' ({{lang-la|anno Diocletiani}}), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century{{nbsp}}AD and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. Western Christians were aware of it but did not use it. It was named for the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Diocletian]] who instigated the [[Diocletianic Persecution|last major persecution against Christians]] in the Empire. Diocletian began his reign 20 November 284 during the [[Byzantine_calendar#Alexandrian_Era|Alexandrian year]] that began on 1 Thoth, the Egyptian New Year, or 29 August 284, so that date was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]: year one of the Diocletian era began on that date. This era was used to number the year in [[Paschal_Full_Moon|Easter tables]] produced by the Church of Alexandria. 

When [[Dionysius Exiguus]] continued those tables for an additional 95 years, he replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003, 767&lt;/ref&gt; The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times. 

The anno Diocletiani era was not the only one used by early Christians. Most Roman Christians, like the pagan Romans before them, designated their years by naming the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. The Romans also used the [[ab urbe condita]] (AUC) era. Its name is Latin for "from the founding of the City (Rome)." However, the AUC era was hardly ever used outside historical treatises.

Eras that began at Creation, called [[anno Mundi]] eras, became the dominant method of numbering years in the East until modern times, such as in the [[Byzantine calendar]]. [[Annianus of Alexandria]], a monk who flourished at the beginning of the 5th century, placed the epoch of his world era on 25 March 5492{{nbsp}}BC by counting back eleven 532-year [[paschal cycle]]s from anno Diocletiani 77, itself four 19-year [[lunar cycle]]s after anno Diocletiani 1. Regarded as a civil rather than a religious era, it began on the first day of the Alexandrian year, 29 August 5493{{nbsp}}BC. This Alexandrian era was the preferred era used by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Christians such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] until the Byzantine era, having an epoch of 1 September 5509{{nbsp}}BC, became dominant in the 10th century. Both eras used a version of [[dating Creation]] based on the [[Septuagint]].

In [[music]], an '''extension''' is a set of [[musical note]]s that lie outside the standard [[range (music)|range]] or [[tessitura]].

==Staff==
A note that lies outside the lines of a musical staff is an extension of the staff.  The note will lie on a [[ledger line]].  [[Middle C]] for example is an extension note on both treble and bass clefs, however is not outside the grand staff.  Soprano C and Deep C lie two ledger lines above treble and below bass respectively (as well as the [[grand staff]]).

==Instruments==
An instrumental extension is a range of playable notes outside the normal range of the instrument.  A [[baritone horn]], if played by a skillful player, can be played an octave above the normal range.  Since this isn't standard, these notes would be an extension. See also: [[Crook (music)]]. With the bowed string instruments, lower pitches than the standard range are sometimes used through [[scordatura]] in which the lowest string is tuned down a note or two. The double bass sometimes uses a [[Double bass#Tuning|C extension]] extending the range of the E string downwards to C. Some [[Bösendorfer]] pianos have extra keys, extending the range several notes lower than a standard 88-key piano.

==Voice==
In vocal performance, a singer's extension is all notes that are a part of the singer's vocal range that lie outside the singer's [[tessitura]].  This usually include notes that a singer can hit, but doesn't use on a regular basis. For example, a [[coloratura]] [[soprano]] regularly, as defined by range, will sing in the [[whistle register]]. A standard [[mezzo-soprano]] has a range to the high F or G above [[middle C]], however a [[mezzo-soprano|mezzo]] with good head voice extension can rival the [[coloratura]] [[soprano]] in range. However, since her normal [[tessitura]] is [[mezzo-soprano]] (or under [[Soprano C]]), her abilities in the whistle register would be considered her extension.

Although not commonly thought of, extension can be applied to the lower register as well.  A baritone may actually be able to reach depths of low D or E below low C, but is more comfortable in the higher [[baritone]] [[tessitura]]. A special class of soprano, the [[soprano sfogato]], while retaining the high notes characteristic of the soprano vocal range, may be able to hit down to E3 using the chest voice. Due to dearth of true contraltos, usually mezzo-sopranos with strong low extension are employed instead in roles such as ''Ulrica'' in Verdi's [[Un ballo in maschera]].

For men, their vocal extension upwards is usually co-terminus{{Jargon-inline|date=January 2017}} with his [[falsetto]], unless they are a [[countertenor]], barbershop tenor, or its equivalent in [[popular music]].

Uses of extensions include:
* providing an ''acuto'', i.e. an accented high note which may or may not be written in the score, e.g. in cadenzas, mad scenes etc.
* providing a cadence ''in acuti'', e.g. Eb6 at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in [[La traviata]] (which had in fact became a tradition if the soprano is able and the conductor allows it).
* ornamental purposes, usually in massive scale works, e.g. ''D'amor al dolce impero'' in Rossini's ''[[Armida (Rossini)|Armida]]''

{{Sociology}}
{{Feminism sidebar|Theory}}
'''Feminist sociology''' is a [[conflict theory]] and theoretical perspective which observes [[gender]] in its relation to power, both at the level of [[face-to-face interaction]] and [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] within a [[social structure]] at large. Focuses include [[sexual orientation]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social stratification|economic status]], and [[nationality]].

At the core of feminist sociology is the idea of the systemic [[oppression]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A phenomenon derived from prehistoric-human social- behavioral patterns, specifically regarding the (Fe)Male relationship; as well as significant gender differentiation in terms of physical and mental attributes. This Idea of origin is Key to the progression of 'equalist' ideals, which have grown to engulf a number of socially important injustices, yet is often not realized in the Psyche of the individual and thus not beheld, conceptually by public; possibly due to the absence of a cross-conceptual, analytical thinking pattern.{{Original research inline|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of women and the historical dominance of men within most societies: '[[patriarchy]]'. [[Feminist]] thought has a rich history, however, which may be categorized into three 'waves'. The current, '[[third wave feminism|third wave]]', emphasizes the concepts of [[globalization]], [[postcolonialism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Contemporary feminist thought has frequently tended to do-away with all generalizations regarding sex and gender, closely linked with [[antihumanism]], [[posthumanism]], [[queer theory]] and the work of [[Michel Foucault]].

'''[[Feminist theory]]-''' [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]](1860-1935) was a women ahead of her time who work and research would help formalize "feminist theory during the 1960s. Growing up she went against traditional holds that were placed on her by society by focusing on reading and learning concepts different than women who were taught to be a housewife. Her main focus was on gender inequality between men and women along with gender roles placed on my society. Where men go to work secure proper income for the family while women stay at home and tend to the family along with house hold chores.  She "emphasized how differential socialization leads to gender inequality". Yet, she did agree that biologically there is different between those born with female and male parts. 

Parts of her research involves a theoretical orientation of a multidimensional approach to gender and discusses more in depth in her book ''Women and Economics''. Due to gender roles she believes that women pretend to live a certain life to avoid achieving their full potential living the role of a housewife. This is an example of falling under [[False consciousness|false consciousness]] instead of "true" consciousness. Leading the belief that women are viewed as property towards their husbands because despite their own work they may do; economically women were still dependent on husbands to provide financial support to themselves and their family. She also stated that the traditional division of labor was not biologically driven , but instead pushed upon based structure of how society was established since before the 19th century. 

In the end Gilman describes it as ''sociobiological'' tragedy because women are disregarded as being part of the ideology of "survival of the fittest". Instead females are thought to be soft and weak individuals that are only good for productive reasons. Females are depicted as emotional and frail human beings who are born to serve their husbands, children, and family without living for herself. Gilman's research was conducted during a time where women being a sociologist were unheard of; she lived during a time that women couldn't even vote. Her research helps create a ripple effect along with other female sociologists that help paved wave for feminism, feminist, and concepts to correlate with feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociological Theory in the Classical Era|last=Edles|first=Laura|last2=Appelrouth|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4129-7564-3|location=|pages=9,222-255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism

[[Heterosexism]] is a system of attitudes, bias, and [[discrimination]] in favour of male-female [[sexuality]] and relationships.
Heterosexism describes a set of [[paradigms]] and institutionalized beliefs that systematically disadvantage anyone other than heterosexual, which can stem from personal beliefs, societal institutions and or a country's government. For example, heterosexual [[marriage]] has been or is the only lawful union between two people that was or is fully recognized and subsequently given full benefits in many countries. This has acted to greatly disadvantage people in same-sex relationships within society as compared with those in different-sex relationships.

==Feminism and race==
Women who suffer from oppression due to race may find themselves in a [[double bind]]. The relationship between feminism and race was largely overlooked until the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminists]] produced greater literature on the topic of '[[black feminism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahony, Pat, and Christine Zmroczek. Class matters: 'working-class' women's perspectives on social class. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Julia Cooper]] and [[Ida Bell Wells-Barnett]] are African American women who were instrumental in conducting much research and making valuable contributions in the field of black feminism.  "Cooper and Wells-Barnett both consciously drew on their lived experiences as African American women to develop a "systematic consciousness of society and social relations."  As such, these women foreshadow the development of a feminist sociological theory based in the interests of women of colour."&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer George and Goodman Douglas (2004) Classical Sociological Theory, Fourth Ed.  p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

An instrumental contribution to the field was [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]]'s seminal 1989 paper, "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex:A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics" (Crenshaw 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K. 1989. "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics". University of Chicago Legal Forum: Vol. 1989: Iss. 1, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt;. In it she outlines the manner in which black women have been erased from feminist pedagogy. Black women must be understood as having multiple identities that intersect and reinforce one another, the two key experiences of being black and of being women. Furthermore, black women suffer on both racist and sexist fronts, marginalized not only by larger systems of oppression but by existing feminist discourse that disregards their [[intersectionality]]. Crenshaw's work is integral to understanding feminist sociology, as it advocated for black feminist thought and set the building blocks for future feminist sociologists such as [[Patricia Hill Collins]]. 

==Feminism and queer theory==
Modern queer theory attempts to unmake the social and contextual elements reinforcing [[heteronormativity]] by challenging oppressive institutions on traditional binary distinctions between male and female, among its many other criticisms. In this regard, feminism and queer theory address the same ways social structures violently categorize and erase women and LGBTQIA+ from the social narrative. However, sociological feminism often reinforces the gender binary through the research process "as the gendered subject is made the object of the study" (McCann 2016, 229). In her recent work "Epistemology of the Subject: Queer Theory's Challenge to Feminist Sociology"&lt;ref&gt;McCann, H. 2016. "Epistemology of the Subject: Queer Theory's Challenge to Feminist Sociology". WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly, Volume 44, Numbers 3 &amp; 4, Fall/Winter 2016, pp. 224-243.&lt;/ref&gt;, McCann confronts the theoretical perspective and methodology of feminist sociology:"[the subject] rarely reflects the fluid, unstable, and dynamic realities of bodies and experiences. To “settle” on a subject category, then, is to reinscribe a fixity that excludes some, often in violent ways (for example, those who are literally erased because their bodies do not conform to a discrete binary)" (McCann 2016, 231-232). There can be a refashioning of the field, where extending boundaries to include queer theory would "develop new and innovative theoretical approaches to research...[and] address inequality within society" (McCann 2016, 237). 

==Feminist critiques of multiculturalism==
Debates within [[ethnic relations]], particularly regarding the opposing perspectives of [[assimilationism]] and [[multiculturalism]], have led to the accusation that feminism is incompatible with multiculturalist policy. The remit of multiculturalism is to allow distinct cultures to reside in Western societies, or separate societies in general, and one possible consequence is that certain religious or traditional practices may negate Western feminist ideals. Central debates include the topics of [[arranged marriage]] and [[female genital mutilation]]. Others have argued that these debates stem from Western [[orientalism]] and general political reluctance to accept foreign migrants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">In [[esoteric]] and [[occult]] teachings, '''giants''' are beings who live on [[spiritual (spiritual plane)|spiritual]], [[etheric (etheric plane)|etheric]] and [[physical (physical plane)|physical]] [[planes of existence]]. Giants were a popular theme in [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] [[literature]], [[Atlantis]], [[lost continents]] and later the [[earth mysteries]] movement of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

==History==
The concept of giants was discussed by the [[theosophist]] and [[occult]] author [[Blavatsky]] who wrote about the existence of giants in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' connecting them to her theory of [[root races]] and claiming they correspond with [[Hindu cycle of the universe]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third [[root race]] who lived on the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner, Fads and fallacies in the name of science, 1957, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race.

The [[Germans|German]] [[occultist]] [[Guido von List]] was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together [[paganism]], [[mythology]], and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology, 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz]], an [[Egyptologist]] and [[tradition]]alist, believed that giants had roamed the [[earth]], and that after the fall of [[Adam]], humanity fell into a state of degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen, 2008, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Spence]], a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched [[English folklore]] and mythology depicting such giants such as [[Gog and Magog|Magog]] and the British giant [[Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Spence, 1976, The Occult Sciences in Atlantis, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British [[journalist]] and author [[William Comyns Beaumont]]. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and [[archeology]]. Beaumont believed that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was the location of [[Atlantis]] and that it was occupied by a giant race of [[Aryan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZNKVA1JcWwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=comyns+beaumont+giants&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlr3TcGTBpOctwejoeS_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Karl Shaw, Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s many of the authors of the [[earth mysteries]] movement in Britain wrote about Giants. [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] wrote about the existence of giants in his book ''The View over Atlantis''. Anthony Roberts wrote the book ''Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History'' in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the  [[British Isles]] and linked [[Alfred Watkins]]' [[ley lines]] to the British giants.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chippindale, Stonehenge complete, Cornell University Press, 1983, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13998">'''Girl studies''', also known as '''girlhood studies''', is an interdisciplinary academic field of study that is focused on [[girl]]hood and girls' culture that combines advocacy and the direct perspectives and thoughts of girls themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kirk, Jackie, Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh. “Welcome to this inaugural issue of Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal (GHS).” ''Girlhood Studies'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2008. 
&lt;/ref&gt;  The field officially emerged in the 1990s after decades of falling under the broader field of women’s studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|year=2009|title=Coalescing: The Development of Girls' Studies|url=|journal=NWSA|volume=21|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars within girl studies examine social and cultural elements of girlhood and move away from an adult-centered focus.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Driscoll, Catherine. “Girls Today: Girls, Girl Culture and Girl Studies.” ''Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' vol. 1, no. 1, 2008. 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those working in the field of girl studies have studied it primarily in relation to other fields that include sociology, psychology, education, history, literary studies, media studies, and communication studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Girl studies seeks to work directly with girls themselves in order to analyze their lives and understand the large societal forces at play within them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Scholars in girl studies also explore the connection the field has to [[women's studies]], [[boyhood]] studies, and masculinity studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History and development ==
Girl studies officially became a field in the 1990s, after the increase in conversation about getting more girls into science, math, and technology fields in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girlhood and the Politics of Place|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Mitchell|editor-first=Claudia|location=|pages=|chapter=Charting Girlhood Studies|editor-last2=Rentschler|editor-first2=Carrie|editor-link2=Carrie Rentschler}}&lt;/ref&gt; though scholars and researchers were studying girls prior to this decade. In the 1970s, some feminist scholars brought to attention the unbalanced focus of boyhood in comparison to girlhood in youth research. Angela McRobbie, Meda Chesney-Lind, and Christine Griffin were some of the few scholars studying and critiquing the lack of study on girlhood and girl culture in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the early 1990s, the [[Harvard]] Project on Women's Psychology and Girls' Development conducted a study on the social development of relationships of girls. This study found that when they approach adolescence, girls begin to hide their honest feelings and desires from those they are in close relationships with, making it hard for them to express their feelings later in life. In 1992, the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) published ''How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' "the first national survey to assert a link between girls' psychosocial experience and schooling".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Benjamin, Beth Cooper and Ward, Janie Victoria. “Women, Girls, and the Unfinished Work of Connection: A Critical Review of American Girls’ Studies.” ''All about the Girl: Culture, Power, and Identity'', edited by Anita Harris, Psychology Press, 2004, pp. 15-27.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Girl studies emerged in the 1990s, a time when there was an increased interest from the media and fashion and beauty industries in young women. Advertisers and retailers marketed towards girls by "promising female youth agency and social value" from purchasing the products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the academy, there was an increase in feminist and gender studies scholars focusing on intersectionality and subsequently on girls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2008, scholars Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, and [[Jackie Kirk]] established and launched ''[[Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]'' after recognizing the emerging interest in the field at the 2001 "A New Girl Order: Young Women and the Future of Feminist Inquiry" conference at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As girl studies develops, "there has been significant movement away from studying girls as future women and toward analyzing girls as members of a unique demographic group", especially in psychology, history, and sociology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a movement towards focusing more on [[intersectionality]] and the experiences of girls across the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a 2016 article, Claudia Mitchell acknowledges the presence of girlhood studies in Africa, referencing a South African video project called ''Vikea Abantwana (Protect The Children: A Story about Incest)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14jxn16.10|title=Girlhood and the Politics of Place|date=2016|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857456021|pages=87–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video chronicles the life of Philendelini, a young girl who was raped by her father. Mitchell mentions this film to highlight the necessity of girlhood studies; in the film, Philendelini confides in several adult women about her assault and is ignored or turned down in each instance.

On the topic of insuring an intersectional and transnational approach in girl studies, scholar Oneka LaBennett commented “Black schoolgirls and college students have engaged in protests across the globe. Girls themselves have drawn attention to the negative impact of things like white beauty standards, the intersections of racial and gender violence, the problems with police brutality and the school-to-prison pipeline."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Meet-the-Scholars-Building-a/239716|title=Meet the Scholars Building a Network Around Black Girlhood|date=2017-04-06|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Black Girlhood Studies ==
Black Girlhood Studies has developed in recent years to combat the white washed field of Girls' studies. Black girlhood studies is understood as a site of Black feminist inquiry with aims of centering the coming into knowing Black girls’ experience and representations of Black girlhood. In ''Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist'' Ruth Nicole Brown states that Black girlhood are, “the representations, memories, and lived experiences of being and becoming in a body marked as youthful, Black, and female.”&lt;ref name="Brown, Ruth Nicole 2008"&gt;Brown, Ruth Nicole. Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-Hop Feminist Pedagogy. First printing edition. New York: Peter Lang Inc., International Academic Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Brown, Black girlhood is a powerful concept that enables Black girls to create sacred spaces for themselves and each other even while structural forces work “to posit [Black girls] as the very “risky” problem, an aberration of normal.”&lt;ref name="Brown, Ruth Nicole 2008"/&gt;  Brown’s sentiments were echoed again during the 2016 “Black Girl Movement: A National Conference”, a three-day conference at Columbia University in New York City that focused on Black girls, cis, queer, and trans girls, in the United States. The purpose of the conference was to recognize that while Black girls are “among the most significant cultural producers, community connectors, and trendsetters”, Black girls still remain highly invisible and “are in crisis.”&lt;ref&gt;“Black Girl Movement Conference | IRAAS Institute for Research in African-American Studies.” Accessed December 7, 2017. http://iraas.columbia.edu/Event/black-girl-movement-conference.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars  have used this moment to theorize liberating projects for Black girls and Black girlhood, a site of both theoretical and practical analysis. Founded by LaKisha Simmons, Renee Sentilles, and Corinne Field, [https://historyofblackgirlhood.org/ History of Black Girlhood: An Academic Network] provides a forum for scholars centering Black girlhood to share work and collaborate. While many of the work in Black Girlhood Studies is contemporary, there are Black feminist canonical texts that hone in on the ways in which Black girlhood has always already been present in the work of Black women ([[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]] by Toni Morrison, [[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf|For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf]] by Ntozake Shange, [[The Bluest Eye]] by Toni Morrison, [[Bone Black|Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood]] by bell hooks, among many others). These materials span literature, film, poetry, policy, magazine articles, and so on.

Many of the texts foundational to the contemporary field of Black girlhood studies fall within an ethnographic tradition. These works include Elizabeth Chin’s ''Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture'' (2001), Ruth Nicole Brown’s ''Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist Pedagogy'' (2009) Oneka LaBennett’s S''he’s Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn'' (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox’s ''Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship'' (2015). These texts examine Black girls’ complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities as they navigate and resist multiple forms of violences. These [[Ethnography|ethnographies]] are rooted in a Black feminist epistemological emphasis on centering lived experiences.

Historians Abosede George ''Making Modern Girls: A history of girlhood, labor, and social development in 20th century colonial Lagos'' (2015), Marcia Chatelain ''South Side Girls: Growing Up in the Great Migration'' (2015), LaKisha Simmons ''Crescent City Girls: The Lives of Young Black Women in Segregated New Orleans'' (2015) extends beyond the ethnographic work of the field in which the three scholars mentioned focus on place and social history to tell the stories of Black girls. This regional approach emphasizes the necessary local specifies of Black girlhood. Nazera Sadiq Wright's ''Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century'' (2016) traces a long literary tradition to discover the origins of Black girlhood as we have come to understand the category today.

== Criticism ==
As an emerging field, girl studies has faced some criticisms from other scholars. Janie Victoria Wald and Beth Cooper Benjamin have found that connections between "girls' psychosocial development and persistent issues in adult women's lives" are not as present in recent scholarship as they were during the advent of the field and believe they should be in order to explore intergenerational relationships.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These two scholars also criticize the increased specialization of focus in the field and subsequent disconnect between the subfields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mary Celeste Kearney, a scholar who does work in girl studies, notices that though there is a focus on intersectionality within the field, "non-white, non-Western girls remain vastly understudied as result of such research being conducted primarily in Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Northern Europe, and the United States."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some critics identify problems that they see with the field as a whole, claiming that it is neither a new nor exciting field, as the ''[[Girlhood Studies]]'' journal states, but rather one that is established and in crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes Kaitlynn, Kumarini Silva, Linda Duits, Liesbet van Zoonen, Sharon Lamb, Shakuntala Banaji, and Natalie Edwards (2009) Commentary and criticism, Feminist Media Studies, 9:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

When girls are growing up, they are learning from the women around them, what is right and what is wrong. Women of the older ages are set up as role models for those who are under the age of 18. The future of girlhood is in the hands of those who chose to set a good example forward for these young people to grasp onto. Marnina et al., explained in their book that we are past the after-girl power stage (2009). After passing this stage these groups of writers are posing another question as to if there is something that comes after this stage. Girls have seen violence from all sorts of stages causing them to fear their growing up ways. As mentioned in the text ''History and Popular Culture at Work in the Subjectivity of a Tween,'' the authors daughter was scared to become an adult because of the concerns of others. Other people in her class were bring articles and other pieces of writing that scared Elisabeth into thinking that growing up was not something that she wanted to do (2005). With girls having these types of ideas rushing through their minds as they get older – we are not helping them grow in a safe space. Instead, we are raising them to fear the outside world and not want to be a part of it. This can change if we focus on what comes next once we pass the after-girl power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16007">The H-500 project is an outline planning scheme in accordance with the Planning and Building Law for South [[Holon]], [[Israel]]. The area of the project is approximately 4,080 dunams and it is the largest, undeveloped land reserve remaining in Holon. The scheme is bounded in the north by Sderot Yerushalayim and the Kiryat Sharet and Kiryat Pinhas Ayalon neighbourhoods, in the east by Highway no. 4, in the south by the border with the city of [[Rishon LeZion]] and in the west by [[Highway 20 (Israel)]] (the Ayalon Highway).

== General Background ==
The scheme (Holon H-500) adapts the land zoning, and the deployment and height of construction, to the restrictions deriving from NOPS 2/4 (the National Outline Planning Scheme for the development of [[Ben Gurion Airport]]), which fixed the location of the flight paths adjacent to and above the site of the H-500 scheme. The restrictions deriving from the Airport's activity are expressed in a limit of the final height of the buildings in the project (a maximum of 22 stories), height limits for masts and antennas and also restrictions relating to the erection of cranes during construction. In addition, the use of acoustic elements for noise insulation is prescribed, as are provisions intended to minimise the hazards deriving from flying birds that might endanger passing aircraft.

According to the scheme, in the version that has been deposited (Holon H-500), a green area of 1,200 dunams or thereabouts is planned for the development of a metropolitan sand dune park at the centre of the site. The centre of the park, which is called the "preserved heart", will include an area of not less than 400 dunams of natural sand dunes in order to preserve the unique ecology that includes a wide range of rare plants, the like of which is not to be found elsewhere along the coast. The ring around the "preserved heart" will form the outer envelope of the park and will be zoned for municipal recreation and leisure activity.

Further to the hearing of oppositions to the deposited version of the scheme (Holon H-500), the district planning and building committee decided to extend the "preserved heart" of the park at the expense of the area for future planning. The 1,500 dwelling units that were allotted in an area for future planning according to the deposited version of the scheme were moved by the district committee's decision to the residential domains, so that their allotment will not be dependent on changes to the Airport flight paths.

== Milestones in the Holon H-500 scheme approval proceedings ==
* Notice of the scheme's preparation and the conditions for the issue of building permits during the interim three-year period according to sections 77 and 78 of the Planning and Building Law was first published in the press on August 10–11, 2006 and in Government Notices no. 5562 of August 2, 2006.
* Notice of an extension of the time for the issue of conditional building permits during the interim period, for one year or until the scheme's deposit, according to section 78 of the Planning and Building Law was published in Government Notices no. 6080 of April 28, 2010.
* Notice of the scheme's deposit in accordance with section 89 of the Planning and Building Law was published in Government Notices no. 6444 of July 11, 2012.
* The decision of the district planning and building committee (the opposition subcommittee) to ratify the Holon H-500 scheme was made on February 18, 2013.
* The decision of the appeal subcommittee of the national council to approve the scheme was made on May 14, 2014.
* The decision of the district planning and building committee (the opposition subcommittee) to ratify the scheme, subject to technical modifications and transitional provisions to permit the existing uses until the preparation of detailed plans, was made on October 12, 2015.

== Building rights – quantitative data of the Holon H-500 scheme ==
* 1,300 low-rise dwelling units
* 12,400 high-rise dwelling units (including 1,500 dwelling units that were moved from the area for future planning that was cancelled in order to increase the size of the sand dune park), of which 2,000 are small dwelling units of 80 m² each, including safe room, for eligible persons.
* 13,700 dwelling units in total (including 800 for encouragement and assistance in the elimination of nuisances and the removal of squatters).
* 930,000 m² (principal area) for employment of various types, including commercial and multipurpose zoning.
* 175,000 m² (principal area) for public buildings.

== The main provisions of the Holon H-500 scheme ==
* A condition for the approval of an initial detailed plan will be the approval of a scheme incorporating division into different domains for consolidation and partition or a plan including such partition as part of, or contemporaneously with, the initial detailed plan ("the domains scheme").
* The domains scheme will prescribe the division of building rights between the domains, the conditions for realisation of the rights in each individual domain and provisions for consolidation and partition that will include reference to the division of public areas.
* The domains scheme will amongst other things prescribe the area of the park that will be included in the various different detailed plans, with reference to the part of the park located in each domain, provided that complete development of the whole park is ensured.

== History ==
The sand dunes of South Holon have been a focus of real estate activity since the beginning of the last century. At that time, before the establishment of the Holon Local Council, the area was defined as being under galilee jurisdiction, that is to say that it was not under the jurisdiction of any local authority, adjacent to the Arab village of Yazur. The first outline scheme that was prepared for the area by the planning agencies during the British Mandate was called the "Agrobank And Neighbourhood Regional Outline Road Scheme".

The scheme was provisionally approved on October 30, 1939 and finally on January 14, 1942 (its approval was published in the Official Gazette, no. 1164). The purpose of the scheme was to delineate the road network for the new neighbourhoods that were to be built around the Agrobank neighbourhood, situated to the north, adjacent to [[Mikveh Israel]].

In the 1930s private individuals and commercial companies started buying large tracts of land totalling hundreds of dunams from the Arab landowners. Parcellation plans were prepared in accordance with the Mandatory City Building Ordinance, which divided the large tracts of land into small parcels of between 300 and 500 m² each, creating neighbourhoods that incorporated roads and plots for public purposes, in conformity with the Mandatory outline scheme for Holon, R/128, the preparation of which began in the early 1940s

The parcels resulting from the parcellation plans were entered in the Land Registers and came to be traded on the open market in Israel and also abroad. At that time great importance was attached to the redemption of the land and for that reason many parcels were bought by the Jews of Europe, USA and South Africa, with the assistance of public leaders who were harnessed to the task on visiting Jewish communities abroad. Thus, for example, Dr Haim Kugel, who went on to become the first Mayor of Holon, helped in the land redemption when he visited the Jewish community in South Africa. For that reason there are still many owners (the heirs of the original owners) of land within the boundaries of the scheme who are non-residents.

The following are examples of the historical parcellation of land in South Holon:

* The creation of blocks 6747, 6748, 6749 and 6750 by the Agricultural and Building Bank for Palestine Ltd
* The partition of parcel 690 in block 6043 by the Land and Loan Company Ltd.

The first outline planning scheme for the City of Holon, H/1, dating from 1958, cancelled all the Mandatory plans for the construction of new residential neighbourhoods in South Holon and zoned the whole area for planning again as an "area for reparcellation" (fresh consolidation and partition). The H-500 scheme is the third and most recent of the outline planning schemes (following H/1 and Amendment no. 3 to H/1) and it proposes a new planning scheme for the whole area.

== The Moledet Neighbourhood ==
The Moledet neighbourhood is included within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. The neighbourhood was established in 1930 as the first residential suburb of South Holon and it is one of the first five neighbourhoods (together with Agrobank, Greene, Kiryat Avoda and Am) that combined into the Holon Local Council in 1940.

The Moledet land was purchased by a company called Hamizrach, headed by the engineer, Alexander Hissin. The centre of the neighbourhood was the Water Tower. The first residents were eight immigrant families from Yemen but by the end of 1934, just four years later, the population of the neighbourhood had reached about 100 families.

Because of Moledet's remoteness from other Jewish settlements and its proximity to the Arab villages of Yazur and Bayt Dajan, the neighbourhood was attacked by Arabs from Jaffa in the great Arab revolt between 1936 and 1939 and almost completely abandoned. Its residents went to live temporarily at the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School.

The Security Road, which was paved in 1948 as an alternative to the Jaffa – Jerusalem Road (now Highway no. 44), with the object of connecting Tel Aviv to the settlements of the South and Jerusalem, ran through Moledet.

Dozens of families now live in Moledet, alongside a few businesses and workshops. All the buildings in the neighbourhood, apart from the Water Tower and Security Road that have been zoned for preservation, are to be cleared according to the H-500 scheme (see below – the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).

== The Givat Holon Neighborhood ==
Givat Holon is located within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. This small suburb is located to the south of Kiryat Sharet in the heart of the sand dune area, alongside the road leading to the site of the municipal abattoir.

Givat Holon includes several dozen homes. The buildings were constructed at the beginning of the 1940s and remain in their original format. Although according to outline scheme H/1 (Amendment no. 3), which was approved in 1978, the area was zoned as residential, in order to enlarge construction in the area it was necessary to prepare a detailed plan. Because of the limitations deriving from the neighbourhood's location in the area affected by the Airport, it was not possible to develop the neighborhood and it has therefore remained in its original state, without modern infrastructure.

The residents of Givat Holon took legal proceedings against Holon Municipality and in June 2014 they were awarded judgement requiring the Municipality to grant them proper municipal services, like garbage removal and the provision of refuse bins, and the installation of lampposts and street signs.

Givat Holon is due to be cleared as part of the H-500 scheme (see below – the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).

== The Abattoir ==
The Abattoir tract is a 254 dunam piece of land that is included in the H-500 scheme. The land was expropriated from private owners in 1961 further to authority obtained by the Mayor of Holon in accordance with the Land Ordinance for the establishment of a regional abattoir and associated industrial facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/b3858e_9a8d0aa430ce481eb5324ac8322f97d0.pdf/ |title=A letter of the mayor of Holon written on Feb. 14, 1960, regarding getting permission to expropriate land for the making of the regional Abattoir|publisher=Joseph Raiten, The Holon H-500 Trade Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end a joint company was established by the Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities (80% Tel Aviv and 20% Holon) in order to promote the venture and bear its costs, including the compensation payable to the private landowners.

Further to the expropriation proceedings, in 1966 a town planning scheme (H-142) for the construction of an abattoir and associated industries was approved. According to the scheme it was permitted to build an abattoir and meat processing facilities.

The aforegoing might today sound like a figment of the imagination: to expropriate 250 dunams of land for an abattoir in the sandhills of South Holon, big enough to serve the whole Middle East. Nevertheless, at that time, the venture did appear to justify such a large-scale expropriation. Not one of the private landowners objected to the venture and even had anyone objected, it is doubtful whether he would have had any chance of succeeding against Holon's then legendary mayor, Pinchas Ayalon.

In fact, apart from one building that was constructed at the end of the 1960s, which served as a municipal abattoir until the beginning of the 1990s, the rest of the land remained empty and undeveloped. The abattoir building was blown up in June 2015 as part of an exercise by the Home Front Command.

The landowners in the abattoir domain, Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities, are expected to obtain rights in the scope of the H-500 scheme for the clearance of the abattoir (section 2.2.4 of the scheme regulations).

== The Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet ==
The H-500 scheme lays down directions for the preservation of the Security Road and the historic sites associated with it in accordance with the municipal preservation plan. The scheme nevertheless prescribes the clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet because of the limitations of using the area, which is affected by the flight paths according to the Ben Gurion Airport national outline scheme. After clearance, the neighborhoods will become part of the municipal sand dune park.

The deposited plan contains merely general provisions for the compensation of the residents of Moledet, the clearance to be financed from building rights that have been allotted specifically for the purpose, totalling 800 dwelling units (designated for the clearance of three centres: the refuse site, the abattoir and Moledet). The scheme further provides that the total compensation will be determined by a real estate appraiser to be appointed by the local planning and building committee.

Further to appeals that were filed against the district planning and building committee's decision (which the residents of Givat Holon also joined), which culminated in the decision of the appeal subcommittee of the national council of May 15, 2014, several operative decisions were made in respect of the clearance of Givat Holon (from which inferences may be drawn in respect of the clearance of Moledet) as follows:

* The clearance of the existing residents will be effected in consolidation and partition proceedings in accordance with the detailed plan, in which the area will be zoned for the park. The residents will be allotted other land in accordance with the relevant provisions of law.
* Until the clearance of Givat Holon it will be possible to continue using the existing lawful buildings for residential purposes.
* So long as residential use continues in Givat Holon, the issue of building permits for the renovation (not including extension) of existing buildings will be permitted by virtue of existing permits.
* The residents will obtain their rights in the scope of the first plan that is approved by virtue of the H-500 scheme.
* Clearance will only be effected when the implementation of the first detailed plan commences or at such other time as it prescribes.

===Final 2014–2015===

In October 2015, the five finalist teams were chosen:  Moralities of Intelligent Machines, Biodiversity Now, Helsinki Sleep Factory, SafePreg – Health into Next Generation and NEMO - Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction.  The jury for the final included Chancellor Thomas Wilhelmsson (chair), Pro-Vice Chancellor of Education [[Sally Mapstone]] from the [[University of Oxford]], Professor of Practice Pasi Sahlberg from [[Harvard University]]’s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], Director Ulrich Weinberg from the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] School of Design Thinking and President Mikko Kosonen of the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]].

====Winner teams====

The €375,000 prize for the science-based idea competition Helsinki Challenge was divided between two teams. The winner was NEMO – Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction, which received €250,000, while the runner-up, Biodiversity Now, received €125,000.The prize money is intended for realising the team’s idea.

NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online.The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions.This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction.The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications.

Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy-receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize-of-250000?publisherId=1807796&amp;releaseId=36507619&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2016–2017==

The second Helsinki Challenge was kicked off in August 2016. The winner will be announced in conjunction with the centennial of [[Finland]]'s independence in 2017. The new Helsinki Challenge themes: Sustainable Plant, Urban Future and People in Change are linked to the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The intention is to create solutions for future wellbeing through cooperation with a range of different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2307">The '''Hessian Bibliography''' ({{lang-de|Hessische Bibliographie}}) is a German regional bibliography. Its aim is to completely capture all the literature connected with the geography, history and culture of the German federal state of [[Hesse]] from the year 1974. It is based on the holdings of the [[legal deposit|copyright libraries]] at [[Kassel University Library|Kassel]], [[Fulda]], [[Frankfurt University Library|Frankfurt]], [[Hessian State Library|Wiesbaden]] and [[Hessian State Library|Darmstadt]].

By 2000 a total of 24 indexed year books had appeared in print; since then it has only been available in electronic form as a freely accessible database of the Hessian library information system ([[HEBIS]]). The titles are recorded in accordance with the Rules for Alphabetic Cataloguing and accessed using a comprehensive system of about 1,200 system sites and keywords. About 6,500 bibliographic records are added per year. 

The Hessian bibliography is part of the [[Virtual German National Bibliography]], which has its own web portal.

For the period before 1974, the "Literature on the History and Historic Geograph and Culture of Hesse"&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Demandt, Winfried Leist, Wolfgang Podehl (Bearb.): ''Schrifttum zur Geschichte und geschichtlichen Landeskunde von Hessen.'' Marburg/Wiesbaden 1965–1984. ([http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=1.1/SET=5/TTL=1/CLK?IKT=12&amp;TRM=011043458 Titelnachweis]).&lt;/ref&gt; is used. This consists of seven printed volumes by Karl Ernst Demandt (covering the period to 1964) and by Winfried Leist and Wolfgang Podehl (covering the period 1965-1976). Currently, the volumes of Podehl and Leist are gradually being added retrospectively to the database.

'''Human geography''' is the branch of [[geography]] that deals  with the study of people and their communities,
cultures, economies, and interactions with the environment by studying their relations with and across space and place.&lt;ref name="HGDICT"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Johnston|first=Ron|editor1-last=Johnston|editor1-first=Ron|editor2-last=Gregory|editor2-first=Derek|editor3-last=Pratt|editor3-first=Geraldine|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Watts|editor4-first=Michael|title=Human Geography|encyclopedia=The Dictionary of Human Geography| pages=353–60|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human geography attends to human patterns of social interaction, as well as spatial level interdependencies, and how they influence or affect the earth's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russel|first1=Polly|title=Human Geography|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelpsubject/socsci/humangeog/humangeography.html|website=British Library|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/human/index_en.html|title=Human Geography|last=Reinhold|first=Dennie|date=February 7, 2017|website=www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an intellectual discipline, [[geography]] is divided into the sub-fields of [[physical geography]] and human geography, the latter concentrating upon the study of human activities, by the application of [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research]] methods.

==History==
{{Main article|History of geography}}
{{History of geography sidebar}}
Geography was not recognized as a formal academic discipline until the 18th century, although many scholars had undertaken geographical scholarship for much longer, particularly through [[cartography]].

The [[Royal Geographical Society]] was founded in [[England]] in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Geographical Society|title=History|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/History.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the United Kingdom did not get its first full Chair of geography until 1917. The first real geographical intellect to emerge in [[United Kingdom]]'s geographical minds was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.

The [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became, and continues to be, a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education on geographical topics.

The Association of American Geographers was founded in 1904 and was renamed the [[American Association of Geographers]] in 2016 to better reflect the increasingly international character of its membership.

One of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorize the physical properties of the earth is [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Though Snow was primarily a [[physician]] and a pioneer of [[epidemiology]] rather than a geographer, his map is probably one of the earliest examples of [[health geography]].

The now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography have developed at a later date. This connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of [[environmental determinism]], made popular in the 19th century by [[Carl Ritter]] and others, and has close links to the field of [[evolutionary biology]] of the time. Environmental determinism is the theory, that people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. However, by the mid-19th century, environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigor associated with modern science, and later as a means to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]].

A similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries focused on [[regional geography]].The goal of regional geography, through something known as [[regionalisation]], was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region through both human and physical aspects. With links to (possibilism) (geography) and [[cultural ecology]] some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture remain with environmental determinism.

By the 1960s, however, the [[quantitative revolution]] led to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor in an overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from its two subfields of physical and human geography and from [[geology]], geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical models in order to solve spatial problems.&lt;ref name="HGDICT"/&gt; Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of [[geographic information systems]]; the use of statistics, spatial modeling, and positivist approaches are still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], and [[Torsten Hägerstrand]].

From the 1970s, a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged. Known under the term '[[critical geography]],' these critiques signaled another turning point in the discipline. [[Behavioural geography|Behavioral geography]] emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places, and made locational decisions. The more influential 'radical geography' emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. It draws heavily on [[Marxist geography|Marxist]]'s theory and techniques, and is associated with geographers such as [[David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]]. Radical geographers seek to say meaningful things about problems recognized through quantitative methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Harvey, David| authorlink=David Harvey| title=Social Justice and the City| year=1973 | publisher=Edward Arnold | location=London | pages=128–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide explanations rather than descriptions, put forward alternatives and solutions, and be politically engaged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&amp;site=1 | title=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography: Celebrating Over 40 years of Radical Geography 1969-2009 | author=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography | year=2009 | accessdate=31 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010193949/http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&amp;site=1 | archivedate=10 October 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than using the detachment associated with positivists. (The detachment and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital). Radical geography and the links to Marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography (See: ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]''). Critical geography also saw the introduction of 'humanistic geography', associated with the work of [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], which pushed for a much more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] approach in methodology.

The changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as [[feminist geography]], [[Cultural geography#"New cultural geography"|new cultural geography]], "demonic" geographies&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339&lt;/ref&gt;, and the engagement with [[postmodern]] and [[post-structural]] theories and philosophies.

==Fields==
The primary fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of:

===Culture===
[[Cultural geography]] is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places, as well as their relations. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Agriculture_in_Asia.jpg|thumb|This picture shows terraced rice agriculture in Asia.]]

* Subfields include: [[Social geography]], [[Animal geographies]], [[Language geography]], [[Sexuality and space]], [[Children's geographies]], and [[Religion and geography]].

===Development===
[[Development geography]] is the study of the Earth's geography with reference to the [[standard of living]] and the [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants, study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities, across the Earth. The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.

===Economic===
[[File:Shan Street Bazaar.JPG|thumb|Economic Geography: Shan Street bazaar, market in Myanmar]]
[[Economic geography]] examines relationships between human economic systems, states, and other factors, and the biophysical environment.
* Subfields include: [[Marketing geography]] and [[Transportation geography]]

===Health===

[[Health geography]] is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]]. Health geography deals with the spatial relations and patterns between people and the environment. This is a sub-discipline of human geography, researching how and why diseases are spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dummer|first=Trevor J.B.|date=2008-04-22|title=Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|issue=9|pages=1177–1180|doi=10.1503/cmaj.071783|issn=0820-3946|pmc=2292766|pmid=18427094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
[[Historical geography]] is the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past. Historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics. A common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time. Many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time, including how people have interacted with their environment, and created the cultural landscape.

===Political===
[[Political geography]] is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures.
* Subfields include: [[Electoral geography]], [[Geopolitics]], [[Strategic geography]] and [[Military geography]]

===Population===
[[Population geography]] is the study of ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to their environment or location.

===Settlement===
[[Settlement geography]], including [[urban geography]], is the study of [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement.  That is the study of areas which have a concentration of [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]].  These are areas where the majority of [[economy|economic]] activities are in the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sectors]]. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high [[population density]].
{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Urban ===
[[Urban geography]] is the study of cities, towns, and other areas of relatively dense settlement. Two main interests are site (how a settlement is positioned relative to the physical environment) and situation (how a settlement is positioned relative to other settlements). Another area of interest is the internal organization of urban areas with regard to different demographic groups and the layout of infrastructure. This subdiscipline also draws on ideas from other branches of Human Geography to see their involvement in the processes and patterns evident in an [[urban area]].&lt;ref name="Palm"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|date=2016-09-05|title=Urban geography: city structures|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030913258200600104|journal=Progress in Geography|language=en|doi=10.1177/030913258200600104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Kaplan, Dave H. |author2=Holloway, Steven |author3=Wheeler, James O. |title=Urban Geography, 3rd. Edition | year=2014 | publisher=Wiley | location=Hoboken, NJ  | isbn=978-1-118-57385-3 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subfields include: [[Economic geography]], [[Population geography]], and [[Settlement geography]]. These are clearly not the only subfields that could be used to assist in the study of [[Urban geography]], but they are some major players.&lt;ref name="Palm"/&gt;

==Philosophical and theoretical approaches==
Within each of the subfields, various philosophical approaches can be used in research; therefore, an urban geographer could be a Feminist or Marxist geographer, etc.

Such approaches are:

The '''Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology''' is a biomedical and genomics research institute located in New York, NY. It is housed within the [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]]. Its aim is to generate and integrate many layers of biological, clinical, and environmental data in order to characterize and understand complex human diseases on a network level, and to use that data to advance information-driven medicine and to better diagnose and treat patients at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n8/full/nbt.2331.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==

The institute’s primary goal is to improve patient care by building predictive models to better characterize disease. These models are constructed with multiple layers of biological data, including gene expression, metabolite, DNA, and protein information, and are combined with phenotypic and clinical data, predictive modeling, and probabilistic analysis to try to elucidate the complex mechanisms of disease.&lt;ref name="bio-itworld"&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/BioIT_Article.aspx?id=108466&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is called multiscale biology. To achieve this goal, scientists at the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology have outfitted facilities such as the Genomics Core with new technologies to generate many types of biological information and have placed an emphasis on hiring staff with bioinformatics expertise to analyze big data.&lt;ref name="genomeweb"&gt;http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/qa-mount-sinais-milind-mahajan-running-clia-certified-genomics-core-facility&lt;/ref&gt; Institute founding director [[Eric Schadt]] has said that this approach — along with the institute’s connection to both a hospital and medical school — is expected to lead to improved and more personalized diagnoses, assessments of risk, and treatment plans for patients.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;

== History ==

The institute was formed in 2011. Eric Schadt was named as founding director of the new institute.&lt;ref name="bio-itworld" /&gt;

The Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology is slated to receive more than $100 million in funding in its first several years, allocated from a $1 billion capital campaign run by Mount Sinai School of Medicine.&lt;ref name="bio-itworld" /&gt;

Originally called the Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, it was renamed in 2012 when philanthropist Carl Icahn pledged $200 million to its parent organization, the [[Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-15/carl-icahn-to-give-200-million-to-mount-sinai-school.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology received certification for the first [[CLIA]]-approved next-generation sequencing lab in New York City.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="genomeweb" /&gt;

Institute faculty [[Andrew Kasarskis]], Michael Linderman, George Diaz, Ali Bashir, and Randi Zinberg taught the first class in which Mount Sinai medical students were able to fully sequence and analyze their own genomes.&lt;ref&gt;http://nygenome.org/blog/mount-sinais-genomic-training-doctors-gets-personal&lt;/ref&gt;

Institute member Joel Dudley was named one of the 100 most creative people in business in a 2014 list compiled by Fast Company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcompany.com/3029509/most-creative-people-2014/joel-dudley&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine said it chose Dudley "for splicing information with quality medical care."

In 2014 the institute, in collaboration with Sage Bionetworks, announced a new project aiming to genotype up to 1 million people with the goal of identifying the rare biological mechanisms that keep people healthy when they have genetic variants that should cause disease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6187/970.full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://resilienceproject.me/&lt;/ref&gt; The Resilience Project will scan the genomes of healthy people age 30 and older who contribute their DNA to the effort with an initial focus on 127 diseases. Scientists anticipate that finding protective mechanisms for Mendelian diseases will be more straightforward than finding ones for complex or multifactorial diseases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetic-heroes-may-be-key-to-treating-debilitating-diseases/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/unexpected-heroes-resilience-project-2014-5&lt;/ref&gt; Based on an analysis of publicly available data from 600,000 human genomes, scientists involved in the Resilience Project estimate that one person in 15,000 has a mechanism protecting against disease-causing genetic variants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/searching-for-the-genes-that-prevent-disease/371256/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Research at the institute falls into six broad disease areas:&lt;ref&gt;http://icahn.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/genomics&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alzheimer's disease]]
* [[Cancer]]
* [[Asthma]] and [[allergies]]
* [[Infectious disease]]
* Psychiatric genomics
* [[Human microbiome]]

Scientists from the institute published a paper in Nature Genetics in 2012 demonstrating the ability to derive enough information from non-DNA sources to identify individuals whose supposedly anonymized biological data is stored in large research databases.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2248.html&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that measuring RNA levels in tissue allowed them to infer a genetic barcode that could be used to match other materials to that same individual. This was noteworthy as validation of existing concerns among genomics scientists that it may not be possible to prevent the identification of an individual from genetic data even when that data is meant to be anonymous.

In a PLoS Biology paper, institute founding director Eric Schadt led a research team that utilized six different types of data (metabolite concentration, gene expression, DNA variation, DNA-protein binding, protein-metabolite interaction, and protein-protein interaction) to reconstruct networks involved in cell regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001301&lt;/ref&gt;

Data scientist Jeffrey Hammerbacher from [[Cloudera]] joined the institute in 2012 as an assistant professor. In an interview with [[Charlie Rose]] he said that his goal is to establish scalable infrastructure for data storage and analysis and to use that foundation to integrate genomic data with existing health records and improve the quality of health care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12840&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, institute scientists published a paper in the journal Cell reporting findings from a network-based study of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The researchers constructed gene regulatory networks and discovered a neural structure involved in a pathway associated with onset of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(13)00387-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute has established a research program to use predictive network modeling for personalized cancer therapy. Scientists in the program combine DNA, RNA, copy number variation, and other data from individual patients, and test some of the detected mutations in fly models. The goal is to find the driver mutations of each patient’s data and recommend specific treatments based on that information. By March 2013, the program had worked on seven cases with more planned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nygenome.org/blog/mount-sinai-cancer-tumor-study-seeks-nail-moving-targets&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cases, that of Stephanie Lee, was publicized in an article in Esquire reporting on how the scientists implanted tumor cells into a fly and then found an existing medication that knocked out the tumor in the models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esquire.com/features/patient-zero-1213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/war-widow-finds-purpose-following-stage-4-cancer-diagnosis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the institute will work with Mount Sinai’s rare disorder clinic to study how single-gene diseases interact with other biomolecular processes by measuring and analyzing molecular, cellular, and tissue networks along with environmental response information.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;

In January 2014, scientists from the institute’s Division of Psychiatric Genomics including [[Pamela Sklar]] published two papers in the journal Nature that explored the genetic complexity of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7487/full/nature12929.html De novo mutations in schizophrenia implicate synaptic networks | Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7487/full/nature12975.html A polygenic burden of rare disruptive mutations in schizophrenia | Nature]&lt;/ref&gt; The exome sequencing studies of populations in Bulgaria and Sweden revealed that the disorder is likely caused by a lot of rare genetic mutations rather than a few common mutations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/2014/1/22/maddening-genetics-schizophrenia.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/schizophrenia-could-be-caused-by-a-wide-variety-of-dna-mutations-rather-than-one-gene-9078284.html&lt;/ref&gt; The projects also established the world’s largest database on schizophrenia.

The '''Instituto de Astronomía Teórica y Experimental''' (IATE) is a scientific institute funded by the [[Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas|Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones en Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET)]] and the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC)]], located in the city of Córdoba, Argentina, and dedicated to the study of different topics in astronomy. The headquarters of the institute are located at the [[:es:Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba]].

== History ==
In the 1960s, [[:es:José Luis Sérsic|Dr. José Luis Sérsic]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/b1038-l-Jose%20Luis-Sersic&lt;/ref&gt; (argentinian scientist mainly known for his empirical law for the intensity of a galaxy called [[Sersic profile|Sersic's Law]])  created the extragalactic astronomy department at the [[:es:Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba]], where he developed his academic and research activities, forming his first disciples. In 1983, the department became the "Programa de Investigaciones en Astronomía Teórica y Experimental" (IATE), funded by [[CONICET]], under Dr. Sérsic direction. Following the death of Dr. Sérsic on July 19, 1993, the program was discontinued. However, those graduates and PhD who were trained under his tutelage were ordered to continue with the group IATE as research group within the Observatorio Astronómico, under the leadership of Dr. Diego Garcia Lambas, one of the main disciples of Dr. Sérsic. After more than 10 years of hard work forming graduates, PhD and researchers, and to become one of the most numerous research groups within the Observatorio Astronómico, the IATE group has become one of the institutes of [[CONICET]] in 2006, with Dr. Diego Garcia Lambas being its first director. The institute then took the name of Instituto de Astronomía Teórica y Experimental, retaining the acronym IATE.

== Scientific Areas ==
The lines of research are:

* Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy
* Large Scale Structure of the Universe
* Planetary Systems
* Astrophysical Plasmas
* Instrumental Astronomy and Site Testing

=== Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy ===
[[File:Seyfert Sextet cut out.jpg|170x170px|thumbnail|right|The Seyfert's Sextet]]
The 13.8 billion years of the Universe is enough time to form giant objects, being the galaxies one of the most interesting. Galaxies are truly island universes where dark matter, billions of stars and huge amounts of gas and dust coexist in equilibrium, and yet, they are an environment suitable for the formation of new stars. Galaxies also tend to cluster in a network of cosmic proportions which highlights fabulous large structures formed by thousands of galaxies.
At the IATE, the study of galaxies has been a constant challenge, which has allowed to consolidate over the years different methods for the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies. Some of the most important are:
* Numerical Simulations: the physical processes that govern the evolutionary history of one or many galaxies are recreated by using supercomputers:
* Statistical Studies: properties of galaxies are inferred and analysed from large data surveys;
* Astronomical Observations: classic observations and the most modern and sophisticated techniques are combined by using the telescope facilities around the world.

These and other tools are used by different scientists at the IATE to perform original and reliable astronomical research.

=== Large Scale Structure of the Universe ===
[[File:Large-scale structure formation.gif|thumbnail|right|Numerical simulation of a CDM universe with dark energy (Andrey Kravtsov and Anatoly Klypin)]]
The large-scale structure of the Universe is the field of cosmology that studies the distribution of the matter in the Universe on the largest scales. This field has grown remarkably since the '80s, with the development of three-dimensional maps of galaxies in several bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, and with the observation of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)]].
The increasing flow of information generated by observations has allowed to obtain reliable characterization of the content of the universe comprising
* 74% of [[Dark energy|vacuum or dark energy]],
* 26% [[dark matter]] and
* 4% [[Baryonic matter|ordinary baryonic matter]],
as well as its distribution.
The distribution of the structures seems to follow a hierarchical model where the upper level is dominated by a network of clusters and filaments. On top of that, the universe appears to be isotropic and homogeneous in accordance with the [[cosmological principle]].
From the analysis of catalogs and the development of numerical simulations, the distribution is characterized through the implementation of different statistics that allow the study of the spatial distribution as well as the dynamics by means of the velocity field of the matter distribution.

=== Planetary Systems ===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|280x150px|thumbnail|left|Artist's concept of a protoplanetary disk.]]
The question of the existence of other worlds has been present in the history of mankind for centuries, but only recent scientific evidence has confirmed that planets could exist and are common outside the Solar System. Since the first discovery in 1992, over 850 new exoplanets have been cataloged.
Contrary to the Solar System, exoplanets' population presents several examples of exoplanets at very small distances from its stars, highly eccentric planetary orbits, and they are frequently found in configurations not previously imagined. This led to the development of new theories and areas of research, which ultimately can help us to better understand the Solar System.
Some of the projects that are currently being developed at the IATE include:
* Analyses of observational data for exoplanets (radial velocity and transit);
* Models of tidal interaction with the central star to study the origin of the population of "hot" exoplanets
* Study of the dynamics of extrasolar planets in mean motions resonances;
* Development of hydrodynamic codes to describe the interaction between planets and the protoplanetary disk;
* Analyses of the formation of planets in binary stellar systems.

=== Astrophysical Plasmas ===
[[File:EruptiveProminence.gif|170x170px|thumbnail|right|An eruptive prominence on the surface of the sun.]]
The plasma is the most common state of the baryonic matter in the Universe (99%). Most of a star, the interplanetary and interstellar medium, and the ionosphere, are plasmas. The plasma can also be generated in terrestrial laboratories for industrial applications such as producing surface coatings, precision cuts in lamps, micro-motors, and plasma reactors.
A plasma is a fluid consisting of a large number of free charged particles (globally neutral and whose kinetic energy is larger than the electrostatic potential energy between them). The charges and currents that conform a plasma are sources of the electromagnetic fields and, in turn, these fields affect the distribution of charges and currents which makes its dynamics highly nonlinear and very different from that of a neutral gas. When the magnetic fields are capable of modifying an individual particle trajectory, it is said that the plasma is magnetized. The corona is highly magnetized and therefore, several structures are observed, some of which can maintain its stability for relatively long times as dark filaments on the surface of the sun.
In the group of astrophysical plasmas, our scientist perform studies about the dynamic configuration and structures of the corona through the analysis of magnetic arcs and prominences, the formation of voids that remain in the plasma due to the interaction of nonlinear waves, the formation of very energetic shock wave capable of sweeping the chromosphere along a whole quadrant, etc. The team also analyse the interaction of stellar winds with the magnetosphere of exoplanets, and they model the morphology of supernova remnants affected by instabilities and the influence of the magnetic field.

=== Site Testing ===
The IATE also performs site testing for the installation of large astronomical facilities in the Argentinian territory.
During the 90's (1989-1998), the IATE began the first work on astronomical site testing performing seeing measurements in the Antarctic Base Belgrano II. In 1998, measurements of seeing were performed in the Llano de Chajnantor, Atacama (Chile), as part of a project aimed at installing a liquid mercury telescope in Toco volcano. This project was not successful but the group learnt the use of the most modern technologies for measuring sky parameters. Through this experience, the IATE made contact with Dr. Marc Sarazin, of the [[European Southern Observatory|European Southern Observatory (ESO)]], with whom, since the year 2000, the IATE began the searching and characterization of candidate sites to install the [[European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu.ar/seccion/novedades/2008/mayo/cientificos-de-la-unc-estudian-la-puna-saltena&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archivo.lavoz.com.ar/08/05/09/secciones/sociedad/nota.asp?nota_id=188054&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSJeKmqsmYs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlmHTEC8CGQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeJ9m6vPRc4&lt;/ref&gt; which will be finally installed in Chile, at the Cerro Armazones. During that work, a suitable candidate site was preselected at the Cordón Macón, close to Tolar Grande town. Because of its excellent conditions, the IATE decided to install observational facilities at this site,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoylauniversidad.unc.edu.ar/2012/junio/argentina-tendra-su-cuarto-observatorio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomiadecordoba.blogspot.com.ar/2010/08/el-instituto-de-astronomia-teorica-y.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is the most important project to date for the instrumentation team.
The project also involves the development of a program committed to the educational public outreach in astronomy at the town of Tolar Grande, named Ñawi Puna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secyt.unc.edu.ar/unc/boletin_contenido.php?idNota=271&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cordon Macon iate.jpg|955x370px|thumb|center| View from the Macón peak at the Cordón Macón, Salta, Argentina.]]

==== The New Astronomical Complex ====
[[File:Observatory at the Cordon Macon.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first observatory building at the Macón peak (May, 2012).]]
The IATE is building an astronomical complex on the Cordón Macón, located at 10&amp;nbsp;km from the town of [[Tolar Grande]], [[Salta]], Argentina. The site is located at latitude 24.61 South and longitude 67.32 West and at an altitude of 4,650 meters. The location has ideal conditions of humidity and air turbulence, which create almost perfect astronomical seeing. The site infrastructure will enable the development of several observational projects:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ABRAS Logo.jpg|170x170px|thumbnail|right|Logo of the ABRAS project.]] --&gt;

* The '''ABRAS''' project: The Argentina-Brasil Astronomical Center is a project involving both Latin-American countries. The main institutions behind the project are the IATE, from Argentina, and the [http://www.iag.usp.br/ IAG (Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciencias Atmosféricas)], from Sao Paulo, Brasil, while the funding institutions are the [http://www.mincyt.gov.ar/ Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva] and the [[University of Sao Paulo]] ([http://www5.usp.br/ Universidade de Sao Paulo, USP]). The project involves the installation of an astronomical observational facility in the Cordón Macón. The 1 meter telescope will be installed in an 8-meter diameter dome. The building and the installation of the dome was performed during 2011-2012, while the 1 meter telescope arrived to Córdoba (Argentina) during October 2015. One of the main goals of the project is to optimize the telescope for performing astronomical observations in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The first observations with this telescope is expected to be perform for the year 2016.
* The '''TOROS''' project: The Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South (TOROS) project is a collaboration among scientists from [[The University of Texas]] at Brownsville, the [[Universidad Nacional de Cordoba|Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (UNC)]], [[CALTECH]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. The project intend to construct a dedicated optical follow-up instrument for Advanced [[LIGO]] (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo ([[Virgo interferometer|AdVirgo]]) in order to surveying the sky for even very dim afterglows of gravitational waves events. The project also pursuit the aim of detecting nearby supernovas. The [http://toros.phys.utb.edu/TOROS/First_TOROS_Workshop.html first workshop] of the TOROS collaboration was held in the city of Salta, Argentina, in June, 2013.
* The '''ISON''' project: The International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) program is an international effort that intend to understand and catalogue the space debris population in the near-Earth space and of potentially hazardous [[Near-Earth object|Near Earth Objects (NEOs)]]. In order to contribute to this program, the [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics|Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics (KIAM)]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS), of the [[Russian Federation]], will work together with the [[Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE)]], the IATE, the [[Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba (OAC)]] and the Goberment of the [[:es:Provincia de Salta|Provincia de Salta]] in Argentina, to install and operate two small telescopes of 20 and 25&amp;nbsp;cm of diameter, that will be operated remotely via Internet connection. The aim of this cooperation is to perform observations of orbital debris, asteroids, comets and optical counterparts of gamma-ray bursts.

== FoF meetings ==
Yearly, the IATE organizes the astronomical meeting named "Friends-of-Friends", usually carried out during the first fortnight of April. The meeting is aimed at stretching the bounds between the astronomers that work at the IATE and their external collaborators, as well as sharing the state-of-the-art of works that are being developed by the IATE members.
The talks are split into two different modes: invited speakers present talks of 45+15 minutes, while there are several short talks of 15+5 minutes long.

The '''Italian Renaissance''' ({{lang-it|Rinascimento}} {{IPA-it|rinaʃʃiˈmento|}}) was a period of [[European history]] that began in [[Italy]] in the 14th century ([[Trecento]]) and lasted until the 17th century ([[Seicento]]), marking the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to [[Modernity]]. The French word ''renaissance'' (''Rinascimento'' in Italian) means "Rebirth" and defines the period as one of cultural revival and renewed interest in [[classical antiquity]] after the centuries labeled the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] by [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]]. The Renaissance author [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "Rebirth" in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' but the concept became widespread only in the 19th century, after the works of scholars such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]].

The European Renaissance began in [[Tuscany]] ([[Central Italy]]), and was centred in the city of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Florence, one of the several [[city-states]] of the peninsula, rose to economic prominence by providing credit for European monarchs and laying down the groundwork for [[capitalism]] and [[banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sée|first=Henri|title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|work=University of Rennes|publisher=Batoche Books|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010542/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Renaissance later spread to [[Venice]], heart of a [[Venetian Empire|mediterranean empire]] and in control of the trade routes with the east since the participation in the [[crusades]] and the voyages of [[Marco Polo]], where the remains of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek culture]] were brought together and provided [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars with new texts. Finally the Renaissance had a significant effect on the [[Papal States]] and [[Rome]], largely rebuilt by Humanist and [[Renaissance pope]]s (such as [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]), who were frequently involved in [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Italian politics]], in [[Treaty of Tordesillas|arbitrating disputes]] between competing colonial powers and in [[Counter-Reformation|opposing]] the [[Reformation]].

The Italian Renaissance is best known for its achievements in [[Italian Renaissance painting|painting]], [[Italian Renaissance architecture|architecture]], [[Italian Renaissance sculpture|sculpture]], [[Italian Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]] and [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]]. Italy became the recognized European leader in all these areas by the late 15th century, during the [[Peace of Lodi]] (1454-1494) agreed between Italian states. The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as domestic disputes and foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]] (1494-1559). However, the ideas and ideals of the Italian Renaissance endured and spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the [[Northern Renaissance]]. Italian explorers from the [[maritime republics]] served under the auspices of European monarchs, ushering the Age of discovery. The most famous among them are [[Christopher Columbus]] who served for Spain, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] for France, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] for Portugal, and [[John Cabot]] for England. Italian universities attracted [[polymaths]] and scholars such as [[Copernicus]], [[Vesalius]], [[Galileo]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], playing a key role in the [[scientific revolution]]. Various events and dates of the 17th century, such as the conclusion of the [[European Wars of Religion]] in 1648, have been proposed for the end of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=SvYACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;dq=peace+of+westphalia+marks+the+end+of+the+Renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA3ICuifLVAhXKCsAKHRbbBCgQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=peace%20of%20westphalia%20marks%20the%20end%20of%20the%20Renaissance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of [[Renaissance literature]] usually begin with the three great poets of the 14th century: [[Dante Alighieri]] (''[[Divine Comedy]]''), [[Petrarch]] (''[[Canzoniere]]'') and [[Boccaccio]] (''[[Decameron]]''). Famous vernacular poets of the Renaissance include the renaissance epic authors [[Luigi Pulci]] (author of ''[[Morgante]]''), [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] (''[[Orlando Innamorato]]''), [[Ludovico Ariosto]] (''[[Orlando Furioso]]'') and [[Torquato Tasso]] (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''). 15th-century writers such as the poet [[Poliziano]] and the Platonist philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] made extensive translations from both Latin and Greek. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]] laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady in ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', while [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on "''la verità effettuale della cosa''"—the actual truth of things—in ''[[The Prince]]'', composed, in humanistic style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. Historians of the period include Machiavelli himself, his friend and critic [[Francesco Guicciardini]] and [[Giovanni Botero]] (''[[The Reason of State]]''). The Aldine Press, founded by the printer [[Aldo Manuzio]], active in Venice, developed [[Italic type]] and portable printed books that could be carried in one's pocket, as well as being the first to publish editions of books in Ancient Greek. Venice also became the birthplace of the [[Commedia dell'Arte]].

[[Italian Renaissance art]] exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Donatello]], [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Titian]]. The same is true for [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]], as practiced by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Bramante]]. Their works include, to name only a few, the [[Florence Cathedral]], [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, and the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in Rimini, as well as [[Renaissance architecture|several private residences]]. The musical era of the Italian Renaissance was defined by the [[Roman School]] and later by the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] and the birth of [[Opera]] in Florence. In [[Modern philosophy#Modern Western philosophy|philosophy]], thinkers such as Galileo, Machiavelli, [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], emphasized [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[humanism]], thus rejecting dogma and [[scholasticism]].

==Origins and background==
===Northern and Central Italy in the Late Middle Ages===
By the [[Late Middle Ages]] (circa 1300 onward), [[Latium]], the former heartland of the [[Roman Empire]], and [[southern Italy]] were generally poorer than the North. [[Rome]] was a city of ancient ruins, and the [[Papal States]] were loosely administered, and vulnerable to external interference such as that of France, and later Spain. The Papacy was affronted when the [[Avignon Papacy]] was created in southern France as a consequence of pressure from [[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair]] of France. In the south, [[Sicily]] had for some time been under foreign domination, [[History of Islam in southern Italy|by the Arabs]] and [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|then the Normans]]. Sicily had prospered for 150 years during the [[Emirate of Sicily]] and later for two centuries during the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kingdom]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Hohenstaufen Kingdom]], but had declined by the late Middle Ages.

In contrast, Northern and Central Italy had become far more prosperous, and it has been calculated that the region was among the richest of [[Europe]]. The [[Crusades]] had built lasting trade links to the [[Levant]], and the [[Fourth Crusade]] had done much to destroy the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Roman Empire]] as a commercial rival to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. The main trade routes from the east passed through the Byzantine Empire or the [[Arab World|Arab lands]] and onward to the ports of [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], and [[Venice]]. Luxury goods bought in the Levant, such as spices, dyes, and silks were imported to Italy and then resold throughout Europe. Moreover, the inland [[city-state]]s profited from the rich agricultural land of the [[Po River|Po]] valley. From France, Germany, and the Low Countries, through the medium of the [[Champagne fairs]], land and river trade routes brought goods such as [[wool]], [[wheat]], and [[precious metal]]s into the region. The extensive trade that stretched from [[Egypt]] to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] generated substantial surpluses that allowed significant investment in mining and agriculture. Thus, while northern Italy was not richer in resources than many other parts of Europe, the level of development, stimulated by trade, allowed it to prosper. In particular, Florence became one of the wealthiest of the cities of Northern Italy,  mainly due to its woolen textile production, developed under the supervision of its dominant trade [[guild]], the ''[[Arte della Lana]]''. Wool was imported from Northern Europe (and in the 16th century from Spain)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and together with [[dye]]s from the east were used to make high quality textiles.

The Italian trade routes that covered the Mediterranean and beyond were also major conduits of culture and knowledge. The
[[Transmission of the Classics|recovery of lost Greek classics]] (and, to a lesser extent, Arab advancements on them) following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Siege of Constantinople|conquest of the Byzantine heartlands]], revitalized [[medieval philosophy]] in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], just as the [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|refugee Byzantine scholars]] who migrated to Italy during and following the Turkish conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] between the 12th and 15th centuries were important in sparking the new linguistic studies of the Renaissance, in newly created [[Academy|academies]] in Florence and Venice. Humanist scholars searched monastic libraries for ancient manuscripts and recovered [[Tacitus]] and other Latin authors. The rediscovery of [[Vitruvius]] meant that the architectural principles of Antiquity could be observed once more, and Renaissance artists were encouraged, in the atmosphere of humanist optimism, to excel the achievements of the Ancients, like [[Apelles]], of whom they read.

===Thirteenth-century===
In the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. The trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the [[Hanseatic League]] of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The  [[Italian city-states|city-states of Italy]] expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; apart from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], outside powers kept their armies out of Italy. During this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with [[double-entry book-keeping]], [[joint stock companies]], an international [[banking]] system, a systematized [[foreign exchange market]], [[insurance]], and [[government debt]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Florence became the centre of this financial industry and the gold [[Italian coin florin|florin]] became the main currency of international trade.

The new mercantile governing class, who gained their position through financial skill, adapted to their purposes the [[feudal]] aristocratic model that had dominated Europe in the Middle Ages. A feature of the High Middle Ages in Northern Italy was the rise of the [[Medieval commune|urban communes]] which had broken from the control by bishops and local counts. In much of the region, the [[landed nobility]] was poorer than the urban patriarchs in the High Medieval money economy whose inflationary rise left land-holding aristocrats impoverished. The increase in trade during the early Renaissance enhanced these characteristics. The decline of feudalism and the rise of cities influenced each other; for example, the demand for luxury goods led to an increase in trade, which led to greater numbers of tradesmen becoming wealthy, who, in turn, demanded more luxury goods. This atmosphere of assumed luxury of the time created a need for the creation of visual symbols of wealth, an important way to show a family’s affluence and taste.

This change also gave the merchants almost complete control of the governments of the Italian city-states, again enhancing trade. One of the most important effects of this political control was security. Those that grew extremely wealthy in a feudal state ran constant risk of running afoul of the monarchy and having their lands confiscated, as famously occurred to [[Jacques Coeur]] in France. The northern states also kept many medieval laws that severely hampered commerce, such as those against [[usury]], and prohibitions on trading with non-Christians. In the city-states of Italy, these laws were repealed or rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourteenth-century collapse===
The 14th century saw a series of catastrophes that caused the European economy to go into recession. The [[Medieval Warm Period]] was ending as the transition to the [[Little Ice Age]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 97; see also Andrew B. Appleby's "Epidemics and Famine in the Little Ice Age." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History.'' Vol. 10 No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in climate saw agricultural output decline significantly, leading to repeated [[famine]]s, exacerbated by the rapid population growth of the earlier era. The [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France disrupted trade throughout northwest Europe, most notably when, in 1345, King [[Edward III of England]] repudiated his debts, contributing to the collapse of the two largest Florentine banks, those of the [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]]. In the east, war was also disrupting trade routes, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] began to expand throughout the region. Most devastating, though, was the [[Black Death]] that decimated the populations of the densely populated cities of Northern Italy and returned at intervals thereafter. Florence, for instance, which had a pre-plague population of 45,000 decreased over the next 47 years by 25–50%.&lt;ref&gt;Olea, Ricardo A, Christakos, George, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 "Duration of Urban Mortality for the 14th-Century Black Death Epidemic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206150835/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''Human Biology'',  Jun 2005. The population level of Florence is controversial see also Ziegler (1969, pp. 51-52), Chandler 1987, pp. 16-18, and Gottfried 1983, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread disorder followed, including a revolt of Florentine textile workers, the ''[[ciompi]]'', in 1378.

It was during this period of instability that the Renaissance authors such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Petrarch]] lived, and the first stirrings of Renaissance art were to be seen, notably in the realism of [[Giotto]]. Paradoxically, some of these disasters would help establish the Renaissance. The [[Black Death]] wiped out a third of Europe's population. The resulting labour shortage increased wages and the reduced population was therefore much wealthier, better fed, and, significantly, had more surplus money to spend on luxury goods.  As incidences of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] began to decline in the early 15th century, Europe's devastated population once again began to grow.  The new demand for products and services also helped create a growing class of [[bankers]], merchants, and skilled [[artisan]]s.  The horrors of the Black Death and the seeming inability of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] to provide relief would contribute to a decline of church influence. Additionally, the collapse of the [[Compagnia dei Bardi|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi Bank|Peruzzi]] banks would open the way for the [[Medici]] to rise to prominence in Florence. [[Roberto Sabatino Lopez]] argues that the economic collapse was a crucial cause of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Robert Sabatino. "Hard Times and Investment in Culture."&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, in a more prosperous era, businessmen would have quickly reinvested their earnings in order to make more money in a climate favourable to investment. However, in the leaner years of the 14th century, the wealthy found few promising investment opportunities for their earnings and instead chose to spend more on culture and art.

Another popular explanation for the Italian Renaissance is the thesis, first advanced by historian [[Hans Baron]],&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Hans. "The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance". Princeton University Press, March 1, 1966. {{ISBN|0-691-00752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that states that the primary impetus of the early Renaissance was the long-running series of [[Italian Wars|wars]] between Florence and Milan. By the late 14th century, Milan had become a centralized monarchy under the control of the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]] family. [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]], who ruled the city from 1378 to 1402, was renowned both for his cruelty and for his abilities, and set about building an empire in Northern Italy. He launched a long series of wars, with Milan steadily conquering neighbouring states and defeating the various coalitions led by Florence that sought in vain to halt the advance. This culminated in the 1402 siege of Florence, when it looked as though the city was doomed to fall, before Giangaleazzo suddenly died and his empire collapsed.

Baron's thesis suggests that during these long wars, the leading figures of Florence rallied the people by presenting the war as one between the free republic and a despotic monarchy, between the ideals of the Greek and Roman Republics and those of the Roman Empire and Medieval kingdoms. For Baron, the most important figure in crafting this ideology was [[Leonardo Bruni]]. This time of crisis in Florence was the period when the most influential figures of the early Renaissance were coming of age, such as [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], [[Donatello]], [[Masolino]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Inculcated with this republican ideology they later went on to advocate republican ideas that were to have an enormous impact on the Renaissance.

{{Main|Italian Wars}}
[[File:Piero, ritratto di sigismondo malatesta.jpg|thumb|[[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] (1417–1468), lord of [[Rimini]], by [[Piero della Francesca]]. Malatesta was a capable ''[[condottiere]]'', following the tradition of his family. He was hired by the [[Venice|Venetians]] to fight against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] (unsuccessfully) in 1465, and was patron of [[Leone Battista Alberti]], whose ''[[Tempio Malatestiano]]'' at Rimini is one of the first entirely classical buildings of the Renaissance.]]
Northern Italy and upper Central Italy were divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the most powerful being [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]], [[Genoa]], [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]], [[Verona]] and [[Venice]].  High Medieval Northern Italy was further divided by the long-running battle for supremacy between the forces of the Papacy and of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: each city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, [[Guelf]]s and [[Ghibelline]]s.  Warfare between the states was common, invasion from outside Italy confined to intermittent sorties of [[Holy Roman Emperors]]. Renaissance politics developed from this background. Since the 13th century, as armies became primarily composed of [[mercenaries]], prosperous city-states could field considerable forces, despite their low populations. In the course of the 15th century, the most powerful city-states annexed their smaller neighbors. Florence took [[Pisa]] in 1406, Venice captured [[Padua]] and [[Verona]], while the [[Duchy of Milan]] annexed a number of nearby areas including [[Pavia]] and [[Parma]].

The first part of the Renaissance saw almost constant warfare on land and sea as the city-states vied for preeminence.  On land, these wars were primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, but especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.  The mercenaries were not willing to risk their lives unduly, and war became one largely of sieges and maneuvering, occasioning few pitched battles. It was also in the interest of mercenaries on both sides to prolong any conflict, to continue their employment.  Mercenaries were also a constant threat to their employers; if not paid, they often turned on their patron.  If it became obvious that a state was entirely dependent on mercenaries, the temptation was great for the mercenaries to take over the running of it themselves—this occurred on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

At sea, Italian city-states sent many fleets out to do battle. The main contenders were Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, but after a long conflict the Genoese succeeded in reducing Pisa.  Venice proved to be a more powerful adversary, and with the decline of Genoese power during the 15th century Venice became pre-eminent on the seas. In response to threats from the landward side, from the early 15th century Venice developed an increased interest in controlling the ''terrafirma'' as the Venetian Renaissance opened.

On land, decades of fighting saw Florence, Milan and Venice emerge as the dominant players, and these three powers finally set aside their differences and agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries.  This peace would hold for the next forty years, and Venice's unquestioned hegemony over the sea also led to unprecedented peace for much of the rest of the 15th century. In the beginning of the 15th century, adventurer and traders such as [[Niccolò Da Conti]] (1395–1469) traveled as far as [[Southeast Asia]] and back, bringing fresh knowledge on the state of the world, presaging further European voyages of exploration in the years to come.

===Florence under the Medici===
{{Main|House of Medici}}
Until the late 14th century, prior to the Medici, Florence's leading family were the [[House of Albizzi]]. In 1293 the Ordinances of Justice were enacted which effectively became the constitution of the republic of Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bartlett, ''The Italian Renaissance'', Chapter 7, p.37, Volume II, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's numerous luxurious [[Palace#Italy|palazzi]] were becoming surrounded by [[townhouses]], built by the ever prospering merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutflorence.com/history-of-Florence.html |title=History of Florence |publisher=Aboutflorence.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1298, one of the leading banking families of Europe, the Bonsignoris, were bankrupted and so the city of Siena lost her status as the banking center of Europe to Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challengers of the Albizzi family were the [[Medici]]s, first under [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], later under his son [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo di Giovanni de' Medici]]. The Medici controlled the [[Medici bank]]—then Europe's largest bank—and an array of other enterprises in Florence and elsewhere. In 1433, the Albizzi managed to have Cosimo exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, Roger J. ''Severing the Neck of Pride: Donatello's "Judith and Holofernes" and the Recollection of Albizzi Shame in Medicean Florence ''. Artibus et Historiae, Volume 22, Edit 44, 2001. pp. 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, however, saw a pro-Medici [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] elected and Cosimo returned. The Medici became the town's leading family, a position they would hold for the next three centuries. Florence remained a republic until 1537, traditionally marking the end of the High Renaissance in Florence, but the instruments of republican government were firmly under the control of the Medici and their allies, save during the intervals after 1494 and 1527. Cosimo and Lorenzo rarely held official posts, but were the unquestioned leaders.

Cosimo de' Medici was highly popular among the citizenry, mainly for bringing an era of stability and prosperity to the town. One of his most important accomplishments was negotiating the [[Peace of Lodi]] with [[Francesco Sforza]] ending the decades of war with Milan and bringing stability to much of Northern Italy. Cosimo was also an important patron of the arts, directly and indirectly, by the influential example he set.

Cosimo was succeeded by his sickly son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]], who died after five years in charge of the city. In 1469 the reins of power passed to Cosimo's twenty-one-year-old grandson [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]], who would become known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent." Lorenzo was the first of the family to be educated from an early age in the humanist tradition and is best known as one of the Renaissance's most important patrons of the arts. Under Lorenzo, the Medici rule was formalized with the creation of a new [[Council of Seventy]], which Lorenzo headed. The republican institutions continued, but they lost all power. Lorenzo was less successful than his illustrious forebears in business, and the Medici commercial empire was slowly eroded. Lorenzo continued the alliance with Milan, but relations with the papacy soured, and in 1478, Papal agents allied with the [[Pazzi]] family in an attempt to assassinate Lorenzo. Although the plot failed, Lorenzo's young brother, [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]], was killed, and the failed assassination led to a war with the Papacy and was used as justification to further centralize power in Lorenzo's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread===
Renaissance ideals first spread from Florence to the neighbouring states of [[Tuscany]] such as [[Siena]] and [[Lucca]]. The Tuscan culture soon became the model for all the states of Northern Italy, and the Tuscan variety of Italian came to predominate throughout the region, especially in literature. In 1447 [[Francesco Sforza]] came to power in [[Milan]] and rapidly transformed that still medieval city into a major centre of art and learning that drew [[Leone Battista Alberti]]. [[Venice]], one of the wealthiest cities due to its control of the Adriatic Sea, also became a centre for Renaissance culture, especially architecture. Smaller courts brought Renaissance patronage to lesser cities, which developed their characteristic arts: [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]] under the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], and [[Urbino]] under [[Federico da Montefeltro]]. In [[Naples]], the Renaissance was ushered in under the patronage of [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] who conquered Naples in 1443 and encouraged artists like [[Francesco Laurana]] and [[Antonello da Messina]] and writers like the poet [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] and the humanist scholar [[Angelo Poliziano]].

In 1417 the Papacy returned to Rome, but that once imperial city remained poor and largely in ruins through the first years of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="rome"&gt;Burke 1999, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The great transformation began under [[Pope Nicholas V]], who became pontiff in 1447.  He launched a dramatic rebuilding effort that would eventually see much of the city renewed.  The humanist scholar Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini became [[Pope Pius II]] in 1458. As the papacy fell under the control of the wealthy families, such as the [[Medici]] and the [[Borgia]]s&lt;!--Valencia!--&gt; the spirit of Renaissance art and philosophy came to dominate the Vatican.  [[Pope Sixtus IV]] continued Nicholas' work, most famously ordering the construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]].  The popes also became increasingly secular rulers as the [[Papal States]] were forged into a centralized power by a series of "warrior popes".

The nature of the Renaissance also changed in the late 15th century.  The Renaissance ideal was fully adopted by the ruling classes and the aristocracy.  In the early Renaissance artists were seen as craftsmen with little prestige or recognition.  By the later Renaissance the top figures wielded great influence and could charge great fees.  A flourishing trade in Renaissance art developed.  While in the early Renaissance many of the leading artists were of lower- or middle-class origins, increasingly they became aristocrats.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

===Wider population===
As a cultural movement, the Italian Renaissance affected only a small part of the population. Italy was the most urbanized region of Europe, but three quarters of the people were still rural peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; For this section of the population, life remained essentially unchanged from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic [[feudalism]] had never been prominent in Northern Italy, and most peasants worked on private farms or as [[sharecropper]]s.  Some scholars see a trend towards [[refeudalization]] in the later Renaissance as the urban elites turned themselves into landed aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation differed in the  cities. These were dominated by a commercial elite; as exclusive as the aristocracy of any Medieval kingdom.  This group became the main patrons of and audience for Renaissance culture.  Below them there was a large class of artisans and guild members who lived comfortable lives and had significant power in the republican governments.  This was in sharp contrast to the rest of Europe where artisans were firmly in the lower class.  Literate and educated, this group did participate in the Renaissance culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest section of the urban population was the urban poor of semi-skilled workers and the unemployed.  Like the peasants, the Renaissance had little effect on them. Historians debate how easy it was to move between these groups during the Italian Renaissance. Examples of individuals who rose from humble beginnings can be instanced, but Burke notes two major studies in this area that have found that the data do not clearly demonstrate an increase in [[social mobility]]. Most historians feel that early in the Renaissance social mobility was quite high, but that it faded over the course of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality in society was very high.  An upper-class figure would control hundreds of times more income than a servant or labourer.  Some historians see this unequal distribution of wealth as important to the Renaissance, as art patronage relies on the very wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pullan |first1=Brian S. |title=History of early Renaissance Italy:From the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fifteenth century |year=1973 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |isbn=0-7139-0304-X |oclc=613989155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance was not a period of great social or economic change, only of cultural and ideological development.  It only touched a small fraction of the population, and in modern times this has led many historians, such as any that follow [[historical materialism]], to reduce the importance of the Renaissance in human history.

&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "The Renaissance is a difficult concept for historians because the history of Europe quite suddenly turns into a history of Italian painting, sculpture and architecture."

The end of the Renaissance is as imprecisely marked as its starting point.  For many, the rise to power in Florence of the austere monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in 1494-1498 marks the end of the city's flourishing; for others, the triumphant return of the Medici family to power in 1512 marks the beginning of the late phase in the Renaissance arts called [[Mannerism]].  Other accounts trace the end of the Italian Renaissance to the French invasions of the early 16th century and the subsequent conflict between France and Spanish rulers for control of Italian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Roger, Civilization: A New History of the Western World Pegasus, NY, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Savonarola rode to power on a widespread backlash over the secularism and indulgence of the Renaissance –&lt;ref&gt;Cast, David. "Review: Fra Girolamo Savonarola: Florentine Art and Renaissance Historiography by Ronald M. Steinberg". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 61, No. 1, March 1979. pp. 134-136.&lt;/ref&gt; his brief rule saw many works of art destroyed in the "[[Bonfire of the Vanities]]" in the centre of Florence.  With the Medici returned to power, now as [[Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], the counter movement in the church continued.  In 1542 the [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] was formed and a few years later the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' banned a wide array of Renaissance works of literature, which marks the end of the [[illuminated manuscript]] together with [[Giulio Clovio]], who is considered the greatest illuminator of the Italian High Renaissance, and arguably the last very notable artist in the long tradition of the illuminated manuscript, before some modern revivals.

Equally important was the end of stability with a series of foreign invasions of Italy known as the [[Italian Wars]] that would continue for several decades.  These began with the 1494 invasion by France that wreaked widespread devastation on Northern Italy and ended the independence of many of the city-states.  Most damaging was the May 6, 1527, Spanish and German troops' [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacking Rome]] that for two decades all but ended the role of the Papacy as the largest patron of Renaissance art and architecture.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

While the Italian Renaissance was fading, the Northern Renaissance adopted many of its ideals and transformed its styles. A number of Italy's greatest artists chose to emigrate.  The most notable example was [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who left for France in 1516, but teams of lesser artists invited to transform the [[Château de Fontainebleau]] created the [[school of Fontainebleau]] that infused the style of the Italian Renaissance in France. From Fontainebleau, the new styles, transformed by [[Mannerism]], brought the Renaissance to [[Antwerp]] and thence throughout Northern Europe.

This spread north was also representative of a larger trend.  No longer was the Mediterranean Europe's most important trade route.  In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India, and from that date the primary route of goods from the Orient was through the Atlantic ports of Lisbon, Seville, Nantes, Bristol, and London.

===Literature and poetry===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance literature}}
The thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Prior to the Renaissance, the [[Italian language]] was not the [[literary language]] in Italy.  It was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], or [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]].  The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'' (''Sweet New Style'', which emphasized [[Platonic love|Platonic]] rather than [[courtly love]]) came into its own, pioneered by poets like [[Guittone d'Arezzo]] and [[Guido Guinizelli]].  Especially in [[poetry]], major changes in [[Italian literature]] had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began.
[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (1469–1527), the author of ''[[The Prince]]'' and prototypical [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]. Detail from a portrait by [[Santi di Tito]].]]
With the printing of books initiated in Venice by [[Aldus Manutius]], an increasing number of works began to be published in the Italian language in addition to the flood of Latin and Greek texts that constituted the mainstream of the Italian Renaissance.  The source for these works expanded beyond works of [[theology]] and towards the pre-Christian eras of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]].  This is not to say that no religious works were published in this period:  [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' reflects a distinctly medieval world view.  [[Christianity]] remained a major influence for artists and authors, with the [[classics]] coming into their own as a second primary influence.

In the early Italian Renaissance, much of the focus was on translating and studying classic works from Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Renaissance authors were not content to rest on the laurels of ancient authors, however.  Many authors attempted to integrate the methods and styles of the ancient Greeks into their own works.  Among the most emulated Romans are [[Cicero]], [[Horace]], [[Sallust]], and [[Virgil]].  Among the Greeks, [[Aristotle]], [[Homer]], and [[Plato]] were now being read in the original for the first time since the 4th century, though Greek compositions were few.

The literature and poetry of the Renaissance was largely influenced by the developing science and philosophy.  The humanist [[Francesco Petrarch]], a key figure in the renewed sense of scholarship, was also an accomplished poet, publishing several important works of poetry.  He wrote poetry in [[Latin]], notably the [[Punic War]] epic ''[[Africa (epic poem)|Africa]]'', but is today remembered for his works in the Italian [[vernacular]], especially the ''[[Canzoniere]]'', a collection of love [[sonnet]]s dedicated to his unrequited love Laura.  He was the foremost writer of [[sonnet]]s in Italian, and translations of his work into English by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] established the sonnet form in that country, where it was employed by [[William Shakespeare]] and countless other poets.

Petrarch's disciple, [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], became a major author in his own right.  His major work was the ''[[Decameron]]'', a collection of 100 stories told by ten storytellers who have fled to the outskirts of Florence to escape the [[black plague]] over ten nights.  The ''[[Decameron]]'' in particular and Boccaccio's work in general were a major source of inspiration and plots for many English authors in the Renaissance, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Aside from Christianity, [[classical antiquity]], and scholarship, a fourth influence on Renaissance literature was politics. The political philosopher [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s most famous works are ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', ''[[Florentine Histories]]'' and finally ''[[The Prince]]'', which has become so well known in Western society that the term "Machiavellian" has come to refer to the ''[[realpolitik]]'' advocated by the book. However, what is ordinarily called "Machiavellianism" is a simplified textbook view of this single work rather than an accurate term for his philosophy. Further, it is not at all clear that Machiavelli himself was the apologist for immorality as whom he is often portrayed: the basic problem is the apparent contradiction between the monarchism of ''The Prince'' and the republicanism of the ''Discourses''. Regardless, along with many other Renaissance works, ''The Prince'' remains a relevant and influential work of literature today.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}
[[File:Petrarch by Bargilla.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Petrarch]], from the ''Cycle of Famous Men and Women.'' ca. 1450.  Detached fresco.  {{convert|247|x|153|cm|2|abbr=on}}. Galleria degli [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  Artist: [[Andrea di Bartolo di Bargilla]] (ca. 1423–1457).]]
One role of [[Petrarch]] is as the founder of a new method of scholarship,  Renaissance Humanism.

Petrarch encouraged the study of the [[Latin]] classics and carried his copy of Homer about, at a loss to find someone to teach him to read Greek. An essential step in the humanist education being propounded by scholars like [[Pico della Mirandola]] was the hunting down of lost or forgotten manuscripts that were known only by reputation.  These endeavors were greatly aided by the wealth of Italian patricians, merchant-princes and despots, who would spend substantial sums building [[libraries]].  Discovering the past had become fashionable and it was a passionate affair pervading the upper reaches of society.  ''I go'', said [[Cyriac of Ancona]], ''I go to awake the dead''. As the Greek works were acquired, manuscripts found, libraries and [[museum]]s formed, the age of the [[printing press]] was dawning.  The works of Antiquity were translated from Greek and Latin into the contemporary modern languages throughout Europe, finding a receptive middle-class audience, which might be, like Shakespeare, "with little Latin and less Greek".

While concern for [[philosophy]], art and literature all increased greatly in the Renaissance the period is usually seen as one of scientific backwardness.  The reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] views of the universe. Humanism stressed that nature came to be viewed as an animate spiritual creation that was not governed by laws or mathematics.  At the same time philosophy lost much of its rigour as the rules of [[logic]] and deduction were seen as secondary to intuition and emotion.

===Science===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance}}
According to some recent scholarship, the 'father of modern science' is [[Leonardo da Vinci]] whose experiments and clear scientific method earn him this title, Italian universities such as Padua, Bologna and Pisa were scientific centres of renown and with many northern European students, the science of the Renaissance moved to Northern Europe and flourished there, with such figures as [[Copernicus]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Descartes]].   [[Galileo]], a contemporary of Bacon and Descartes, made an immense contribution to scientific thought and experimentation, paving the way for the scientific revolution that later flourished in Northern Europe.
Bodies were also stolen from gallows and examined by many like Vesalius, a professor of anatomy. This allowed them to create accurate skeleton models and correct previously believed theories. For example, many thought that the [[human]] [[Mandible|jawbone]] was made up of two bones, as they had seen this on [[animals]]. However through examining human corpses they were able to understand that humans actually have only one.

===Sculpture and painting===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Last judgement.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'', 1536-1541, by [[Michelangelo]]]]
In painting, the false dawn of [[Giotto]]'s [[Trecento]] realism, his fully three-dimensional figures occupying a rational space, and his humanist interest in expressing the individual personality rather than the iconic images,&lt;ref&gt;Hayden B. J. Maginnis, ''Painting in the Age of Giotto: A Historical Reevaluation'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by a retreat into conservative late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Matt Kavaler, "Renaissance Gothic: Pictures of Geometry and Narratives of Ornament," ''Art History,'' Feb 2006, Vol. 29 Issue 1, pp 1-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Renaissance in painting began anew, in Florence and Tuscany, with the frescoes of [[Masaccio]], then the [[panel painting]]s and [[fresco]]s of [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Paolo Uccello]] which began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], thus representing three [[dimension]]s in two-dimensional art more authentically. The figures in Masaccio's frescos painted between 1425 and his death in 1428 have a plasticity unknown up to that point in time.  Compared to the flatness of Gothic painting, his pictures were revolutionary.  Piero della Francesca wrote treatises on scientific perspective. The creation of credible space allowed artists to also focus on the accurate representation of the human body and on naturalistic landscapes.  Completed in 1460, the [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] of [[Andrea Mantegna]], was probably the first good example of Renaissance painting in Northern Italy and became a model for other painters in the region.  At the turn of the 16th century, especially in Northern Italy, artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of [[Titian]]'s portraits and the development of [[sfumato]] and [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Giorgione]].  The period also saw the first secular (non-[[religion|religious]]) themes.  There has been much debate as to the degree of [[secularism]] in the Renaissance, which had been emphasized by early 20th-century writers like Jacob Burckhardt, based on, among other things, the presence of  a relatively small number of mythological paintings.  Those of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], notably ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', are now among the best known, although he was deeply religious (becoming a follower of Savonarola) and the great majority of his output was of traditional religious paintings or portraits.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"&gt;Frederick Hartt,  and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In sculpture, [[Donatello]]'s (1386–1466)  study of classical sculpture led to his development of classicizing positions (such as the [[contrapposto]] pose) and subject matter (like the unsupported nude – his second sculpture of ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire.)  The progress made by Donatello was influential on all who followed; perhaps the greatest of whom is [[Michelangelo]], whose [[Michelangelo's David|''David'']] of 1500 is also a male nude study;   more naturalistic than Donatello's and with greater emotional intensity. Both sculptures are standing in ''contrapposto'', their weight shifted to one leg.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Blake McHam, ed. ''Looking at Italian Renaissance Sculpture'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The period known as the High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. Pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Pg. 659&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous painters from this phase are Leonardo da Vinci, [[Raphael]], and Michelangelo and their images, including Leonardo's the [[Last Supper (da Vinci)|''Last Supper'']] and ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' and Michelangelo's ''[[Sistine Chapel Ceiling]]'' are the masterpieces of the period and among the most widely known works of art in the world.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"/&gt;

High Renaissance painting evolved into [[Mannerism]], especially in Florence.  Mannerist artists, who consciously rebelled against the principles of High Renaissance, tend to represent elongated figures in illogical spaces.   Modern scholarship has recognized the capacity of Mannerist art to convey strong (often religious) emotion where the High Renaissance failed to do so. Some of the main artists of this period are [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Parmigianino]] and Raphael's pupil [[Giulio Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Italian Renaissance and Mannerist Art'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]]. The dome, completed in 1590, was designed by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], architect, painter and poet.]]
{{Main|Italian Renaissance and Mannerist architecture}}
In [[Florence]], the Renaissance style was introduced with a revolutionary but incomplete monument in Rimini by [[Leone Battista Alberti]].  Some of the earliest buildings showing Renaissance characteristics are [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|church of San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]]. The interior of ''Santo Spirito'' expresses a new sense of light, clarity and spaciousness, which is typical of the early Italian Renaissance.  Its architecture reflects the philosophy of [[Humanism]], the enlightenment and clarity of mind as opposed to the darkness and spirituality of the Middle Ages.  The revival of classical antiquity can best be illustrated by the [[Palazzo Rucellai]].  Here the [[pilaster]]s follow the superposition of [[classical orders]], with  [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] on the ground floor, [[Ionic order|Ionic]] capitals on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals on the uppermost floor. Soon, Renaissance architects favored grand, large domes over tall and imposing spires, doing away with the Gothic style of the predating ages.

In Mantua, [[Leone Battista Alberti]] ushered in the new antique style, though his culminating work, [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Sant'Andrea]], was not begun until 1472, after the architect's death.

[[File:PalladioBramanteTempietto1570.jpg|thumb|[[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' in San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, 1502]]
The High Renaissance, as we call the style today, was introduced to [[Rome]] with [[Donato Bramante]]'s [[San Pietro in Montorio|Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio]] (1502) and his original centrally planned [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506), which was the most notable architectural commission of the era, influenced by almost all notable Renaissance artists, including [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]].  The beginning of the late Renaissance in 1550 was marked by the development of a new column order by [[Andrea Palladio]].  Colossal columns that were two or more stories tall decorated the [[facade]]s.

===Music===
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
In Italy during the 14th century there was an explosion of musical activity that corresponded in scope and level of innovation to the activity in the other arts.  Although [[musicologist]]s typically group the music of the [[Trecento]] (music of the 14th century) with the late [[Medieval music|medieval]] period, it included features which align with the early Renaissance in important ways:  an increasing emphasis on secular sources, styles and forms; a spreading of culture away from ecclesiastical institutions to the nobility, and even to the common people; and a quick development of entirely new techniques.  The principal forms were the [[Madrigal (Trecento)|Trecento madrigal]], the [[caccia (music)|caccia]], and the [[ballata]]. Overall, the musical style of the period is sometimes labelled as the "Italian [[ars nova]]." From the early 15th century to the middle of the 16th century, the center of innovation in sacred music was in the [[Low Countries]], and a flood of talented composers came to Italy from this region.  Many of them sang in either the papal choir in Rome or the choirs at the numerous chapels of the aristocracy, in [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Milan]], [[Ferrara]] and elsewhere; and they brought their [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style with them, influencing many native Italian composers during their stay.

The predominant forms of church music during the period were the [[mass (music)|mass]] and the [[motet]].  By far the most famous composer of church music in 16th-century Italy was [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], the most prominent member of the [[Roman School]], whose style of smooth, emotionally cool polyphony was to become the defining sound of the late 16th century, at least for generations of 19th- and 20th-century musicologists.  Other Italian composers of the late 16th century focused on composing the main secular form of the era, the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]:  and for almost a hundred years these secular songs for multiple singers were distributed all over Europe.  Composers of madrigals included [[Jacques Arcadelt]], at the beginning of the age, [[Cipriano de Rore]], in the middle of the century, and [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Philippe de Monte]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi]] at the end of the era. Italy was also a centre of innovation in instrumental music.  By the early 16th century keyboard improvisation came to be greatly valued, and numerous composers of virtuoso keyboard music appeared.  Many familiar instruments were invented and perfected in late Renaissance Italy, such as the [[violin]], the earliest forms of which came into use in the 1550s.

By the late 16th century Italy was the musical centre of Europe.  Almost all of the innovations which were to define the transition to the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period originated in northern Italy in the last few decades of the century.  In Venice, the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] productions of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], and associated instrumental music, moved north into Germany; in Florence, the [[Florentine Camerata]] developed [[monody]], the important precursor to [[opera]], which itself first appeared around 1600; and the avant-garde, [[mannerism|manneristic]] style of the [[Ferrara school]], which migrated to [[Naples]] and elsewhere through the music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]], was to be the final statement of the polyphonic vocal music of the Renaissance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13274">A '''KWL table''', or '''KWL chart''', is a [[Graphic organizers|graphical organizer]] designed to help in [[learning]]. The letters KWL are an [[acronym]], for what students, in the course of a lesson, already '''k'''now, '''w'''ant to know, and ultimately '''l'''earn. It is a part of the [[Constructivist methods|constructivist teaching method]] where students move away from what are considered traditional methods of teaching and learning. In this particular methodology the students are given the space to learn by constructing their own learning pace and their own style of understanding a given topic or idea. The KWL chart or table was developed within this methodology and is a form of instructional reading strategy that is used to guide students taking them through the idea and the text.&lt;ref name="nea.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/k-w-l-know-want-to-know-learned.html|title=NEA - K-W-L (Know, Want to Know, Learned)|work=NEA|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A KWL table is typically divided into three columns titled [[declarative knowledge|Know]], Want and Learned. The table comes in various forms as some have modified it to include or exclude information.

It may be useful in research projects and to organize information to help study for tests.

==Classroom introduction==
The KWL chart was created by Donna Ogle in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Ogle, D.M. (1986). K-W-L: A teaching model that develops active reading of expository text. ''Reading Teacher'', 39, 564–570&lt;/ref&gt; A KWL chart can be used for all subjects in a whole group or small group atmosphere. The chart is a comprehension strategy used to activate background knowledge prior to reading and is completely student centered.  The teacher divides a piece of chart paper into three columns.  The first column, 'K', is for what the students already know about a topic.  This step is to be completed before the reading.  The next column, 'W', is for students to list what they want to learn about the topic during the reading.  This step is also to be completed before the reading.  The third column, 'L', is for what the students learned from the reading.  This step, of course, is done after finishing the reading. The KWL chart can also be used in reading instruction at the beginning of a new unit.

Here is what the KWL chart can look like: 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! K 
What I ''know''
! W 
What I ''want'' to know
! L 
What I ''learned
|-
| Write the information about what the students know in this space. 
| Write the information about what the students want to know in this space. 
| After the completion of the lesson or unit, write the information that the students learned in this space. 
|-
|}

=== Things to keep in mind ===

Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then 1 paper with KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every individual child to brainstorm on the given topic then every individual shall have their own student paper copy.&lt;ref name="msu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msu.edu/course/cep/886/Reading%20Comprehension/7Learn_Serv_Proj_KWL.html|title=K-W-L STRATEGY|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'K' column, the teacher has to make sure that she or he has all the questions ready for the students to brainstorm on the particular idea that needs to be taken care in that class. The questions help the students to be prompted to think in specific directions that will lead them to the first step of brainstorming. Also ask the students the reason of their answers. By this the teacher makes them aware of their associations to the answers. The questions like "what made you think like that?" shall guide them well.
In the 'W' column, ask associating questions or liking questions to make them come to the thinking. questions like, "what would you like to learn more about this idea?" can help them to analyze and think more. The teacher here has to come prepared with her/his own set of questions that will link the students' questions to the idea in the text. This is done so that the student shall not lose the flow of the text as well as not lose the purpose of the activity.
In the last column 'L', help the students to come out with their own creative ideas and analysis. Also in this particular column, the teacher shall ask the students to differentiate between the answers to their questions and ideas in other columns and the idea they found interesting. At last, the teacher shall help the students to consult other sources which would answer their questions which are not mentioned in the text.&lt;ref name="nea.org"/&gt;

A KWL chart can be used to drive instruction in the classroom. The teacher can create lesson plans based upon the interests and inquiries of the students and their needs. Using this strategy can increase motivation and attention by activating the students' prior knowledge. This allows the teacher to understand the students' prior knowledge and the students' interests in the topic.

==Purpose==
A teacher has many reasons for using KWL charts in the classroom. First, a KWL chart activates students' prior knowledge of the text or topic to be studied. By asking students what they already know, students are thinking about prior experiences or knowledge about the topic. Next, KWL charts set a purpose for the unit. Students are able to add their input to the topic by asking them what they want to know. Students then have a purpose for participating and engaging in the topic. Also, using a KWL chart allows students to expand their ideas beyond the text used in the classroom. By being aware of students' interests, the teacher has the ability to create projects and assignments that the students will enjoy. A KWL chart is a tool that can be used to drive instruction as well as guide student learning.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;KWL table/ chart. (2009). Retrieved October 26, 2012, from http://www.study-habits.com/kwl-table-chart&lt;/ref&gt; 
KWL charts are used by elementary teachers from literature to science. They are also used to teach historical content at the elementary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachinghistory.org/teaching-materials/teaching-guides/21806|title=Applying KWL Guides to Sources with Elementary Students|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study tool ===
A KWL chart can be used as a study tool for an individual, group or entire class.  It is a way to synthesize information into a visual aid.  The students are also able to keep track of what they have done and what they still would like, or need to do.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Required materials ===
Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then one paper with KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every individual child to brainstorm on the given topic then every individual shall have their own student paper copy.&lt;ref name="msu.edu"/&gt;

=== Specific learners ===
KWL charts can be used with all students, however there are specific groups of students that lend themselves quite well to this strategy, including visual learners, young learners or [[ESL]] learners.  As the chart is a [[graphic organizer]] it can aid visual learners.  The information is presented in a user friendly way that is visually accessible.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;McDermott, M. J. (2012). Using graphic organizers in preschool. Teaching Young Children, 5(5), 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the visual nature of the KWL chart it can also be beneficial for young learners such as preschoolers.  Words may not be necessary and pictures can be used in order to express the ideas within the chart.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  As pictures can be used alone or in conjunction with words the KWL chart may provide assistance for students that are learning a second language.

== Adaptations ==
There are various adaptations of KWL charts that can be used within the classroom.

=== Hill ===
One adaptation as created by Hill&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Instructional strategies online. (2009). Retrieved October 26, 2012, from http://olc.spsd.sk.ca/DE/PD/instr/strats/kwl/&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the traditional KWL chart to include a column for "Further Wanderings" at the end of the table.  This allows for the students' knowledge to continue beyond what they have learned within the classroom. The idea behind this extra column is to encourage the students to continue to learn.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== KLEW ===
Another adaptation of the KWL chart is the KLEW chart.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Hershberger, K., Zembal-Saul, C., &amp; Starr, M. L. (2006). Evidence helps the KWL get a KLEW. Science &amp; Children, 43(5), 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  The KLEW chart was developed by a group of people with various backgrounds including an elementary school teacher, a professor and a professional development specialist.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Within this chart, the "K" stands for what students know of a topic, the "L" for what is being learned, the "E" for evidence that supports the learning previously described, and the "W" for wondering, which leaves room for further questions.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; This table differs from the traditional KWL chart as it places an emphasis on observation and examination of evidence that supports what they see.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

=== Mooney ===
Margaret Mooney suggested a variation to the KWL chart by adding a fifth column to the traditional chart. This column would be located between the "W" and the "L". Its purpose is to answer the question "How".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This encourages the students to develop their own means of how they will discover more information. This can be quite useful in the sciences for experimentation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Assessment and evaluation ==
The KWL chart is useful to complete [[formative assessment]] in the classroom.  It allows the teacher to find out the students prior knowledge on a particular topic.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Struble, J. (2007). Using graphic organizers as formative assessment. Science Scope, 30(5), 69-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this knowledge the teacher is then able to gear their lessons based upon this information. The KWL chart can be completed when starting a new topic and be added to throughout the unit.  Further, the teacher is able to find out what the students have learned by the end of their lessons.

KWL charts work well in order to examine the individual student or the entire class in order to understand their thinking and learning.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

=== Advantages ===
According to Jared and Jared (1997), KWL was established with the motive to enhance the comprehensive reading skills of the students. This was done by designing the three levels of the activity focusing on the different learning styles of the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jared, J. Elizabeth, Jared, H. Alva (1997). Launching into improved comprehension. ''The Technology Teacher'', 56(6), 24–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Glazer(1998), students fail to enjoy the text or content because they fail to understand it. Hence, KWL increases their comprehension skills as the activity goes through each topic step by step.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, M. Susan. (1998). Using kwl folders. Teaching Diverse Learners, 29(4), 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan. (1998). Using kwl folders. Teaching Diverse Learners, 29(4), 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Szabo(2006), a KWL table uses a strategy of before-during-after for the students to enhance their comprehension skills. The students start by brainstorming the prior knowledge about the topic and then eventually develop curiosity about the topic. This builds their interest in the topic and they would want to learn more about the topic. KWL chart gives an opportunity to the individual to build up self-motivation regarding the topic. Through KWL table, the students go through self-evaluation as they know what they intend to learn and what they really understood. Hence, KWL gives the students some space to explore the topic through other sources and build up their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, Susan. (2006). Kwhhl: A student-driven evolution of the kwl. ''American Secondary Education'', 34(3), 57–67&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5535">[[Image:KanishkaCasket.JPG|thumb|The "Kanishka casket", dated to [[127|127 CE]], with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] surrounded by [[Brahma]] and [[Indra]], and Kanishka standing at the center of the lower part, [[British Museum]].]]
[[Image:KanishkaBuddhaDetail2.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Buddha, surrounded by [[cherubs]], with devotee or [[bodhisattava]]]]
The '''Kanishka casket''' or '''Kanishka reliquary''', is a [[Buddhist]] [[reliquary]] made in gilded copper, and dated to the first year of the reign of the [[Kushan]] emperor [[Kanishka]], in 127 CE.  It is now in the [[Peshawar Museum]] in the historic city of Peshawar, Pakistan. 

==History and description==
It was discovered in a deposit chamber under the monumental [[Kanishka stupa]] (described by Chinese pilgrims in the 7th century as the tallest stupa in all India), during the archeological excavations in 1908-1909 in Shah-ji-Dheri on the outskirts of [[Peshawar]]. It is said to have contained three bone fragments of the Buddha,&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, D. B. (1908-9): "Excavations at Shāh-ji-Dherī." ''Archaeological Survey of India'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; which were forwarded to [[Burma]] by the British following the excavation,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, John H. (1909): "Archaeological Exploration in India, 1908-9." (Section on: "The stūpa of Kanishka and relics of the Buddha"). ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 1909, pp. 1056-1061.&lt;/ref&gt; where they still remain.

The casket is today at the [[Peshawar Museum]], and a copy is in the [[British Museum]]. The casket is dedicated in [[Kharoshthi]]. The inscription reads:

: "(*mahara)jasa kanishkasa kanishka-pure nagare aya gadha-karae deya-dharme sarva-satvana hita-suhartha bhavatu mahasenasa sagharaki dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kanishkasa vihare mahasenasa sangharame"

:"In the acceptance (i.e. for the acceptance) of the Sarvāstivādin teachers, this perfume box is the meritorious gift of Mahārāja Kanishka [ . . . ''jasa Kani''] in the city of Kanishkapura [''Kanishkapure nagare'']. May (it) be for the welfare and happiness of all beings. . . . ''sa'', the superintendent of construction of the refectory in Kanishka's vihāra [''nashkasa vihare''], in Mahāsena's saṁghārāma [''Mahasenasa saṁgharame'']." &lt;ref&gt;Translated by B. N. Mukherjee. ''BMQ'', Vol. XXVIII, pp. 41-43. Quoted in: Dobbins, K. Walton. (1971): ''The Stūpa and Vihāra of Kanishka I''. The Asiatic Society of Bengal Monograph Series, Vol. XVIII. Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally it was believed, that the text is signed by the maker, a Greek artist named ''Agesilas'', who oversaw work at Kanishka's [[stupa]]s (caitya), confirming the direct involvement of Greeks with Buddhist realizations at such a late date: "The servant ([[dasa]]) Agisalaos, the superintendent of works at the vihara of Kanishka in the monastery of Mahasena" ("dasa agisala nava-karmi ana*kaniskasa vihara mahasenasa sangharame"). However, a recent cleaning of the casket had shown that the old reading was not accurate. Instead, the name is to be read ''agnisala'', which is the [[refectory]] of the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Prudence R. Myer: ''Again the Kanishka Casket'', In: ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 48, No. 3/4 (Sep.–Dec., 1966), pp. 396–403 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3048396]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lid of the casket shows the Buddha on lotus pedestal, and worshipped by [[Brahma]] and [[Indra]].

The edge of the lid is decorated by a frieze of flying geese, or [[Hamsa bird|hamsa]], symbolizing the travel of departing souls and the removal from [[samsara]]. Some of the geese have a wreath of victory in their beak.

The body of the casket represents a Kushan monarch, probably Kanishka in person, with the Iranian [[Sun god]] and [[Moon god]] at his side. On the sides are two images of a seated Buddha, worshiped a royal figures, possibly a [[bodhisattava]].

A garland, supported by [[cherubs]] goes around the scene in typical Hellenistic style.

The relics themselves were forwarded to Burma by the British in 1910 in order to safeguard them. They are today visible in [[Mandalay]]. The three fragments of bone are believed to be true relics of Gautama Buddha.

'''Lost artworks''' are original pieces of art that credible sources indicate once existed but that cannot be accounted for in museums or private collections or are known to have been [[Iconoclasm|destroyed deliberately]] or accidentally, or neglected through ignorance and lack of [[connoisseurship]].

The US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] maintains a list of "Top Ten Art Crimes";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft|title=FBI — Art Theft|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2006 book by Simon Houpt&lt;ref name="Houpt2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houpt |first=Simon |title=Museum of the Missing: The High Stakes of Art Crime |year=2006 |publisher=Key Porter Books |isbn=978-1-86189-316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other media outlets have profiled the most significant outstanding losses.

==Chronology of notable loss events==
&lt;!-- Consistent and concise format is: Identifying place proper name as indicated elsewhere on English wiki (should be linked out to that page) followed by a 1-2 word event-type descriptor ("fire", "theft") then comma plus the most specific date possible in euro format: "Gosford House fire, 1940". Use a geographic designation only to differentiate between places with exactly the same name (i.e. Museum of Modern Art). If event has a globally recognized standard name (i.e. "Bonfire of the Vanities" that supersedes this convention) ---&gt;

== Research and recovery efforts ==

The [[Art Loss Register]] is a commercial computerized international database which captures information about lost and stolen art, antiques and collectables. It is operated by a commercial company based in London.

In the U.S., the FBI maintains the [https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file|National Stolen Art File], "a database of stolen art and cultural property. Stolen objects are submitted for entry to the NSAF by law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad."&lt;ref name="FBI20160930"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Stolen Art File|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file|website=fbi.gov|publisher=FBI|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Divine Mercy}}
[[File:Peterborough Psalter c 1220-25 Mercy and Truth.jpg|thumb|''Mercy and Truth'' are shown together in a 13th-century representation of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms#85|Psalm 85 (10)]]]]
'''Mercy''' ([[Middle English]], from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] ''merci'', from [[Medieval Latin]] ''merced-'', ''merces'', from [[Latin]], "price paid, wages", from ''merc-'', ''merxi'' "merchandise") is [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[forgiveness]], and [[kindness]] in a variety of ethical, religious, social, and [[Law|legal]] contexts.

The concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and [[Works of Mercy]].

In the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party, e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims.&lt;ref name=Sarat &gt;Sarat, Austin and Hussain, Nasser. ''Forgiveness, mercy, and clemency'', 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-5333-4}} pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;Menke, Christopher. ''Reflections of equality'' by Christoph Menke 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-4474-2}} p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
"Mercy" can be defined as "compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one's power"; and  also "a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mercy "Mercy", Merriam-Webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "To be at someone's mercy" indicates a person being "without defense against someone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/at+the+mercy+of "At the mercy of", McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs. © 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and ethics==
[[File:Spirit of Compassion.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''Spirit of Compassion'', commemorating [[World War I]], [[National War Memorial (South Australia)|South Australia]], 1931]]
In a judicial context mercy is often termed "clemency". It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. [[John Locke]] defined it as "the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Second Treatise on Civil Government'', (C.B MacPherson, ed.), Indianapolis, Indiana. Hackett, 1980, §§ 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] explained that "The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Sapp'', 118 F. 3d 460, 465 (6th Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Christianity===
{{see also|Works of Mercy}}
Hebrews 4:16 says, "So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help."&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 4:16, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that they do not deserve while mercy is what one receives when they do ''not'' get that which they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2014/03/17/what-is-the-difference-between-mercy-and-grace/ Wellman, Jack. "What Is The Difference Between Mercy and Grace?"], ''Patheos'', March 17, 2104&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emphasis on mercy appears in the [[New Testament]], for example in the [[Magnificat]] &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:46-55|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] (Song of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:68-79|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Luke's Gospel]], and in the [[Beatitudes]] in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:7|Matthew 5:7]]: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#2:4|Ephesians 2:4]] [[Apostle Paul]] refers to the mercy of God in terms of salvation: "God, being rich in mercy,... even when we were dead through our sins, made us alive together with Christ".

[[Psalm 117]] calls upon all nations to praise the Lord, and that on account of his "merciful kindness". This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 15:11 to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and Gentile. Thus St Peter writes in 1 Peter 2:9,10:
:''But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.''

This devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by [[Saint Augustine]] who called mercy "ever ancient, ever new".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 &gt;''Mercies Remembered'' by Matthew R Mauriello 2011 {{ISBN|1-61215-005-5}} page 149-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', Book X, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Works of Mercy]] (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 /&gt;

[[File:Kazimirowski Eugeniusz, Divine Mercy, 1934.jpg|thumb|180px|The first ''[[Divine Mercy image]]'' (circa 1934) painted according to the apparitions of [[Faustina Kowalska]] by [[Eugene Kazimierowski]]. Now permanently enshrined at the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Vilnius)|Divine Mercy Sanctuary of Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref name=Withyou548 &gt;''Am With You Always'' by [[Benedict Groeschel]] 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-58617-257-2}} page 548&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' ("Rich in Mercy") Pope John Paul II examines the role of mercy—both God's mercy, and also the need for human mercy.&lt;ref name=Dives&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II. ''Dives in misericordia'', November 30, 1980, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees in the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:11|Luke 15:11-32]]) "the essence of the divine mercy".&lt;ref name=Dives/&gt; Having squandered his patrimony, justice would dictate that the prodigal should only expect to be received back as a hireling. The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] emphasizes the importance of the [[Works of Mercy]] (item 2447) and in [[Roman Catholic]] teachings, the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 &gt;''We Believe in the Holy Spirit'' by Andrew Apostoli 2002 {{ISBN|1-931709-31-9}} pages 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Catechism2447 &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm#2447 Vatican website Catechism item 2447]&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic [[liturgy]] includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison]]'': Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08714a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Kyrie Eleison'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy has also been an important subject of Christian [[iconography]]. Since the [[Middle Ages]], many representations in art encouraged people to practice the [[works of mercy]] and, as the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains using the example of [[Caravaggio]], helped "the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism]'', in ''Church, Communication and Culture'' 2 (2017), pp. 63-87, quotation from pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, there was new focus on mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, partly due to the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion.&lt;ref name=Withyou548 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it.&lt;ref name=Ball175 &gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Pope John Paul II]] was a follower of the Divine Mercy devotion, due to Saint [[Mary Faustina Kowalska]] (1905–1938), who is known as the ''[[Faustina Kowalska|Apostle of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref name=Butler &gt;''Butler's lives of the saints: the third millennium'' by Paul Burns, Alban Butler 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-86012-383-5}} page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drake85 &gt;''Saints of the Jubilee'' by Tim Drake 2002 {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}} pages 85-95&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of Roman Catholic [[shrines]] are specifically dedicated to Divine Mercy, e.g.
the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Krakow)|Basilica of Divine Mercy]] in Krakow Poland, and the [[National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061997_sr-faustina_en.html Vatican website: Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt; During the dedication of the Basilica of Divine Mercy John Paul II quoted [[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul|the Diary of Faustina]] and called mercy the "greatest attribute of God Almighty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20020817_shrine-divine-mercy_en.html  Vatican website: Dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''World Apostolic Congress on Mercy'' was held in Rome in April 2008 and was inaugurated by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407083540/http://www.zenit.org/article-22184?l=english |title=Zenit April 2, 2008 |date=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080408194854/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0801799.htm |title=Catholic News Service, APril 3, 2008 |date=2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April, 2015, at St. Peter's Basillica, in a Papal Bull of Indiction entitled ''Misericordiae Vultus'' ("The Face of Mercy"), [[Pope Francis]] proclaimed a Special and Extraordinary Holy Year [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of Mercy, from December 8, 2015: [[Solemnity]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], until November 21, 2016: the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus [[Christ the King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/papa-francesco_bolla_20150411_misericordiae-vultus.html Pope Francis, ''Misericordiae Vultus'', April 11, 2015, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of the Extraordinary Jubilee is taken from Luke 6:36, "Merciful, Like the Father".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-declares-2016-to-be-a-jubilee-for-mercy-84325/ Harris, Elise. "Pope Francis declares Holy Year for Mercy", Catholic News Agency, March 13, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] the title "Most Merciful" (al-Rahman) is one of the [[names of Allah]] and Compassionate (al-Rahim), is the most common name occurring in the [[Quran]]. Rahman and Rahim both derive from the root Rahmat, which refers to tenderness and benevolence.&lt;ref name=Rafiabadi &gt;''World religions and Islam: a critical study, Part 1'' by Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi, 2003 Sarup and Sons Publishers {{ISBN|81-7625-414-2}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of mercy, the giving of alms ([[zakat]]) is the fourth of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] and one of the requirements for the faithful.&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;Hooker, Richard (July 14, 1999). "arkan ad-din the five pillars of religion". Washington State University. {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203124633/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The Hebrew word  for mercy is ''Rachamim'' which is always in plural form so that it literally means "mercies". "Mercy includes showing kindness to those who don’t deserve it, and forgiving those that deserve punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shema.com/gods-attributes-the-mercy-of-god-3043/ Rabbi Loren. "God’s Attributes: The Mercy of God", Congregation Shema Yisrael]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy is one of the defining characteristics of [[God]]. Exodus 34:6 says: "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness."&lt;ref&gt;''After the exile'' by John Barton, David James Reimer 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-86554-524-3}} page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This is also emphasized in the context of the Babylonian exile in Isaiah: "For the Lord has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones. But Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.' Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." (Isaiah 49:13-15) Also: "It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just." (Tobit 12:8) 

When [[David]], because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence saying, "Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 24:14, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.

===Other religions and beliefs===
[[Kwan Yin]] the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated [[Bodhisattva]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Guan Yin: goddess of compassion'' by Kok Kiang Koh 2004 {{ISBN|981-229-379-5}} pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karuṇā]] (often translated as "compassion") is part of the beliefs of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. Karuṇā is present in all schools of Buddhism and in Jainism it is viewed as one of the reflections of universal friendship.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described God as being "all-merciful and eternally benevolent" in his [[Parvardigar Prayer|O Parvardigar]] prayer, and he held that we can approach God through the "invocation of His mercy."&lt;ref&gt; Kalchuri, Bhau (1986).

'''Mexican muralism''' was the promotion of [[mural]] painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post [[Mexican Revolution]] government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in [[Mexico]] and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the [[United States]] where it served as inspiration for the [[Chicano art movement]].

==Antecedents==

[[Mexico]] has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the [[Olmec]] civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was [[Juan Cordero]] in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the [[Santa Teresa la Antigua|Santa Teresa Church]] and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of [[Gabino Barreda]] at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (since disappeared).&lt;ref name="plasmo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Plasmó Juan Cordero primer mural en México con temas filosóficos |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=May 27, 2008&lt;!--|918-917-9042--&gt;  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Juan Cordero plastered the first mural with philosophical themes in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making [[Mexico]] like [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; [[Dr. Atl|Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl]], is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcounty.gov/museum/media/press-kit/contretas/contreras-media-kit-mural-tradition.pdf |title= The art of Ramón Contreras and the Mexican Muralists movement |publisher= San Bernardino County Museum  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.  Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=) Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253341 |title= Populist art and the Mexican mural renaissance |work= Hispanic Heritage in the Americas -Latin American art |publisher= Britannica  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name="dratl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title=Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art  |last1=Burton |first1=Tony |date=March 14, 2008 |issn=1028-9089 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The [[Mexican Revolution]] itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to [[Porfirio Díaz]] policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included [[Antonio Curo]], [[Alfonso Reyes]] and [[José Vasconcelos]]. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros |title= Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros.  |first=Rita |last=Pomade |date= May 5, 2007  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas gained power as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of [[Francisco I. Madero]] who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the [[Álvaro Obregón]] faction, which became the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI).&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.&lt;ref name="dratl"/&gt;

In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]]. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; These ideals or principles were to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the identity of [[Mexico]] as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;  The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, [[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], [[Federico Cantú]] and others but the main three would be [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by [[Roberto Montenegro]], but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; 
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|Mural in the Palacio de Bellas Artes by [[Rufino Tamayo]].]]

The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]], at that time used for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]].&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]] painted ["dancers of Chalma"] "Los danzantes de Chalma", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, [[Jean Charlot]] painted ''La conquista de Tenochtitlán'' (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal.&lt;ref name="folgarait"&gt; {{cite book |title= Mural painting and Social Revolution in Mexico 1920-1940  |last= Folgariat |first= Leonard |year=1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58147-8 |pages=42-46 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

===After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School===
This project at the institution was followed by projects at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the interior walls of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Escuela Nacional de Chapingo]] the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the [[Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters|Secretaria de Educación Pública building]] among many others.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;
[[File:DeembarcoCanalSICDF.JPG|thumb|[[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], Mural at [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]]]]
The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors.  The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of [[Marxism]], especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the "heroic" phase while the period after 1930 is the "statist" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Mary|title=Muralism and The People: Culture, Popular Citizenship, and Government in Post-Revolutionary Mexico|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|pages=7–38|doi=10.1080/10714420212350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who "acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as "propaganda for a corrupt state" as taking a hard line.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;  Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;

Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Folgarait|title=Mural Painting and Social Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940: Art of the New Order|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt;  The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt; Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.

The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
[[File:MuralCamarenaBellasArtes.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Mural by [[Jorge González Camarena]] at the Palacio de Bellas Artes]]

Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.&lt;ref name="anos30"&gt;{{cite news |title= Testigo de los anos 30 |author=James Oles |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 12, 2000 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Witness to the 1930s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minima"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/artmex/tema3.html |title=Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican School of Painting and Sculpting |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” &lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:
1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
Most painters in this school worked in [[Mexico City]] or other cities in [[Mexico]], working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of [[Mexico]] and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.&lt;ref name="minima"/&gt;  
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 5 057.jpg|thumb|180px|Mural by [[Alfredo Zalce]] at the state government palace in [[Morelia]].]]
A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the [[Mexican Revolution]], mestizo identity and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural history.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The other political orientation was that of [[Marxism]], especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.  The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The mural painters of [[Mexico]] freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the [[fresco]], painting on freshly plastered walls and [[encaustic painting|encaustic or hot wax painting]] .&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with [[pyroxlene]], a commercial enamel and [[Duco]] (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Los Tres Grandes==
[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumb|Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace by Diego Rivera]]
By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]], called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones).&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;
[[File:La abolición de la esclavitud de Orozco.JPG|thumb|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]] abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco]]
Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"/&gt; His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; His work shows an "expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure." &lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the [[Mexican Revolution]], having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;
[[File:PolyforumSiqueiros05.jpg|thumb|View of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros in Mexico City]]
Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the [[Venustiano Carranza]] army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a "futurist blurring of form and technique." His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism.&lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"/&gt; His radical politics made him unwelcome in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], so he did much of his work in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, his masterpiece is considered to be the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], located in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. [[José Vasconcelos]], the Secretary of Public Education under President [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=William|title=The Dilemmas of a Communist Artist: Diego Rivera in Moscow, 1927-1928|journal=Mexican Studies|year=1987|volume=3|issue=1|pages=49–69|jstor=4617031|doi=10.2307/4617031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.

In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crosscultural"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbard |first=Kathy |date=September 2010 |title= A CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION: Using Visual Culture for the Creation of a Socially Relevant Mural in Mexico |journal=Art Education |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=68–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal market]] of [[Teotitlán del Valle]], a small town in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. High school and college students from [[State of Georgia|Georgia]], [[United States]], collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of [[Zapotec language]] and customs.&lt;ref name="crosscultural"/&gt;

Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after [[World War I]] with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include [[Carlos Mérida]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Candido Portinari]] of [[Brazil]] .&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;  Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to [[Los Angeles]]. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The only one of the three to survive, [[América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos|''América Tropical'']] (full name: ''América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos'', or ''Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism''&lt;ref&gt;Del Barco, Mandalit.

The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. It served as inspiration to the later [[Chicano]] muralism but the political messages are different.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the [[Sandinista]] period.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992''.

[[Image:RAF Observation Post Bunker.jpg|right|thumb|An observation post for airfield defense coordination.]]

An '''observation post''' (commonly abbreviated '''OP'''), temporary or fixed, is a position from which [[soldier]]s can watch enemy movements, to warn of approaching soldiers (such as in [[trench warfare]]), or to [[Artillery observer|direct artillery fire]]. In strict military terminology, an observation post is ''any'' preselected position from which observations are to be made - this may include very temporary installations such as a vehicle parked as a roadside checkpoint, or even an airborne aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=386 DoD News Briefing, February 15, 1996 1:30 pm EST] (from a [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] news briefing. Accessed 2008-06-21.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[Image:Disguisetactics.jpg|thumb|right|[[German Empire|German]] [[World War I]] observation post disguised as a tree.]]

When selecting a (temporary) observation post, trained troops are to avoid obvious and conspicuous locations such as hilltops, [[water tower]]s or other isolated terrain features, and to ensure that the observation post can be reached via a [[:wikt:conceal|concealed]] route. This is especially important as the observer in the post should be rotated every 20–30 minutes, as [[alertness|vigilance]] decreases markedly after such a time.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt; 

Observation posts should be manned with at least two personnel (more, for defense and observer rotation, if the post is to be retained for longer durations), and should be provided a means of communication with their [[chain of command]], preferably by phone instead of by radio.&lt;ref name="IM"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/accp/in0202/le2l.htm#pl Observation posts] (from the ''Mechanized Infantry Squad Operations (Bradley)'' course manual, [[United States Army Infantry School]], 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Often being positioned in secret very close to the enemy, an observation post is usually a small construct, often consisting largely of [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] materials and possibly weather cover. However, where [[Front (military)|frontlines]] are expected to be stable for a longer time, an observation post (or '''ground observation post''') may develop into a [[bunker]]-like installation.

It is not unusual for soldiers to occupy a 'hide' for long periods of time. To avoid detection they have to remove all their own waste, this is achieved with the aid of clingfilm, plastic bags and empty water bottles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One example of makeshift observation posts is [[Gaza Baptist Church]], which was commandeered by both [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] troops during the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11971">In early [[Greek music]] [[music theory|theory]], an '''octave species''' (εἶδος τοῦ διὰ πασῶν, or σχῆμα τοῦ διὰ πασῶν) is a sequence of [[incomposite interval]]s ([[ditone]]s, [[minor third]]s, [[whole tone]]s, [[semitone]]s of various sizes, or [[quarter tone]]s) making up a complete [[octave]] {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=231–32}}. The concept was also important in Medieval and Renaissance music theory.

==Ancient Greek theory==
[[File:Greek Dorian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the enharmonic genus, showing the two component tetrachords {{audio|Greek Dorian mode on E, enharmonic genus.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:Greek Dorian chromatic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the chromatic genus {{audio|Greek Dorian mode on E, chromatic genus.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:Dorian diatonic.png|thumb|right|300px|Greek Dorian octave species in the diatonic genus {{audio|Phrygian mode E.mid|Play}}]]
Greek theorists used two terms interchangeably to describe what we call species: ''eidos'' (εἶδος) and ''skhēma'' (σχῆμα), defined as "a change in the arrangement of incomposite [intervals] making up a compound magnitude while the number and size of the intervals remains the same" ({{harvnb|Aristoxenus|1954|loc=92.7–8 &amp; 92.9–11}} (da Rios), translated in {{harvnb|Barbera|1984|loc=230}}). Cleonides (the Aristoxenian tradition) described (in the diatonic genus) three species of [[perfect fourth|diatessaron]], four of [[perfect fifth|diapente]] and seven of [[octave|diapason]]. Ptolemy in his "Harmonics" called them all generally "species of primary consonances" (εἴδη τῶν πρώτων συμφωνιῶν). [[Boethius]], who inherited Ptolemy's generalization under the term "species primarum consonantiarum" (Inst. mus. IV,14{{Full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--Unless there is a very good reason not to, this should be referenced to Bower's translated edition.--&gt;), expanded species theory of Greeks; along with the traditional orderings of three primary species he introduced three further their orderings {{harv|Boethius|1989|loc=149}}. For epistemology of the Antiquity music theory, the most important of all was the octave species, because "from the species of the consonance of the diapason arise what are called ''modes''" {{harv|Boethius|1989|loc=153}}.

=== Octave species ===
The basis of octave species was the smaller category of species of the [[perfect fourth]], or ''diatessaron''; when filled in with two intermediary notes, the resulting four notes and three consecutive intervals constitute a "[[tetrachord]]" {{harv|Gombosi|1951|loc=22}}. The species defined by the different positioning of the intervals within the tetrachord in turn depend upon [[Genus (music)|genus]] first being established {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. Incomposite in this context refers to intervals not composed of smaller intervals.

[[File:Greek Phrygian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|300px|Greek Phrygian octave species in the enharmonic genus {{audio|Greek Phrygian mode on E, enharmonic genus.mid|Play}}]]
Most Greek theorists distinguish three genera of the tetrachord: [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic]], [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]], and [[Diatonic genus|diatonic]]. The enharmonic and chromatic genera are defined by the size of their largest incomposite interval (major third and minor third, respectively), which leaves a composite interval of two smaller parts, together referred to as a ''pyknon''; in the diatonic genus, no single interval is larger than the other two combined {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. The earliest theorists to attempt a systematic treatment of octave species, the harmonicists (or school of Eratocles) of the late fifth century BC, confined their attention to the enharmonic genus, with the intervals in the resulting seven octave species being {{harv|Barker|1984–87|loc=2:15}}:

Species of the [[perfect fifth]] (''diapente'') are then created by the addition of a whole tone to the intervals of the tetrachord. The first, or original species in both cases has the ''pyknon'' or, in the diatonic genus, the semitone, at the bottom {{harv|Cleonides|1965|loc=41}} and, similarly, the lower interval of the ''pyknon'' must be smaller or equal to the higher one {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229–30}}. The whole tone added to create the species of fifth (the "tone of disjunction") is at the top in the first species; the remaining two species of fourth and three species of fifth are regular rotations of the constituent intervals, in which the lowest interval of each species becomes the highest of the next ({{harvnb|Cleonides|1965|loc=41}}; {{harvnb|Barbera|1984|loc=233}}). Because of these constraints, tetrachords containing three different incomposite intervals (compared with those in which two of the intervals are of the same size, such as two whole tones) still have only three species, rather than the six possible permutations of the three elements {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=232}}. Similar considerations apply to the species of fifth.

The species of fourth and fifth are then combined into larger constructions called "systems". The older, central "characteristic octave", is made up of two first-species tetrachords separated by a tone of disjunction, and is called the Lesser Perfect System {{harv|Gombosi|1951|loc=23–24}}. It therefore includes a lower, first-species fifth and an upper, fourth-species fifth. To this central octave are added two flanking conjuct tetrachords (that is, they share the lower and upper tones of the central octave). This constitutes the Greater Perfect System, with six fixed bounding tones of the four tetrachords, within each of which are two movable pitches. {{harvnb|Ptolemy|1930|loc=D. 49–53}} {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=235}} labels the resulting fourteen pitches with the (Greek) letters from Α ([[Alpha (letter)|Alpha α]]) to Ο ([[Omega (letter)|Omega Ω]]). (A diagram is available at [[Musical system of ancient greece#Systêma ametabolon, an overview of the Tone System|systema ametabolon]])

The Lesser and Greater Perfect Systems exercise constraints on the possible octave species. Some early theorists, such as Gaudentius in his ''Harmonic Introduction'', recognized that, if the various available intervals could be combined in any order, even restricting species to just the diatonic genus would result in twelve ways of dividing the octave (and his 17th-century editor, [[Marcus Meibom]], pointed out that the actual number is 21), but "only seven species or forms are melodic and symphonic" {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=237–39}}. Those octave species that cannot be mapped onto the system are therefore rejected {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=240}}.

==Medieval theory==
In chant theory beginning in the 9th century, the ''New Exposition'' of the composite treatise called ''Alia musica'' developed an eightfold [[Musical mode|modal system]] from the seven diatonic octave species of ancient Greek theory, transmitted to the West through the Latin writings of [[Martianus Capella]], [[Cassiodorus]], [[Isidore of Seville]], and, most importantly, Boethius. Together with the species of fourth and fifth, the octave species remained in use as a basis of the theory of modes, in combination with other elements, particularly the system of [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|octoechos]] borrowed from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] {{harv|Powers|2001}}.

Species theory in general (not just the ''octave'' species) remained an important theoretical concept throughout Middle Ages. The following appreciation of species as a structural basis of a mode, found in the ''Lucidarium'' (XI, 3) of [[Marchetto of Padua|Marchetto]] (ca. 1317), can be seen as typical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We declare that those who judge the mode of a melody exclusively with regard to ascent and descent cannot be called musicians, but rather blind men, singers of mistake... for, as [[Berno of Reichenau|Bernard]] said, "species are dishes at a musical banquet; they create modes" {{harv|Herlinger|1985|loc=393-395}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Orlando Science Center''' ('''OSC''') is a private science museum located in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Its purposes are to provide experience-based opportunities for learning about science and technology and to promote public understanding of science.

The Orlando Science Center is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM) and is a member of the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC). The Orlando Science Center is member supported and sponsored in part by United Arts of Central Florida, Inc., the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Cultural Affairs and the Florida Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission statement ==
Inspire science learning for life.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1955, the Central Florida Museum (CFM) opened in Orlando Loch Haven Park in 1960. For its first decade, it was an anthropology museum with collections of artifacts relating to [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean Basin]].

In the early 1970s, the CFM's board of directors voted to change directions and to become a "hands-on" science and technology center. In 1973 the institution was renamed to honor a famous native son and astronaut, [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]].

In 1984, as part of an expansion and change of philosophy, the institution's name was changed to Orlando Science Center. In 1985 another major expansion created a permanent physical sciences hall, a traveling exhibit hall, and Curiosity Corner, a hands-on exhibit area dedicated to pre-school and early primary age children. Its new facility was the setting for the Orlando Children's Museum scenes in ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2014/06/20/location-matters-various-points-from-ernest-saves-christmas|title= Location Matters: various points from 'Ernest Saves Christmas'|date= June 10, 2014|work=Orlando Weekly|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final expansion to the original facility in 1990, NatureWorks, a prototype for OSC's centerpiece natural science exhibit was created.

In May 1992, the Board and staff developed a comprehensive master plan for the Orlando Science Center, including a blueprint for construction of an entirely new science center. Construction of the new science center began in early 1995.

The new {{convert|207000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Orlando Science Center celebrated its grand opening on February 1, 1997. It is six times larger than the original facility, which closed December 31, 1996. The current president and CEO of the science center is JoAnn Newman.

== Exhibits ==
These are the current exhibits within the Orlando Science Center 
*'''NatureWorks'''  - 1st Floor - Exhibit hall that describes the richness of the natural world, with a focus on the diverse ecosystems of Central Florida. Such as, plants and animals of coral reefs, cypress swamps, mangrove, and other Florida environments. You can learn how living and non-living things interact with each other and their environment.
*'''KidsTown''' - 2nd Floor - Miniature town that introduces science concepts through whole-body experiences, hands-on interactives and  imaginative role-playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/os-orlando-science-center-kids-town-20160909-story.html|title=Orlando Science Center hopes Kids Town can be boom town|date= September 9, 2016|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kinetic Zone''' - 2nd Floor - An eclectic array of hands-on, interactive exhibits, Kinetic Zone lets visitors explore the fundamentals of forces, such as electricity, gravity, Newton's Laws and much more. Visitors can engage in a series of hands-on challenges that invite them to design, build and test their own.

*'''Fusion: A STEAM Gallery''' – 3rd Floor Mezzanine - The Orlando Science Center's art gallery which integrates art into the STEM curriculum. All art displayed has a fusion of art and technology. While the Gallery will remain as a permanent part of the Science Center, the exhibition is updated intermittently
*'''DinoDigs''' - 4th Floor - Exhibit consisting of fossil replicas of dinosaurs and prehistoric sea creatures. Uncover fossils in the giant dig pit "Jurassic Ridge"; examine real, fossilized dino eggs; explore displays that feature ancient land and marine reptiles; compare reptiles and dinosaurs to see similarities and differences; and discover denizens of the ancient oceans such as Elasmosaurus and Tylosaurus.
*'''Our Planet''' - 4th Floor - This exhibit is geared to exploring the strange, curious and odd peculiarities of the universe and our place within it. Discover the dynamic forces and systems that shape Earth and uncover the mysteries of the solar system. Experiences include computer-based interactives and visuals, such as images direct from the NASA Hubble Space Telescope, and hands-on stations that explore some strange and familiar phenomena. There is also a Virtusphere: a 10-foot hollow sphere that rotate freely in any direction based to the user's steps. 
*'''Crosby Observatory''' - 6th Floor - Florida's largest public refractor telescope as well as an array of smaller yet still powerful telescopes strategically placed for star gazing. The Crosby Observatory is open from 3-5pm for SunWatch on the first Saturday of each month, weather permitting, and from 5-9 on the first and third Saturday of the month, weather permitting (exhibit halls are closed during this time).

== Traveling Exhibits ==
The Science Center has a history of hosting traveling exhibits that are displayed for a few months at a time in different galleries.

== Theaters ==
The Science Center has two movie theaters that show both educational and Hollywood films as well as laser light shows. Check the Orlando Science Center website for a current list of movie show times.
*'''Dr. Phillips Cinedome''' - Featuring a giant screen measuring 8,000 square feet, the 300-seat Dr. Phillips CineDome projects films through a fisheye lens, creating an image that surrounds the audience and extends well beyond their peripheral vision. It uses the largest film format in the world, 10 times larger than a conventional film theater. It's commonly called 15/70, meaning 15 perforations (horizontally) on a 70&amp;nbsp;mm print.
*'''Digital Adventure Theater''' - One of the first museums to join a national effort with National Geographic,  the Science Center has special access to one of the world's largest giant-screen film libraries that includes award-winning films in 2D and 3D digital formats.

A '''planned unit development (PUD)''' is a type of building development and also a regulatory process. As a building development, it is a designed grouping of both varied and compatible [[land use]]s, such as [[house|housing]], [[recreation]], [[commerce|commercial]] centers, and [[industrial park]]s, all within one contained development or [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]].

==History==
The origins of PUDs in the new American communities can be traced to British movements during the 1950s. The developments in Britain's new communities dealt with the locations of [[industry|industrial]] elements and how they were publicly dictated before building ever began in order to uphold an [[economic base]]. However, in America, privately controlled communities often had to attract industry after the residential sectors had been built and occupied.

The oldest forms of the planned unit development in America appeared shortly after World War II in the [[Levittown]]s and [[Park Forest, Illinois|Park Forest]] developments, as whole communities within the limits and orbits of large metropolitan centers. The first zoning evidence of PUD was created by [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] in 1949. It "permit[ed] the development of a large tract of land as a complete neighborhood unit, having a range of dwelling types, the necessary local shopping facilities and off-street parking areas, parks, playgrounds, school sites, and other community facilities" (Burchell 43). Alexandria, Virginia, in 1952, as an amendment to its city code, provided for a "Community Unit Plan", with the intent to provide for planned community facilities and [[Urban open space|open space]] development with new residential building.  One of the first modern uses of the term "planned unit development" appears in San Francisco's code of ordinances in 1962.

==Current definitions==
PUD as a regulatory process is a means of land regulation which promotes large scale, unified land development by means of mid-range, realistic programs in chase of physically curable, social and economic deficiencies in land and cityscapes. Where appropriate, this development control promotes: 
*A mixture of both land uses and dwelling types with at least one of the land uses being regional in nature
*The clustering of residential land uses providing public and common open space
*Increased administrative discretion to a local professional planning staff while setting aside present land use regulations and rigid plat approval processes
*The enhancement of the bargaining process between the developer and government municipalities which in turn strengthens the municipality's site plan review and control over development for potentially increased profits due to land efficiency, multiple land uses, and increased residential densities.

Frequently, PUDs take on a variety of forms ranging from small clusters of houses combined with open spaces to new and developing towns with thousands of residents and various land uses. However, the definition of a PUD does not take into consideration these types of developments unless they fit into a category of size ranging from {{convert|100|to|200|acre}}. In a PUD the property owner owns the land the dwelling sits on.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Mixtures of land uses==
In PUDs, the zoning of districts becomes very different from what was standard under the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act|Standard Zoning Enabling Act]]. Historically, the districts were very narrow in type and large in area. Within PUDs, zoning becomes much more integrated with multiple land uses and districts being placed on adjacent land parcels.

Residential properties in PUDs are by far the most numerous and occupy the largest land areas. PUDs tend to incorporate single-family residential uses in proximity to two-family units and multiple-family dwellings to form a larger diversified neighborhood concept. Schools, churches, retirement homes, hospitals, and recreation facilities begin to find their way into residential districts. Residential districts also tend to use the best land in the community and the most favorable sites are protected from commercial and industrial uses.

Grouping shopping districts by service area is a first step in returning to the neighborhood concept. Land is reserved for regional, community, and local shopping clusters with some specific restrictions based on market experience and on what types of business intend to locate at each development. Local shopping districts with sufficient provisions for off-street parking, height restrictions, and traffic control are not frequently found surrounded by residential areas.

Industrial standards now help to reduce the journey for employees to work. Nowadays, there tends to be environmental and performance regulations that cut back on the amount of nuisance to surrounding areas adjacent to industrial districts. With sufficient setbacks, off-street parking, and height regulations, industrial locations adjacent to residential zones are usually looked to as an overall community goal. PUDs do not normally have large numbers of industrial districts, but if so, they tend to be geared more towards light industry.

A '''planned residential unit development (PRUD)''' (sometimes '''planned unit residential development (PURD))''' is a variant form of PUD where common areas are owned by the individual homeowners and not a [[homeowners association]] or other entity.  A PURD is considered the same as a PUD for planning commission purposes and allows for flexibility in zoning and civic planning.

=== Maintenance of common areas ===
In most PUDs, individual owners have full ownership of their homes and buildings, making them the responsible party for maintenance. Governing documents of homeowners associations within PUDs often delegate most of the maintenance responsibilities to the owners, assuming the least amount of responsibility possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOA Maintenance Responsibility in Condominiums and Planned Unit Developments|url=http://www.echo-ca.org/article/hoa-maintenance-responsibility-condominiums-and-planned-unit-developments |publisher=ECHO|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==

===Houses and placement of houses===
Houses in PUDs often include access to a large shared open space surrounding the house as well as a smaller private yard. These large protected open spaces are created by the layout of the buildings and are intended for use by all residents of the developments. Different housing types ([[Single-family detached home|single-family]], [[two-family]], [[multiple-family]]) are often mixed rather than separated as is done in conventional development

===Streets===
[[Street pattern]]s are one of the most important elements in establishing the neighborhood character of a residential community. Most non-PUD development focuses on obtaining maximum [[frontage]] for lot sizes and maximum flow of traffic on all streets. However, in order to dispel the monotony of the typical [[grid plan]] street pattern, PUDs often employ a [[street hierarchy|hierarchy of street types]] based on usage. Local streets serve only residences and have a low traffic volume, while collector streets connect [[local street]]s to arterials, which are the major routes of travel throughout a PUD.

===Sidewalks and pedestrian ways===
Sidewalks and pedestrian ways of PUDs supplement and complement street systems in establishing the character of the neighborhood. Sidewalks are located on at least one side of every street to enable the [[walkability]] of the developments. Circulation systems are provided to link residential groupings, open space areas, schools, and local shopping areas.

===Combining design features===
It is in the ability to design each of these components simultaneously that makes PUDs unique and effective. Each of the elements work together to enhance the whole. This represents a major advantage over traditional zoning practices that force lots to be planned in accordance with broad rules that may allow for some incompatibility.

[[Image:Red flag II.svg|thumb|[[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] associated with [[marxism]]]]
'''Political symbolism''' is symbolism that is used to represent a political standpoint.  The symbolism can occur in various media including [[banners]], [[acronyms]], [[pictures]], [[flags]], [[mottos]], and countless more. For example, [[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] have traditionally been flown by [[socialists]], [[left-wing]] radicals, and [[communist]] groups to represent the "blood of the workers". Black flags have traditionally been flown by [[anarchists|anarchism]], and [[left-wing]] radicals to represent the absence of all oppressive structures. A combination of the two colors in a black flag represents social anarchism, such as [[anarchist communism]] and [[anarcho syndicalism]].

Many groups use the [[political colour]] associated with their political philosophy, for example blue, particularly dark blue, is often associated with [[Conservative political parties|Conservative parties]].

Cultural groups may use symbols in what many consider to be a political way, for example [[LGBT symbols]] like the [[Rainbow flag]] are used to promote the political goal of [[LGBT]] rights.

A '''scroll''' (from the Old French ''escroe'' or ''escroue''), also known as a '''roll''', is a roll of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], or [[paper]] containing writing.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter. (2008) "scroll" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H9SWMK4U?url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/ |date=5 June 2013 }} Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A scroll is usually divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of [[writing material]]. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page. It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction ([[boustrophedon]]).

Some scrolls are simply rolled up pages; others may have wooden rollers on each end: [[Torah]] scrolls have rather elaborate rollers befitting their ceremonial function.

==History of scroll use==
{{Main|History of scrolls}}
{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''[[History of scrolls|volumen]]''}}{{See also|Roman Empire#Literacy, books, and education}}Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s. Parchment scrolls were used by the [[Israelites]] among others before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-innovations-that-built-ancient-rome|title=10 Innovations That Built Ancient Rome|author=|date=|website=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.

The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls.

==Rolls==
[[File:Parliamentary archives.jpg|thumb|right|Rolls recording UK [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Acts of Parliament]] held in the [[Parliamentary Archives]], [[Palace of Westminster]], London]]
Shorter pieces of [[parchment]] or [[paper]] are called ''rolls'' or ''[[Rotulus|rotuli]]'', although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use ''roll'' instead of ''scroll''. Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for [[manuscript]] administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60&amp;nbsp;cm or two feet wide.  Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.

A special Chinese form of short book, called the "whirlwind book," consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d|title=IDP Education - Bookbinding|author=|date=|website=idp.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
In [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the term ''scrow'' was used from about the 13th to the 17th centuries for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (''Rotulorum Clericus'') meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, 2008, "scrow".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement by the codex==
The Romans invented the ''codex'' form of the book, folding the scroll into pages which made reading and handling the document much easier. Legend has it that Julius Caesar was the first to fold scrolls, concertina-fashion, for dispatches to his forces campaigning in Gaul. Scrolls were awkward to read if a reader wished to consult material at opposite ends of the document. Further, scrolls were written only on one side, while both sides of the codex page were used. 

Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or "leaves," and bound together along one edge. The bound pages were protected by stiff covers, usually of wood enclosed with leather. ''Codex'' is Latin for a "block of wood": the Latin ''liber'', the root of "library," and the German ''Buch'', the source of "book," both refer to wood. The codex was not only easier to handle than the scroll, but it also fit conveniently on library shelves. The spine generally held the book's title, facing out, affording easier organization of the collection.

The term ''codex'' technically refers only to manuscript books-those that, at one time, were handwritten. More specifically, a codex is the term used primarily for a bound manuscript from Roman times up through the Middle Ages.

From the fourth century on, the codex became the standard format for books, and scrolls were no longer generally used. After the contents of a parchment scroll were copied in codex format, the scroll was seldom preserved. The majority that did survive were found by archaeologists in burial pits and in the buried trash of forgotten communities.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A.P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago, IL. Skyhorse Publishing. (p.27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent discovery==
The oldest complete Torah scroll was discovered stored in an academic library in Bolonia, Italy by Professor Mauro Perani in 2013. It had been mislabeled in 1889 as dating from the 17th century, but Perani suspected it was actually older as it was written in an earlier Babylonian script. Two tests conducted by laboratories at Italy’s University of Salento and at the University of Illinois confirmed that the scroll dates from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century. Ancient Torah scrolls are rare because when they are damaged they stop being used for liturgies and are buried. 

The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather. It is 36 meters long and 64 centimeters wide. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy Oldest complete scroll of Torah found in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075932/http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy |date=7 April 2014 }}.

==Modern technology ==
Modern technology may be able to assist in reading ancient scrolls. In January 2015, computer software may be making progress in reading 2,000-year-old Herculaneum scrolls, computer scientists report. After working for more than 10 years on unlocking the contents of damaged [[Herculaneum_papyri|Herculaneum scrolls]], researchers may be able to progress towards reading the scrolls, which cannot be physically opened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150122114405.htm Major breakthrough in reading ancient scrolls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123041620/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150122114405.htm |date=23 January 2015 }}, ''[[Science Daily]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex]] and the use of [[drug]]s (legal and illegal) have been linked throughout human history, encompassing all aspects of sex: [[desire]], [[performance improvement|performance]], [[pleasure]], [[fertilisation|conception]], [[gestation]], and [[disease]].

== Disinhibition ==
Drugs are frequently associated with reduced sexual inhibition, both when used voluntarily in social circumstances, and involuntarily, as in the case of some [[date rape drug]]s.

Because the use of drugs, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], is commonly presented as an excuse for risky or socially unacceptable behaviour, it is necessary to treat the idea of a direct causal relation between drug use and [[unsafe sex]] with caution.  Drugs may provide a socially acceptable excuse for engaging in sexual behaviours in which people may want to engage but perhaps feel that they should not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Race|first1=Kane|title=Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The Queer Politics of Drugs|date=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822390884|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVuU9KmotYC&amp;&amp;pg=PA176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual function ==
Some forms of sexual dysfunction such as [[erectile dysfunction]] can be treated with drugs. Because of their effects, erectile dysfunction drugs are sometimes used for recreational purposes.

Many [[drug]]s, both legal and illegal, some sold online, have side effects that affect the user's sexual function. Many drugs can cause [[loss of libido]] as a side effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=JR|last2=Ratamess|first2=NA|title=Medical issues associated with anabolic steroid use: are they exaggerated?|journal=Journal of sports science &amp; medicine|date=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=182-93|pmid=24259990|pmc=3827559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-male-enhancement-products-deliver-more-you-bargained-f1C8993189 | title = FDA: ‘Male enhancement’ products deliver more than you bargained for | publisher = NBC News | date  = 21 March 2013| accessdate = January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the partial cause of the [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] is the inhibition of [[dopamine]] by an orgasm-induced [[secretion]] of [[prolactin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such potent [[dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]]s as [[cabergoline]] may help achieve multiple [[orgasm]]s as well as the retention of sexual arousal for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, etal | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraception and abortion == 
Drug-based contraception has been available since the development of the [[contraceptive pill]]. As well as their contraceptive effects, contraceptive drugs can also have adverse sexual and reproductive side-effects. Prior to the availability of effective contraceptives, some substances were also used as [[abortifacient]]s to terminate pregnancy; [[medical abortion]] exists as a modern medical practice.

The '''short chronology''' is one of the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronologies of the Near Eastern Bronze and Early Iron Age]], which fixes the reign of [[Hammurabi]] to 1728–1686 BC and the [[Babylonia#The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology|sack of Babylon]] to 1531 BC.

The absolute [[2nd millennium BC]] dates resulting from this decision have very little support in academia, particularly after more recent research.  The ''[[middle chronology]]'' (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature and early twenty-first century [[dendrochronology]] has essentially disproved the short chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, S. W.; Kromer, B.; Kuniholm, P. I.; and Newton, M. W. 2001 Anatolian tree-rings and a new chronology for the east Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages. Science 294: 2532-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0157144#pone-0157144-g008 Sturt W. Manning ''et al.'', Integrated Tree-Ring-Radiocarbon High-Resolution Timeframe to Resolve Earlier Second Millennium BCE Mesopotamian Chronology, PlosONE July 13 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the period in question, middle chronology dates can be calculated by adding 64 years to the corresponding short chronology date (e.g. 1728 BC in short chronology corresponds to 1792 in middle chronology).

After the so-called "dark age" between the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, absolute dating becomes less uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1619055/Problems_of_Chronology_Mesopotamia_Anatolia_and_the_Syro-Levantine_Region], Schwartz, Glenn, 2008.

In Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C., edited by Joan Aruz, Kim Benzel, and Jean M. Evans: 450-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  While exact dates are still not agreed upon, the 64-year middle/short chronology dichotomy no longer applies from the beginning of the Third Babylon Dynasty onward.

==Early Bronze Age==
Estimation of absolute dates becomes possible for the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.
For the first half of the 3rd millennium, only very rough chronological matching of archaeological dates with written records is possible.

===Kings of Ebla===
{{Main|Ebla}}

The city-states of Ebla and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (in modern [[Syria]]) competed for power at this time. Eventually, under Irkab-Damu, Ebla defeated Mari for control of the region just in time to face the rise of [[Uruk]] and Akkad. After years of back and forth, Ebla was destroyed by the [[Akkadian Empire]]. Pottery seals of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Pepi I]] have been found in the wreckage of the city.

{{Further|Akkad (city){{!}}Akkad}}

Since Akkad (or Agade), the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]], has not yet been found, available chronological data comes from outlying locations like [[Ebla]], [[Tell Brak]], [[Nippur]], [[Susa]] and [[Tell Leilan]]. Clearly, the expansion of Akkad came under the rules of Sargon and Naram-sin. The last king of the empire, Shar-kali-sharri managed to mostly hold things together but upon his death, the empire fragmented. Finally, the city of Akkad itself was destroyed by the [[Guti (Mesopotamia)|Guti]].&lt;ref&gt;The Genesis and Collapse of Third Millennium North Mesopotamian Civilization, H.

First appearing in the area during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], the [[Gutium|Guti]] became a regional power after the decline of the [[Akkadian Empire]] following [[Shar-kali-sharri]]. The dynasty ends with the defeat of the last king, Tirigan, by [[Uruk]].

;Second Dynasty of Lagash
{{Further|Lagash}}

Following the collapse of the [[Akkadian Empire]] after [[Shar-kali-sharri]] of Akkad under pressure from the invading Gutians, Lagash gradually regained prominence. As a client state to the Gutian Kings, Lagash was extremely successful, peaking under the rule of Gudea. After the last Gutian king, [[Tirigan]], was defeated, by [[Utu-hengal]], Lagash came under the control of Ur under [[Ur-Namma]].&lt;ref&gt;Gudea and His Dynasty, Dietz Otto Edzard, 1997, University of Toronto Press {{ISBN|0-8020-4187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that there is some indication that the order of the last two rulers of Lagash should be reversed.

;Kings of Larsa
{{Further|Larsa}}

The chronology of the Kingdom of Larsa is based mainly on the Larsa King List (Larsa Dynastic List), the Larsa Date Lists, and a number of royal inscriptions and commercial records. The Larsa King List was compiled in [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Hammurabi]], conqueror of Larsa. It is suspected that the list elevated the first several [[Amorite]] [[Isin]]ite governors of Larsa to kingship so as to legitimize the rule of the Amorite Babylonians over Larsa. After a period of Babylonian occupation, Larsa briefly breaks free in a revolt ended by the death of the last king, Rim-Sin II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuneiform.ucla.edu/staff/fitz/dissertation.pdf The Rulers of Larsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306091227/http://cuneiform.ucla.edu/staff/fitz/dissertation.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }}, M.

;First Babylonian Dynasty (Dynasty I)
{{Main|First Babylonian Dynasty}}

Following the fall of the Ur III Dynasty, the resultant power vacuum was contested by [[Isin]] and [[Larsa]], with Babylon and [[Assyria]] later joining the fray. In the second half of the reign of [[Hammurabi]], [[Babylon]] became the preeminent power, a position it largely maintained until the sack by [[Mursili I]] in 1531 BC. Note that there are no contemporary accounts of the sack of Babylon. It is inferred from much later documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc20/kings.html Chronicle of early kings] at Livius.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fTelipinuProclamation.html The Proclamation of Telipinu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816012134/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FTelipinuProclamation.html |date=2012-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1st Sealand Dynasty (2nd Dynasty of Babylon)
{{Main|Sealand Dynasty}}

When the names of Sealand Dynasty kings were found on cuneiform records like the Babylonian Kings Lists, Chronicle 20, Chronicle of the Early Kings, and the Synchronistic King List, it was assumed that the dynasty slotted in between the [[First Dynasty of Babylon]] and the [[Kassites]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Kirk Grayson, Assyrian and Babylonian chronicles, Eisenbrauns, 2000 {{ISBN|1-57506-049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later discoveries changed this to the assumption that the dynasty ran entirely in parallel to the others. Modern scholarship has made it clear that the Sealand Dynasty did in fact control Babylon and the remnants of its empire for a time after its sack by the [[Hittites]] in 1531 BC.&lt;ref&gt;W. G.

;Hittite Old Kingdom
{{Main|Hittites}}

The absolute chronology of the Hittite Old Kingdom hinges entirely on the date of the sack of [[Babylon]]. In 1531 BC, for reasons that are still extremely unclear, Mursili I marched roughly 500 miles from [[Aleppo]] to Babylon, sacked it, and then promptly returned home, never to return. Other than that event, all the available [[chronological synchronism]]s are local to the region in and near [[Anatolia]].

The Middle Assyrian period (14th to 12th centuries)

;Third Babylon Dynasty (Kassite)
{{Main|Kassites}}
The [[Kassites]] first appeared during the reign of [[Samsu-iluna]] of the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] and after being defeated by [[Babylon]], moved to control the city-state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. Some undetermined amount of time after the fall of [[Babylon]], the Kassites established a new [[Babylonia]]n dynasty. The [[Babylonian king list]] identifies 36 kings reigning 576 years, however, only about 18 names are legible. A few more were identified by inscriptions. There is some confusion in the middle part of the dynasty because of conflicts between the [[Babylonian Chronicles|Synchronistic Chronicle]] and [[Babylonian Chronicles|Chronicle P]]. The later kings are well attested from ''[[kudurru]]'' [[stele]]s. Relative dating is from sychronisms with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Hittites]]. The dynasty ends with the defeat of [[Enlil-nadin-ahi]] by [[Elam]].&lt;ref&gt;The Collapse of a Complex State, A Reappraisal of the End of the First Dynasty of Babylon 1683–1597 B.C., Seth Richardson, dissertation, Columbia University, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materials for the Study of Kassite History, Vol. I (MSKH I) |author=J.

;Mitanni
{{Main|Mitanni}}
Perhaps because the capital of Mitanni, [[Washukanni]], has not yet been found, there are no available king lists, year lists, or royal inscriptions. Fortunately, a fair amount of diplomatic, [[Hittites|Hittite]], and [[Assyria]]n sources exist to firm up the chronology. Having become powerful under Shaushtatar, Mitanni eventually falls into the traditional trap of dynasties, the contest for succession. Tushratta and Artatama II both claim the kingship and the Hittites and Assyrians take advantage of the situation. After that, Mitanni was no longer a factor in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/pdf/6b%20Pharaoh%20and%20his%20Brothers.pdf Pharaoh and his Brothers], S Jakob&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'', Trevor Bryce, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25857-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Assyrian Middle Kingdom
{{Main|Assyria}}
Long a minor player, after the defeat of its neighbor [[Mitanni]] by the [[Hittites]], Assyria rises to the ranks of a major power under Ashur-uballit I. The period is marked by conflict with rivals [[Babylon]] and the [[Hittites]] as well as diplomatic exchanges with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], in the [[Amarna letters]]. Note that after the excavation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of various [[Neo-Assyrian]] documents, such as the [[Assyrian king list]], scholars assumed that the chronological data for earlier [[Assyria]]n periods could be taken as accurate history. That view has changed over the years and the early [[Assyria]]n chronology is being re-assessed. Since there is yet no consensus, the traditional order and regnal lengths will be followed.&lt;ref&gt;"Comments on the Nassouhi Kinglist and the Assyrian Kinglist Tradition," J.A.

;Hittite New Kingdom
{{Main|Hittites}}
Beginning under his father, Suppiluliuma I brought the Hittites from obscurity into an empire that lasts for almost 150 years. The Hittite New Kingdom reaches its height after the defeat of [[Mitanni]], an event which ironically leads to the rise of [[Assyria]]. The dynasty ends with the destruction of [[Hattusa]] by parties undetermined but which may have included the [[Sea People]] and the [[Kaskians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, T., [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/pdf/6a%20The%20Eternal%20Treaty.pdf 'The 'Eternal Treaty' from the Hittite perspective'], BMSAES 6 (2006), 1–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sürenhagen, D., [https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/6e%20Forerunners.pdf 'Forerunners of the Hattusili-Ramesses treaty'], BMSAES 6 (2006), 59–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hittite Studies in Honor of Harry A.

;Kings of Ugarit
{{Further|Ugarit}}
A client state of [[Mitanni]] and later the [[Hittites]], Ugarit was nonetheless a significant player in the region. While regnal lengths and an absolute chronology for Ugarit are not yet available, the known order of kings and some firm synchronisms make it reasonably placeable in time. The fall of Ugarit has been narrowed down to the range from the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Merneptah]] to the 8th year of [[Pharaoh]] [[Rameses III]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. This is roughly the same time that [[Hattusa]] is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Ugaritic Studies'', edited by Wilfred G. E.

==Iron Age==
{{Further|Neo-Hittite}}
The [[Early Iron Age]] (12th to 7th centuries BC). While not subject to the long versus short dating issue, chronology in the Ancient Near East is not on a firm footing until the rise of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian rulers in their respective regions. The dates, regnal lengths, and even the names of a number of rulers from that interim period are still unknown. To make matters worse, the few surviving records, such as the Synchronistic Chronicle, give conflicting data.&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Brinkman, ''A Political History of Post-Kassite Babylonia, 1158–722 B.C.'', Biblical Institute Press, 1968, {{ISBN|88-7653-243-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second Dynasty of Isin
{{Further|Kings of Babylon}}
After the fall of the [[Kassite dynasty]] of Babylon to [[Elam]], power
in the region, and control of Babylon, swung to the city-state of Isin. Assyria at this time was extremely weak, except during the reign of the powerful Assyrian ruler [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. Other polities in the area had yet to recover from the [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;A Poebel, "The Second Dynasty of Isin According to a New King-List Tablet," ''Assyriological Studies'' 15, Oriental Institute of Chicago, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

;Middle-Assyrian period
{{Further|Assyria}}
After the Middle Assyrian Kingdom there is an uncertain period in Assyrian history. The current cornerstone of chronology for this time is the Assyrian King List which, unfortunately, conflicts with other records such as the Synchronised King List and the Babylonian King List. In any event, the rulers of Assyria in this time were all fairly weak, except for Tiglath-Pileser I. Note too that this chronology is based on assumed synchronisms with Egypt in the previous period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21856">'''T-norm fuzzy logics''' are a family of [[non-classical logic]]s, informally delimited by having a [[semantics]] that takes the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] for the system of truth values and functions called [[t-norm]]s for permissible interpretations of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. They are mainly used in applied [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy set|fuzzy set theory]] as a theoretical basis for approximate reasoning.

T-norm fuzzy logics belong in broader classes of [[fuzzy logic]]s and [[many-valued logic]]s. In order to generate a well-behaved [[logical implication|implication]], the t-norms are usually required to be [[left-continuous]]; logics of left-continuous t-norms further belong in the class of [[substructural logic]]s, among which they are marked with the validity of the ''law of prelinearity'',  (''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''B'') &amp;or; (''B''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''A''). Both [[propositional logic|propositional]] and [[first-order logic|first-order]] (or [[higher-order logic|higher-order]]) t-norm fuzzy logics, as well as their expansions by [[Modal operator|modal]] and other operators, are studied. Logics that restrict the t-norm semantics to a subset of the real unit interval (for example, finitely valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]s) are usually included in the class as well.

Important examples of t-norm fuzzy logics are [[monoidal t-norm logic|monoidal t-norm logic MTL]] of all left-continuous t-norms, [[BL (logic)|basic logic BL]] of all continuous t-norms, [[product fuzzy logic]] of the product t-norm, or the [[nilpotent minimum logic]] of the nilpotent minimum t-norm. Some independently motivated logics belong among t-norm fuzzy logics, too, for example Łukasiewicz logic (which is the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) or [[intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (which is the logic of the minimum t-norm).

== Motivation ==

As members of the family of [[fuzzy logic]]s, t-norm fuzzy logics primarily aim at generalizing classical two-valued logic by admitting intermediary [[truth value]]s between 1 (truth) and 0 (falsity) representing ''degrees'' of truth of propositions. The degrees are assumed to be real numbers from the unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. In propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, [[propositional formula|propositional connectives]] are stipulated to be [[truth-functional]], that is, the truth value of a complex proposition formed by a propositional connective from some constituent propositions is a function (called the ''truth function'' of the connective) of the truth values of the constituent propositions. The truth functions operate on the set of truth degrees (in the standard semantics, on the [0,&amp;nbsp;1] interval); thus the truth function of an ''n''-ary propositional connective ''c'' is a function ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;: [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Truth functions generalize [[truth table]]s of propositional connectives known from classical logic to operate on the larger system of truth values.

T-norm fuzzy logics impose certain natural constraints on the truth function of [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]. The truth function &lt;math&gt;*\colon[0,1]^2\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of conjunction is assumed to satisfy the following conditions:
* ''Commutativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;x*y=y*x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' and ''y'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of fuzzy propositions is immaterial in conjunction, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Associativity'', that is, &lt;math&gt;(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that the order of performing conjunction is immaterial, even if intermediary truth degrees are admitted.
* ''Monotony'', that is, if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x*z \le y*z&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This expresses the assumption that increasing the truth degree of a conjunct should not decrease the truth degree of the conjunction.
* ''Neutrality of 1'', that is, &lt;math&gt;1*x = x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This assumption corresponds to regarding the truth degree 1 as full truth, conjunction with which does not decrease the truth value of the other conjunct. Together with the previous conditions this condition ensures that also &lt;math&gt;0*x = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], which corresponds to regarding the truth degree 0 as full falsity, conjunction with which is always fully false.
* ''Continuity'' of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (the previous conditions reduce this requirement to the continuity in either argument). Informally this expresses the assumption that microscopic changes of the truth degrees of conjuncts should not result in a macroscopic change of the truth degree of their conjunction. This condition, among other things, ensures a good behavior of (residual) implication derived from conjunction; to ensure the good behavior, however, ''left''-continuity (in either argument) of the function &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is sufficient.&lt;ref name="EG2001"&gt;Esteva &amp;amp; Godo (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In general t-norm fuzzy logics, therefore, only left-continuity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is required, which expresses the assumption that a microscopic ''decrease'' of the truth degree of a conjunct should not macroscopically decrease the truth degree of conjunction.

These assumptions make the truth function of conjunction a left-continuous [[t-norm]], which explains the name of the family of fuzzy logics (''t-norm based''). Particular logics of the family can make further assumptions about the behavior of conjunction (for example, [[Intermediate logic|Gödel logic]] requires its [[idempotence]]) or other connectives (for example, the logic IMTL requires the [[involution (mathematics)|involutiveness]] of negation).

All left-continuous t-norms &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; have a unique [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]], that is, a binary function &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; such that for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:&lt;math&gt;x*y\le z&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x\le y\Rightarrow z.&lt;/math&gt;
The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm can explicitly be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;(x\Rightarrow y)=\sup\{z\mid z*x\le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
This ensures that the residuum is the pointwise largest function such that for all ''x'' and ''y'',
:&lt;math&gt;x*(x\Rightarrow y)\le y.&lt;/math&gt;
The latter can be interpreted as a fuzzy version of the [[modus ponens]] rule of inference. The residuum of a left-continuous t-norm thus can be characterized as the weakest function that makes the fuzzy modus ponens valid, which makes it a suitable truth function for implication in fuzzy logic. Left-continuity of the t-norm is the necessary and sufficient condition for this relationship between a t-norm conjunction and its residual implication to hold.

Truth functions of further propositional connectives can be defined by means of the t-norm and its residuum, for instance the residual negation &lt;math&gt;\neg x=(x\Rightarrow 0)&lt;/math&gt; or bi-residual equivalence &lt;math&gt;x\Leftrightarrow y = (x\Rightarrow y)*(y\Rightarrow x).&lt;/math&gt; Truth functions of propositional connectives may also be introduced by additional definitions: the most usual ones are the minimum (which plays a role of another conjunctive connective), the maximum (which plays a role of a disjunctive connective), or the Baaz Delta operator, defined in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. In this way, a left-continuous t-norm, its residuum, and the truth functions of additional propositional connectives determine the truth values of complex propositional formulae in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Formulae that always evaluate to 1 are called ''tautologies'' with respect to the given left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; or ''&lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies.'' The set of all &lt;math&gt;*\mbox{-}&lt;/math&gt;tautologies is called the ''logic'' of the t-norm &lt;math&gt;*,&lt;/math&gt; as these formulae represent the laws of fuzzy logic (determined by the t-norm) which hold (to degree 1) regardless of the truth degrees of [[atomic formula]]e. Some formulae are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] with respect to a larger class of left-continuous t-norms; the set of such formulae is called the logic of the class. Important t-norm logics are the logics of particular t-norms or classes of t-norms, for example:
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|Łukasiewicz t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \max(x+y-1,0)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|minimum t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = \min(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Product fuzzy logic]] is the logic of the [[T-norm#Prominent examples|product t-norm]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = x\cdot y&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Monoidal t-norm logic]] MTL is the logic of (the class of) ''all'' left-continuous t-norms
* [[Basic fuzzy logic]] BL is the logic of (the class of) all ''continuous'' t-norms

It turns out that many logics of particular t-norms and classes of t-norms are axiomatizable. The completeness theorem of the axiomatic system with respect to the corresponding t-norm semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] is then called the ''standard completeness'' of the logic. Besides the standard real-valued semantics on [0,&amp;nbsp;1], the logics are sound and complete with respect to general algebraic semantics, formed by suitable classes of prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]]s.

== History ==

Some particular t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and investigated long before the family was recognized (even before the notions of [[fuzzy logic]] or [[t-norm]] emerged):
* [[Łukasiewicz logic]] (the logic of the Łukasiewicz t-norm) was originally defined by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1920) as a [[three-valued logic]];&lt;ref name="Luk1920"&gt;Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trojwartosciowej (Polish, On three-valued logic). Ruch filozoficzny '''5''':170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; it was later generalized to ''n''-valued (for all finite ''n'') as well as infinitely-many-valued variants, both propositional and first-order.&lt;ref name="Hay1963"&gt;Hay, L.S., 1963, Axiomatization of the infinite-valued predicate calculus. ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''28''':77–86.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]] (the logic of the minimum t-norm) was implicit in [[Gödel]]'s 1932 proof of infinite-valuedness of [[intuitionistic logic]].&lt;ref name="Goe1932"&gt;Gödel K., 1932, Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkül, ''Anzeiger Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien'' '''69''': 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Later (1959) it was explicitly studied by [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] who proved a completeness theorem for the logic.&lt;ref name="Dum1959"&gt;Dummett M., 1959, Propositional calculus with denumerable matrix, ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' '''27''': 97–106&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic study of particular t-norm fuzzy logics and their classes began with [[Petr Hájek|Hájek]]'s (1998) monograph ''Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic'', which presented the notion of the logic of a continuous t-norm, the logics of the three basic continuous t-norms (Łukasiewicz, Gödel, and product), and the 'basic' fuzzy logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] of all continuous t-norms (all of them both propositional and first-order). The book also started the investigation of fuzzy logics as non-classical logics with Hilbert-style calculi, algebraic semantics, and metamathematical properties known from other logics (completeness theorems, deduction theorems, complexity, etc.).

Since then, a plethora of t-norm fuzzy logics have been introduced and their metamathematical properties have been investigated. Some of the most important t-norm fuzzy logics were introduced in 2001, by Esteva and Godo ([[monoidal t-norm logic|MTL]], IMTL, SMTL, NM, WNM),&lt;ref name="EG2001" /&gt; Esteva, Godo, and Montagna (propositional ŁΠ),&lt;ref name="EGM2001"&gt;Esteva F., Godo L., &amp; Montagna F., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ logics: Two complete fuzzy systems joining Łukasiewicz and product logics, ''Archive for Mathematical Logic'' '''40''': 39–67.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cintula (first-order ŁΠ).&lt;ref name="Cin2001"&gt;Cintula P., 2001, The ŁΠ and ŁΠ½ propositional and predicate logics, ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''124''': 289–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical language ==

The logical vocabulary of [[propositional logic|propositional]] t-norm fuzzy logics standardly comprises the following connectives:
* '''Implication''' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ([[arity|binary]]). In the context of other than t-norm-based fuzzy logics, the t-norm-based implication is sometimes called '''residual implication''' or '''R-implication''', as its standard semantics is the [[t-norm#Residuum|residuum]] of the [[t-norm]] that realizes strong conjunction.
* '''Strong conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\And&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics, the sign &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and the names ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel conjunction'' are often used for strong conjunction.
* '''Weak conjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice conjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] in algebraic semantics). In the context of substructural logics, the names ''additive'', ''extensional'', or ''comparative conjunction'' are sometimes used for lattice conjunction. In the logic [[BL (logic)|BL]] and its extensions (though not in t-norm logics in general), weak conjunction is definable in terms of implication and strong conjunction, by
::&lt;math&gt;A\wedge B \equiv A \mathbin{\And} (A \rightarrow B).&lt;/math&gt;
:The presence of two conjunction connectives is a common feature of contraction-free [[substructural logic]]s.
* '''Bottom''' &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[nullary]]); &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt; are common alternative signs and '''zero''' a common alternative name for the propositional constant (as the constants bottom and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''falsity'' or ''absurdum'' and corresponds to the classical truth value ''false''.
* '''Negation''' &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; ([[unary operation|unary]]), sometimes called '''residual negation''' if other negation connectives are considered, as it is defined from the residual implication by the reductio ad absurdum:
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A \equiv A \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Equivalence''' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (binary), defined as
::&lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B \equiv (A \rightarrow B) \wedge (B \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
: In t-norm logics, the definition is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \mathbin{\And} (B \rightarrow A).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''(Weak) disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; (binary), also called '''lattice disjunction''' (as it is always realized by the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] operation of [[join (mathematics)|join]] in algebraic semantics). In t-norm logics it is definable in terms of other connectives as
::&lt;math&gt;A \vee B \equiv ((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow B) \wedge ((B \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Top''' &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; (nullary), also called '''one''' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\overline{1}&lt;/math&gt; (as the constants top and zero of substructural logics coincide in t-norm fuzzy logics). The proposition &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the classical truth value ''true'' and can in t-norm logics be defined as
::&lt;math&gt;\top \equiv \bot \rightarrow \bot.&lt;/math&gt;

Some propositional t-norm logics add further propositional connectives to the above language, most often the following ones:
* The '''Delta''' connective &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; is a unary connective that asserts classical truth of a proposition, as the formulae of the form &lt;math&gt;\triangle A&lt;/math&gt; behave as in classical logic. Also called the '''Baaz Delta''', as it was first used by Matthias Baaz for [[Intermediate logic|Gödel–Dummett logic]].&lt;ref name="Baa96"&gt;Baaz M., 1996, Infinite-valued Gödel logic with 0-1-projections and relativisations. In P. Hájek (ed.), ''Gödel'96: Logical Foundations of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics'', Springer, ''Lecture Notes in Logic'' '''6''': 23–33&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of a t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by the Delta connective is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\triangle}.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Truth constants''' are nullary connectives representing particular truth values between 0 and 1 in the standard real-valued semantics. For the real number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding truth constant is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{r}.&lt;/math&gt; Most often, the truth constants for all rational numbers are added. The system of all truth constants in the language is supposed to satisfy the ''bookkeeping axioms'':&lt;ref name="Haj98"&gt;Hájek (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{r \mathbin{\And} s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\And} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\overline{r \rightarrow s} \leftrightarrow (\overline{r} \mathbin{\rightarrow} \overline{s}),&lt;/math&gt; etc. for all propositional connectives and all truth constants definable in the language.
* '''Involutive negation''' &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; (unary) can be added as an additional negation to t-norm logics whose residual negation is not itself [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]], that is, if it does not obey the law of double negation &lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A \leftrightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;. A t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; expanded with involutive negation is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L_{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; and called ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution''.
* '''Strong disjunction''' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; (binary). In the context of substructural logics it is also called ''group'', ''intensional'', ''multiplicative'', or ''parallel disjunction''. Even though standard in contraction-free substructural logics, in t-norm fuzzy logics it is usually used only in the presence of involutive negation, which makes it definable (and so axiomatizable) by de Morgan's law from strong conjunction:
::&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B \equiv \mathrm{\sim}(\mathrm{\sim}A \mathbin{\And} \mathrm{\sim}B).&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Additional t-norm conjunctions and residual implications'''. Some expressively strong t-norm logics, for instance the logic [[ŁΠ]], have more than one strong conjunction or residual implication in their language. In the standard real-valued semantics, all such strong conjunctions are realized by different t-norms and the residual implications by their residua.

[[Well-formed formula]]e of propositional t-norm logics are defined from [[propositional variable]]s (usually [[countable|countably]] many) by the above logical connectives, as usual in [[propositional logic]]s. In order to save parentheses, it is common to use the following order of precedence:
* Unary connectives (bind most closely)
* Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence
* Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely)

First-order variants of t-norm logics employ the usual logical language of [[first-order logic]] with the above propositional connectives and the following [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s:
* '''General quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Existential quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;
The first-order variant of a propositional t-norm logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;L\forall.&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

[[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|Algebraic semantics]] is predominantly used for propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, with three main classes of [[algebraic structure|algebras]] with respect to which a t-norm fuzzy logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[completeness (logic)|complete]]:
* '''General semantics''', formed of all ''&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'' — that is, all algebras for which the logic is [[Soundness theorem|sound]].
* '''Linear semantics''', formed of all ''linear'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose [[lattice (order)|lattice]] order is [[total order|linear]].
* '''Standard semantics''', formed of all ''standard'' &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras — that is, all &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] with the usual order. In standard &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras, the interpretation of strong conjunction is a left-continuous [[t-norm]] and the interpretation of most propositional connectives is determined by the t-norm (hence the names ''t-norm-based logics'' and ''t-norm &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras'', which is also used for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;-algebras on the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1]). In t-norm logics with additional connectives, however, the real-valued interpretation of the additional connectives may be restricted by further conditions for the t-norm algebra to be called standard: for example, in standard &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras of the logic &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with involution, the interpretation of the additional involutive negation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is required to be the ''standard involution'' &lt;math&gt;f_\sim(x)=1-x,&lt;/math&gt; rather than other involutions which can also interpret &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; over t-norm &lt;math&gt;L_\sim&lt;/math&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="FM2006"&gt;Flaminio &amp; Marchioni (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In general, therefore, the definition of standard t-norm algebras has to be explicitly given for t-norm logics with additional connectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">'''TIMIT''' is a corpus of phonemically and lexically transcribed speech of [[American English]] speakers of different sexes and dialects.  Each transcribed element has been delineated in time.

TIMIT was designed to further acoustic-phonetic knowledge and automatic speech recognition systems.  It was commissioned by [[DARPA]] and corpus design was a joint effort between the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[SRI International]], and [[Texas Instruments]] (TI). The speech was recorded at TI, transcribed at MIT, and verified and prepared for publishing by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Information School''' or '''iSchool''' of the [[University of Sheffield]], in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]], was founded in 1963 as the University's '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship''' and became in 2010 the first UK [[iSchool]]. Other names were the '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship and Information Science''' ('''PGSLIS''', 1967-81) and '''Department of Information Studies''' (1981-2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iSchool Timeline|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/about/history.html|work=University of Sheffield: Information School|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, it employs 28 academic staff, 12 administrative/support staff, 7 affiliated research staff, and has about 50 research students. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath.

The department opened in 1964 as a library school, becoming only the second university-based department in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016555158901500402 |last=Saunders |first=W. |year=1989|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5| pages = 193–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, like many [[information science]] departments it has grown to encompass teaching and research in [[cheminformatics]], educational informatics, [[health informatics]], [[information retrieval]], [[information systems]], knowledge and information management, as well as libraries and information society. Such is the status of the school, that it has twice been honoured with a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Information Science]]'' devoted entirely to the department, its staff and its research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1989 | journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol15/issue4-5/|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003|title=Special Issue, 40 years of the Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=29 |issue=4|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol29/issue4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research achievements==
The school has ranked highest or joint highest in its subject rating in every [[Research Assessment Exercise]] since the running of the first exercise in 1986. In this UK-government sponsored assessment of research outputs, no other department in its subject field (or its [[University of Sheffield|University]]) achieved this consistency; few departments of any subject area in UK universities managed such a high level of continuous research output (see the following links to the 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1992/c26_92t64.html |title=UFC 26/92 - RAE92: The Outcome Table 64 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1996/1_96/t61.html |title=1996 RAE - Unit of Assessment: 61 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/results/byuoa/uoa61.htm |title=Results : 2001 Research Assessment Exercise : Unit of Assessment : 61 Library and Information Management |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAE results). In 2008, rankings of departments was left to news organizations; the [[Times Higher Education]] placed Sheffield at No. 1 again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/Journals/THE/THE/18_December_2008/attachments/RAE_2008_THE_RESULTS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Times Higher Education Table of Excellence |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an analysis of citations showed four of the ten most cited UK information studies academics were working in the Sheffield department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.20771 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4579/ |last=Sanderson |first=M. | year=2008 | title=Revisiting h measured on UK LIS and IR academics| journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST) |volume=59 |issue=7| pages=1184–1190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first UK-based (and 2nd European) department to be become an [[i-school|iSchool]].
