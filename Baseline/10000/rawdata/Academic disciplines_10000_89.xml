In the realm of [[application security]], the term '''Application Portfolio Attack Surface''' or APAS, refers to the collective risk to an [[organization]] posed by the sum total of the security vulnerabilities found within the set of all mission critical systems or [[software]] run by the organization or enterprise.&lt;ref name="AppScan Tools and Tricks"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9532">'''Botanical Latin''' is a technical language based on [[New Latin]], used for descriptions of [[botanical]] [[taxon|taxa]]. Until 2012, [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] mandated Botanical Latin to be used for the descriptions of most new taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Article 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still the only language other than English accepted for descriptions. The [[Botanical name|names]] of organisms governed by the Code also have forms based on Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Principle V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical Latin is primarily a written language. It includes taxon names derived from any language or even arbitrarily derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|e.g., articles 20 and 23.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently there is no single consistent pronunciation system. When speakers of different languages use Botanical Latin in speech, they use pronunciations influenced by their own languages, or, notably in French, there may be variant spellings based on the Latin. There are at least two pronunciation systems used for Latin by English speakers. All of these systems, however, will inevitably be unsustainable across the spectrum of botanical names.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|chapter=Pronunciation|p. 51–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] described the language in 1880:
&lt;blockquote&gt;C'est le latin arrangé par Linné à l'usage des descriptions et, j'oserai dire, à l'usage de ceux qui n'aiment ni les complications grammaticales, ni les phrases disposées sens desus dessous." (Quoted by W. T. Stearn&lt;ref name=Stearn1&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [It is the Latin chosen by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] for the purpose of descriptions, and, I dare to say, for the use of those who love neither grammatical complications nor phrases arranged with senses on top of one another.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Candolle estimated that to learn Botanical Latin would take three months' work for an English speaker not already familiar with any language of Latin origin, and one month for an Italian.&lt;ref name=Stearn1/&gt;

[[William T. Stearn]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|p. 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Botanical Latin is best described as a modern Romance language of special technical application, derived from [[Renaissance Latin]] with much plundering of ancient Greek, which has evolved, mainly since 1700 and primarily through the work of Carl Linnaeus (1707–78), to serve as an international medium for the scientific naming of plants in all their vast numbers and manifold diversity. These include many thousands of plants unknown to the Greeks and Romans of classical times and for which names have had to be provided as a means of reference. Their description necessitates the recording of structures often too small for comprehension by the naked eye, hence unknown to the ancients and needing words with precise restricted applications foreign to [[classical Latin]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Orthography of taxon names==
Latin names of organisms are generally used in English without alteration, but some informal derivatives are used as common names. For example, the -''idae'' ending of [[class (biology)|subclass]] names is changed to -ids (e.g., ''[[Rosidae]]'' produces rosids); the [[subfamily]] ending -''oideae'' is changed to -oids (e.g., ''[[Papilionoideae]]'' produces papilionoids). The -ids common names have, however also been adopted as rankless [[clade]] names, sometimes containing further -ids clade names, so that, for example, in the APG IV classification, rosids contain both fabids and malvids.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2016 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG IV |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=181 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.1111/boj.12385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Side box
|above=In French wikipedia
|text=[[:fr:Francisation des termes en latin scientifique|''Francisation des termes en latin scientifique'']]
}}
More extensive modifications to the spelling and pronunciation are routinely used in some other languages. French organism names are usually [[Francization|gallicized]]. For example: ''[[Chlorophyceae]]'' becomes Chlorophycées; ''Portulacineae'' becomes Portulacinées.

===Alphabet===
The Classical Latin alphabet consisted of 21 letters, to which w, y, and z were later added, and the vowel/consonant pairs i and j, u and v, were later separated. This 26-letter alphabet is used for taxon names in Botanical Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|chapter=Pronunciation|p. 49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Article 60.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diacritic]]s are not used in names, and a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|dieresis]] is considered an optional mark that does not affect spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2011|ref=ICN2011|Article 60.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English pronunciation==
Some English speakers, and some speakers of other languages, use the reconstructed pronunciation guide for [[Latin#Phonology|Classical Latin]] when speaking Botanical Latin.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt; Latin names pronounced by gardeners and English botanists usually follow a system close to English.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt; It differs greatly from Classical pronunciation, and also from [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] pronunciation (which is based on Italian, and has, for example, ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' pronounced as ''ch'').&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt;

Every vowel is pronounced, except diphthongs, which are treated as single long vowels.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In classical Latin words of several syllables the stress falls on the syllable next to the last one (the penultimate) when this syllable is long ... e.g., ''for-mō'-sus'', or when two consonants separate the two last vowels, e.g., ''cru-ěn'-tus'' ... on the last syllable but two (the antepenultimate) when the last but one is short, e.g. ''flō-ri-dus''.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"These rules cannot satisfactorily be applied to all generic names and specific epithets commemorating persons. About 80 per cent of generic names and 30 per cent of specific epithets come from languages other than Latin and Greek. A simple and consistent method of pronouncing them does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Stearn 1992|ref=Stearn|chapter=Pronunciation|p. 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rules also create difficulties with the -''ii'' and -''iae'' endings derived from personal names, because the stress falls in a place that is not usual for those names.

===Traditional English pronunciation===

The following table is simplified from Stearn 1992.&lt;ref name=Pronunciation/&gt; The pronunciation transcriptions for medical terminology in major medical dictionaries, such as ''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary]]'' and ''[[Stedman's Medical Dictionary]]'', match these values.

A '''cement bond log''' documents the evaluation of the integrity of [[cement]] work performed on an [[oil well]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=cement%20bond%20log|title=cement bond log|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of drilling and completing a well, cement is injected through the [[wellbore]] and rises up the [[Annulus (well)|annulus]] between the steel [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] and the [[Geological formation|formation]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=casing|title=casing|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sonic tool is typically run on [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] by a service company that detects the bond of the cement to the casing and formation via a principle based on [[resonance]]. Casing that is not bound has a higher resonant vibration than that which is bound, causing the imparted energy from the sonic signal to be transferred to the formation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} In this sense, the [[amplitude]] of the [[waveform]] received is the basic measurement that is evaluated.

The data is collected by the tool and recorded on a log which is used by the oil producing company as an indicator of [[zonal isolation]] in the well. There are production reasons and legal reasons (governed by a petroleum regulatory body in each individual state) that dictate the well must have specific areas of isolation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

'''Universidad Autónoma Chapingo''' (Chapingo Autonomous University) is an agricultural college located in [[Texcoco, Mexico State]] in Mexico. The university is a federally funded public institution of higher education. It offers technical and full bachelor's degrees as well as having scientific and technological research programs. Many of these programs are related to agriculture, forestry and fishing.&lt;ref name="uach"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=universidad |title=Rectoría |publisher=Universidad Autonoma de Chapingo |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109102242/http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=universidad |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school began as the Escuela Nacional de Agricultura (National School of Agriculture) which was founded in 1854 at the Monastery of San Jacinto in Mexico City. The school was moved in 1923 to the President [[Álvaro Obregón]]&lt;ref name="historiauac"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=historia |title=Historia |publisher=Universidad Autonoma de Chapingo |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906131307/http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=historia |archivedate=2009-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="novo140"&gt;{{cite book |title= The State of Mexico |last=Novo |first=Gerardo |author2=Jorge de la Luz |year=2002 |publisher= Ediciones Nueva Guia SA de CV |location= Madrid |isbn=968-5437-26-2  |page=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ex Hacienda of Chapingo.  Postgraduate studies were added in 1959. The school received autonomous status in 1978. It offers courses of study in Forestry, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Industries, Irrigation, Rural Sociology and more.&lt;ref name="historiauac"/&gt;

The main attraction for visitors at this school is its murals. In the old hacienda chapel, which is now the University Ceremonies Room is a mural by [[Diego Rivera]] called “Tierra Fecundada” (Fertile Land). This work was begun in 1924 and completed in 1927. Covering an area of over 700m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the work divides into three parts. The left panel depicts man’s struggle to have land, the right panel shows the evolution of Mother Nature and the center shows the communion between man and earth. It is considered to be one of Rivera’s best works.&lt;ref name="novo140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atractivos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texcoco.gob.mx/ciudad_atractivos_culturales_economicos |title=Ciudad / Atractivos turísticos y culturales |publisher=Municipality of Texcoco |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=City: Tourist and cultural attractions |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100103015303/http://www.texcoco.gob.mx/ciudad_atractivos_culturales_economicos |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the school acquired an unnamed mural by [[Luis Nishizawa]]. This work was produced during his last year at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas (ENAP) of [[UNAM]] and depicts the agriculture of Mexico in both the past and the present. The work is six meters high, nine meters wide and in the form of a triangle. It is placed in a building that is commonly called “El Partenon.”&lt;ref name="lvalos"&gt;{{cite news |title= Llevan mural a Chapingo |first= Leopoldo |last=Avalos |newspaper=Reforma  |location= Mexico City  |date=2006-02-16 |page= 14 |language=Spanish |trans-title= Bringing mural to Chapingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The school is also home to the '''National Museum of Agriculture'''. The 2,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; facility presents the development of agriculture in Mexico from the pre-Hispanic past to the present day. The collection has about 4,000 objects relating to technology, agronomy including farming implements and photographs by Hanz Gutmann.&lt;ref name="musnatag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/2842-Museo-Nacional-de-Agricultura-de-la-Universidad-Aut%F3noma-de-Chapingo-%28Estado-de-M%E9xico%29 |title=Museo Nacional de Agricultura de la Universidad Autónoma de Chapingo (Estado de México) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The National Museum of Agriculture of the Autonomous University of Chapingo |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clothing fetishism''' or '''garment fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetish]] that revolves around a fixation upon a particular article or type of [[clothing]], a collection of garments that appear as part of a fashion or uniform, or a person dressed in such a garment.

The clinical definition of a sexual fetish would require that a person be fixated on a specific garment to the extent that it exists as a recurrent (or exclusive) stimulus for sexual gratification.&lt;ref&gt;Masters WH, Johnson VE, Kolodny RC: ''Human sexuality'', 5th ed. New York: Harper Collins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Silva WP |title=ABC of sexual health. Sexual variations |journal=BMJ |volume=318 |issue=7184 |pages=654–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10066212 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/318/7184/654.pdf | format=PDF |pmc=1115095 |doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7184.654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One who exhibits a clothing fetish may be aroused by the sight of a person wearing a particular garment, or by wearing the garment oneself which can be because of the look one achieves by wearing it or the way it feels while it is being worn (and might also get some arousal by seeing somebody in it and imagining how it feels). In later case arousal may originate from the way its fabric feels (see [[#By fabric type|clothing fetish by fabric type]]) or from the way the garment feels and functions as whole ([[#Restrictive clothing|restrictive clothing]] being an example).

Others with a clothing fetish may be aroused by the sight of such garments, even without wearing them and in the absence of other person wearing them, and may also derive pleasure from collecting them.

==Relative prevalence of garment fetishism==
[[File:Dasha Astafieva at One Sunset, West Hollywood.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Playboy Playmate]] [[Dasha Astafieva]] wearing a [[see-through clothing|see-through]] [[fishnet]] dress without any [[undergarments]], poses for photographers at a [[Playboy]] party in USA, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/hugh-hefner-gal-pal-dasha-astafieva-bares-playboy-red-carpet-article-1.357435|title=Hugh Hefner gal pal Dasha Astafieva bares all on Playboy red carpet|work=NY Daily News|author=Lauren Johnston|date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In order to determine the relative prevalence of different fetishes, researchers at the [[University of Bologna]] obtained a sample of at least 5000 individuals worldwide from 381 Internet discussion groups. The relative prevalences were estimated based on (a) the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. The top garment fetish was clothes worn on the legs or buttocks (such as stockings or skirts), followed by footwear, underwear, whole-body wear (such as [[costume]]s and coats), and upper-body wear (such as jackets or waistcoats).&lt;ref name="scorolli"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scorolli C, Ghirlanda S, Enquist M, Zattoni S, Jannini EA |title=Relative prevalence of different fetishes |journal=Int. J. Impot. Res. |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=432–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17304204 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901547 | url = http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v19/n4/full/3901547a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By garment type==
Although almost any type of garment in theory can be the subject of a fetish, common clothing fetishes include footwear, female [[underwear]] and [[uniform]]s. A wide range of other garments have been the subject of less common fetishes.

Separate from fetishes as a paraphilia are garments worn to enhance appearance, such as tight jeans or other eye-catching clothing. The difference is whether, for the person concerned, the clothing is the focus of a sexual fetish, or is merely appreciated and found pleasing.

===Restrictive clothing===
Clothing that limits the wearer's movement is commonly used for this property, particularly among [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] enthusiasts and it has common appearance in bondage-related [[fetish fashion]]. Such restrictive fashion, among others, includes [[corset]]s, [[Collar (BDSM)|collar]]s, and [[hobble skirt]]s. As many restrictive items of clothing belong to women's fashion, male restrictive clothing fetishists can have problems in obtaining and using such items without being labeled as [[transvestite]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Corsets====
{{See also|Corset#Fetish|Tightlacing}}
The [[training corset]] and [[bondage corset]] has also become a staple in fetish wear, particularly among professional dominants. A [[submissive]] or slave may also be forced to wear a tightly laced corset as a form of punishment or simply restriction. And the masochistic practice known as [[tightlacing]] creates a particular type of pleasure for the wearer. In the 1980s, pop music performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] reintroduced and popularized the corset as a daring example of [[underwear as outerwear]]. This influence continues to the present day in both fetish and mainstream fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hobble skirts====
[[File:Open-Bottom-Girdle-RHT-Stockings-small.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Lingerie Model wearing full-fashioned stockings, with an open-bottom [[girdle]], see-through [[panties]], and [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]].]]
A [[hobble skirt]] is a long, tight skirt, extending below the knees and often ankle length, which is so tight that it is difficult to walk in. When used as fetish clothing, it is often made of [[latex]] or [[PVC]] and sometimes [[corset]]ed, to increase the restriction.

Such skirts were briefly a mainstream fashion in the 1910s; however, they were soon abandoned as impractical. They were revived in the 1950s by [[John Willie]] and others as a bondage/fetish style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbleskirt.com/About.aspx|title=Custom Hobble Skirts|publisher=|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockings and socks===
Stocking fetishists usually find sexual partners clothed in sheer nylon or silk stockings to be sexually stimulating, or find the act of a person donning or removing a pair of stockings arousing. Some men find it arousing to collect and wear stockings, sometimes hidden under a pair of trousers.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, David (2004). ''Fashion and Fetishism''. Sutton. {{ISBN|0-7509-3808-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Foot fetishism|feet]] and [[Shoe fetishism|shoes]], sock fetishists often require some specific attraction in the object which may include particular styles or knit patterns. People with a fetish for socks may have no special attraction to feet or shoes. Some speculate that the strong attraction some men exhibit to the smell of socks worn by women may be an example of the existence of human pheromones – the hypothesis being that the sweat from women's feet may contain chemical attractants that arouse a male subject and that when a male subject is exposed to the smell of women's feet or footwear at a young age that young man may carry a strong psycho-chemical imprint which motivates his enthusiasm for worn socks or shoes later in life.

Many male sock fetishists are also highly specific regarding the nature of the socks that stimulate them, and this may be a product of exposure to particular types of clothing during the teenage years. This belief is supported by observations that the nature of sock fetishism appears to differentiate according to age brackets and periods of clothing trends. Among men who exhibit an interest in women's socks who were in their early pubescent period during the late 1980s/early 1990s when slouch socks were a popular clothing trend, there is a tendency to exhibit a strong interest in very heavy slouchy socks, whereas younger men with a sock fetish tend to show greater interest in the short ankle-style socks that became popular in later years.  There is also a regional trend in sock fetishes, with men who spent their teenage years living in northern climates exhibiting a strong interest in heavy wool socks.

===Sneakers===
Sneaker fetishism is another specific form of [[shoe fetishism]] and like [[boot fetishism]] it can be accompanied by a fetish for the material from which it is made for example the rubber which the [[Shoe#Outsole|outsole]] and sidewall are made of can be a source of [[rubber fetishism]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Swimwear ===
{{Main|spandex fetishism}}
Swimwear fetishism is a sexual fetish relating to swimwear. It can also involve printed or electronic material with swimwear being worn.

===Jackets and coats===
Jacket fetishism is usually associated with the fixation or attraction to padded nylon jackets – though it can also be associated with leather jackets, particularly in association with [[Bondage (BDSM)]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In a survey, researchers at the University of Bologna found that 9% of members of online fetish groups were in groups related to upper-body wear such as jackets.&lt;ref name="scorolli" /&gt;

===Jeans===

The style and cut of jeans can also enhance their sexual appeal to fetishists of either gender. Jeans without pockets on the back are sometimes viewed as showing off one's buttocks and therefore more flattering. Stretch jeans are often viewed as attractive because they have the appearance of being skin tight, while not binding like regular denim jeans would. An example of fetish denim would be "Zip Around Jeans", so called because their zipper unzips starting in the front and continues all the way to the back. Other popular styles include the lace up jean and multi button style jeans.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Crop Tops (Half-Shirts)===

[[Crop top]]s are particularly appealing to [[Navel fetishism|navel fetishists]] since exposure of the [[navel]] is accentuated by the bared midriff characteristic of such garments.  In so doing, the crop-top can highlight [[navel piercings]], which have become popular.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Gender-related clothes==
Fetishism may include various garments typically worn by or associated with a particular gender or gender expression. For example, this could describe an individual who is attracted to people wearing masculine-associated clothing items, like [[gym shorts|basketball shorts]] or a [[Suit (clothing)#Suit etiquette for men|man's suit]]. Certain gender-related elements of clothes could be the source of a fetish, include [[lace]], [[ruffle]]s, [[floral]] print, [[embroidery]], [[back closure]]s, or various colors (such as [[mauve]] and pink).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Uniforms==
{{Main|Uniform fetishism}}
Among the most common uniforms in uniform fetish are those of a doctor, schoolgirl, police officer, nurse, [[French maid]], sports player, waitress, cheerleader and [[Playboy Bunny]]. Some people also regard [[nun]]s' [[religious habit|habits]] or even [[apron]]s as uniforms. Sometimes, a uniform may be used appropriate to what is being done. For example, someone may wear a nurse's uniform to administer an [[enema]], a police uniform to handcuff and cage someone, or two equals dress as inmates for [[cell mate]] on cell mate activities in a prison setting or as submissive to a third (guard) player. This may add a sense of authenticity to the game play.&lt;ref name="isbn0894790110"&gt;The Visual Dictionary of Sex, Dr. Eric J Trimmer (editor), {{ISBN|0-89479-011-0}}; A &amp; W Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==By fabric type==

===Fur===

[[File:Titian - Venus with a Mirror - Google Art Project.jpg |thumb|Venus with a Mirror, by [[Tiziano Vecellio]] (circa 1555) inspired [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]´s novel Venus im Pelz ([[Venus in Furs]])]]
Fur fetishism refers to the [[sexual fetishism]] that revolves around people wearing fur, or in certain cases, to the garments themselves.

These materials may be fetishised because the garment acts as a fetishistic [[wiktionary:surrogate|surrogate]] or [[second skin (fetishism)|second skin]] for the wearer's own skin. The material may be regarded as providing a [[superstimulus]] that is more intense than the normal response associated with real skin. This is heightened by the fact that the [[fur]] was originally an animal's skin and hair.

The most famous, and one of the earliest depictions of the topic was the semi-autobiographical novel [[Venus in Furs]] (1870) by [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]]. After the novel's success, Sacher-Masoch apparently decided to take on a fetish [[sadomasochism]]-lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Written in the flesh: a history of desire. Author: Edward Shorter. Editor: University of Toronto Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8020-3843-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-3843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1884, he had sent a copy of the novel to [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], who gave Sacher-Masoch immortality when, in 1891 he used this ancient [[Austrian nobility]] name as an [[eponym]] for what today is called [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoming]].

===Leather===
{{Main|Leather subculture}}
Leather fetishism is the name popularly used to describe a sexual attraction to people wearing leather and or to the garments themselves. The smell and the sound of leather is often an erotic stimulus for people with a leather fetish. Leather uniforms may also become a fetish. Leather is occasionally finished with a glossy surface and produced in bright colors, providing visual stimuli for some leather fetishists.

The feel of tight leather garments worn may be experienced as a form of [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. Some [[bondage equipment]] is made from leather straps. The term "[[leather culture]]" was applied in the 1960s in the USA gay [[sadomasochistic]] [[subculture]] as an umbrella term for alternative sexual practices. The [[pony]] fetish involves the use of equestrian like gear fitted to humans.

===Latex/PVC===
[[File:Black Latex Catsuit 777.jpg|thumb|200px|A woman wearing a black [[latex]] fetish catsuit and [[thigh-high boots]].]][[File:Fetish clothing - blue PVC shorts and top 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman wearing blue [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] shorts and top]]
{{Main|latex and PVC fetishism}}
Latex fetish is the [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to [[latex clothing]] or garments and sometimes called rubber fetishism as latex is a type of rubber. Latex or rubber fetishists may refer to themselves as "Rubberists". Varieties of latex fetishism include [[body inflation]] and attraction to transparent rubber. Latex fetishism includes wearing clothing made from latex, observing it worn by others, and enjoyment of erotic fantasies featuring latex garments, catsuits, hoods, [[underwater diving|divers]] or industrial protective clothing. A common latex fetish icon is the [[dominatrix]] wearing a skin-tight glossy black latex or PVC [[catsuit]].

PVC fetishism is often closely associated with latex fetishism even though the two materials are very different. PVC fetishism involves an erotic attraction to shiny plastic clothes made from [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), polyurathane or similar man made materials. PVC may be mistaken for shiny [[patent leather]]. PVC fetishism also includes an erotic attraction to clothing such as clear plastic raincoats, [[slipcover]]s, custom clothing made out of clear PVC or inflatable items.

Nylon fetishism includes the wearing of shiny raincoats, jackets and trousers. In the case of heterosexuals, special preferences often include nylon clothing items designed for or belonging to the other sex.

===Spandex===
{{Main|spandex fetishism}}

Spandex fetishism is a [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to people wearing [[stretch fabric]]s or, in certain cases, to the garments themselves, such as [[leotard]]s. One reason why spandex and other tight fabrics may be fetishised is that the garment forms a "[[second skin (fetishism)|second skin]]," acting as a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. Wearers of skin-tight nylon and cotton spandex garments can appear naked or coated in a shiny or matte substance like paint. The tightness of the garments may also be seen as [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. Another reason is that nylon-spandex fabric (preferred by many spandex fetishists) is often produced with a very smooth and silk-like finish, which lends a tactile dimension to the fetish – as well as a visual one. There is a sexual attraction to [[leotard]]s and other dance related clothing. This also goes for gymnasts too.

In comic books, [[superhero]]es, [[superheroine]]s, and [[supervillain]]s are generally depicted as wearing costumes made of spandex or a similar material. The superheroines always wear skintight, very flashy and bright-coloured costumes that usually cover only just enough of the body to be presentable. Fantasies involving superheroes or the wearing of superhero costumes are commonly associated with spandex fetishism.

Full-body suits called [[zentai]] entirely immerse the wearer in skin tight fabric. The suits are essentially [[catsuit]]s with gloves, feet, and a hood. The wearer experiences [[total enclosure]] and those who enjoy [[erotic objectification]] might make use of the garment's anonymizing aspect. The word ''zentai'' means ''whole body'' in Japanese.

'''Demographic transition''' ('''DT''') is the transition from high [[Birth rate|birth]] and [[death rate]]s to lower birth and death rates as a country or region develops from a pre-industrial to an [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] [[economic system]]. The theory was proposed in 1929 by the American [[demography|demographer]] Warren Thompson,&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Warren Thompson|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Population| volume = 2|pages=939–40|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-02-865677-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; who observed changes, or transitions, in birth and death rates in industrialized societies over the previous 200 years.  Most [[developed countries]] have completed the demographic transition and have low birth rates; most [[developing countries]] are in the process of this transition.&lt;ref name=Caldwell&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=John C.|author2=Bruce K Caldwell |author3=Pat Caldwell |author4=Peter F McDonald |author5=Thomas Schindlmayr |title=Demographic Transition Theory|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year= 2006 |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-4373-4 | page = 239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = About | title = Geography | url = http://geography.about.com/od/culturalgeography/a/demotransition.htm | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The major (relative) exceptions are some poor countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and some [[Middle Eastern]] countries, which are poor or affected by government policy or civil strife, notably, Pakistan, [[Palestinian territories]], [[Yemen]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell /&gt;

The demographic transition model, in isolation, can be taken to predict that birth rates will continue to go down as societies grow increasingly wealthy; however, recent data contradicts this, suggesting that beyond a certain level of development birth rates increase again.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature08230|pmid=19661915|title=Advances in development reverse fertility declines|journal=Nature|volume=460|issue=7256|pages=741–3|year=2009|last1=Myrskylä|first1=Mikko|last2=Kohler|first2=Hans-Peter|last3=Billari|first3=Francesco C.|bibcode=2009Natur.460..741M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the very long term, the demographic transition should be reversed via [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher [[Birth rate|fertility]] and higher [[death rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name=bbc_sure&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19923200 Can we be sure the world's population will stop rising?], BBC News, 13 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of some kind of demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical [[correlation]] linking dropping fertility to social and economic development.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes [[Causation (sociology)|lead to]] lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes. Scholars also debate to what extent various proposed and sometimes inter-related factors such as higher [[per capita]] income, higher female income, lower mortality, old-age security, and rise of demand for human capital are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galor|first1=Oded|title=The demographic transition: causes and consequences|journal=Cliometrica|date=17 February 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1007/s11698-011-0062-7|pmid=25089157|pmc=4116081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demographic-TransitionOWID.png|thumb|upright=2.75|Demographic transition overview, with below-replacement-fertility broken out into a "stage 5"]]

==History of the theory==
The theory is based on an interpretation of [[demography|demographic]] history developed in 1929 by the American demographer Warren Thompson (1887–1973).&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll /&gt; [[Adolphe Landry]] of France made similar observations on demographic patterns and population growth potential around 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landry|first1=Adolphe|title=Adolphe Landry on the Demographic Revolution|journal=Population and Development Review|date=December 1987|volume=13|issue=4|pages=731|doi=10.2307/1973031|jstor=1973031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s [[Frank W. Notestein]] developed a more formal theory of demographic transition.&lt;ref name="Woods2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Robert|title=The Demography of Victorian England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75DZmQtybMwC&amp;pg=PA18|date=2000-10-05|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78254-8|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the existence of a negative correlation between fertility and industrial development had become one of the most widely accepted findings in social science.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;

==Summary of the theory==
[[File:Demographic-Transition-5-countries.png|thumb|upright=2.75|Demographic change in Germany, Sweden, Chile, Mauritius, China from 1820 to 2010.&lt;br /&gt;Pink line: crude [[death rate]] (CDR), green line: (crude) [[birth rate]] (CBR), yellow line: population.]]

The transition involves four stages, or possibly five.

* In stage one, [[pre-industrial society ]], death rates and birth rates are high and roughly in balance. All human populations are believed to have had this balance until the late 18th century, when this balance ended in Western Europe.&lt;ref name= "marathon.uwc.edu"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | publisher = UWC | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, growth rates were less than 0.05% at least since the Agricultural Revolution over 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is constrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new technologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or achieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by death rates.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* In stage two, that of a developing country, the death rates drop quickly due to improvements in food supply and sanitation, which increase life expectancies and reduce disease. The improvements specific to food supply typically include selective breeding and crop rotation and farming techniques.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Other improvements generally include access to ovens, baking, and television. For example, numerous improvements in public health reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Prior to the mid-20th century, these improvements in public health were primarily in the areas of food handling, water supply, sewage, and personal hygiene.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; One of the variables often cited is the increase in female literacy combined with public health education programs which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; In Europe, the death rate decline started in the late 18th century in northwestern Europe and spread to the south and east over approximately the next 100 years.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Without a corresponding fall in birth rates this produces an [[Demographic trap|imbalance]], and the countries in this stage experience a large increase in [[population]].
* In stage three, birth rates fall due to various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] such as access to [[contraception]], increases in wages, [[urbanization]], a reduction in [[subsistence agriculture]], an increase in the status and education of women, a reduction in the value of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of children and other social changes.  Population growth begins to level off. The birth rate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, it should be noted that contraceptives were not generally available nor widely used in the 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline then.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in values; not just because of the availability of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* During stage four there are both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth rates may drop to well below replacement level as has happened in countries like [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]], leading to a [[population decline|shrinking population]], a threat to many industries that rely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates an economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death rates may remain consistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low exercise levels and high [[obesity]] and an aging population in [[developed countries]]. By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates.&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"/&gt;
* Some scholars break out, from stage four, a "stage five" of below-replacement fertility levels. Others hypothesize a different "stage five" involving an increase in fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure/&gt;

As with all models, this is an idealized picture of population change in these countries. The model is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately describe all individual cases. The extent to which it applies to less-developed societies today remains to be seen. Many countries such as [[China]], [[Brazil]] and [[Thailand]] have passed through the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) very quickly due to fast social and economic change. Some countries, particularly African countries, appear to be stalled in the second stage due to stagnant development and the effect of [[AIDS]].

==Stage One==
In pre-industrial society, death rates and birth rates were both high, and fluctuated rapidly according to natural events, such as drought and disease, to produce a relatively constant and young population. Family planning and contraception were virtually nonexistent; therefore, birth rates were essentially only limited by the ability of women to bear children. Emigration depressed death rates in some special cases (for example, Europe and particularly the Eastern United States during the 19th century), but, overall, death rates tended to match birth rates, often exceeding 40 per 1000 per year. Children contributed to the economy of the household from an early age by carrying water, firewood, and messages, caring for younger siblings, sweeping, washing dishes,  preparing food, and working in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/DemographicTransition.htm|title=Demographic Transition Model|website=geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising a child cost little more than feeding him or her; there were no education or entertainment expenses.  Thus, the total [[Cost of raising a child|cost of raising children]] barely exceeded their contribution to the household.  In addition, as they became adults they become a major input to the family business, mainly farming, and were the primary form of insurance for adults in old age.  In India, an adult son was all that prevented a widow from falling into destitution.  While death rates remained high there was no question as to the need for children, even if the means to prevent them had existed.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

During this stage, the society evolves in accordance with [[Malthusian growth model|Malthusian]] paradigm, with population essentially determined by the food supply. Any fluctuations in food supply (either positive, for example, due to technology improvements, or negative, due to droughts and pest invasions) tend to translate directly into population fluctuations. [[Famine]]s resulting in significant mortality are frequent. Overall, [[population dynamics]] during stage one are comparable to those of animals living in the wild. According to Edward, Revocatus. (2016) This is the earlier stage of demographic transition in the world and also characterized by primary activities such as small fishing activities, farming practices, pastoralism and petty businesses.

==Stage Two==
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|World population 10,000 BC-2017 AD]]
This stage leads to a fall in death rates and an increase in population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml BBC bitesize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023172810/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The changes leading to this stage in Europe were initiated in the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] of the 18th century and were initially quite slow.  In the 20th century, the falls in death rates in developing countries tended to be substantially faster.  Countries in this stage include [[Yemen]], [[Afghanistan]], the [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Iraq]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (but do not include [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Kenya]], [[Gabon]] and [[Ghana]], which have begun to move into stage 3).&lt;ref name=Caldwell10&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in the death rate is due initially to two factors:
*First, improvements in the food supply brought about by higher yields in agricultural practices and better transportation reduce death due to starvation and lack of water.  Agricultural improvements included [[crop rotation]], [[selective breeding]], and [[seed drill]] technology.
*Second, significant improvements in public health reduce mortality, particularly in childhood. These are not so many medical breakthroughs (Europe passed through stage two before the advances of the mid-20th century, although there was significant medical progress in the 19th century, such as the development of [[vaccination]]) as they are improvements in water supply, [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]], food handling, and general personal [[hygiene]] following from growing scientific knowledge of the causes of disease and the improved education and social status of mothers.

A consequence of the decline in mortality in Stage Two is an increasingly rapid growth in population growth (a.k.a. "[[population explosion]]") as the gap between deaths and births grows wider and wider. Note that this growth is not due to an increase in fertility (or birth rates) but to a decline in deaths. This change in population occurred in north-western Europe during the 19th century due to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During the second half of the 20th century less-developed countries entered Stage Two, creating the worldwide rapid growth of number of living persons that has demographers concerned today. In this stage of DT, countries are vulnerable to become [[Failed States Index|failed states]] in the absence of progressive governments.

[[File:Angola population pyramid 2005.svg|right|upright=1.7|thumb| [[Population pyramid]] of [[Angola]] 2005]]
Another characteristic of Stage Two of the demographic transition is a change in the [[population pyramid|age structure]] of the population. In Stage One, the majority of deaths are concentrated in the first 5&amp;ndash;10 years of life. Therefore, more than anything else, the decline in death rates in Stage Two entails the increasing survival of children and a growing population. Hence, the age structure of the population becomes increasingly youthful and start to have big families and more of these children enter the reproductive cycle of their lives while maintaining the high fertility rates of their parents. The bottom of the "[[population pyramid|age pyramid]]" widens first where children, teenagers and infants are here, accelerating population growth rate. The age structure of such a population is illustrated by using an example from the [[Third World]] today.

==Stage Three==
In Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), death rates are low and birth rates diminish, as a rule accordingly of enhanced economic conditions, an expansion in women’s status and education, and access to contraception. The decrease in birth rate fluctuates from nation to nation, as does the time span in which it is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-3-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=16 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage Three moves the population towards stability through a decline in the birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UWC | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | series = Marathon | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]]s contribute to this eventual decline, and are generally similar to [[Sub-replacement fertility#Causes|those associated with sub-replacement fertility]], although some are speculative:
*In rural areas continued decline in childhood death means that at some point parents realize they need not require so many children to be born to ensure a comfortable old age. As childhood death continues to fall and incomes increase parents can become increasingly confident that fewer children will suffice to help in family business and care for them in old age.
*Increasing [[urbanization]] changes the traditional values placed upon fertility and the value of children in rural society. Urban living also raises the cost of dependent children to a family. A recent theory suggests that urbanization also contributes to reducing the birth rate because it disrupts optimal mating patterns. A 2008 study in Iceland found that the most fecund marriages are between distant cousins. Genetic incompatibilities inherent in more distant outbreeding makes reproduction harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Kissing cousins, missing children | url = http://www.economist.com/node/10640683?story_id=10640683 | journal= The Economist | date = 7 February 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In both rural and urban areas, the cost of children to parents is exacerbated by the introduction of compulsory education acts and the increased need to educate children so they can take up a respected position in society.  Children are increasingly prohibited under law from working outside the household and make an increasingly limited contribution to the household, as school children are increasingly exempted from the expectation of making a significant contribution to domestic work.  Even in equatorial Africa, children (age under 5) now required to have clothes and shoes, through the body, and may even require school uniforms. Parents begin to consider it a duty to buy children(s) books and toys,  partly due to education and access to family planning, people begin to reassess their need for children and their ability to grow them.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5/&gt;
[[File:Familyplanningmalaysia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A major factor in reducing birth rates in stage&amp;nbsp;3 countries such as Malaysia is the availability of family planning facilities, like this one in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia.]]
*Increasing literacy and employment lowers the uncritical acceptance of childbearing and motherhood as measures of the status of women. Working women have less time to raise children; this is particularly an issue where fathers traditionally make little or no contribution to child-raising, such as [[southern Europe]] or [[Japan]].  Valuation of women beyond childbearing and motherhood becomes important.
*Improvements in contraceptive technology are now a major factor. Fertility decline is caused as much by changes in values about children and gender as by the availability of contraceptives and knowledge of how to use them.

The resulting changes in the age structure of the population include a decline in the youth [[dependency ratio]] and eventually [[population aging]]. The population structure becomes less triangular and more like an elongated balloon. During the period between the decline in youth dependency and rise in old age dependency there is a [[demographic window]] of opportunity that can potentially produce economic growth through an increase in the ratio of working age to dependent population; the [[demographic dividend]].

However, unless factors such as those listed above are allowed to work, a society's birth rates may not drop to a low level in due time, which means that the society cannot proceed to stage Three and is locked in what is called a [[demographic trap]].

Countries that have witnessed a fertility decline of over 50% from their pre-transition levels include: [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Panama]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Lebanon]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and many [[Pacific islands]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of 25–50% include: [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Demographics of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], [[Demographics of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Demographics of Zimbabwe| Zimbabwe]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of less than 25% include: [[Demographics of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Demographics of Niger|Niger]], [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].

==Stage Four==
This occurs where birth and death rates are both low, leading to a total population stable. Death rates are low for a number of reasons, primarily lower rates of diseases and higher production of food. The birth rate is low because people have more opportunities to choose if they want children; this is made possible by improvements in contraception or women gaining more independence and work opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.main-vision.com/richard/demographic.htm | title = Main vision | first =  | contribution = Demographic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The DTM is only a suggestion about the future population levels of a country, not a prediction.

Countries that are at this stage (2 &lt; [[Total Fertility Rate]] &lt; 2.5 in 2015) include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, El Salvador, Faroe Islands, Grenada, Guam, India, Indonesia, Kosovo, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Palau, Peru, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tunisia, Turkey and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage Five==

Note the vertical axis is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and represents millions of people.]]
The original Demographic Transition model has just four stages, but additional stages have been proposed. Both more-fertile and less-fertile futures have been claimed as a Stage Five.

Some countries have [[sub-replacement fertility]] (that is, below 2.1–2.2 children per woman). Replacement fertility is generally slightly higher than 2 (the level which replaces the two parents) both because boys are born more often than girls (about 1.05–1.1 to 1) and to compensate for deaths prior to full reproduction. Many European and East Asian countries now have higher death rates than birth rates. [[Population aging]] and [[population decline]] may eventually occur, assuming that the fertility rate does not change and sustained mass immigration does not occur.

In an article in the August 2009 issue of ''Nature'', Myrskylä, Kohler and [[Francesco Billari]] argue that the previously negative relationship between "development", as measured by the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), and birth rates has become J-shaped. The HDI is a composite of life expectancy, income, and level of education. Development promotes fertility decline at HDI levels below 0.9 but further advances in HDI cause a small rebound in birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08230.html | last1 = Myrskyla | first1 = M | last2 = Kohler | first2 = H-P | last3 = Billari | first3 = F | title= Advances in development reverse fertility declines | journal= Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7256 | pages = 741–43 | date = 6 August 2009| bibcode = 2009Natur.460..741M | doi = 10.1038/nature08230 | pmid=19661915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries with very high levels of development, fertility rates are now approaching two children per woman — although there are exceptions, notably Germany, Italy and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The best of all possible worlds? | work = The Economist | date = 6 August 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current century, most developed countries have increased fertility. From the point of view of [[evolutionary biology]], wealthier people having fewer children is unexpected, as [[natural selection]] would be expected to favor individuals who are willing and able to convert plentiful resources into plentiful fertile descendants. This may be the result of a departure from the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = Alice L. | last2 = Low | first2 = Bobbi S. | year = 2001 | title = Testing evolutionary hypotheses with demographic data | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 633–660 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Daly |first1=Martin |last2=Wilson |first2=Margo I |title=Human evolutionary psychology and animal behaviour |url=http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Daly%26Wilson-HEP-AB1999.pdf |publisher=Department of Psychology, McMaster University |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=26 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the perspective of [[evolutionary psychology]], the modern environment is exerting [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;

[[Jane Falkingham]] of [[Southampton University]] has noted that "We've actually got population projections wrong consistently over the last 50 years... we've underestimated the improvements in mortality... but also we've not been very good at spotting the trends in fertility."&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt; In 2004 a United Nations office published its guesses for global population in the year 2300; estimates ranged from a "low estimate" of 2.3 billion (tending to −0.32% per year) to a "high estimate" of 36.4 billion (tending to +0.54% per year), which were contrasted with a deliberately "unrealistic" illustrative "constant fertility" scenario of 134 trillion (obtained if 1995–2000 fertility rates stay constant into the far future).&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Population to 2300|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|accessdate=24 May 2016|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In stage 5 of the demographic transition, a country encounters misfortune as a whole this is because the death rate becomes higher than the birth rate. There will be a negative population growth rate which will affect the country. This will take a generation or two before the population grows back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-5-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 5 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=18 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on age structure==
[[File:Dtm pyramids.png|thumb|upright=1.4|One such visualization of this effect may be approximated by these hypothetical population pyramids.  ]]
The decline in death rate and birth rate that occurs during the demographic transition may transform the age structure. When the death rate declines during the second stage of the transition, the result is primarily an increase in the child population. The reason being that when the death rate is high (stage one), the infant mortality rate is very high, often above 200 deaths per 1000 children born. When the death rate falls or improves, this may include lower infant mortality rate and increased child survival. Over time, as individuals with increased survival rates age, there may also be an increase in the number of older children, teenagers, and young adults. This implies that there is an increase in the fertile population proportion which, with constant fertility rates, may lead to an increase in the number of children born. This will further increase the growth of the child population. The second stage of the demographic transition, therefore, implies a rise in child dependency and creates a youth bulge in the population structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population: An Introduction to Concepts and Issues|last=Weeks|first=John R.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-305-09450-5|location=|pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a population continues to move through the demographic transition into the third stage, fertility declines and the youth bulge prior to the decline ages out of child dependency into the working ages. This stage of the transition is often referred to as the golden age, and is typically when populations see the greatest advancements in living standards and economic development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, further declines in both mortality and fertility will eventually result in an aging population, and a rise in the aged dependency ratio. An increase of the aged dependency ratio often indicates that a population has reached below replacement levels of fertility, and as result does not have enough people in the working ages to support the economy, and the growing dependent population. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historical studies==

===Britain===
Between 1750 and 1975 England experienced the transition from high levels of both mortality and fertility, to low levels. A major factor was the sharp decline in the death rate due to infectious diseases, which has fallen from about 11 per 1,000 to less than 1 per 1,000.  By contrast, the death rate from other causes was 12 per 1,000 in 1850 and has not declined markedly. The agricultural revolution and the development of transport, initiated by the construction of canals, led to greater availability of food and coal, and enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]] to improve the standard of living. Scientific discoveries and medical breakthroughs did not, in general, contribute importantly to the early major decline in infectious disease mortality.

===Ireland===
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Irish demographic status converged to the European norm.  Mortality rose above the European Community average, and in 1991 Irish fertility fell to replacement level. The peculiarities of Ireland's past demography and its recent rapid changes challenge established theory. The recent changes have mirrored inward changes in Irish society, with respect to family planning, women in the work force, the sharply declining power of the Catholic Church, and the emigration factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = DA | last = Coleman | title= The Demographic Transition in Ireland in International Context | journal= Proceedings of the British Academy | year = 1992 | issue = 79 | pages = 53–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
France displays real divergences from the standard model of Western demographic evolution.  The uniqueness of the French case arises from its specific demographic history, its historic cultural values, and its internal regional dynamics. France's demographic transition was unusual in that the mortality and the natality decreased at the same time, thus there was no demographic boom in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quand l'Angleterre rattrapait la France |journal=Population &amp; Societes |date=May 1999 |issue=346 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Demographic_transition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12 |accessdate=14 November 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's demographic profile is similar to its European neighbors and to developed countries in general, yet it seems to be staving off the population decline of Western countries. With 62.9 million inhabitants in 2006, it was the second most populous country in the European Union, and it displayed a certain demographic dynamism, with a growth rate of 2.4% between 2000 and 2005, above the European average. More than two-thirds of that growth can be ascribed to a natural increase resulting from high fertility and birthrates. In contrast, France is one of the developed nations whose migratory balance is rather weak, which is an original feature at the European level. Several interrelated reasons account for such singularities, in particular the impact of pro-family policies accompanied by greater unmarried households and out-of-wedlock births. These general demographic trends parallel equally important changes in regional demographics. Since 1982 the same significant tendencies have occurred throughout mainland France: demographic stagnation in the least-populated rural regions and industrial regions in the northeast, with strong growth in the southwest and along the Atlantic coast, plus dynamism in metropolitan areas. Shifts in population between regions account for most of the differences in growth. The varying demographic evolution regions can be analyzed though the filter of several parameters, including residential facilities, economic growth, and urban dynamism, which yield several distinct regional profiles. The distribution of the French population therefore seems increasingly defined not only by interregional mobility but also by the residential preferences of individual households. These challenges, linked to configurations of population and the dynamics of distribution, inevitably raise the issue of town and country planning. The most recent census figures show that an outpouring of the urban population means that fewer rural areas are continuing to register a negative migratory flow – two-thirds of rural communities have shown some since 2000. The spatial demographic expansion of large cities amplifies the process of peri-urbanization yet is also accompanied by movement of selective residential flow, social selection, and sociospatial segregation based on income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Guy | last1 = Baudelle | first2 = David | last2 = Olivier | title= Changement Global, Mondialisation et Modèle De Transition Démographique: réflexion sur une exception française parmi les pays développés | journal= Historiens et Géographes | year = 2006 | volume = 98 | issue = 395 | pages = 177–204 | issn = 0046-757X | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
McNicoll (2006) examines the common features behind the striking changes in health and fertility in East and Southeast Asia in the 1960s–1990’s, focusing on seven countries: Taiwan and South Korea ("tiger" economies), Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia ("second wave" countries), and China and Vietnam ("market-Leninist" economies). Demographic change can be seen as a byproduct of social and economic development together with, in some cases, strong governmental pressures. The transition sequence entailed the establishment of an effective, typically authoritarian, system of local administration, providing a framework for promotion and service delivery in health, education, and family planning.  Subsequent economic liberalization offered new opportunities for upward mobility — and risks of backsliding —, accompanied by the erosion of social capital and the breakdown or privatization of service programs.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====India====
As of 2013, India is in the later half of the third stage of the demographic transition, with a population of 1.23 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/59771739/THE-ARTHEMETICS-OF-INDIAN-POPULATION |title=  The arithmetic's of Indian population|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nearly 40 years behind in the demographic transition process compared to [[EU countries]], [[Japan]], etc. The present demographic transition stage of India along with its higher population base will yield a rich [[demographic dividend]] in future decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789334/India-vs-USA-vs-China-vs-World|title=India vs China vs USA vs World|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korea====
Cha (2007) analyzes a panel data set to explore how industrial revolution, demographic transition, and human capital accumulation interacted in Korea from 1916–38. Income growth and public investment in health caused mortality to fall, which suppressed fertility and promoted education. Industrialization, skill premium, and closing gender wage gap further induced parents to opt for child quality. Expanding demand for education was accommodated by an active public school building program. The interwar agricultural depression aggravated traditional income inequality, raising fertility and impeding the spread of mass schooling. Landlordism collapsed in the wake of de-colonization, and the consequent reduction in inequality accelerated human and physical capital accumulation, hence leading to growth in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Myung | first = Soo Cha | title = Industrial Revolution, Demographic Transition, and Human Capital Accumulation in Korea, 1916–38 | publisher = Naksungdae Institute of Economic Research | type = working Paper | date = July 2007 | url = http://www.naksung.re.kr/papers/wp2007-7.pdf | format = PDF | place = KR}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madagascar===
Campbell has studied the demography of 19th-century Madagascar in the light of demographic transition theory. Both supporters and critics of the theory hold to an intrinsic opposition between human and "natural" factors, such as climate, famine, and disease, influencing demography. They also suppose a sharp chronological divide between the precolonial and colonial eras, arguing that whereas "natural" demographic influences were of greater importance in the former period, human factors predominated thereafter. Campbell argues that in 19th-century Madagascar the human factor, in the form of the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina state]], was the predominant demographic influence. However, the impact of the state was felt through natural forces, and it varied over time. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Merina state policies stimulated agricultural production, which helped to create a larger and healthier population and laid the foundation for Merina military and economic expansion within Madagascar. From 1820, the cost of such expansionism led the state to increase its exploitation of forced labor at the expense of agricultural production and thus transformed it into a negative demographic force.  Infertility and infant mortality, which were probably more significant influences on overall population levels than the adult mortality rate, increased from 1820 due to disease, malnutrition, and stress, all of which stemmed from state forced labor policies. Available estimates indicate little if any population growth for Madagascar between 1820 and 1895. The demographic "crisis" in Africa, ascribed by critics of the demographic transition theory to the colonial era, stemmed in Madagascar from the policies of the imperial Merina regime, which in this sense formed a link to the French regime of the colonial era. Campbell thus questions the underlying assumptions governing the debate about historical demography in Africa and suggests that the demographic impact of political forces be reevaluated in terms of their changing interaction with "natural" demographic influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Gwyn | last1 = Campbell | title= State and Pre-colonial Demographic History: the Case of Nineteenth-century Madagascar | journal= Journal of African History | year = 1991 | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–45 |  issn = 0021-8537 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700031534}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
{{main article|Demographics of Russia}}  
[[File:Russian male and female life expectancy.PNG|thumb|upright=1.4|Russian male and female life expectancy since 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/pril.php |title=Life expectancy of the Russian Federation since 1950 |publisher=Demoscope.ru |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514001827/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/pril.php |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/2008/demo/osn/05-08.htm Life Expectancy of the Russian Federation since 1992] Retrieved on 29 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Russia entered stage two of the transition in the 18th century, simultaneously with the rest of Europe, though the effect of transition remained limited to a modest decline in death rates and steady population growth. The population of Russia nearly quadrupled during the 19th century, from 30 million to 133 million, and continued to grow until the First World War and the turmoil that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/russia.htm|title=Population of Eastern Europe|date=|website=tacitus.nu|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia then quickly transitioned through stage three. Though fertility rates rebounded initially and almost reached 7 children/woman in the mid-1920s, they were depressed by the 1931–33 famine, crashed due to the Second World War in 1941, and only rebounded to a sustained level of 3 children/woman after the war. By 1970 Russia was firmly in stage four, with crude birth rates and crude death rates on the order of 15/1000 and 9/1000 respectively.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Russia underwent a unique demographic transition; observers call it a "demographic catastrophe": the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, life expectancy fell sharply (especially for males) and the number of suicides increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = George J | editor-last = Demko | others = et al | title = Population under Duress: The Geodemography of Post-Soviet Russia | year = 1999 | url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91465272 | publisher = Questia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1992 through 2011, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births.

=== United States ===
Greenwood and Seshadri (2002) show that from 1800 to 1940 there was a [[demographic shift]] from a mostly rural US population with high fertility, with an average of seven children born per white woman, to a minority (43%) rural population with low fertility, with an average of two births per white woman. This shift resulted from technological progress. A sixfold increase in real wages made children more expensive in terms of forgone opportunities to work and increases in agricultural productivity reduced rural demand for labor, a substantial portion of which traditionally had been performed by children in farm families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The U.S. Demographic Transition|last=Greenwood |first=Jeremy |last2=Seshadri |first2=Ananth|date=January 2002|ssrn = 297952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplification of the DTM theory proposes an initial decline in mortality followed by a later drop in fertility. The changing demographics of the U.S. in the last two centuries did not parallel this model. Beginning around 1800, there was a sharp fertility decline; at this time, an average woman usually produced seven births per lifetime, but by 1900 this number had dropped to nearly four. A mortality decline was not observed in the U.S. until almost 1900—a hundred years following the drop in fertility.

However, this late decline occurred from a very low initial level. During the 17th and 18th centuries, crude death rates in much of colonial North America ranged from 15 to 25 deaths per 1000 residents per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of the United States|author= Herbert S. Klein|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of North America|author1= Michael R. Haines |author2=Richard H. Steckel|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; (levels of up to 40 per 1000 being typical during stages one and two). Life expectancy at birth was on the order of 40 and, in some places, reached 50, and a resident of 18th century Philadelphia who reached age 20 could have expected, on average, additional 40 years of life.

This phenomenon is explained by the pattern of colonization of the United States. Sparsely populated interior of the country allowed ample room to accommodate all the "excess" people, counteracting mechanisms (spread of communicable diseases due to overcrowding, low real wages and insufficient calories per capita due to the limited amount of available agricultural land) which led to high mortality in the Old World. With low mortality but stage 1 birth rates, the United States necessarily experienced exponential population growth (from less than 4 million people in 1790, to 23 million in 1850, to 76 million in 1900.)

The only area where this pattern did not hold was the American South. High prevalence of deadly endemic diseases such as malaria kept mortality as high as 45–50 per 1000 residents per year in 18th century North Carolina. In [[New Orleans]], mortality remained so high (mainly due to [[yellow fever]]) that the city was characterized as the "death capital of the United States" – at the level of 50 per 1000 population or higher – well into the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael R. |last=Haines |title=The Urban Mortality Transition in the United States, 1800–1940 |journal=NBER Historical Working Paper No. 134 |date=July 2001 |doi=10.3386/h0134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the U.S. is recognized as having both low fertility and mortality rates. Specifically, birth rates stand at 14 per 1000 per year and death rates at 8 per 1000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html#People | title = World factbook | contribution = US | publisher = CIA | place = USA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical evaluation==
[[File:Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Countries with lower economic development have much faster demographic transition than high-income countries.]]
It must be remembered that the DTM is only a model and cannot necessarily predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates may be for an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size. Most particularly, of course, the DTM makes no comment on change in population due to migration. It is not applicable for high levels of development, as it has been shown that after a [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of 0.9 the fertility increases again.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

DTM does not account for recent phenomena such as [[AIDS]]; in these areas HIV has become the leading source of mortality.  Some trends in waterborne bacterial infant mortality are also disturbing in countries like [[Malawi]], [[Sudan]] and [[Nigeria]]; for example, progress in the DTM clearly arrested and reversed between 1975 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.populationaction.org/resources/researchCommentaries/Nov06_AgeStructure.htm | contribution = Nigeria: Reversal of Demographic Transition | title = Population action | date = November 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DTM assumes that population changes are induced by industrial changes and increased wealth, without taking into account the role of social change in determining birth rates, e.g., the education of women. In recent decades more work has been done on developing the social mechanisms behind it.&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt;

DTM assumes that the birth rate is independent of the death rate. Nevertheless, demographers maintain that there is no historical evidence for society-wide fertility rates rising significantly after high mortality events. Notably, some historic populations have taken many years to replace lives after events such as the [[Black Death]].

Some have claimed that DTM does not explain the early fertility declines in much of Asia in the second half of the 20th century or the delays in fertility decline in parts of the Middle East.  Nevertheless, the demographer [[John Caldwell (demographer)|John C Caldwell]] has suggested that the reason for the rapid decline in fertility in some [[developing country|developing countries]] compared to Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is mainly due to government programs and a massive investment in education both by governments and parents.&lt;ref name=Caldwell10/&gt;

==Second demographic transition==
The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) is a conceptual framework first formulated in 1986 by Ron Lesthaeghe and Dirk van de Kaa in a short article that was published in the Dutch sociology journal ''Mens en Maatschappij''.&lt;ref name="Lesthaeghe_2011"&gt;{{citation |author=Ron J.

The changes, increased numbers of women choosing to not marry or have children, increased cohabitation outside marriage, increased childbearing by single mothers, increased participation by women in higher education and professional careers, and other changes are associated with increased individualism and autonomy, particularly of women. Motivations have changed from traditional and economic ones to those of self-realization.&lt;ref name="PNAC122314"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ron Lesthaeghe|title=The second demographic transition: A concise overview of its development|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=December 23, 2014 |volume=111|issue=51|pages=18112–18115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1420441111|pmid=25453112|pmc=4280616|bibcode=2014PNAS..11118112L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Nicholas Eberstadt, political economist at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, described the Second Demographic Transition as one in which "long, stable marriages are out, and divorce or separation are in, along with serial cohabitation and increasingly contingent liaisons."&lt;ref name="WSJ_Eberstadt_2015"&gt;{{citation |quote=‘They’re getting divorced, and they’ll do anything NOT to get custody of the kids.” So reads the promotional poster, in French, for a new movie, “Papa ou Maman"|title=The Global Flight From the Family: It's not only in the West or prosperous nations—the decline in marriage and drop in birth rates is rampant, with potentially dire fallout |author=Nicholas Eberstadt |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nicholas-eberstadt-the-global-flight-from-the-family-1424476179|date=February 21, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |publisher=''Wall Street Journal'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devitrification''' is the process of [[crystallization]] in a formerly crystal-free ([[amorphous]]) [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Vogel: "Glass Chemistry"; Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co. K; 2nd revised edition (November 1994), {{ISBN|3-540-57572-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vitreus'', meaning ''[[glassy]]'' and ''[[Transparent materials|transparent]]''.

==Devitrification in glass art==
Devitrification occurs in [[glass art]] during the firing process of [[fused glass]] whereby the surface of the [[glass]] develops a whitish scum, [[crazing]], or wrinkles instead of a smooth [[glossy]] shine, as the [[molecules]] in the glass change their structure into that of crystalline solids.  While this condition is normally undesired, in [[glass art]] it is possible to use devitrification as a deliberate artistic technique.

Causes of devitrification, commonly referred to as "devit", can include holding a high temperature for too long, which causes the nucleation of crystals. The presence of foreign residue such as dust on the surface of the glass or inside the kiln prior to firing can provide nucleation points where crystals can propagate easily.  The chemical compositions of some types of glass can make them more vulnerable to devitrification than others, for example a high [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] content can be factor in inducing this condition.  In general [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] glass can devit easily as crystals are present in the glass to give its opaque appearance and thus the higher the chance it might devit.

Techniques for avoiding devitrification include cleaning the glass surfaces of dust or unwanted residue, and allowing rapid cooling once the piece reaches the desired temperature, until the temperature approaches the [[Annealing (glass)|annealing]] temperature.  Devit spray can be purchased to apply to the surfaces of the glass pieces prior to firing which is supposed to help prevent devitrification, however there is disagreement over the long term effectiveness of this solution and whether it should be used as a substitute for proper firing techniques.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Once devit has occurred, there are techniques that can be attempted to fix it, with varying degrees of success.  One technique is to cover the surface with a sheet of clear glass and refiring.  Since devitrification can change the [[Coefficient of thermal expansion|COE]] somewhat, and devitrified glass tends to be somewhat harder to melt again, there is the possibility of this technique resulting in a less stable piece, however it has also been used effectively with full-fused pieces with no apparent problems.  Applying devit spray and refiring can also be effective.  Alternatively, [[sandblasting]], acid bath, or polishing with a [[pumice]] stone or rotary brush can be used to remove the unwanted surface.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Devitrification in geology==
In a general sense, any crystallization from a [[magma]] could be considered devitrification, but the term is most commonly used for the formation of [[spherulites]] in otherwise glassy rocks such as [[obsidian]].

The process of conversion of glass material to crystallized material is known as devitrification. Spherulites are evidence of this process. Perlite is due to hydration of glass causing expansion and not necessarily devitrification.

==Fiber glass==
Devitrification can occur in fiberglass ([[glass wool]]) batting or blown-in insulation where it can result in the product becoming a powder with substantially lower thermal insulation properties.

The theory presents simple mechanistic rules that describe the uptake and allocation of energy (and nutrients) and the consequences for physiological organization throughout an organism's life cycle, including the relationships of energetics with aging and effects of toxicants.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Assumptions of the DEB theory are delineated in an explicit way,  the approach clearly distinguishes mechanisms associated with intra‐ and interspecific variation in metabolic rates, and equations for energy flows are mathematically derived following the principles of physics and simplicity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledder|first=Glenn|date=2014|title=The Basic Dynamic Energy Budget Model and Some Implications|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23737867.2014.11414482|journal=Letters in Biomathematics|volume=1:2|pages= 221–233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarà|first=Gianluca|last2=Rinaldi|first2=Alessandro|last3=Montalto|first3=Valeria|date=2014-12-01|title=Thinking beyond organism energy use: a trait-based bioenergetic mechanistic approach for predictions of life history traits in marine organisms|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/maec.12106|journal=Marine Ecology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=506–515|doi=10.1111/maec.12106|issn=1439-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornerstones of the theory are:

* conservation of [[mass balance|mass]], [[Energy balance (biology)|energy]] and [[time balance|time]],
* relationships between surface area and volume
* [[stoichiometric]] constraints on production
* organizational uncoupling of metabolic [[modularity (biology)|modules]] (assimilation, dissipation, growth)
* strong and weak [[homeostasis]] (composition of compartments is constant; composition of the organism is constant when the food is constant) 
* substrate(s) from the environment is/are first converted to reserve(s) before being used for further metabolism

The theory specifies that an organism is made up two main compartments: '''[[Dynamic reserve|(energy) reserve]]''' and '''structure'''. Assimilation of energy is proportional to surface area of the structure, and maintenance is proportional to its volume. Reserve does not require maintenance. Energy mobilization will depend on the relative amount of the energy reserve, and on the interface between reserve and structure. Once mobilized, the energy is split into two branches:

* a fixed proportion  (termed kappa, κ) is allocated to  [[Individual growth|growth]] (increase of structural mass) and maintenance of structure, while 
* the remaining proportion (1- κ) is allocated to processes of maturation (increase in complexity, installation of regulation systems, preparation for reproduction) and maintaining the level of attained maturity (including, e.g., maintenance of defense systems).

The κ-rule therefore states that the processes of growth and maturation do not directly compete. [[Maintenance of an organism|Maintenance]] needs to be paid before allocating energy to other processes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the context of energy acquisition and allocation, the theory recognizes three main developmental stages: '''embryo''', which does not feed or reproduce, '''juvenile''', which feeds but does not reproduce, and '''adult''', which both feeds and is allocating energy to reproduction. Transitions between these life stages occur at events specified as '''birth''' and '''puberty''', which are reached when energy invested into maturation (tracked as 'level of '''maturity'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;') reaches a certain threshold. Maturity does not increase in the adult stage, and maturity maintenance is proportional to maturity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Biochemical composition of reserve and structure is considered to be that of [[generalised compound]]s, and is constant (the assumption of strong homeostasis) but not necessarily identical. Biochemical transformation from food to reserve (assimilation), and from reserve to structure (growth) include overhead costs. These overheads, together with processes of somatic and maturity [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]] and reproduction overheads (inefficiencies in transformation from reserve to reproductive material), all contribute to the consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide, i.e. [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== DEB models ==
All dynamic energy budget models follow the energy budget of an individual organism throughout its life cycle; by contrast,"static" energy budget models describe a specific life stage or [[size]] of an organism.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lika|first=Konstadia|last2=Nisbet|first2=Roger M.|date=2000-10-01|title=A Dynamic Energy Budget model based on partitioning of net production|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002850000049|journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=361–386|doi=10.1007/s002850000049|issn=0303-6812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantage of the DEB-theory based model over most other models is its description of energy assimilation and utilization ([[Dynamic reserve|reserve dynamics]]) simultaneously with decoupled processes of growth, [[Developmental biology|development/ maturation]], and [[Maintenance of an organism|maintenance]].&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Casey A.|last2=Augustine|first2=Starrlight|last3=Kooijman|first3=Sebastiaan A.L.M.|last4=Kearney|first4=Michael R.|last5=Seymour|first5=Roger S.|title=The trade-off between maturation and growth during accelerated development in frogs|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S109564331200308X|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Molecular &amp; Integrative Physiology|volume=163|issue=1|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.05.190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DEB theory specifies [[dynamic reserve|reserve]]s as separate from structure: these are the two [[state variable]]s that contribute to physical volume, and (in combination with reproduction buffer of adults) fully define the size of an individual. Maturity (also a [[state variable]] of the model) tracks how much energy has been invested into maturation, and therefore determines the life stage of the organism relative to maturity levels at which life stage transitions (birth and puberty) occur. Dynamics of the state variables are given by [[ordinary differential equation]]s which include the major processes of energy uptake and use: assimilation, mobilization, maintenance, growth, maturation, and reproduction.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

* Food is transformed into reserve, which fuels all other metabolic processes. The feeding rate is proportional to the surface area; food handling time and the transformation efficiency from food to reserve are independent of food density.
* A fixed fraction (kappa) of mobilized reserve is allocated to somatic maintenance plus growth (soma), the rest on maturity maintenance plus maturation or reproduction. Maintenance has priority over other processes. Somatic maintenance is proportional to structural body volume, and maturity maintenance to maturity. Heating costs for endotherms and osmostic work (for fresh water organisms) are somatic maintenance costs that are proportional to surface area.
* Stage transitions occur if the cumulated investment into [[Developmental biology|maturation]] exceeds threshold values. Life stages typically are: embryo, juvenile, and adult. Reserve that is allocated to reproduction is first accumulated in a buffer. The rules for converting the buffer to gametes are species-specific (e.g. spawning can be once per season).

[[Parametrization|Parameters]] of the model are individual specific, but similarities between individuals of the same species yield species-specific parameter estimations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/MarqAugu2018.html|title=The AmP project: Comparing Species on the Basis of Dynamic Energy Budget Parameters|last=Marques, G.

Estimated parameters are collected in the online library called the [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/index.html Add-my-pet project].

===The standard DEB model===
The standard model quantifies the metabolism of an [[isomorph]] (organism that does not change in shape during ontogeny) that feeds on one type of food with a constant composition (therefore the weak [[homeostasis]] applies, i.e. the chemical composition of the body is constant). The state variables of the individual are 1 reserve, 1 structure, maturity, and (in the adult stage) the reproduction buffer. Parameter values are constant throughout life. The reserve density at birth equals that of the mother at egg formation. [[Foetus]]es develop similarly, but receive unrestricted amount of reserve from the mother during development.

===Extensions of the standard model===

DEB theory has been extended into many directions, such as 
*effects of changes in shape during growth (e.g. [[V1-morph]]s and [[V0-morph]]s)
*non-standard embryo-&gt;juvenile-&gt;adult transitions, for example in holometabolic insects &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Llandres|first=Ana L.|last2=Marques|first2=Gonçalo M.|last3=Maino|first3=James L.|last4=Kooijman|first4=S.

== Criticism ==
The main criticism is directed to the formal presentation of the theory (heavy mathematical jargon), number of listed parameters, the symbol heavy notation, and the fact that modeled (state) variables and parameters are abstract quantities which cannot be directly measured, all making it less likely to reach its intended audience (ecologists) and be an "efficient" theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquet|first=Pablo A.|last2=Allen|first2=Andrew P.|last3=Brown|first3=James H.|last4=Dunne|first4=Jennifer A.|last5=Enquist|first5=Brian J.|last6=Gillooly|first6=James F.|last7=Gowaty|first7=Patricia A.|last8=Green|first8=Jessica L.|last9=Harte|first9=John|date=2014-08-01|title=On Theory in Ecology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/8/701/2754269|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=8|pages=701–710|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu098|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent publications aim to present the DEB theory in an "easier to digest" content to "bridge the ecology-mathematics gap".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The general methodology of estimation of DEB parameters from data is described in [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Meer2006.html van der Meer 2006]; [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/KooySous2008.html Kooijman et al 2008] shows which particular compound parameters can be estimated from a few simple observations at a single food density and how an increasing number of parameters can be estimated if more quantities are observed at several food densities. A natural sequence exists in which parameters can be known in principle. In addition, routines for data entry and scripts for parameter estimation are available as a free and documented software package [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/manual/index.html DEBtool], aiming to provide a ready-to-use tool for users with less mathematical and programing background. Number of parameters, also pointed as relatively sparse for a bioenergetic model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; vary depending on the main application and, because the whole life cycle of an organism is defined, the overall number of parameters per data-set ratio is relatively low.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Michael R.|last2=Domingos|first2=Tiago|last3=Nisbet|first3=Roger|date=2015-04-01|title=Dynamic Energy Budget Theory: An Efficient and General Theory for Ecology|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/65/4/341/255084|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=65|issue=4|pages=341–341|doi=10.1093/biosci/biv013|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the DEB (abstract) and measured properties is done by simple mathematical operations which include auxiliary parameters (also defined by the DEB theory and included in the [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/debtool/DEBtool_M/manual/index.html DEBtool] routines), and include also switching between energy-time and mass-time contexts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  [https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/index.html Add my pet (AmP)] project explores parameter pattern values across taxa.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike simpler models like the [[MOSFET#Modes of operation|Quadratic Model]], the EKV Model is accurate even when the MOSFET is operating in the subthreshold region (e.g. when V&lt;sub&gt;bulk&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt; then the MOSFET is subthreshold when V&lt;sub&gt;gate-source&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;Threshold&lt;/sub&gt;). In addition, it models many of the specialized effects seen in [[Micrometre|submicrometre]] [[CMOS]] [[Integrated Circuit|IC]] design.

As each egg was laid, it would roll from the hen's cage and trigger a mercury switch, connected to a panel. The panel would relay a pulse to the Eggatron, prompting a converted P.M.G. teletyper to print and time-stamp on a roll of paper tape.

The Eggatron is but one of many [[tron]]-like developments of Cold War science that sought to control nature through technology, primarily through large centralized computer systems. The development of the [[phytotron]], [[algatron]], ecotron and zootron represents the explosion of these technologies through the 1950s and 1960s.

{{General relativity |phenomena}}

In [[general relativity]], an '''event horizon''' is a region in [[spacetime]] beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer.  In layman's terms, it is defined as the shell of "points of no return", i.e., the boundary at which the gravitational pull of a massive object becomes so great as to make escape impossible. An event horizon is most commonly associated with [[black holes]].  Light emitted from inside the event horizon can never reach the outside observer.  Likewise, any object approaching the horizon from the observer's side appears to slow down and never quite pass through the horizon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Eric | last=Chaisson | title=Relatively Speaking: Relativity, Black Holes, and the Fate of the Universe | page=213 | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | year=1990 | isbn=978-0393306750}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its image becoming more and more [[redshift]]ed as time elapses. This means that the wavelength of the light emitted from the object is getting longer as the object moves away from the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jeffrey | last=Bennett |last2=Donahue | first2= Megan | author2-link = Megan Donahue |last3=Schneider |first3= Nicholas| last4=Voit |first4=Mark|title=The Cosmic Perspective | page=156 | publisher=[[Pearson Education]] | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-134-05906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traveling object, however, experiences no strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the horizon in a finite amount of [[proper time]].

More specific types of horizon include the related but distinct [[Absolute horizon|absolute]] and [[apparent horizon]]s found around a black hole.  Still other distinct notions include the [[Cauchy horizon|Cauchy]] and [[Killing horizon]]s; the [[photon sphere]]s and [[ergosphere]]s of the [[Kerr solution]]; [[particle horizon|particle]] and [[cosmological horizon]]s relevant to [[cosmology]]; and [[isolated horizon|isolated]] and [[dynamical horizon]]s important in current black hole research.

One of the best-known examples of an event horizon derives from general relativity's description of a [[black hole]], a celestial object so massive that no nearby matter or radiation can escape its [[gravitational field]].  Often,  this is described as the boundary within which the black hole's [[escape velocity]] is greater than the [[speed of light]].  However,  a more accurate description is that within this horizon, all [[lightlike]] paths (paths that light could take) and hence all paths in the forward [[light cone]]s of particles within the horizon, are warped so as to fall farther into the hole. Once a particle is inside the horizon, moving into the hole is as inevitable as moving forward in time, and can actually be thought of as equivalent to doing so, depending on the spacetime coordinate system used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time |first1=S.

The surface at the [[Schwarzschild radius]] acts as an event horizon in a non-rotating body that fits inside this radius (although a [[rotating black hole]] operates slightly differently). The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to its mass. Theoretically, any amount of matter will become a black hole if compressed into a space that fits within its corresponding Schwarzschild radius. For the mass of the [[Sun]] this radius is approximately 3 kilometers and for the [[Earth]] it is about 9 millimeters. In practice, however, neither the Earth nor the Sun has the necessary mass and therefore the necessary gravitational force, to overcome [[Electron degeneracy pressure|electron]] and [[neutron degeneracy pressure]]. The minimal mass required for a star to be able to collapse beyond these pressures is the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]], which is approximately three solar masses.

Black hole event horizons are widely misunderstood. Common, although erroneous, is the notion that black holes "vacuum up" material in their neighborhood, where in fact they are no more capable of seeking out material to consume than any other gravitational attractor. As with any mass in the universe, matter must come within its gravitational scope for the possibility to exist of capture or consolidation with any other mass. Equally common is the idea that matter can be observed falling into a black hole. This is not possible. Astronomers can detect only [[accretion disk]]s around black holes, where material moves with such speed that friction creates high-energy radiation which can be detected (similarly, some matter from these accretion disks is forced out along the axes of spin of the black hole, creating visible jets when these streams interact with matter such as interstellar gas or when they happen to be aimed directly at Earth). Furthermore, a distant observer will never actually see something reach the horizon. Instead, while approaching the hole, the object will seem to go ever more slowly, while any light it emits will be further and further redshifted.

==Cosmic event horizon==
{{Main|Cosmological horizons}}

In [[cosmology]], the event horizon of the [[observable universe]]  is the largest [[comoving distance]] from which light emitted ''now'' can ever reach the observer in the future. This differs from the concept of [[particle horizon]], which  represents the largest comoving distance from which light emitted in the ''past'' could have reached the observer at a given time. For events beyond that distance, light has not had time to reach our location, even if it were emitted at the time the universe began. How the particle horizon changes with time depends on the nature of the [[expansion of the universe]]. If the expansion has certain characteristics, there are parts of the universe that will never be observable, no matter how long the observer waits for light from those regions to arrive. The boundary past which events cannot ever be observed is an event horizon, and it represents the maximum extent of the particle horizon.

The criterion for determining whether a particle horizon for the universe exists is as follows. Define a [[comoving distance]] ''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' as
:&lt;math&gt;d_p=\int_{0}^{t_0} \frac{c}{a(t)} \,dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''a'' is the [[scale factor (universe)|scale factor]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the age of the Universe. If {{nowrap|''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' [[Limit (mathematics)|→ ∞]]}} (i.e., points arbitrarily as far away as can be observed), then no event horizon exists. If {{nowrap|''d&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ∞}}, a horizon is present.

Examples of cosmological models without an event horizon are universes dominated by [[matter]] or by [[light|radiation]]. An example of a cosmological model with an event horizon is a universe dominated by the [[cosmological constant]] (a [[de Sitter universe]]).

A calculation of the speeds of the cosmological event and particle horizons was given in a paper on the [[FLRW]] cosmological model, approximating the Universe as composed of non-interacting constituents, each one being [[Equation of state (cosmology)|a perfect fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Apparent horizon of an accelerated particle==
{{See also|Hyperbolic motion (relativity)}}
[[Image:Event-horizon-particle.svg|right|thumb|[[Minkowski diagram|Spacetime diagram]] showing a uniformly [[acceleration|accelerated]] particle, '''P''', and an event '''E''' that is outside the particle's apparent horizon. The event's forward [[light cone]] never intersects the particle's [[world line]].]]

If a particle is moving at a constant velocity in a non-expanding universe free of gravitational fields, any event that occurs in that Universe will eventually be observable by the particle, because the forward [[light cone]]s from these events intersect the particle's [[world line]]. On the other hand, if the particle is accelerating, in some situations light cones from some events never intersect the particle's world line. Under these conditions, an [[apparent horizon]] is present in the particle's (accelerating) reference frame, representing a boundary beyond which events are unobservable.

For example, this occurs with a uniformly accelerated particle. A [[Minkowski diagram|spacetime diagram]] of this situation is shown in the figure to the right. As the particle accelerates, it approaches, but never reaches, the [[speed of light]] with respect to its original reference frame. On the spacetime diagram, its path is a [[hyperbola]], which [[asymptote|asymptotically approaches]] a 45-degree line (the path of a light ray). An event whose light cone's edge is this asymptote or is farther away than this asymptote can never be observed by the accelerating particle. In the particle's reference frame, there appears to be a boundary behind it from which no signals can escape (an apparent horizon).

While approximations of this type of situation can occur in the real world {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} (in [[particle accelerator]]s, for example), a true event horizon is never present, as this requires the particle to be accelerated indefinitely (requiring arbitrarily large amounts of energy and an arbitrarily large apparatus).

==Interacting with an event horizon==
A misconception concerning event horizons, especially [[black hole]] event horizons, is that they represent an immutable surface that destroys objects that approach them. In practice, all event horizons appear to be some distance away from any observer, and objects sent towards an event horizon never appear to cross it from the sending observer's point of view (as the horizon-crossing event's [[light cone]] never intersects the observer's [[world line]]). Attempting to make an object near the horizon remain stationary with respect to an observer requires applying a force whose magnitude increases unboundedly (becoming infinite) the closer it gets.

In the case of a horizon perceived by a uniformly accelerating observer in empty space, the horizon seems to remain a fixed distance from the observer no matter how its surroundings move. Varying the observer's acceleration may cause the horizon to appear to move over time, or may prevent an event horizon from existing, depending on the acceleration function chosen. The observer never touches the horizon and never passes a location where it appeared to be.

In the case of a horizon perceived by an occupant of a [[de Sitter universe]], the horizon always appears to be a fixed distance away for a [[inertial frame of reference|non-accelerating]] observer. It is never contacted, even by an accelerating observer.

In the case of the horizon around a black hole, observers stationary with respect to a distant object will all agree on where the horizon is. While this seems to allow an observer lowered towards the hole on a rope (or rod) to contact the horizon, in practice this cannot be done. The [[proper length|proper distance]] to the horizon is finite,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Misner |first1=Charles |author1-link=Charles W. Misner |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |author2-link=Kip Thorne |last3=Wheeler |first3=John |author3-link=John Archibald Wheeler | title=Gravitation | publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]] | year=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0 |page=824|title-link=Gravitation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the length of rope needed would be finite as well, but if the rope were lowered slowly (so that each point on the rope was approximately at rest in [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]), the [[proper acceleration]] ([[G-force]]) experienced by points on the rope closer and closer to the horizon would approach infinity, so the rope would be torn apart. If the rope is lowered quickly (perhaps even in [[freefall]]), then indeed the observer at the bottom of the rope can touch and even cross the event horizon. But once this happens it is impossible to pull the bottom of rope back out of the event horizon, since if the rope is pulled taut, the forces along the rope increase without bound as they approach the event horizon and at some point the rope must break. Furthermore, the break must occur not at the event horizon, but at a point where the second observer can observe it.

Observers crossing a black hole event horizon can calculate the moment they have crossed it, but will not actually see or feel anything special happen at that moment. In terms of visual appearance, observers who fall into the hole perceive the black region constituting the horizon as lying at some apparent distance below them, and never experience crossing this visual horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/schw.html|title=Journey into a Schwarzschild black hole|website=jila.colorado.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other objects that had entered the horizon along the same radial path but at an earlier time would appear below the observer but still above the visual position of the horizon, and if they had fallen in recently enough the observer could exchange messages with them before either one was destroyed by the [[gravitational singularity]].&lt;ref name="casa.colorado.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/dive.html|title=Dive into the Black Hole|website=casa.colorado.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing [[tidal force]]s (and eventual impact with the hole's singularity) are the only locally noticeable effects. Tidal forces are a function of the mass of the black hole. In realistic [[stellar black hole]]s, [[spaghettification]] occurs early: tidal forces tear materials apart well before the event horizon. However, in [[supermassive black hole]]s, which are found in centers of galaxies, spaghettification occurs inside the event horizon. A human astronaut would survive the fall through an event horizon only in a black hole with a mass of approximately 10,000 [[solar mass]]es or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Relativity: An introduction for physicists|first1=Michael Paul

==Beyond general relativity==
The description of event horizons given by [[general relativity]] is thought to be incomplete. When the conditions under which event horizons occur are modeled using a more comprehensive picture of the way the Universe works, that includes both relativity and [[quantum mechanics]], event horizons are expected to have properties that are different from those predicted using general relativity alone.

At present, it is expected that the primary impact of quantum effects is for event horizons to possess a [[temperature]] and so emit radiation. For [[black hole]]s, this manifests as [[Hawking radiation]], and the larger question of how the black hole possesses a temperature is part of the topic of [[black hole thermodynamics]]. For accelerating particles, this manifests as the [[Unruh effect]], which causes space around the particle to appear to be filled with matter and radiation.

According to the controversial [[Firewall (physics)|black hole firewall]] hypothesis, matter falling into a black hole would be burned to a crisp by a high energy "firewall" at the event horizon.

An alternative is provided by the [[Black hole complementarity|complementarity principle]], according to which, in the chart of the far observer, infalling matter is thermalized at the horizon and reemitted as Hawking radiation, while in the chart of an infalling observer matter continues undisturbed through the inner region and is destroyed at the singularity. This hypothesis does not violate the [[no-cloning theorem]] as there is a single copy of the information according to any given observer. Black hole complementarity is actually suggested by the scaling laws of [[String Theory|strings]] approaching the event horizon, suggesting that in the Schwarzschild chart they stretch to cover the horizon and thermalize into a [[Planck length]]-thick membrane.

A complete description of event horizons is expected to, at minimum, require a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. One such candidate theory is [[M-theory]].  Another such candidate theory is [[Loop Quantum Gravity|loop quantum gravity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">An '''extreme environment''' contains conditions that are hard to survive for most known [[life form]]s. These conditions may be extremely high or low [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]; high or low content of [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]]; high levels of [[radiation]], [[acidity]], or [[alkalinity]]; absence of water; water containing a high concentration of salt or sugar; presence of [[sulphur]], [[petroleum]], and other [[toxic]] substances.

Examples of extreme environments include the [[geographical pole]]s, very arid [[deserts]], [[volcano]]es, deep [[ocean trench]]es, [[upper atmosphere]], [[Mt Everest]], [[outer space]], and the environments of every [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]] except the [[Earth]]. Any organisms living in these conditions are often very well adapted to their living circumstances, which is usually a result of long-term evolution. Physiologists have long known that organisms living in extreme environments are especially likely to exhibit clear examples of evolutionary adaptation because of the presumably intense past natural selection they have experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Jr., T., and P. A. Carter. 1994. Evolutionary physiology. Annual Review of Physiology 56:579–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On Earth==
The distribution of extreme environments on [[Earth]] has varied through [[geological time]]. Humans generally do not inhabit extreme environments. There are organisms referred to as [[extremophile]]s that do live in such conditions and are so well-adapted that they readily grow and multiply.

==Beyond Earth==
Most of the moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] are also extreme environments. [[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] have not yet found life in any environments beyond Earth, though experiments have shown that [[tardigrades]] can survive the harsh vacuum and intense radiation of outer space. The conceptual modification of  conditions in locations beyond Earth, to make them more habitable by humans and other terrestrial organisms, is known as [[terraforming]].

==Types==
Among extreme environments are [[alkaline]], [[acidic]], extremely cold, extremely hot, [[hyper-saline]], places without water or [[oxygen]], and places altered by humans, such as mine [[tailings]] or oil impacted habitats.

* Radiation: broadly conceived as habitats exposed to abnormally high [[radiation]] or of radiation outside the normal range of light. Includes habitats exposed to high UV and IR radiation.
* Without water: broadly conceived as habitats without free water whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes hot and cold desert environments, and some endolithic habitats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12262">'''Eye music''' (often referred to in English by its exact German translation ''Augenmusik'') describes graphical features of [[Sheet music|score]]s that when performed are unnoticeable by the listener.

==Difficulties in defining eye music==
A clear definition of eye music is elusive, for the border between eye music, [[word painting]], and representations of melody and form depends on the relationships of composer, performer, and listener.&lt;ref name="dart"&gt;Dart, Thurston. "Eye music." New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Stanley Sadie, ed. London:Macmillan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye music and puzzle-solving===
The difficulty in definition is also apparent with border-line cryptographic [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] works such as [[Canon (music)#Puzzle canon|puzzle canons]], which appear in the score entirely as a bare line of notes with [[clefs]], [[Rest (music)|rests]], [[time signature]]s, or [[key signatures]] as clues to reveal multiple lines of music in canon. (Closer to true cryptographic works would be those with [[soggetto cavato]], where letters are embedded in the work using their [[solfège]] names.)&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; As an example, a puzzle canon might be notated as one line of music with two key signatures and clefs, where the worked-out result will be a two-voice canon with one voice the [[Canon (music)#Retrograde|retrograde]] (reverse) of the other. In itself the score with the clues alone is not eye music. But represent the same work "graphically spelled out," however, say with a drawing of the clued score facing a mirror, and the score/drawing becomes eye music.&lt;ref&gt;For many such figures of music graphically portrayed in mirrors, helixes, etc. ''see'' Hofstadter, Douglas R. Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (New York: Basic Books [1979] 1999. {{ISBN|0-394-75682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''type'' of puzzle canon is also a factor. A four-voiced circular canon, when notated as a puzzle canon, may remain an un-worked-out single line of notes, and be inadmissible as eye music. When that single line of notes is inscribed in a graphical shape it becomes eye music, even if the [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] puzzle remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt;

An even finer use of graphical conceit is when the canon does not have any musical way to end, and are in a sense "infinite"—classically referred to as ''canon perpetuus,'' more commonly as "circular canons," and even more commonly as "[[round (music)|rounds]]." When an infinite (circular) canon is inscribed in a circle, and the ''circle itself'' is a  clue that means "play me as a round," a different type of eye music entails.

===Eye music for the performer===
Another class of eye music is when the score is purposely made difficult for the performer.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; For example, in [[Benedetto Marcello]]'s cantata ''Stravaganze d’amore,'' the [[Figured bass|continuo]] part is written entirely in [[enharmonic]] chords, that is, "puns" of chord indications spelled with no regard to the key of the rest of the ensemble, but (in [[equal temperament]]) indistinguishable audibly from those spelled in the appropriate way. Here, the perverse spelling (whether humorous or annoying to the trained continuo player) is not unusual graphically, but represents a score writing unmotivated except as an inside joke between composer and performer, and is unhearable by the listener.

The ''Gulliver Suite'' by [[Telemann]] discussed below, shows a combination of three eye music features. The score is made difficult "unnecessarily," is eye-catching for its graphics, and has a clever external reference, all unnoticeable to the listener.

==The Renaissance==
[[Image:Cordier circular canon.gif|170 px|thumb|right|[[Baude Cordier]]'s ''Tout par compas suy composés.'']] 
[[Image:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|left|Cordier's ''Belle, bonne, sage'' with a red notation heart of notes within the larger heart.]]Two examples of eye music from the early Renaissance are from [[Baude Cordier]], (ca. 1380-ca.1440). Cordier's chanson about love ''Belle, bonne, sage'' is in a heart shape, with red notes ([[Ars subtilior#Notational characteristics|coloration]]) indicating rhythmic alterations. Eye-music-within-eye music is in the small group of notes hanging like a locket in the upper left, also all in red and in the shape of a heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icking-music-archive.org/ByComposer/Cordier.php A modern transcription and music media file of "''Belle, bonne, sage.''"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another work of Cordier, this time inscribed in circles, ''Tout par compas suy composés'' ("With a compass was I composed"), goes out of its way to identify itself as eye music.&lt;ref&gt;Bergsagel, John. "Cordier's Circular Canon." ''The Musical Times,'' 113:1558 (Dec., 1972), pp. 1175-1177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josquin des Prez]], the most important composer of the next generation, used [[Mensural notation#Note values|black note notation]] eye music in his well-known ''Nymphes des bois,'' a lament over the death of the composer [[Ockeghem]], as well as another lament, this time for the composer [[Jacob Obrecht]], ''Absolve, quaesumus, Domine.''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Elders, Willem. "Zeichen und Symbol in der altniederländischen Totenklage." In Zeichen und Struktur in der Musik der Renaissance: Ein Symposium aus Anlaß der Jahrestagung der Gesellschaft für Musikforschung Münster. Westfalen (1987) pp. 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It can be seen that words of death and lament are associated with black notes, a [[mannerism]] made even simpler to achieve in light of the contemporaneous simplification to [[Mensural notation#Note values|white note]] notation. This feature of eye music would extend through the [[Humanism|Humanist]] period.

[[Image:Dosi_allegory_canon.png|thumb|left|A detail from [[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Allegory of Music'' with an anonymous [[canon (music)|canon]] notated in a circle and a canon by [[Josquin]] notated in a triangle. (The notes of the triangular canon can be seen on the original painting under raking light.)]] Another instance of eye music in the Renaissance is apparently unique—the representation of a triangle for a canonic piece, which appears in juxtaposition with an anonymous canon written in a circle—in [[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Allegory of Music.''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Slim, H. Colin. "Dosso Dossi's Allegory at Florence about Music." ''Journal of the American Musicological Society.'' 43:No. 1 (April 1990), pp. 43–98.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the two types of representation—the circle and the inherent symbolism of the tenets of Christianity in the triangle—are both suggestive of a sense of the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;A transcription of the canon written as a circle is in Slim, pp. 53-55. The triangle canon is transcribed on p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The work represented in the triangle, is part of a "rough" version of a puzzle canon in Josquin's Agnus Dei II from his ''[[Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales]]'' canonic mass. It has the superscript "trinitas in un[um]" ("three in one") as a clue to its solution, is a [[Canon (music)#Mensuration and tempo canons|mensuration canon]] of 3:1, and has one voice take part at the interval of a fifth, that is, 3:2. Its relation to the Christian [[Holy Trinity]] is clear, suggesting the use of a triangular representation. The representation is unique, although possibly from a copy used by Dossi.&lt;ref&gt;On the implication of "transcendance" expressed by the theoretically infinite repetition in many canons, ''see'' Chafe, Eric. " Allegorical Music: The "Symbolism" of Tonal Language in the Bach Canons." ''The Journal of Musicology'' 3:4 (Autumn, 1984), pp. 340-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanism==
[[Image:John bull sphera mundi.gif|thumb|[[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]]'s 6-part circular canon ''Sphera mundi.'' (From an 18th-century MS.)]]With the significant shift of style of composers of the [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] movement—the rediscovery and translation of Greek texts in the mid-16th century—eye music flourished. The change in musical practice, particularly with the [[madrigal (music)|madrigalists]] and their focus on text declamation, at a word-by-word basis, was fertile ground for eye music. Words that suggest "blackness," such as "death" or "night," receive "black" notes (e.g. [[quarter note]]s, [[eighth note]]s); "white words" such as "light" or "pale" receive "white" notes (e.g. [[whole note]]s, [[half note]]s).&lt;ref name="einstein1"&gt;Einstein, Alfred. "Augenmusik im Madrigal." ''Zeitschrift für internationazional Musikgesellschaft,'' XIX (1912–13), pp. 8–21; partly trans. in The Italian Madrigal, transl. Krappe, [[Roger Sessions|Sessions]], and [[Oliver Strunk|Strunk]]. 3 Vol. Princeton:Princeton University Press, (1949) 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Italian madrigalists from the 1580s until the early 17th century (whose style was almost literally imported to England), eye music reached its apogee until its transformation in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="einstein2"&gt;''See'' Einstein, Alfred. The Italian Madrigal, transl. Krappe, [[Roger Sessions|Sessions]], and [[Oliver Strunk|Strunk]]. 3 Vol. Princeton:Princeton University Press, (1949) 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luca Marenzio]] is considered the composer most fond of eye music.&lt;ref name="einstein2"/&gt; For example, in the madrigal ''Senza il mia sole'' from his ''Madrigali a quattro, cinque e sei voci'' (1588), black notes are used for "chiuser le luci" ("close their eyes")&lt;ref&gt;Steele, John. "Lamenting Marenzio." ''The Musical Times,'' 120:1636 (June, 1979), pp. 497 and 499.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Marenzio's standing among madrigalists and his use of eye music, ''see'' Lang, Paul Henry. "Editorial." ''The Musical Quarterly '' 35:3 (July 1949), pp. 437-447.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reaction by theorists of the time was mixed. A leading musical humanist, [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (the father of the physicist), was opposed to it but [[Zarlino]] approved.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; In the 20th century, [[Alfred Einstein]], a groundbreaking scholar of the Humanist madrigal, wrote that eye music is "the most extreme and (for our aesthetic convictions) most horrible testimony of naturalism, of ''imitazione,'' in the madrigal."&lt;ref&gt;''Das übertriebenste und (für unser ästhetisches Empfinden) grausamste Zeugnis des Naturalismus, der imitazione, im Madrigal.'' Einstein,'' Op. cit.'', p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque==
[[Image:Telemann Gulliver Suite.jpg|thumb|right|The notes for scampering Lilliputians and ponderous Brobdingnag in [[Telemann]]'s ''Gulliver Suite.'' {{audio|Telemann Gulliver Suite Lilliputian.mid|Play Chaconne}} and {{audio|Telemann Gulliver Suite Brobigdinian.mid|Play gigue}}]]

In [[Telemann]]'s ''Gulliver Suite'' for two violins the note values in the [[chaconne]] are "[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputian]]",  and, in the [[gigue]], are [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|"Brobdingnagian"]] ones. Because the Lilliputian movement is written in the bizarre [[time signature]] of {{music|time|3|32}}, and the Brobdingnagian one in the equally obtuse {{music|time|24|1}} (which is doubly humorous because gigues are generally light and brisk), the time signatures reduce to {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|12|8}}, perfectly normal ones for each movement, as are the tempos associated with them and the type of dance of each.

==20th century==
Post-tonal music has seen an expansion of eye music in line with its expansion and experimentalism of musical techniques. The last examples using a rigorous scoring system rooted in standard practice are the finely turned circles and spirals (as well as a peace symbol and a crucifix) in the works of [[George Crumb]].

===Graphic notation===
The beauties of many examples of [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] are not, in fact, a feature of eye music. As novel and attractive as the graphics may be in these scores, they function entirely as performance indications or true records of compositional method (such as the Steiner score shown here). Also often seen are graphical or [[conceptual art]] works that use the symbols of music notation but are not performing scores at all, such as  [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s 1919 ''In futurum (Zeitmaß-zeitlos).''{{cn|date=August 2012}}

The data from the family aggregation studies have been extensively studied to determine the mode of inheritance of [[schizophrenia]].

[[File:Von einem Schrecklichen vnd Wunderbarlichen Cometen so sich den Dienstag nach Martini dieses lauffenden M. D. Lxxvij. Jahrs am Himmel erzeiget hat (grayscale).png|right|thumb|250px|The Great Comet of 1577, depicted in a woodcut, over [[Prague]]]]
A '''great comet''' is a [[comet]] that becomes exceptionally bright. There is no official definition; often the term is attached to comets such as [[Halley's Comet]], which are bright enough to be noticed by casual observers who are not looking for them, and become well known outside the astronomical community. Great comets are rare; on average, only one will appear in a [[decade]]. Although comets are officially named after their discoverers, great comets are sometimes also referred to by the year in which they appeared great, using the formulation "The Great Comet of ...", followed by the year.

== Causes ==
[[File:Verschuier1680.jpg|thumb|250px|The Great Comet of 1680 over [[Rotterdam]] as painted by [[Lieve Verschuier]]]]
The vast majority of comets are never bright enough to be seen by the naked eye, and generally pass through the inner [[Solar System]] unseen by anyone except [[astronomers]]. However, occasionally a comet may brighten to naked eye visibility, and even more rarely it may become as bright as or brighter than the brightest stars. The requirements for this to occur are: a large and active [[cometary nucleus|nucleus]], a close approach to the [[Sun]], and a close approach to the [[Earth]]. A comet fulfilling all three of these criteria will certainly be spectacular. Sometimes, a comet failing on one criterion will still be extremely impressive. For example, [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] had an exceptionally large and active nucleus, but did not approach the Sun very closely at all, yet it still became an extremely famous and well observed comet. Equally, [[Comet Hyakutake]] was a rather small comet, but appeared bright because it passed extremely close to the Earth.

=== Size and activity of the nucleus ===
Cometary nuclei vary in size from a few hundreds of metres across or less to many kilometres across. When they approach the Sun, large amounts of [[gas]] and [[dust]] are ejected by cometary nuclei, due to solar heating. A crucial factor in how bright a comet becomes is how large and how active its nucleus is. After many returns to the inner Solar System, cometary nuclei become depleted in volatile materials and thus are much less bright than comets which are making their first passage through the Solar System.

The sudden brightening of comet [[17P/Holmes]] in 2007 showed the importance of the activity of the nucleus in the comet's brightness. On October 23–24, 2007, the comet suffered a sudden outburst which caused it to brighten by factor of about half a million. It unexpectedly brightened from an [[apparent magnitude]] of about 17 to about 2.8 in a period of only 42 hours, making it visible to the naked eye. All these temporarily made comet 17P the largest (by radius) object in the Solar System although its nucleus is estimated to be only about 3.4&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.

=== Close perihelion approach ===
The brightness of a simple reflective body varies with the [[inverse square]] of its distance from the Sun. That is, if an object's distance from the Sun is halved, its brightness is quadrupled. However, comets behave differently, due to their ejection of large amounts of volatile gas which then also reflect sunlight and may also [[fluorescence|fluoresce]]. Their brightness varies roughly as the inverse cube of their distance from the Sun, meaning that if a comet's distance from the Sun is halved, it will become eight times as bright.

This means that the peak brightness of a comet depends significantly on its distance from the Sun. For most comets, the [[perihelion]] of their orbit lies outside the Earth's orbit. Any comet approaching the Sun to within 0.5 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] or less may have a chance of becoming a great comet.

=== Close approach to the Earth ===
[[Image:Comet Halley.jpg|thumb|185px|right|[[Halley's Comet]]'s 1986 apparition was unusually modest in brightness.]]
For a comet to become spectacular, it also needs to pass close to the Earth if it is to be easily seen. [[Halley's Comet]], for example, is usually very bright when it passes through the inner Solar System every seventy-six years, but during its 1986 [[periodic comet|apparition]], its closest approach to Earth was almost the most distant possible. The comet became visible to the naked eye, but was unspectacular. On the other hand, the intrinsically small and faint [[Comet Hyakutake]] (C/1996 B2) appeared very bright and spectacular due to its very close approach to Earth at its nearest during March 1996. Its passage near the Earth was one of the closest cometary approaches on record.

'''''Grome''''' is an environmental modeling package developed by Quad Software dedicated for procedural and manual generation of large virtual outdoor worlds suitable for games and other 3D real-time simulation applications.

== History ==
After more than two years of internal developing, the program was first launched on {{#dateformat:March 28, 2007}} as version 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamershell.com/companies/garage_games/400947.html Joint announcement of collaboration with GarageGames]&lt;/ref&gt; It immediately started to be used by various professional game studios and independent developers. Version 1.1 was launched on {{#dateformat:August 22, 2007}} adding various optimizations, pen tablet support and more flexibility by introducing user defined data sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15219 Grome 1.1 Launch Announcement (Gamasutra)]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this was version 1.2 on {{#dateformat:March 12, 2008}} which optimized existing fractal tools and added new ones, extended import and export with new data formats and introduced the Grome scripting language for automated tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17833 Grome 1.2 Launch Announcement (Gamasutra)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major release, 2.0, was introduced on {{#dateformat:June 18, 2009}} with many new additions. With this new version, Grome becomes a more complete outdoor editing platform by introducing editing of water surfaces, vegetation and other decoration layers. 64bit processing was introduced to take advantage of large amounts of RAM and 64bit CPUs. With this version, Quad Software announced the availability for customization work for professional studios that need a specific Grome version for their projects.

The Grome 3.0 version was launched on {{#dateformat:April 4, 2011}} bringing road networks editing, support for per-pixel materials, optimization tools for mobiles and low-end hardware and other new tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengl.org/news/comments/grome-3.0-the-opengl-based-scene-editor-launched/ Grome 3.0 Launch Announcement on OpenGL official site]&lt;/ref&gt; A new updated, version 3.1, was launched on October 12, 2011 with focus on optimization. A further update, version 3.11, was made on September 12, 2012, fixing various issues and improving the SDK.

==Main Features==
===General===

{{Refimprove|article|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Rezidual Stress.JPG|thumb|A hot-rolled HSS-shape tubing cut open with a bandsaw, demonstrating [[residual stress]].]]

A '''hollow structural section''' ('''HSS''') is a type of metal [[profile (engineering)|profile]] with a hollow tubular [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. The term is used predominantly in the United States, or other countries which follow US construction or engineering terminology.

HSS members can be circular, square, or rectangular sections, although other shapes such as elliptical are also available. HSS is only composed of [[structural steel]] per code.

HSS is sometimes mistakenly referenced as ''hollow structural steel''. Rectangular and square HSS are also commonly called ''tube steel'' or ''structural tubing''. Circular HSS are sometimes mistakenly called ''[[steel pipe]]'', although true steel [[Pipe (material)|pipe]] is actually dimensioned and classed differently from HSS. (HSS dimensions are based on exterior dimensions of the profile; pipes are also manufactured to an exterior tolerance, albeit to a different standard.)  The corners of HSS are heavily rounded, having a radius which is approximately twice the wall thickness. The wall thickness is uniform around the section.

In the UK, or other countries which follow British construction or engineering terminology, the term ''HSS'' is not used.  Rather, the three basic shapes are referenced as CHS, SHS, and RHS, being circular, square, and rectangular hollow sections.  Typically, these designations will also relate to metric sizes, thus the dimensions and tolerances differ slightly from HSS.

==Use in structures==
HSS, especially rectangular sections, are commonly used in welded steel frames where members experience loading in multiple directions. Square and circular HSS have very efficient shapes for this multiple-axis loading as they have uniform geometry along two or more cross-sectional axes, and thus uniform strength characteristics. This makes them good choices for [[column]]s. They also have excellent resistance to [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]].

HSS can also be used as [[beam (structure)|beams]], although ''wide flange'' or [[I-beam]] shapes are in many cases a more efficient structural shape for this application. However, the HSS has superior resistance to [[buckling|lateral torsional buckling]].

The flat square surfaces of rectangular HSS can ease construction, and they are sometimes preferred for architectural aesthetics in exposed structures, although elliptical HSS are becoming more popular in exposed structures for the same aesthetic reasons.

In the recent past, HSS was commonly available in [[mild steel]], such as [[A500 steel|A500 grade B]]. Today, HSS is commonly available in [[mild steel]], [[A500 steel|A500 grade C]]. Other steel grades available for HSS are A847 (weathering steel), A1065 (large sections up to 50 inch sq made with SAW process), and recently approved A1085 (higher strength, tighter tolerances than A500).

==Manufacture==
Square HSS is made the same way as pipe. During the manufacturing process flat steel plate is gradually changed in shape to become round where the edges are presented ready to weld. The edges are then welded together to form the mother tube. During the manufacturing process the mother tube goes through a series of shaping stands which form the round HSS (mother tube) into the final square or rectangular shape. Most American manufacturers adhere to the ASTM A500 or newly adopted ASTM A1085 standards, while Canadian manufacturers follow both ASTM A500 and CSA G40.21. European hollow sections are generally in accordance with the EN 10210 standard.

==Filled HSS==
HSS is often filled with concrete to improve fire rating, as well as robustness. When this is done, the product is referred to as a ''[[Lally column]]'' after its inventor John Lally of Waltham, Massachusetts. (The pronunciation is often corrupted to ''lolly column''.) For example, barriers around parking areas ([[bollard]]s) made of HSS are often filled, to at least bumper height, with concrete. This is an inexpensive (when replacement costs are factored in) way of adding compressive strength to the bollard, which can help prevent unsightly local denting, though it does not generally significantly increase the overall structural properties of the bollard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">'''HCISec''' is the study of interaction between humans and computers, or [[human–computer interaction]], specifically as it pertains to [[information security]].  Its aim, in plain terms, is to improve the [[usability]] of security features in [[end user]] applications.  

Unlike HCI, which has roots in the early days of [[Xerox PARC]] during the 1970s, HCISec is a nascent field of study by comparison. Interest in this topic tracks with that of [[Internet security]], which has become an area of broad public concern only in very recent years.

When security features exhibit poor usability, the following are common reasons:

* they were added in casual afterthought
* they were hastily patched in to address newly discovered [[security bug]]s
* they address very complex [[use case]]s without the benefit of a [[Wizard (software)|software wizard]]
* their interface designers lacked understanding of related security concepts
* their interface designers were not usability experts (often meaning they were the application developers themselves)

The '''Hussain Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry''', ICCBS, widely known as HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, is an [[Applied science|advanced]] [[Research institute| research center]] in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh province|Sindh Province]] of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry"&gt;{{Cite web   | last =HEJ-RIC    | first =HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry   | authorlink =   | coauthors =    | title =History of HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry | work =    | publisher =HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry   | url =http://www.iccs.edu/hej/index.php   | doi =    | accessdate=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Prof. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui established a postgraduate institute of chemistry in the department of Chemistry, University of Karachi. Dr. Atta ur Rahman joined the Institute later on after obtaining Ph.D. from the Kings College, Cambridge University, later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. Currently the institute is led by Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary as the director of the ICCBS. The HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry (HEJRIC) oversees Pakistan’s largest doctoral program in a single field of interest. The main areas of student training and research include natural product, protein and synthetic organic chemistry, computational medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and plant biotechnology. Specific areas of research relate largely to pharmacological studies of novel natural products and protein chemistry. 

==Overview==
On the retirement of Professor [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] (FRS) as Chairman PCSIR, his services were taken up by the University of Karachi and a "Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry" was established under his Directorship in 1967 in a wing of the Department of Chemistry. PCSIR provided the services of some of its staff (including Dr. Viqar Uddin Ahmad and Dr. Zafar H. Zaidi) and furniture during the initial phase of the establishment of this institute. Dr. Atta ur Rahman joined the Institute in March 1969 after obtaining Ph.D. from the Kings College, Cambridge University, later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. He was then sent by Cambridge University to the University of Karachi during 1971-74 to assist in the setting up of a modern postgraduate institute of chemistry, and he brought with him donations of gas chromatograph, balances and a combustion microanalyser from Cambridge University.
Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman succeeded in obtaining grants to acquire a new mass and NMR spectrometers, both of which were installed in 1973, within a year of his return to Pakistan. He was appointed as the Co-Director in 1977. He succeeded in winning several major projects for the institute from the West, which have transformed the institute into the finest center in Asia and one of the best in the world in the field of Natural Product Chemistry. A generous donation was offered to the University for the Institute by the leading philanthropist/industrialist Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal on behalf of the Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation in 1976, the largest donation at that time in the history of the country. The Institute was accordingly named as "Husein Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry", in the memory of late Mr. Husein Ebrahim Jamal.
The efforts of Professor Dr. W. Voelter of Tuebingen University, Germany, deserve a special praise since the initial grant of 2.3 million DM from the Republic of Germany was largely due to his untiring efforts, and collaborative researches continue with his group till today.
Professor Atta-ur-Rahman was appointed as the Director in January 1990, while Professor Viqar Uddin Ahmad took over as Co-Director in 1990. In 2000, Professor Bina S. Siddiqui was appointed as the Co-Director on the retirement of Professor Ahmad, while in 2002 Professor Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary was given the responsibilities of the Director (Acting) of ICCBS and Co-Director of Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research. In September 2008, he was appointed as the Director of the ICCBS institutions. During last ten years, the institute has gone through a rapid and unprecedented expansion, both in terms of infrastructure development and academic programs, while maintaining the highest quality in research and student training.
The institute has organized a number of major international conferences and symposia on various aspects of Natural Product Chemistry, Spectroscopy and Protein Chemistry. The institute had the distinction of hosting the 19th IUPAC Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry in January 1994 in which over 500 scientists from 52 countries, including 4 Nobel Laureates participated.
Additionally the Institute has also been selected as one of the three library centers of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). The H.E.J. Institute has been designated as the W.H.O. Center for Pesticide Analysis for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The institute is also a member of the IUCN-International, WAITRO, and COMSATS. More recently the institute is designated as the OIC Center of Excellence in Chemical Sciences. In 2001, the H.E.J. Research Institute became a constituent institution of the International Center for Chemical Sciences (later named as International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences).
In 2004, the H.E.J. Research Institute received the most prestigious IDB (Islamic Development Bank) prize for the best science institution in the entire Islamic world. Recently, the IDB awarded the best science institution again to the H.E.J. Research Institute (second time), an unprecedented honor to any science institution in OIC region.
In August 2003, an Industrial Analytical Center was established as the service wing of H. E. J. Institute. Third World Center (TWC) Laboratory complex was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2005 as an extension of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry. The building of TWC was renamed as Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman Laboratories by the Executive Board in 2011, in recognition of the outstanding services of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman (FRS) who is now serving the ICCBS institution as the Patron-in-chief.
Molecular medicine is an emerging new field, which deals with the understanding of the molecular basis of diseases and then developing appropriate strategies for their early diagnosis, management and elimination. Knowledge of human biology and disease mechanism at molecular level is the most important step in developing effective disease prevention and treatment. In the year 2004, the Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD) was established through a generous donation and patronage of Ms. Nadira Panjwani (Chairperson, Dr. Panjwani Memorial Trust) in the memory of her beloved father, Dr. Mohammad Hussain Panjwani, a leading scholar and philanthropist. The main objective of the center is to train highly qualified manpower in the emerging new fields of molecular medicine and drug development. The academicians, clinicians and pharmaceutical researchers are brought together to translate basic scientific discoveries into new therapies, vaccines and diagnostic tests. 
Late Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal, Chairman Ebrahim Jamal Foundation, continuing his patronage to the Institute, established the Latif Ebrahim Jamal National Science Information Center in 2005. The beautiful building of this one of the largest paperless libraries of the region was constructed under the direct supervision of Mr. Aziz Latif Jamal S.I. (Current Chairman Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation), able and committed son of (Late) Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal.

'''Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping''' ('''LDDMM''') is a specific suite of algorithms used for diffeomorphic mapping and manipulating dense imagery based on  '''diffeomorphic metric mapping''' within the academic discipline of [[Computational anatomy]], to be distinguished from its precursor based on '''diffeomorphic mapping'''.  The distinction between the two is that diffeomorphic metric maps satisfy the property that the length associated to their flow away from the identity induces a metric on the [[Computational anatomy#The Diffeomorphism Group of Computational Anatomy|group of diffeomorphisms]], which in turn induces a metric on the orbit of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|Shapes and Forms]] within the field of [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy]]. The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called [[Computational Anatomy#Diffeomorphometry:the metric space of shapes and forms|Diffeomorphometry]].

A '''diffeomorphic mapping''' system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery.

Diffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar [[T1 (MRI)|T1]] or T2 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance imagery]], or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices [[Diffusion MRI]] and [[Diffusion-weighted imaging]], to scalar densities associated to [[Computed Tomography]] (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and scalar densities such as [[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]].

Computational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of [[Neuroinformatics]] within [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Medical imaging]]. The first algorithm for dense image mapping via diffeomorphic metric mapping was Beg's LDDMM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660081|title=Computing Large Deformation Metric Mappings via Geodesic Flows of Diffeomorphisms|journal=International Journal of Computer Vision|doi=10.1023/B:VISI.0000043755.93987.aa|access-date=2016-01-27|author1=M.F.

In a more general sense, diffeomorphic mapping is any solution that registers or builds correspondences between dense coordinate systems in Medical imaging by ensuring the solutions are diffeomorphic.

The distinction between diffeomorphic metric mapping forming the basis for LDDMM and the earliest methods of diffeomorphic mapping is the introduction of a Hamilton principle of least-action in which large deformations are selected of shortest length corresponding to geodesic flows. This important distinction arises from the original formulation of the [[Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy|Riemannian metric]] corresponding to the right-invariance. The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy. Non-geodeisc formulations of diffeomorphic mapping in general does not correspond to any metric formulation.

Diffeomorphic ma'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''pping 3-dimensional coordinate systems as measured via high resolution dense imagery has a long history in 3-D beginning with [[CT scan|Computed Axial Tomography]] (CAT scanning) in the early 80's by the University of Pennsylvania group led by [[Ruzena Bajcsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multiresolution Elastic Matching|journal = Comput.

The central focus of the sub-field of '''[[Computational anatomy]] (CA)''' within [[medical imaging]]  is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems at the 1 millimeter [[morphome]] scale. In CA mapping of dense information measured within [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance image]] (MRI) based coordinate systems such as in the brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of '''diffeomorphic mapping''' via '''large deformation''' flows of [[diffeomorphisms]] for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller &lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–1447"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deformable Templates Using Large Deformation Kinematics|journal = Trans.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian]] equations of motion. This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Such methods are powerful in that they introduce notions of regularity of the solutions so that they can be differentiated and local inverses can be calculated. The disadvantages of these methods is that there was no associated global least-action property which could score the flows of minimum energy. This contrasts the geodesic motions which are central to the study of  [[Rigid-body kinematics|Rigid body kinematics]] and the many problems solved in [[Physics]] via&lt;nowiki/&gt; [[Hamilton's principal of least action|Hamilton's principle of least action]].

In CA the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; are modelled as a [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|reproducing Kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS) defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt; determining the norm &lt;math&gt;  \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_{R^3} Av\cdot v dx, \ v \in V \ ,

where the integral is calculated by integration by parts when &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function  in the dual space &lt;math&gt; V^*&lt;/math&gt;. 
The differential operator is selected so that the Green's kernel, the inverse of the operator, is continuously differentiable in each variable implying that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]]; see&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupuis |first1=Paul |last2=Grenander |first2=Ulf |last3=Miller |first3=Michael I. |title=Variational problems on flows of diffeomorphisms for image matching |journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics |date=1 September 1998 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=587–600 |doi=10.1090/qam/1632326}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the necessary conditions on the norm for existence of solutions.

{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
&amp;v_t^{new}(\cdot) = v_t^{old}(\cdot) - \epsilon(v_t^{old} +  \sum_i  K(\cdot, \phi_t^{old}(x_i)) (D \phi_{t1})^{oldT}|_{\phi_t^{old}(x_i)} (y_i-\phi_1^{old}(x_i)), t \in [0,1]

This implies that the fixed point satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; Av_0= -\sum_i (D \phi_1)(x_i)^T (y_i - \phi_1(x_i)) \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

First Order Variation of the Flow and Vector Field for Dense Image and Landmark Matching |

The first order variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; requires the variation of  &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[Invertible matrix#Derivative of the matrix inverse|perturbation of the inverse]]  via &lt;math&gt;(\phi + \epsilon \delta \phi \circ \phi)\circ (\phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1}) = id + o(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; giving  &lt;math&gt;\delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} =-(D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi  &lt;/math&gt; . 
To express the variation in terms of &lt;math&gt; \delta v &lt;/math&gt;, use the solution to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d }{d t} \left( \delta \phi_{|\phi} \right) = (Dv)_{| \phi} \delta \phi_{| \phi} + \delta v_{| \phi}&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \phi_1 = (D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t )_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} } dt
&lt;/math&gt;

*Image Matching:
Taking the directional derivative of the image endpoint condition &lt;math&gt; E(\phi) = \int_X | I \circ \phi^{-1} - J |^2 dx &lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon} \frac{1}{2} \int_X | I \circ ( \phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1})-J|^2 dx|_{\epsilon =0}
=\int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} dx
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
= \int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} 
(-D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi dx
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; =\int_X(I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}} (- D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1}(D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}) \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dt dx
&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Substituting &lt;math&gt;
\phi_{t1} \doteq \phi_1 \circ \phi_t^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; gives the necessary condition for an optimum:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon}C(v +\epsilon\delta v)|_{\epsilon=0} = \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot \delta v_t dx dt -\int_0^1 \int_X (I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}}(D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dx dt 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  = \int_0^1 \int_X \left( Av_t - (I \circ \phi_t^{-1} -J \circ \phi_{t1}) \nabla I|_{\phi_t^{-1}}(D \phi_t)_{|\phi_t^{-1}}^{-1} |D \phi_{t1}| \right) \cdot \delta v_t dxdt = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;.

*Landmark Matching: 
Take the variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} |\phi_1(x_i)-y_i)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
use the chain rule for the perturbation &lt;math&gt; \delta \phi \circ \phi &lt;/math&gt; to gives the first variation

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_i (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot D \phi_1 |_{\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))}^{-1} \delta v_t |_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} (\phi_1(x_i))} dt
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; =\int_0^1 \int_X \sum_i \delta_{\phi_t(x_i)}(x) (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot (D \phi_1)_{\phi_t^{-1} (x)}(D \phi_t)_{\phi_t^{-1}(x)}^{-1} \delta v_t (x) dx dt
=\int_0^1 \int_X \sum_i \delta_{\phi_t(x_i)}(y) (D \phi_{t1})_{\phi_t(x_i)}^T (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot  \delta v_t (x) dx dt

The variational problem matching onto :&lt;math&gt; M^\prime (x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3 &lt;/math&gt;  with endpoint

==LDDMM ODF ==
High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries by reconstructing an orientation distribution function (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Denote the square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The metric defines the distance between two &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho(\psi_1,\psi_2)=
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle = 
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.
The template and target are denoted
&lt;math&gt; \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; indexed across the unit sphere and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly.

Define the variational problem assuming that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1],\phi_0={id}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to  
&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\min_{v: \dot \phi_t =
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_{R^3} Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{R^3}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

| Proof of Hamiltonian Dynamics
|
The [[Computational anatomy#Hamiltonian formulation of Computational Anatomy|Hamiltonian dynamics]] with advected state and control dynamics  &lt;math&gt; q_t = I \circ \phi_t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot q = - \nabla q \cdot v &lt;/math&gt; with extended Hamiltonian 
&lt;math&gt; H(q,p,v) = (p|-\nabla q \cdot v ) -\frac{1}{2} (Av|v) &lt;/math&gt; gives the variational problem&lt;ref name="Miller 447–509"/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{p,q,v} C(p,q,v) \doteq (p|\dot q)-\left( (p|-\nabla q \cdot v ) -\frac{1}{2} (Av|v) \right) + E(q_1)
= (p|\dot q) - H(p,q,v) +E(q_1) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
The first variation gives the condition on the optimizing vector field &lt;math&gt;Av=-p\nabla q &lt;/math&gt;, with the endpoint condition &lt;math&gt;
 p_1=-\frac{\partial E}{\partial q}(q_1)
&lt;/math&gt; and dynamics on the Lagrange multipliers determined by the Gatteux derivative conditions &lt;math&gt;
 (-\dot p - \nabla \cdot (pv) | \delta q) ) =0

&lt;/math&gt; and the state &lt;math&gt;

( \delta p | \dot q + \nabla q \cdot v  ) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">A '''ligule''' (from {{Lang-la|ligula}} "strap", variant of ''lingula'', from ''lingua'' "tongue") — is a thin outgrowth at the junction of [[leaf]] and leafstalk of many [[Poaceae|grasses (Poaceae)]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. A ligule is also a strap-shaped extension of the [[corolla (flower)|corolla]], such as that of a [[ray floret]] in plants in the daisy family [[Asteraceae]].

==Poaceae and Cyperaceae==
[[Image:Ligula.jpg|200px|right]]
The ligule is part of the leaf that is found at the junction of the blade and sheath of the leaf. It may take several forms, but it is commonly some form of translucent membrane or a fringe of hairs. The membranous ligule can be very short 1&amp;ndash;2&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Kentucky bluegrass]], ''Poa pratensis'') to very long 10&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;mm ([[Johnson grass]], ''Sorghum halepense''), it can also be smooth on the edge or very ragged. Some grasses do not have a ligule, for example barnyardgrass (''[[Echinochloa crus-galli]]'').

A ligule can also be defined as a membrane-like tissue or row of delicate hairs typically found in grasses at the junction of the leaf sheath and blade. The ligule appears to be a continuation of the leaf sheath and encircles or clasps the stem as does the leaf sheath. The three basic types of ligules are: membranous, a fringe of hairs (ciliate), and absent or lacking. Most grasses have ligules, and the shape, length, and appearance of the ligule margin provide consistent characters for separating genera and some species of grasses.

In grass-like plants such as sedges ([[Cyperaceae]]) and rushes ([[Juncaceae]]), ligules are usually absent or poorly developed.

==Asteraceae==

[[File:Ray-floret.svg|thumb|Ligulate floret, typical for flowers of some members of the family Asteraceae:&lt;br/&gt;A. ovary&lt;br/&gt;B. pappus&lt;br/&gt;C. theca&lt;br/&gt;D. ligule&lt;br/&gt;E. style with stamen]]

In members of [[Asteraceae]], a '''ligule''' is the elongated tongue of the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] of a [[ray flower]] or [[ligulate flower]].&lt;ref name=CDF&gt;Sia Morhardt, Emil Morhardt, California Desert Flowers, University of California Press, pp. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubmosses==
The microphylls of [[Lycopodiophyta]] of the families [[Selaginellaceae]] (spikemosses or lesser clubmosses) and [[Isoetaceae]] (quillworts) have minute, scale-like flaps of tissue called ligules at the base of the upper surface of each leaf blade. This feature distinguishes them from clubmosses of the family [[Lycopodiaceae]].&lt;ref name=Stace&gt;{{cite book|last=Stace|first=C. A.|authorlink = Stace, C.

==History==
In 1911, the college was founded as a one-year normal school housed in rented space in nearby [[Lyndon Institute]]. The term "[[normal school]]" is based on the French ''école normale supérieure'', a school to educate teachers. Consistent with education tradition of the times, the Lyndon Training Course expanded its curriculum in one-year increments, and the first two-year class graduated in 1923. In 1927, Rita Bole became principal of the school. The first three-year class, consisting of nine students, graduated in 1934. In 1944, the state allowed Lyndon to grant four-year degrees so long as it remained a teacher training institution. The first four-year degrees were granted to 18 students in 1944. It was during these years that the [[Northeast Kingdom]] began to depend on Lyndon to address the educational needs of its residents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Bole, who led the school until 1955, encouraged the Vermont State Legislature to establish Lyndon Teachers College, saw the admission of the first male and first out-of-state students during the 1940s, and oversaw the move to the [[Theodore Newton Vail]] estate. Vail had been instrumental in the establishment of Lyndon Institute, and Bole recognized his vacant estate as the perfect place to house the growing school. The move to Vail Manor was completed on June 30, 1951, the final day of the school's lease at Lyndon Institute.

In 1961, the State Legislature established the [[Vermont State Colleges]] system, a consortium of Vermont's five public colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor and [[Council of Presidents]] and Lyndon Teachers College became Lyndon State College. This marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth and, in 1964, the campus began to expand. A library, a dormitory, a dining hall, a science wing, a gymnasium, and a theater were built. These additions began meeting the needs of a growing student population that also brought a rapid expansion of the Lyndon curriculum.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In the 1970s, new majors were developed in business administration, special education, recreations, meteorology, communications, human services, and physical education. It was also during this decade that the original Vail Manor was deemed unsafe and was replaced with the Theodore N. Vail Center that now houses the Vail Museum and preserves the name that has become an integral part of the Lyndon State tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Lyndon State College Undergraduate Catalog, 2007-2008, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a new residence hall was constructed near Wheelock Hall. The building was named The Rita L. Bole Complex, after the principal of Lyndon Normal School.

In 2009, the Academic and Student Activity Center, a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified, or "green" building, was constructed to house Lyndon's Business, Exercise Science and Meteorology majors. It also contains computer labs, classrooms and a student event center.

In September 2016, the VSC board of trustees voted to merge Lyndon State College with [[Johnson State College]], located roughly 50 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/shotgun-marriage-johnson-and-lyndon-state-colleges-rush-to-the-altar/Content?oid=3669084|title=Shotgun Marriage?

==Campus==

The Vail Center has classrooms, and teachers' offices, especially English, mathematics, and education. It also contains the bookstore, student center, and snack bar. The science wing contains classrooms and laboratories. There is a television wing for the television studies and is home to News 7, LSC's daily live broadcast facility. It also contains the small [[Alexander Twilight]] Theater. It is connected to the Library and Academic Center (LAC).

LAC contains classrooms, a 24-hour computer lab, and the three-floor [[Samuel Read Hall Library]].

The Harvey Academic Center is located at the center of campus, and houses offices and classrooms for Recreation Studies, as well as for other classes.

The center of campus is around the fountain, which sprays into a small pond. There is a larger pond across from the library. Adjacent to the fountain is Stevens Dining Hall.

Adjacent to the theater is the Stannard Gymnasium. The smaller gym, known as the Rita Bole Gymnasium (There is also a Rita Bole residence hall.) is used for basketball games, floor hockey, and a wide variety of intramural sports. In this complex is a {{convert|25|m}} swimming pool, racquetball court, rock climbing wall and a fitness center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.lyndonstate.edu/Athletics/Facilities/tabid/730/Default.aspx Lyndon State College Hornets: Facilities]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the north side of the campus, across from the baseball fields is the Brown House containing a dispensary. The Gray House is a special residential opportunity, currently for those performing service to the community.

No smoking is allowed on campus, except for in nearby parking lots.

&lt;!---because of name change, some of this stuff may need to be moved---&gt;
Half of the student population lives on campus in one of the nine residence halls. The Stonehenge residence hall complex is located on the southern end of campus, and consists of six residence halls: Whitelaw/Crevecoeur (first-year students), Arnold/Bayley, and Poland/Rogers. They are clustered around a central courtyard and shaped in a circle, hence the nickname "Stonehenge." Wheelock is a residence hall that is located in the center of campus. Rita Bole is the newest of the residence halls, which features apartment-style living for upperclassmen, as well as accessible. The ninth hall, Grey House, is a living-learning community dedicated to performing community service on campus and in the local area.

'''MSU Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics (CMC)''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Факультет вычислительной математики и кибернетики (ВМК)}}), founded in 1970 by [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Andrey Tikhonov]], is a part of [[Moscow State University]].

==Education==
CMC is the leading Russian research and training center in the fields of applied mathematics, computing and software development .{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Education at CMC combines in-depth theoretical studies, extensive practical exercises, and research.

Main 12 Master's programs:
* [[Mathematical physics]]
* [[Mathematical modeling]]
* Computational diagnostics
* [[Numerical methods]]
* [[Theory of probability]] and [[mathematical statistics]] 
* Operations research and [[systems analysis]] 
* Optimization and [[optimal control]]
* Mathematical cybernetics
* Software for computers and computer systems
* Networks software
* [[System programming]]
* [[Decision making]] in Economics and Finance

==History==
[[File:Tikhonov board.jpg|thumb|250px|Memorial board of [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Andrey Tikhonov]] on the building of MSU Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics]]

A group of professors and scholars from [[MSU Faculty of Physics|Department of Physics]] and [[MSU Department of Mechanics and Mathematics|Department of Mechanics and Mathematics]] led by [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Andrey Tikhonov]] founded CMC in 1970. The three departments are still closely connected.

Following companies work with CS MSU: [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Borland]], [[Software AG]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[IBM]]/[[Lotus Software|Lotus]], [[Samsung]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]].

Perhaps, ''Department of [[Applied Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]]'' would be a more precise name for this one. The word ''[[cybernetics]]'' historically refers to what [[Norbert Wiener]] introduced in his book ''Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and Machine'' (1948).  In the Soviet Union cybernetics was initially considered [[antiscientific]], and was prohibited. However, in 1960s more liberal scientific views were adopted, triggering a remarkable boom in research and education. That was later reflected in the name of this department founded in 1970. Since that time the CMC name became a well-recognized brand and is unlikely to change.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The '''National Institute of Oceanography (NIO)''', ({{lang-ur|{{nq|قومی اداره سمندر جغرافیہ}}}}), is a department of the [[Government of Pakistan]] and a major research institute of [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)]]. The NIO is a science and research executive organization located in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. The NIO' research and studies are funded by the Federal Government of Pakistan while the facilities are provided by the [[Sindh Government]].

==History==
NIO was established in 1981 through a Government Resolution to conduct multidisciplinary research in [[oceanography]] in the coastal and offshore areas of Pakistan (EEZ 24,000&amp;nbsp;km²). The institute has 30 qualified marine scientists working on ocean biology/productivity, marine chemistry and environment, physical oceanography/coastal hydraulics, marine geology and geophysics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">{{Refimprove|date=May 2017}}'''Notional [[election]] results''' are calculations made, usually following boundary changes of electoral districts brought about by population shifts, to determine what election results would have been in previous elections had the newly created boundaries then been in place.  Such calculations are used by psephologists and media for the purposes of detecting changing voting patterns and swings from one party to another from one election to the next, which is easier to calculate when no boundary changes have been implemented.

==Use in United Kingdom elections==
Boundary reviews can favour a particular political party, as notional election calculations have found.  In the case of the [[United Kingdom]], the Conservative Party usually benefits slightly due to population shifts away from inner cities towards suburban areas, where the Conservative Party has a stronger vote base.  Consequently, representation in inner city areas - usually areas where the Labour Party has its strongest voter base - declines as its population declines.

Notional election result calculations are of particular importance in the United Kingdom because the country is unusual in not releasing official breakdowns in voting data, which enables such data to be applied to electoral areas which are subject to boundary changes.  Parliamentary constituencies are based on smaller local government wards, and it is the results from local government elections that are the primary source used to calculate notional results at a constituency level.

Professors [[Colin Rallings]] and [[Michael Thrasher]] of [[Plymouth University]] have been involved in calculating notional results for general elections since 1992 where periodic boundary changes have taken place.  The data compiled from their work has been used by several prominent media companies including television channels for the purposes of comparing one general election result to the last.

Notional results have their limitations in that voting patterns may well have been different had new boundaries been in force at previous elections, because some voters who vote tactically may have chosen to vote differently under different boundaries, depending on which political parties or candidates were most competitive under old boundaries.

Other problems with making notional calculations is that people vote differently between national and local elections, particularly as many councilors enjoy a cross-party personal vote.  Local factors can also have a great effect on voting patterns.  In addition, a large number of wards are not contested by all the major political parties, some of them electing independent candidates or candidates from residents' associations.  Sometimes wards themselves are subject to boundary changes.

On a national level, notional general election results by constituency have been calculated in the UK on numerous occasions in the past by academics and election experts such as Rallings and Thrasher, when boundary changes have been implemented. 

In the February 1974 general election, notional results from the previous general election in 1970 were calculated on behalf of the [[BBC]] in constituencies where major boundary changes took effect.
In 1983, extensive boundary changes led to notional general election results being jointly calculated by the BBC and ITN for the previous general election in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0261-3794(83)80028-6 |title=The 1983 boundary commission: Policies and effects |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=195–206 |year=1983 |last1=Waller |first1=Robert J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further notional results were created for the 1997 general election (to compare with the 1992 general election), in 2005 (to take into account the reduction in the number of Scottish constituencies brought about by the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gerry |last1=Hassan |first2=Douglas |last2=Fraser |year=2004 |title=The political guide to modern Scotland: people, places and power |location=London |publisher=Politico's |isbn=978-1-84275-047-6 }}{{pn|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 2010 general election (to compare with the 2005 general election).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="887">The '''optical force''' is a phenomenon whereby beams of light can attract and repel each other. The force acts along an axis which is perpendicular to the light beams. Because of this, parallel beams can be induced to converge or diverge. The optical force works on a microscopic scale, and cannot currently be detected at larger scales. It was discovered by a team of [[Yale]] researchers led by [[electrical engineer]] Hong Tang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jan-feb/083 Top 100 Stories of 2009 #83: Like Magnets, Light Can Attract and Repel Itself], Discover magazine, from the January–February 2010 special issue; published online December 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], the '''Ostriker–Peebles criterion''', named after its discoverers [[Jeremiah Ostriker]] and [[Jim Peebles]], describes the formation of barred [[galaxy|galaxies]].&lt;ref name=gd-pup&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=01yNf7mipb0C&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;ots=p8wf-UJBte&amp;dq=Ostriker-Peebles%20criterion&amp;pg=PA374#v=onepage&amp;q=Ostriker-Peebles%20criterion&amp;f=false |title=Galactic Dynamics |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |access-date=2 September 2016 |date=1987 |first1=James |last1=Binney |first2=Scott |last2=Tremaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rotating disc of a spiral galaxy, consisting of stars and solar systems, may become unstable in a way that the stars in the outer parts of the "arms" are released from the galaxy system, resulting in the collapse of the remaining stars into a bar-shaped galaxy. This occurs in approximately 1/3 of the known spiral galaxies.

Based on the first kinetic energy component ''T'' and the total gravitational energy ''W'', a galaxy will become barred when &lt;math&gt;\frac{T}{W} &gt; 0.15&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=gd-pup/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2792">'''PFD allowance''' is the adjustment done to the normal time to obtain the [[Standard time (manufacturing)|standard time]] for the purpose of recovering the lost time due to personal needs, [[fatigue]], and unavoidable delays.&lt;ref&gt;Groover, M. P. (2007). ''Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement &amp; Management of Work'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|978-0-13-140650-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing a small increase to the normal time in each cycle, a worker can still be able to cover lost time and complete the work assigned to him.

==Allowance technique==
There are two types of interruption: (1) interruption related to work (2) interruption not related to work. For example, a machine breakdown, [[rest break]] to overcome fatigue, and receiving [[Teacher|instruction]] from the manager are the interruption related to work, but personal needs, [[lunch break]]s, and personal [[telephone call]]s are interruptions not related to work. However, the two types of interruption are both essential for the worker because it is almost impossible to work continually during a regular shift.

===Personal needs, fatigue, and unavoidable delays allowance===
The standard time is calculated by multiplying the normal time by 1 plus the PFD allowance:&lt;ref&gt;Niebel, B., Freivalds, A. (2008) ''Methods, Standards and Work design'', McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|978-0-07-337631-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;T_\text{std} = T_n*(1 + A_\text{pfd})&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;T_\text{std}= &lt;/math&gt;standard time.
*&lt;math&gt;T_n = &lt;/math&gt; normal time.
*&lt;math&gt;A_\text{pfd} = &lt;/math&gt; PFD allowance.

====Personal needs====
The personal needs allowance is the time that is associated with workers’ daily personal needs which include going to the [[restroom]], phone calls, going to the [[water fountain]], and similar interruptions of a personal nature. However, it is categorized as 5%, but it also depends on the work environment, e.g. in terms of discomfort and temperature.

====Fatigue====
The fatigue allowance is intended to cover the time that the worker should be given to overcome fatigue due to work related stress and conditions. There are three factors that cause fatigue: (1) physical factors like standing and use of force, (2) mental and [[cognitive function|cognitive]] factors like mental strain and [[eye strain]], and (3) environmental and work factors like poor [[lighting]], noise, and heat.

====Unavoidable Delays====
Unavoidable delays are categorized under unavoidable interruption that occurs at random times during the day in the [[workplace]]. They usually refer to work-related events like cleaning up at the end of the shift and machine breakdowns or malfunctions. Unavoidable delays occur because of many [[randomness|random]] events at [[Workstation|work stations]].

'''Plant perception''' is the ability of [[plant]]s to sense and respond to the environment to adjust their [[plant morphology|morphology]], [[plant physiology|physiology]], and [[phenotypic plasticity|phenotype]] accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = Green plants as intelligent organisms | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 413–9 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16054860 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2005.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines such as [[plant physiology]], [[plant ecology|ecology]] and [[molecular biology]] are used to assess this ability.

==Processes==

===Detection===
Displacement can be detected by plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaffe MJ, Forbes S | title = Thigmomorphogenesis: the effect of mechanical perturbation on plants | journal = Plant Growth Regulation | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–24 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 11541741 | doi = 10.1007/BF00027213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Populus|Poplar]] stems can detect reorientation and inclination ([[equilibrioception]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Azri W, Chambon C, Herbette S, Brunel N, Coutand C, Leplé JC, Ben Rejeb I, Ammar S, Julien JL, Roeckel-Drevet P | title = Proteome analysis of apical and basal regions of poplar stems under gravitropic stimulation | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 136 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–208 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19453506 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3054.2009.01230.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathway signals===
Wounded tomatoes are known to produce the volatile odour [[methyl jasmonate]] as an alarm signal.&lt;ref name="farmer1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer EE, Ryan CA | title = Interplant communication: airborne methyl jasmonate induces synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in plant leaves | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 19 | pages = 7713–6 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 11607107 | pmc = 54818 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbouring plants can then
detect the chemical and prepare for the attack by producing chemicals that defend against insects or attract predators.&lt;ref name="farmer1990"/&gt;

Plants systematically use [[Plant hormone|hormonal]] [[signalling pathway]]s to coordinate their own [[Plant development|development]] and morphology.

====Neurochemicals====
Plants produce several proteins found in the animal neuron systems such as [[acetylcholine esterase]], [[glutamate receptor]]s, [[GABA receptor]]s, and [[endocannabinoid]] signaling components. They also use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nitric oxide|NO]], and [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] like animals for signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Baluška F, Volkmann D, Mancuso S | year = 2006 | title = Communication in Plants: Neuronal Aspects of Plant Life. | publisher = Springer Verlag | isbn = 978-3-540-28475-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrophysiology====
Although plant cells are not [[neuron]]s, they can be electrically excitable and can display rapid electrical responses ([[action potential]]s) to environmental stimuli. These action potentials can influence processes such as [[actin]]-based cytoplasmic streaming, [[rapid plant movement|plant organ movements]], wound responses, respiration, [[photosynthesis]], and flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wagner E, Lehner L, Normann J, Veit J, Albrechtova J | year = 2006 | chapter = Hydroelectrochemical integration of the higher plant—basis for electrogenic flower induction | pages = 369–389 | veditors =  Baluska F, Mancuso S, Volkmann D | title = Communication in plants: neuronal aspects of plant life | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fromm J, Lautner S | title = Electrical signals and their physiological significance in plants | journal = Plant, Cell &amp; Environment | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–257 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17263772 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01614.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmermann MR, Maischak H, Mithöfer A, Boland W, Felle HH | title = System potentials, a novel electrical long-distance apoplastic signal in plants, induced by wounding | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 1593–600 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19129416 | pmc = 2649404 | doi = 10.1104/pp.108.133884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Pickard BG | title = Action Potentials in Higher Plants| jstor = 4353850| journal = Botanical Review| volume = 39| issue = 2| pages = 172–201| year = 1973| doi = 10.1007/BF02859299}}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrical responses can cause the synthesis of numerous [[Organic compound|organic molecules]], including ones that act as neuroactive substances in other organisms.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Thus, plants accomplish [[Behavior|behavioural responses]] in environmental, [[Plant communication|communicative]], and [[Plant ecology|ecological]] contexts.

===Signal response===
{{Further information|Plant hormone|Thigmotropism|Thigmomorphogenesis}}
A plant's concomitant reactive behavior is mediated by [[phytochrome]]s, [[kinin]]s, [[Plant hormone|hormones]], [[antibiotic]] or other chemical release, changes of water and chemical transport, and other means. These responses are generally slow, taking at minimum a number of hours to accomplish, and can best be observed with [[time-lapse]] cinematography, but [[Rapid plant movement|rapid movements]] can occur as well.
Plants respond to volatile signals produced by other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer EE, Ryan CA | title = Interplant communication: airborne methyl jasmonate induces synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in plant leaves | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 19 | pages = 7713–6 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 11607107 | pmc = 54818 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.19.7713 | bibcode = 1990PNAS...87.7713F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Karban R, Baxter KJ | journal = Journal of Insect Behavior| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 147–156|title=Induced Resistance in Wild Tobacco with Clipped Sagebrush Neighbors: The Role of Herbivore Behavior| year = 2001| doi = 10.1023/A:1007893626166}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jasmonate]] levels also increase rapidly in response to mechanical perturbations such as [[tendril]] coiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falkenstein E, Groth B, Mithöfer A, Weiler EW | title = Methyljasmonate and α-linolenic acid are potent inducers of tendril coiling | journal = Planta | volume = 185 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–22 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 24186412 | doi = 10.1007/BF00201050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants have many [[inducible plant defenses against herbivory|strategies to fight off pests]]. For example, they can produce different toxins ([[phytoalexin]]s) against invaders or they can induce rapid [[cell death]] in invading cells to hinder the pests from spreading out.

Some plants are capable of [[Rapid plant movement|rapid movement]]: the mimosa plant (''[[Mimosa pudica]]'') makes its thin leaves point down at the slightest touch {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} and [[carnivorous plant]]s such as the [[Venus flytrap]] snap shut by the touch of insects. In the Venus flytrap, touch is detected by [[Cilium|cilia]] that generate an [[action potential]] that stimulates motor cells, by which movement occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Volkov AG, Adesina T, Jovanov E |date=May 1, 2007|title=Closing of Venus Flytrap by Electrical Stimulation of Motor Cells | doi = 10.4161/psb.2.3.4217 | journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|volume=2|pages=139-145|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, the mechanism responsible for adaptation is [[signal transduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Scheel D, Wasternack C |title=Plant signal transduction |year=2002 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-963879-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiong L, Zhu JK | title = Abiotic stress signal transduction in plants: Molecular and genetic perspectives | journal = Physiologia Plantarum | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–166 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11454221 | doi = 10.1034/j.1399-3054.2001.1120202.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark GB, Thompson G, Roux SJ | title = Signal transduction mechanisms in plants: an overview | journal = Current Science | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 170–7 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 12194182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = How plants learn | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages = 4216–8 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10200239 | pmc = 33554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.8.4216 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.4216T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of perception==

===Light===
[[File:Sonnenblume-hjf.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The sunflower'', a common heliotropic plant which perceives and reacts to sunlight by slow turning movement]]
{{Main article|Photomorphogenesis|photoperiodism}}
Many plant organs contain photo-sensitive compounds ([[phototropin]]s, [[cryptochrome]]s and [[phytochrome]]s), each reacting very specifically to certain wavelengths of light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} These light sensors tell the plant if it is day or night, how long the day is, how much light is available and from where the light comes. Shoots grow towards light and roots usually grow away from light. These responses are called [[phototropism]] and skototropism respectively. They are brought about by light sensitive pigments like [[phototropin]]s and [[phytochrome]]s and the plant hormone [[auxin]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Many plants exhibit certain phenomena at specific times of the day; for example, certain flowers open only in the mornings. Plants keep track of the time of day with a [[circadian clock]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} This internal clock is set to solar time every day using sunlight, temperature and other cues, similar to the biological clocks of other organisms. The internal clock coupled with the ability to perceive light also allows plants to measure the time of the day and so find the season of the year. This is how many plants know when to flower.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} (see [[photoperiodism]]) The seeds of many plants sprout only after they are exposed to light. This response is carried out by phytochrome signalling. Plants are also able to sense the quality of light and respond appropriately. For example, in low light conditions, plants produce more photosynthetic pigments. If the light is very bright or if the levels of harmful UV increase, plants produce more of their protective pigments that act as sunscreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strid | first1 = Åke | last2 = Porra | first2 = Robert J. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1992 | title = Alterations in Pigment Content in Leaves of Pisum sativum After Exposure to Supplementary UV-B | url = http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/33/7/1015 | journal = Plant and Cell Physiology | volume = 33 | issue = 7| pages = 1015–1023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gravity ===
{{Main article|Gravitropism}}
To orient themselves correctly, plants must have an adequate sense of the direction of gravity’s unidirectional pull. The subsequent response plant movement is known as [[gravitropism]]. Typically, in the root this works as gravity is sensed and translated in the [[Root cap|root tip]], and subsequently roots grow towards gravity via elongation of the cells. In the shoot, similar effects are happening, but gravity is perceived and then growth occurs in the opposite direction, as the above ground part of the plant experiences negative gravitropism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biological science | last = Freeman | first = Scott | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Pearson | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-321-74367-1 | location = Illinois | pages = 803 | oclc = 821271420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the root tip, there are [[amyloplast]]s containing starch granules that fall in the direction of gravity. This weight activates secondary receptors, which signal to the plant the direction of gravitational pull. After this occurs, [[auxin]] is redistributed through [[polar auxin transport]] and differential growth towards gravity begins. In the shoots, auxin redistribution occurs in a way to produce differential growth away from gravity.

For perception to happen, the plant must sense, perceive and translate the direction of gravity. Without gravity, proper orientation will not occur and the plant will not effectively grow. The root will not be able to uptake nutrients or water, and the shoot will not grow towards the sky to maximize [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perrin RM, Young LS, Murthy UM, Harrison BR, Wang Y, Will JL, Masson PH | title = Gravity signal transduction in primary roots | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 737–43 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16033778 | pmc = 4247041 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mci227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant intelligence==
{{Further information|Hormonal sentience|Plant cognition}}
Plants do not have a brain or [[neuronal network]], but reactions within signalling pathways may provide a biochemical basis for learning and memory in addition to computation and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhalla US, Iyengar R | title = Emergent properties of networks of biological signaling pathways | journal = Science | volume = 283 | issue = 5400 | pages = 381–7 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9888852 | doi = 10.1126/science.283.5400.381 | bibcode = 1999Sci...283..381B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the brain is used as a metaphor in plant intelligence to provide an integrated view of signalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner ED, Stahlberg R, Mancuso S, Vivanco J, Baluska F, Van Volkenburgh E | title = Plant neurobiology: an integrated view of plant signaling | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 413–9 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16843034 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants respond  to [[Stimulus (physiology)|environmental stimuli]] by [[Tropism|movement]] and changes in [[Plant morphology|morphology]]. They  communicate while actively competing for resources. In addition, plants accurately compute their circumstances, use sophisticated [[cost–benefit analysis]] and take tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control diverse environmental stressors. Plants are also capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning by registering memories from their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goh CH, Nam HG, Park YS | title = Stress memory in plants: a negative regulation of stomatal response and transient induction of rd22 gene to light in abscisic acid-entrained Arabidopsis plants | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 240–55 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14535888 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01872.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkov AG, Carrell H, Baldwin A, Markin VS | title = Electrical memory in Venus flytrap | journal = Bioelectrochemistry | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 142–7 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19356999 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bioelechem.2009.03.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rensing L, Koch M, Becker A | title = A comparative approach to the principal mechanisms of different memory systems | journal = Die Naturwissenschaften | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 1373–84 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19680619 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00114-009-0591-0 | bibcode = 2009NW.....96.1373R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gagliano M, Renton M, Depczynski M, Mancuso S | title = Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters | journal = Oecologia | volume = 175 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24390479 | doi = 10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gagliano M, Vyazovskiy VV, Borbély AA, Grimonprez M, Depczynski M | title = Learning by Association in Plants | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 38427 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27910933 | doi = 10.1038/srep38427 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants use this information to update their behaviour in order to survive present and future challenges of their environment.

Plant physiology studies the role of [[Signal transduction|signalling]] to integrate data obtained at the [[Plant genetics|genetic]], [[Phytochemistry|biochemical]], [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[Plant physiology|physiological]] levels to understand plant development and behaviour. The neurobiological view sees plants as information-processing organisms with rather complex processes of communication occurring throughout the individual plant organism. It studies how environmental information is gathered, processed, integrated and shared (sensory plant biology) to enable these adaptive and coordinated responses (plant behaviour); and how  sensory perceptions and behavioural events are 'remembered' in order to allow predictions of future activities upon the basis of past experiences. Plants, it is claimed by some plant physiologists, are as sophisticated in behaviour as animals but this sophistication has been masked by the time scales of plants' response to stimuli, many [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] slower than animals'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

It has been argued that although plants are capable of adaptation, it should not be called intelligence, as plant neurobiologists are relying primarily on metaphors and analogies to argue that complex responses in plants can only be produced by intelligence.&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt; ''"A bacterium can monitor its environment and instigate developmental processes appropriate to the prevailing circumstances, but is that intelligence? Such simple adaptation behaviour might be bacterial intelligence but is clearly not animal intelligence."''&lt;ref name="firn2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Firn R | title = Plant intelligence: an alternative point of view | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–51 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15023701 | pmc = 4242337 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mch058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plant intelligence fits a definition of intelligence proposed by [[David Stenhouse]] in a book about evolution and animal intelligence where he described it as "adaptively variable behaviour during the lifetime of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Helen | last = Phillips | name-list-format = vanc | title = Not just a pretty face | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523535.700-not-just-a-pretty-face.html | date = 27 July 2002 | work =  New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the concept have also argued that a plant cannot have goals once it is past the development stage of seedling because, as a modular organism, each module seeks its own survival goals and the resulting organism level behavior is not centrally controlled.&lt;ref name="firn2004"/&gt; This view, however, necessarily accommodates the possibility that a tree is a collection of individually intelligent modules cooperating, competing and influencing each other to determine behavior in a bottom-up fashion. The development into a larger organism whose modules must deal with different environmental conditions and challenges is not universal across plant species however, as smaller organisms might be subject to the same conditions across their bodies, at least, when the below and above ground parts are considered separately. Moreover, the claim that central control of development is completely absent from plants is readily falsified by apical dominance.

The Italian botanist [[Federico Delpino]] wrote on the idea of plant intelligence in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mancuso S | title = Federico Delpino and the foundation of plant biology | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 1067–71 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21490417 | pmc = 3115070 | doi = 10.4161/psb.5.9.12102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] studied the movement of plants and in 1880 published a book ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''.  In the book he concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the [[radicle]] thus endowed [..] acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being situated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, there are few studies of the implications of plant perception. [[Michael Marder]] put forth a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of plant life based on the physiology of plant perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marder M | title = Plant intentionality and the phenomenological framework of plant intelligence | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 1365–72 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22951403 | pmc = 3548850 | doi = 10.4161/psb.21954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paco Calvo Garzon offers a philosophical take on plant perception based on the cognitive sciences and the computational modeling of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garzón FC | title = The quest for cognition in plant neurobiology | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 208–11 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 19516990 | pmc = 2634130 | doi = 10.4161/psb.2.4.4470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to neurobiology===
A plant's sensory and response system has been compared to the [[neurobiological]] processes of animals. [[Plant neurobiology]], an unfamiliar misnomer, concerns mostly the sensory [[adaptive behaviour (ecology)|adaptive behaviour]] of plants and plant [[electrophysiology]]. [[India]]n  scientist [[J. C. Bose]] is credited as the first person to research and talk about neurobiology of plants. Many plant scientists and neuroscientists, however, view this as inaccurate, because plants do not have neurons.&lt;ref name="NoBrain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alpi A, Amrhein N, Bertl A, Blatt MR, Blumwald E, Cervone F, Dainty J, De Michelis MI, Epstein E, Galston AW, Goldsmith MH, Hawes C, Hell R, Hetherington A, Hofte H, Juergens G, Leaver CJ, Moroni A, Murphy A, Oparka K, Perata P, Quader H, Rausch T, Ritzenthaler C, Rivetta A, Robinson DG, Sanders D, Scheres B, Schumacher K, Sentenac H, Slayman CL, Soave C, Somerville C, Taiz L, Thiel G, Wagner R | title = Plant neurobiology: no brain, no gain? | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 135–6 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17368081 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas behind plant neurobiology were criticised in a 2007 article&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt; published in ''[[Trends in Plant Science]]'' by Amedeo Alpi and 35 other scientists, including such eminent plant biologists as [[Gerd Jürgens]], Ben Scheres, and Chris Sommerville. The breadth of fields of plant science represented by these researchers reflects the fact that the vast majority of the plant science research community reject plant neurobiology.  Their main arguments are that:&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt;
* "Plant neurobiology does not add to our understanding of plant physiology, plant cell biology or signaling".
* "There is no evidence for structures such as neurons, synapses or a brain in plants".
* The common occurrence of [[plasmodesmata]] in plants which "poses a problem for signaling from an electrophysiological point of view" since  extensive electrical coupling would preclude the need for any cell-to-cell transport of a ‘neurotransmitter-like’ compounds.
The authors call for an end to "superficial analogies and questionable extrapolations" if the concept of "plant neurobiology" is to benefit the research community.&lt;ref name="NoBrain" /&gt;

There were several responses to the criticism clarifying that the term "plant neurobiology" is a metaphor and metaphors have proved useful on several previous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trewavas A | title = Response to Alpi et al.: Plant neurobiology--all metaphors have value | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 231–3 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17499006 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner ED, Stahlberg R, Mancuso S, Baluska F, Van Volkenburgh E | title = Response to Alpi et al.: plant neurobiology: the gain is more than the name | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 285–6 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17591455 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecophysiology#Plants|Plant ecophysiology]] describes this phenomenon.&lt;!--{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} unnecessary--&gt;

===Parallels in other taxa===

As described above in the case of a plant, similar mechanisms exist in a bacterial cell, a choanoflagellate, a fungal hypha, or a sponge, among the many other examples. All of these individual organisms of the respective taxa, despite being devoid of a brain or nervous system, are capable of sensing their immediate and momentary environment and responding accordingly. In the case of single-celled life, the sensory pathways are even more primitive in the sense that they take place on the surface of a single cell, as opposed to a network of many cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''Policy by press release''' refers to the act of attempting to influence [[public policy]] by [[press release]]s intended to alarm the public into demanding action from their [[elected official]]s. In modern times, the term is used to dismiss an opponent's claims by suggesting the arguments to be lacking in substance and created solely to generate media attention.

== Cold War ==

Perhaps the most common use of the term refers to an infamous period during the [[Eisenhower administration]] when "leaked" documents were a common way for the various branches of the [[US military]] to attempt to garner funding for their pet projects when traditional chains of command failed, or they actively ended them. Practically any idea, no matter how outlandish, could gain some traction by simply claiming that the [[Soviet Union]] was working on a similar device.

The first and most costly example of this behavior was the mythical "[[bomber gap]]." After seeing the latest Soviet designs in 1955, a clamor broke out in Washington about the Soviets developing a lead in deploying strategic bombers, with estimates that hundreds would be available shortly. The result was a massive expansion of the US building program, which led to the eventual introduction of about 2,500 jet bombers. Although it was not revealed at the time, US intelligence services had actually made real estimates of the size of the Soviet fleet as early as 1956 by placing it at around 20 aircraft.&lt;ref name="heppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T. A. | year=1998 | page=193 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/contents.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the tactic of claiming the gap existed and then brushing aside any criticism as being "weak on defense," was so successful it led to a wave of similar claims.

Another famous case was a claim that suggested the Soviets were working on a global-range [[nuclear aircraft]]. An article, complete with images claimed to be leaked by a spy agency, appeared in the December 1958 issue of ''[[Aviation Week]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/site-files/aviationweek.com/files/uploads/2014/10/1958-%20Soviet%20Nuclear%20Bomber.pdf "Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber"], ''Aviation Week'', 1 December 1958, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The article described a system that was suspiciously similar to some of the designs that were currently under consideration by large US aviation companies. Concerns were soon expressed that "the Russians were from three to five years ahead of the US in the field of atomic aircraft engines and that they would move even further ahead unless the US pressed forward with its own program."&lt;ref&gt;''Soviet Nuclear Plane Possibility Conceded'', Ford Eastman, Aviation Week, 19 January 1959, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the entire article was a hoax; third parties later revealed that the aircraft appearing in the pictures was the entirely-conventional [[Myasishchev M-50]] ''Bounder'', which never entered production. The rumored aircraft was a nuclear-powered version of the [[Tupolev Tu-95]] bomber, called [[Tupolev Tu-119]]. The controversy managed to secure, for a time, continued funding of US efforts, which culminated in the [[Convair B-36#Experiments|NB-36]] testbed aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Norris, [http://aviationweek.com/blog/false-starts-aviation-s-atomic-age "False Starts For Aviation’s ‘Atomic Age’"], ''Aviation Week'', 14 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Another apparent case of policy by press release was the famous ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' article on [[flying saucer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Is this the real Flying Saucer?'', Look, Volume 19, 14 June 1955&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[US Air Force]] and then the [[US Army]] were funding the development of the [[Avrocar (aircraft)|Avrocar]] at [[Avro Canada]] in [[Toronto]]. The article, in the 14 June 1955 edition, suggested that the recent wave of saucer reports were possibly caused by Soviet flying saucers, and the article went on to describe them and their capabilities. It included several images that appeared to be provided to them by Avro Canada, or someone in contact with them, including a description of the control system, which was identical to the one used on the Avrocar. In the end, the concept proved unfeasible, and the Avrocar project was eventually cancelled in 1961. The article nevertheless remains famous, as it is often presented as a US government misinformation campaign to deflect attention away from "real" UFO's: to exactly what end varies by the source.

==Contemporary use==
The term is now more commonly used, especially in the US, to refer to [[environmental policy]], but it is still used in discussions of [[defense policy]]. Myriad claims asserting [[global warming]] or [[ozone depletion]] have been described by editorialists, such as Mark Martin, the Chronicle Sacramento Bureau,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/17/MNG56HAEPT1.DTL Governor to push global warming fight - Bold policy gambits expected in bid to lower greenhouse gases], San Francisco Chronicle, 17 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Hugh Ellsaesser, as "policy by press release."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcenter.org/npa159.html Why the U.S. Should Withdraw from the Montreal Protocol], The National Center for Public Policy Research, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--BROKEN LINK:
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepp.org/key%20issues/ozone/ozonscare.html The Latest Ozone Scare: Policy by Press Release], Washington Times, 17 March 1992&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Likewise, the implication that Iraq was involved in the 9-11 attacks
or had [[weapons of mass destruction]], based on evidence that the CIA's own reports had dismissed, was described as "policy by press release" by [[John Kerry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3916793/ January 11, 2004 - Meet the Press]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lou Dobbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/26/ldt.01.html CNN.com Transcripts: Lou Dobbs Tonight]&lt;/ref&gt;

A related term, ''public health by press release'', is occasionally used ironically to imply official pronouncements or media campaigns belie inadequate effort or funding, but the term appeared in an article warning against a pitfall from the opposite direction (potential misassessment of limited clinical studies by press and policymakers).&lt;ref&gt;"The perils of public health by press release," Lancet, 2004 Sep 18;364:1037-1038&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish | PCP theorem}}

The '''Post correspondence problem''' is an [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] [[decision problem]] that was introduced by [[Emil Post]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="Post46"&gt;{{cite journal|year = 1946|author = [[Emil Post|E. L. Post]]| title= A variant of a recursively unsolvable problem |journal = Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.| volume =  52|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/1946-52-04/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9/S0002-9904-1946-08555-9.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1946-08555-9|pages=264–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is simpler than the [[halting problem]] and the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' it is often used in proofs of undecidability.

== Definition of the problem ==

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an alphabet with at least two symbols.  The input of the problem consists of two finite lists &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{N}&lt;/math&gt; of words over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. A solution to this problem is a [[sequence]] of indices &lt;math&gt;(i_k)_{1 \le k \le K}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;K \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 1 \le i_k \le N&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, such that

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \ldots \alpha_{i_K} = \beta_{i_1} \ldots \beta_{i_K}.&lt;/math&gt;

The decision problem then is to decide whether such a solution exists or not.

===Alternative definition===
 

:&lt;math&gt;g: (i_1,\ldots,i_K) \mapsto \alpha_{i_1} \ldots \alpha_{i_K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h: (i_1,\ldots,i_K) \mapsto \beta_{i_1} \ldots \beta_{i_K}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives rise to an equivalent alternative definition often found in the literature, according to which any two homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;g,h&lt;/math&gt; with a common domain and a common codomain form an instance of the Post correspondence problem, which now asks whether there exists a nonempty word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in the domain such that

:&lt;math&gt;g(w)=h(w)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example instances of the problem ==

===Example 1===
Consider the following two lists:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;background:#55FF83;font-style:italic;"
|-style="font-weight:bold;"
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|a
|ab
|bba
|}
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;background:#87E6FF;font-style:italic;"
|-style="font-weight:bold;"
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|width=40 | β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
|baa
|aa
|bb
|}
{{col-end}}
A solution to this problem would be the sequence (3, 2, 3, 1), because

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_3 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_1 = bba \cdot ab \cdot bba \cdot a = bbaabbbaa = bb \cdot aa \cdot bb \cdot baa = \beta_{3} \beta_{2} \beta_{3} \beta_{1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, since (3, 2, 3, 1) is a solution, so are all of its "repetitions", such as (3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1), etc.; that is, when a solution exists, there are infinitely many solutions of this repetitive kind.

However, if the two lists had consisted of only &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2, \alpha_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{2}, \beta_{3}&lt;/math&gt; from those sets, then there would have been no solution (the last letter of any such α string is not the same as the letter before it, whereas β only constructs pairs of the same letter).

A convenient way to view an instance of a Post correspondence problem is as a collection of blocks of the form
{{col-begin|width=auto}}  
{{col-break}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | α&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | β&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-end}}
there being an unlimited supply of each type of block. Thus the above example is viewed as
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | a
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | baa
|}
''i = 1''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | aa
|}
''i = 2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i = 3''
{{col-end}}
where the solver has an endless supply of each of these three block types. A solution corresponds to some way of laying blocks next to each other so that the string in the top cells corresponds to the string in the bottom cells. Then the solution to the above example corresponds to:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | aa
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bba
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bb
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | a
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | baa
|}
''i&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1''
{{col-end}}

===Example 2===
Again using blocks to represent an instance of the problem, the following is an example that has infinitely many solutions in addition to the kind obtained by merely "repeating" a solution.

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bb
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | b
|}
''1''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ba
|}
''2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | c
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bc
|}
''3''
{{col-end}}

In this instance, every sequence of the form (1, 2, 2, . . ., 2, 3) is a solution (in addition to all their repetitions):

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | bb
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | b
|}
''1''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ba
|}
''2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ba
|}
''2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ab
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ba
|}
''2''
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | c
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | bc
|}
''3''
{{col-end}}

==Proof sketch of undecidability ==

The most common proof for the undecidability of PCP describes an instance of PCP that can simulate the computation of an arbitrary [[Turing machine]] on a particular input. A match will occur if and only if the input would be accepted by the Turing machine. Because [[Halting problem|deciding if a Turing machine will accept an input is a basic undecidable problem]], PCP cannot be decidable either. The following discussion is based on [[Michael Sipser]]'s textbook ''Introduction to the Theory of Computation''.&lt;ref name="sipser05"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael Sipser]] | year = 2005 | title = Introduction to the Theory of Computation | edition = 2nd | publisher = Thomson Course Technology | isbn = 0-534-95097-3 | chapter = A Simple Undecidable Problem | pages = 199&amp;ndash;205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more detail, the idea is that the string along the top and bottom will be a [[computation history]] of the Turing machine's computation. This means it will list a string describing the initial state, followed by a string describing the next state, and so on until it ends with a string describing an accepting state. The state strings are separated by some separator symbol (usually written #). According to the definition of a Turing machine, the full state of the machine consists of three parts:
* The current contents of the tape.
* The current state of the [[finite state machine]] which operates the tape head.
* The current position of the tape head on the tape.
Although the tape has infinitely many cells, only some finite prefix of these will be non-blank. We write these down as part of our state. To describe the state of the finite control, we create new symbols, labelled ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, for each of the finite state machine's ''k'' states. We insert the correct symbol into the string describing the tape's contents at the position of the tape head, thereby indicating both the tape head's position and the current state of the finite control. For the alphabet {0,1}, a typical state might look something like:

101101110''q''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;00110.

A simple computation history would then look something like this:

''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;101#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;01#11''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;1#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;10.

We start out with this block, where ''x'' is the input string and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the start state:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''#
|}

The top starts out "lagging" the bottom by one state, and keeps this lag  until the very end stage. Next, for each symbol ''a'' in the tape alphabet, as well as #, we have a "copy" block, which copies it unmodified from one state to the next:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''a''
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''a''
|}

We also have a block for each position transition the machine can make, showing how the tape head moves, how the finite state changes, and what happens to the surrounding symbols. For example, here the tape head is over a 0 in state 4, and then writes a 1 and moves right, changing to state 7:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;0
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | 1''q''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

Finally, when the top reaches an accepting state, the bottom needs a chance to finally catch up to complete the match. To allow this, we extend the computation so that once an accepting state is reached, each subsequent machine step will cause a symbol near the tape head to vanish, one at a time, until none remain. If ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is an accepting state, we can represent this with the following transition blocks, where ''a'' is a tape alphabet symbol:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-break|gap=5px|align=center}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
| bgcolor="#55FF83" width="40" | ''aq''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| bgcolor="#87E6FF" width="40" | ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
{{col-end}}

There are a number of details to work out, such as dealing with boundaries between states, making sure that our initial tile goes first in the match, and so on, but this shows the general idea of how a static tile puzzle can simulate a Turing machine computation.

The previous example

''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;101#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;01#11''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;1#1''q''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;10.

is represented as the following solution to the Post correspondence problem:

== Variants ==

Many variants of PCP have been considered. One reason is that, when one tries to prove undecidability of some new problem by reducing from PCP, it often happens that the first reduction one finds is not from PCP itself but from an apparently weaker version. Also note that if one removes ''correspondence'', the [https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4284/post-correspondence-problem-variant problem becomes decidable].

* The problem may be phrased in terms of [[monoid morphism]]s ''f'', ''g'' from the free monoid ''B''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to the free monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; where ''B'' is of size ''n''.  The problem is to determine whether there is a word ''w'' in ''B''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''f''(''w'') = ''g''(''w'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Arto | last=Salomaa | authorlink=Arto Salomaa | title=Jewels of Formal Language Theory | publisher=Pitman Publishing | isbn=0-273-08522-0 | year=1981 | zbl=0487.68064 | pages=74–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The condition that the alphabet &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have at least two symbols is required since the problem is decidable if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has only one symbol.
* A simple variant is to fix ''n'', the number of tiles. This problem is decidable if ''n'' ≤ 2, but remains undecidable for ''n'' ≥ 5. It is unknown whether the problem is decidable for 3 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 4.&lt;ref name="N15"&gt;{{cite conference|author = T. Neary|year=2015|title=Undecidability in Binary Tag Systems and the Post Correspondence Problem for Five Pairs of Words|conference=STACS 2015|book-title=32nd International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2015)|editor=Ernst W.

* The '''''circular'' Post correspondence problem''' asks whether indexes &lt;math&gt;i_1, i_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \cdots \alpha_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i_1} \cdots \beta_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[conjugacy|conjugate words]], i.e., they are equal modulo rotation. This variant is undecidable.&lt;ref name="Ruohonen83"&gt;{{cite journal|author= K. Ruohonen |year =1983|title=On some variants of Post's correspondence problem|publisher=Springer|volume=19|issue=4|pages=357&amp;ndash;367|journal=Acta Informatica | doi = 10.1007/BF00290732}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the most important variants of PCP is the '''''bounded'' Post correspondence problem''', which asks if we can find a match using no more than ''k'' tiles, including repeated tiles. A brute force search solves the problem in time O(2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;), but this may be difficult to improve upon, since the problem is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="GJ79"&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Michael R. Garey]]|author2=[[David S. Johnson]]  | year = 1979 | title = [[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]] | publisher = W.H. Freeman | isbn = 0-7167-1045-5 | page = 228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some NP-complete problems like the [[boolean satisfiability problem]], a small variation of the bounded problem was also shown to be complete for RNP, which means that it remains hard even if the inputs are chosen at random (it is hard on average over uniformly distributed inputs).&lt;ref name="Gurevich91"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Y. Gurevich|journal = J. Comp. Sys. Sci.|year = 1991|pages = 346–398|volume=42|title= Average case completeness|publisher=Elsevier Science|doi = 10.1016/0022-0000(91)90007-R|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another variant of PCP is called the '''''marked'' Post Correspondence Problem''', in which each &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; must begin with a different symbol, and each &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; must also begin with a different symbol. Halava, Hirvensalo, and de Wolf showed that this variation is decidable in [[EXPTIME|exponential time]]. Moreover, they showed that if this requirement is slightly loosened so that only one of the first two characters need to differ (the so-called 2-marked Post Correspondence Problem), the problem becomes undecidable again.&lt;ref name="HHW01"&gt;{{cite journal|author = V. Halava |author2=M. Hirvensalo |author3=R. de Wolf|year=2001|title=Marked PCP is decidable|journal=Theor. Comput. Sci.|publisher=Elsevier Science|volume=255|pages=193–204|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(99)00163-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Post Embedding Problem''' is another variant where one looks for indexes &lt;math&gt;i_1, i_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i_1} \cdots \alpha_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[substring|(scattered) subword]] of &lt;math&gt;\beta_{i_1} \cdots \beta_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;. This variant is easily decidable since, when some solutions exist, in particular  a length-one solution exists. More interesting is the '''''Regular'' Post Embedding Problem''', a further variant where one looks for solutions  that belong to a given regular language (submitted, e.g., under the form of a regular expression on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,N\}&lt;/math&gt;). The Regular Post Embedding Problem is still decidable but,  because of the added regular constraint, it has a very high complexity that dominates every multiply recursive function.&lt;ref name="CS07"&gt;{{cite journal|author = P. Chambart|author2=Ph.

* The '''Identity Correspondence Problem''' (ICP) asks whether a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) can generate an identity pair by a sequence of concatenations. The problem is undecidable and equivalent to the following Group Problem:  is the semigroup generated by a finite set of pairs of words (over a group alphabet) a group.&lt;ref name="BP10"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Paul C.

'''[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] [[adeno-associated virus]]''' ('''rAAV''') '''based genome engineering''' is a [[genome editing]] platform centered on the use of rAAV vectors that enables insertion, deletion or substitiution of [[DNA]] sequences into the genomes of live mammalian cells. The technique builds on [[Mario Capecchi]] and [[Oliver Smithies]]' [[Nobel Prize]]–winning discovery that [[homologous recombination]] (HR), a natural hi-fidelity DNA repair mechanism, can be harnessed to perform precise genome alterations in mice. rAAV mediated genome-editing improves the efficiency of this technique to permit [[genome engineering]] in any pre-established and differentiated human cell line, which, in contrast to mouse ES cells, have low rates of HR.

The technique has been widely adopted for use in engineering human cell lines to generate [[isogenic human disease models]]. It has also been used to optimize bioproducer cell lines for the biomanufacturing of protein vaccines and therapeutics. In addition, due to the non-pathogenic nature of rAAV, it has emerged as a desirable vector for performing gene therapy in live patients.

==rAAV Vector==

[[File:Targeting-vectors-2005-onwards.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a typical rAAV vector&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.horizondiscovery.com/gene-editing/raav|title=Horizon Discovery - rAAV Gene Editing|website=horizondiscovery.com|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The rAAV genome is built of single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA), either positive- or negative-sensed, which is about 4.7 kilobase long. These single-stranded DNA viral vectors have high transduction rates and have a unique property of stimulating endogenous HR without causing double strand DNA breaks in the genome, which is typical of other [[homing endonuclease]] mediated genome editing methods.

==Capabilities==

Users can design a rAAV vector to any target genomic locus and perform both gross and subtle endogenous gene alterations in mammalian somatic cell-types. These include gene knock-outs for functional genomics, or the ‘knock-in’ of protein tag insertions to track translocation events at physiological levels in live cells.  Most importantly, rAAV targets a single allele at a time and does not result in any off-target genomic alterations.&lt;ref name="Setlow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Setlow |title=Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods, Volume 26 |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=145-187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it is able to routinely and accurately model genetic diseases caused by subtle [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] or point mutations that are increasingly the targets of novel drug discovery programs.&lt;ref name="Setlow"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

To date, the use of rAAV mediated genome engineering has been published in over 1300 peer reviewed scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PubMed Search|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=raav|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Another emerging application of rAAV based genome editing is for gene therapy in patients, due to the accuracy and lack of off-target recombination events afforded by the approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16364">'''Ronald Jones''' (born July 8, 1952 in the [[United States]]) is an [[artist]], [[critic]] and [[educator]] who gained prominence in [[New York City]] during the mid-1980s. In the magazine ''[[Contemporary (magazine)|Contemporary]]'', [[Brandon Labelle]] wrote: "Working as an artist, writer, curator, professor, lecturer and critic over the last 20 years, Jones is a self-styled [[Conceptual art|Conceptualist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kim Levin |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0019,159644,14858,13.html |title=Masters of the Universe - Page 1 - Art - New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=2000-05-16 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning the worlds of academia and art, opera and garden design, and acting as paternal spearhead of contemporary critical practice. Explorative and provocative, Jones creates work that demands attention that is both perceptual and political."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contemporary-magazines.com/1024x7 ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labelle positions Jones along the leading edge of a "contemporary critical practice" that is perhaps best described as [[interdisciplinary]] or [[transdisciplinary]].

==1980s==
Jones graduated in 1974, with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Montomery, Alabama]]'s  [[Huntingdon College]]. He completed an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree in sculpture from the [[University of South Carolina]], followed by a [[Ph.D]]. in Interdisciplinary Arts at [[Ohio University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/interarts/ |title=:: School of Interdisciplinary Arts @ Ohio University - Home :: |publisher=Ohio.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote about a collaboration between [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. In 1983, he was included in a group exhibition titled "A Likely Story," at [[Artists space]] in New York City which was curated by Valerie Smith and included [[Gretchen Bender]], [[David Cabrera (artist)|David Cabrera]], and [[Jeff Koons]]. In 1985 he moved to New York City and two years later had his first [[solo exhibition]] at [[Metro Pictures Gallery]]. In the ''[[New York Times]]'', Roberta Smith wrote: "Mr. Jones's main goal seems to be to thwart the eye with formal incoherence and an overload of written information that the mind must digest before his pieces make sense. But the sense made is never visual. Instead, if one wades through the long illustrated paragraph that constitutes each work's title, learning the artwork or event that each component represents, a kind of odd and often frightening poetic logic accrues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Roberta |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DB1539F934A15751C1A967958260 |title=Art in Review - Review - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1991-12-27 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jones is represented by [[Metro Pictures Gallery]] where his last of six solo shows was in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/index.php?mode=past |title=Metro Pictures &amp;#124; Exhibitions |publisher=Metropicturesgallery.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527042124/http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/index.php?mode=past |archive-date=2005-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones began his curatorial practice in 1986, when he assembled The Public Art Show with a catalog designed by [[Louise Lawler]] and a poster by [[Barbara Kruger]]. He went on to organize eleven exhibitions for New York City galleries (Metro Pictures, [[Lehmann Maupin]] and [[Josh Baer]]) and European and [[Scandinavia]]ny institutions ("Dark Side of the Moon," Stockholm Cultural Capital of Europe Arkipelag project, 1998 and Magasin 3 Projekt Djurgårdsbrunn, 2003).

In 1987, he began writing criticism for ''[[Arts Magazine]]'' and ''[[Artscribe]]''. Soon after, he began contributing articles, essays and reviews to ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]'', ''[[Artforum]]'', ''Bookforum'', ''Art in America'', ''Parkett'', ''Cabinet'', ''Zone'' and others. Jones wrote numerous catalogs for other artists including Elizabeth Peyton,&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-3-7757-9099-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Laurie Simmons, David Salle, Terry Winters, Richard Phillips, Carroll Dunham, and Keith Edmier.

In 1989 Jones was invited to join the faculty at the School of Art, [[Yale University]] as Critic in Sculpture and ultimately was named Senior Critic.

==1990s==

In 1992 Jones served as the spokesman for the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] peer-review panel for fellowships in sculpture, which launched one of many high-profile national debates on [[censorship]] and First Amendment issues in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honan |first=William H. |author-link=William H.

In 1993 he had a solo exhibition at the [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in New York City. As his work continued to be exhibited internationally (including solo exhibitions in [[Berlin]], [[Tokyo]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Paris]], and [[Cologne]]) Jones was commissioned to design garden projects including [[Pritzker Park]] in Chicago, the Rethymnon Centre of Contemporary Art in Crete, the  [[Botanical Gardens]] in [[Curitiba, Brazil]], [[Caesar’s Cosmic Garden]] [[Boras Konstmuseet]], [[Sweden]] and a garden for the city of [[Hamburg, Germany]] among others.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:jones garden.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pritzker Park, Chicago, Illinois, 1992. Courtesy of the artist.]] --&gt;

In 1995, ArtForum magazine's "Best and Worst 1995" article stated that Jones should be "a nominee for a lifetime achievement award for contemporary-art awfulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_n4_v34/ai_17837647/ |title=Best and worst 1995 &amp;#124; ArtForum &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 he was appointed professor and Chairman of the Visual Arts Department at [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia he was the Director of the Digital Media Center and Co-Director of the Interactive Design Lab. While at Columbia he served on the faculty of the MA Colloquia in the Masters Program in Critical Studies, Department of Art History and Archeology and taught in seminars at The Computer Music Department.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:jones opera.jpg|thumbnail|left|"Falling and Waving," still from opera produced by Brooklyn Academy of Music and Arts at Saint Ann's, New York City, 1999. Courtesy of Metro Pictures and the artist.]]  --&gt;He continued to serve as a Visiting Professor at [[Konstfack]], University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, in Stockholm, Sweden, which he had done since 1996. He served on the Boards of Artists Space, the [[Public Art Fund]], and [[Franklin Furnace]], all in New York City, the Princeton Sculpture Symposium, and was a Member of the Executive Committee of the Lucent Project, [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].

In 1999, Jones conceived of, and wrote the libretto for "Falling and Waving," the first computer generated opera produced by the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] and Arts at Saint Ann's in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayscheib.com/falling/index.html |title=Falling and Waving (a digital opera) :::: directed by Jay Scheib |publisher=Jayscheib.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

In 2001 he was appointed as the first Provost at Art Center College of Design where he guided the design and implementation of a new transdisciplinary curriculum for the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_7_39/ai_75761312 |title=Mix Master - Ronald Jones curriculum - Brief Article &amp;#124; ArtForum &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he earned a Certificate from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/ |title=Harvard Graduate School of Education |publisher=Gse.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently Jones is Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Konstfack University College of Arts]], Crafts and Design in Stockholm, Sweden where he leads The [[Experience design|Experience Design]] Group, with a mission "to persuade, stimulate, inform, envision, entertain, and forecast events, influencing meaning and modifying human behavior." &lt;ref&gt;http://varutstallning08.konstfack.se/interdisciplinary-studies/ronald-jones.html{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="designtime.se"&gt;http://www.designtime.se&lt;/ref&gt; At Konstfack, Jones also co-directs WIRE, the MA program in curatorial practice and critical writing.
Jones is a Center Director at Konstfack for the [[Stockholm School of Entrepreneurship]] (SSES), an interdisciplinary initiative by Karolinska Institutet, the Royal Institute of Technology, the Stockholm School of Economics, the Stockholm University and Konstfack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sses.se/ |title=SSES |publisher=Sses.se |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones is a Guest Professor of Experience Design at [[National Institute of Design|NID]], the National Institute of Design, [[Ahmedabad, India]]. He has also served on the faculty of The Royal Danish Academy of Art, Copenhagen, The School of Visual Arts, New York, and [[Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste]], [[Städelschule]] [[Frankfurt, Germany]] and as a visiting professor at [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]], Israel's national school of art.
With his appointment at Konstfack as Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies, he has been able, along with the faculty of The Experience Design Group, to create a graduate program especially designed to prepare students to become interdisciplinarians, or even transdisciplinarians. "Interdisciplinarity," says Jones "is by now a stand-alone discipline, as much as the conventional disciplines of art, design or craft."&lt;ref name="designtime.se"/&gt;

==Writing, lectures, collections==

Jones writes regularly for ''[[Artforum]]'' and has a monthly column for ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.

He has delivered over two hundred lectures to universities, museums, art and design schools, including Harvard University, The Art Institute of Chicago, Yale University, The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], The Guggenheim Museum, The Rhode Island School of Design, Parsons School of Design, [[Dia Art Foundation|DIA]] Center for the Arts, New York City, Royal College of Art, London, Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts at MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, Brown University, Akademie Der Bildenden Künste, Vienna, the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]], London, among others.

His art is in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], and the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm, among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1551">In [[mathematics]], and in particular [[game theory]], '''Sion's minimax theorem''' is a generalization of [[John von Neumann]]'s [[minimax theorem]], named after [[Maurice Sion]].

It states:

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[compact space|compact]] [[Convex set|convex]] subset of a [[linear topological space]] and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; a convex subset of a linear topological space.

: &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; [[upper semicontinuous]]  and [[quasiconvex function|quasiconcave]] on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,y)&lt;/math&gt; lower semicontinuous and quasi-convex on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;

then,

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in X}\sup_{y\in Y} f(x,y)=\sup_{y\in Y}\min_{x\in X}f(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|200px|The original cover of [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651), in which he discusses the concept of the social contract theory]]

In both [[Moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], the '''social contract''' is a theory or model that originated during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and usually concerns the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the authority of the [[State (polity)|state]] over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;"For the name social contract (or original contract) often covers two different kinds of contract, and, in tracing the evolution of the theory, it is well to distinguish them. Both were current in the 17th century and both can be discovered in Greek political thought. ... [The first] generally involved some theory of the origin of the state. The second form of social contract may be more accurately called the contract of government, or the contract of submission....  Generally, it has nothing to do with the origins of society, but, presupposing a society already formed, it purports to define the terms on which that society is to be governed: the people have made a contract with their ruler which determines their relations with him. They promise him obedience, while he promises his protection and good government. While he keeps his part of the bargain, they must keep theirs, but if he misgoverns the contract is broken and allegiance is at an end." [[J. W. Gough]], ''The Social Contract'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1936), pp.{{nbsp}}2–3. Modern revivals of social contract theories have not been as concerned with the origin of the state.&lt;/ref&gt; Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented, either explicitly or [[tacit consent|tacitly]], to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler (or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining [[rights]].

Therefore, the relation between [[natural and legal rights]] is often a topic of social contract theory. The term takes its name from ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (French: ''Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique''), a 1762 book by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that discussed this concept.

Although the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy and [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Canon Law]], the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy. The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent of any political order that [[Thomas Hobbes]] termed the "[[state of nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ross Harrison writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term." See Ross Harrison, ''Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.{{nbsp}}70. The phrase "state of nature" does occur, in  [[State of nature#History|Thomas Aquinas]]'s [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer19.htm ''Quaestiones disputatae de veritate'', Question 19, Article 1, Answer 13]. However, Aquinas uses it in the context of a discussion of the nature of the soul after death, not in reference to politics.&lt;/ref&gt; In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[conscience]]. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate, in different ways, why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.

Prominent of 17th- and 18th-century theorists of social contract and natural rights include [[Hugo Grotius]] (1625), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651), [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] (1673), [[John Locke]] (1689), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1762), and [[Immanuel Kant]] (1797). Each solved the problem of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Hobbes]] famously said that in a "[[state of nature]]", human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the "right to all things" and thus the freedom to plunder, rape, and murder; there would be an endless "war of all against all" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political [[community]] ([[civil society]]) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign's edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary). Pufendorf disputed Hobbes's equation of a state of nature with war.&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"&gt;Patrick Riley, ''The Social Contract and Its Critics'', chapter{{nbsp}}12 in ''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Political Thought'', Eds. Mark Goldie and Robert Wokler, Vol{{nbsp}}4 of ''The Cambridge History of Political Thought'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp.{{nbsp}}347–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some freedoms to do so.

The central assertion that social contract approaches is that law and political order are not natural, but human creations. The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate only to the extent that they fulfill their part of the agreement. Hobbes argued that government is not a party to the original contract and citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest. According to other social contract theorists, when the government fails to secure their natural rights (Locke) or satisfy the best interests of society (called the "[[general will]]" in Rousseau), citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey, or change the leadership through elections or other means including, when necessary, violence.

Locke believed that [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] were inalienable, and therefore the rule of God superseded government authority, while Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way to ensure welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law. The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Social contract theories were eclipsed in the 19th{{nbsp}}century in favor of [[utilitarianism]], [[Hegelianism]], and [[Marxism]], and were revived in the 20th{{nbsp}}century, notably in the form of a [[Original position|thought experiment]] by [[John Rawls]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Riley 2006 pp. 347"/&gt;

==History==
The concept of the social contract was originally posed by [[Glaucon]], as described by [[Plato]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Book{{nbsp}}II.

{{quote|They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;—it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic, Book II. Quoted from http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.3.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The social contract theory also appears in ''[[Crito]]'', another dialogue from Plato.  Over time, the social contract theory became more widespread after [[Epicurus]] (341-270 BC), the first philosopher who saw justice as a social contract, and not as existing in Nature due to divine intervention (see below and also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]), decided to bring the theory to the forefront of his society.  As time went on, philosophers of traditional political and social thought, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau put forward their opinions on social contract, which then caused the topic to become much more mainstream.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Classical thought===
Social contract formulations are preserved in many of the world's oldest records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|title=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/enlightenment--33?print=1|website=www.timetoast.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist text of the second century BCE, [[Mahāvastu]], recounts the legend of Mahasammata. The story goes as follows:
{{quote|In the early days of the cosmic cycle mankind lived on an immaterial plane, dancing on air in a sort of fairyland, where there was no need of food or clothing, and no private property, family, government or laws. Then gradually the process of cosmic decay began its work, and mankind became earthbound, and felt the need of food and shelter. As men lost their primeval glory, distinctions of class arose, and they entered into agreements with one another, accepting the institution of private property and the family. With this theft, murder, adultery, and other crime began, and so the people met together and decided to appoint one man from among them to maintain order in return for a share of the produce of their fields and herds. He was called "the Great Chosen One" (Mahasammata), and he received the title of raja because he pleased the people.&lt;ref name="AL Basham pp 83"&gt;AL Basham, ''The Wonder That Was India'', pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his rock edicts, the Buddhist king [[Asoka]] was said to have argued for a broad and far-reaching social contract. The Buddhist ''vinaya'' also reflects social contracts expected of the monks; one such instance is when the people of a certain town complained about monks felling saka trees, the Buddha tells his monks that they must stop and give way to social norms.

[[Epicurus]] in the fourth century BCE seemed to have had a strong sense of social contract, with justice and law being rooted in mutual agreement and advantage, as evidenced by these lines, among others, from his ''Principal Doctrines'' (see also [[Epicureanism#Ethics|Epicurean ethics]]):

{{quote|31. Natural justice is a pledge of reciprocal benefit, to prevent one man from harming or being harmed by another.

32. Those animals which are incapable of making binding agreements with one another not to inflict nor suffer harm are without either justice or injustice; and likewise for those peoples who either could not or would not form binding agreements not to inflict nor suffer harm.

33. There never was such a thing as absolute justice, but only agreements made in mutual dealings among men in whatever places at various times providing against the infliction or suffering of harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vincent Cook |url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html |title=Principal Doctrines |publisher=Epicurus |date=2000-08-26 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Renaissance developments===
[[Quentin Skinner]] has argued that several critical modern innovations in contract theory are found in the writings from French Calvinists and Huguenots, whose work in turn was invoked by writers in the [[Low Countries]] who objected to their subjection to Spain and, later still, by Catholics in England.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin Skinner, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought: Volume 2: The Age of the Reformation'' (Cambridge, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617), from the [[School of Salamanca]], might be considered an early theorist of the social contract, theorizing [[natural law]] in an attempt to limit the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] of [[absolute monarchy]]. All of these groups were led to articulate notions of popular [[sovereignty]] by means of a social covenant or contract, and all of these arguments began with proto-"state of nature" arguments, to the effect that the basis of politics is that everyone is by nature free of subjection to any government.

These arguments, however, relied on a corporatist theory found in Roman law, according to which "a populus" can exist as a distinct legal entity. Thus, these arguments held that a group of people can join a government because it has the capacity to exercise a single will and make decisions with a single voice in the absence of sovereign authority—a notion rejected by Hobbes and later contract theorists.

==Philosophers==

===Hugo Grotius (1625)===
In the early 17th century, [[Grotius]] (1583–1645) introduced the modern idea that individuals had ''natural rights'' that enabled self-preservation, employing this idea as a basis for moral consensus in the face of religious diversity and the rise of natural science. He seeks to find a parsimonious basis for a moral beginning for society, a kind of [[natural law]] that everyone could accept. He goes so far as to say in his ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|On the Law of War and Peace]]'' that even if we were to concede what we cannot concede without the utmost wickedness, namely that there is no God, these laws would still hold.

The idea was considered incendiary since it suggested that power can ultimately go back to the individuals if the political society that they have set up forfeits the purpose for which it was originally established, which is to preserve themselves. In other words, individual persons are sovereign. Grotius says that the people are ''sui juris'' (under their own jurisdiction). People have rights as human beings, but there is a delineation of those rights because of what is possible for everyone to accept morally; everyone has to accept that each person as an individual is entitled to try to preserve himself. Each person should, therefore, avoid doing harm to, or interfering with, another, and any breach of these rights should be punished.

===Thomas Hobbes' ''Leviathan'' (1651)===
{{main|Leviathan (Hobbes book)}}

The first modern philosopher to articulate a detailed contract theory was [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679). According to Hobbes, the lives of individuals in the [[state of nature]] were "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short", a state in which self-interest and the absence of rights and contracts prevented the "social", or society. Life was "anarchic" (without leadership or the concept of sovereignty). Individuals in the state of nature were apolitical and asocial. This state of nature is followed by the social contract.

The social contract was an "occurrence" during which individuals came together and ceded some of their [[natural rights|individual rights]] so that others would cede theirs.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. person{{nbsp}}A gives up his/her right to kill person{{nbsp}}B if person{{nbsp}}B does the same.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the establishment of the state, a sovereign entity like the individuals now under its rule used to be, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Human life was thus no longer "a war of all against all".

The state system, which grew out of the social contract, was, however, also anarchic (without leadership). Just as the individuals in the state of nature had been sovereigns and thus guided by self-interest and the absence of rights, so states now acted in their self-interest in competition with each other. Just like the state of nature, states were thus bound to be in conflict because there was no sovereign over and above the state (more powerful) capable of imposing some system such as social-contract laws on everyone by force. Indeed, Hobbes' work helped to serve as a basis for the [[Political realism|realism]] theories of international relations, advanced by [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]]. Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' that humans ("we") need the "terrour of some Power" otherwise humans will not heed the [[Golden Rule|law of reciprocity]], "(in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|title=Leviathan|date=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Locke's ''Second Treatise of Government'' (1689)===
[[John Locke]]'s conception of the social contract differed from Hobbes' in several fundamental ways, retaining only the central notion that persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a state of nature would be bound morally, by the Law of Nature, not to harm each other in their lives or possessions. Without government to defend them against those seeking to injure or enslave them, Locke further believed people would have no security in their rights and would live in fear. Individuals, to Locke, would only agree to form a state that would provide, in part, a "neutral judge", acting to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who lived within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaba|first=Jeffery|date=Spring 2007|title=John Locke and the Meaning of the Takings Clause|url=https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3727&amp;context=mlr|journal=Missouri Law Review|volume=72|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hobbes argued for near-absolute authority, Locke argued for inviolate freedom under law in his [[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|''Second Treatise of Government'']]. Locke argued that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or "self-preservation"), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ''Du contrat social'' (1762)===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778), in his influential 1762 treatise ''[[The Social Contract]]'', outlined a different version of social contract theory, as the foundations of [[political rights]] based on unlimited [[popular sovereignty]]. Although Rousseau wrote that the British were perhaps at the time the freest people on earth, he did not approve of their [[representative government]]. Rousseau believed that liberty was possible only where there was direct rule by the people as a whole in lawmaking, where popular sovereignty was indivisible and [[inalienable right|inalienable]]. But he also maintained that the people often did not know their "real will", and that a proper society would not occur until a great leader ("the Legislator") arose to change the values and customs of the people, likely through the strategic use of religion.

Rousseau's political theory differs in important ways from that of Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau's collectivism is most evident in his development of the "luminous conception" (which he credited to [[Denis Diderot]]) of the [[general will]]. Rousseau argues a citizen cannot pursue his true interest by being an [[Ethical egoism|egoist]] but must instead subordinate himself to the law created by the citizenry acting as a collective.

{{quote|[The social contract] can be reduced to the following terms: ''Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will; and in a body we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''Oeuvres complètes'', ed.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;Gagnebin and M.&amp;nbsp;Raymond (Paris, 1959–95), III, 361; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', ed.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kelley and R.&amp;nbsp;Masters (Hanover, 1990–), IV, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rousseau's striking phrase that man must "be forced to be free"&lt;ref&gt;''Oeuvres complètes'', III, 364; ''The Collected Writings of Rousseau'', IV, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; should be understood this way: since the indivisible and inalienable popular sovereignty decides what is good for the whole, then if an individual lapses back into his ordinary egoism and disobeys the law, he will be forced to listen to what was decided when the people acted as a collectivity (as [[citizen]]s). Thus, the law, inasmuch as it is created by the people acting as a body, is not a limitation of individual freedom, but rather its expression.

Thus, enforcement of laws, including [[criminal law]], is not a restriction on individual liberty: the individual, as a citizen, explicitly agreed to be constrained if, as a private individual, he did not respect his own will as formulated in the general will. Because laws represent the restraints of civil freedom, they represent the leap made from humans in the state of nature into civil society. In this sense, the law is a civilizing force, and therefore Rousseau believed that the laws that govern a people helped to mold their character.

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's individualist social contract (1851)===
While Rousseau's social contract is based on [[popular sovereignty]] and not on individual sovereignty, there are other theories espoused by [[individualist]]s, [[libertarians]], and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] that do not involve agreeing to anything more than [[Negative and positive rights|negative rights]] and creates only a limited state, if any.

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) advocated a conception of social contract that did not involve an individual surrendering sovereignty to others. According to him, the social contract was not between individuals and the state, but rather among individuals who refrain from coercing or governing each other, each one maintaining complete sovereignty upon him- or herself:

{{quote|What really is the Social Contract? An agreement of the citizen with the government? No, that would mean but the continuation of [Rousseau's] idea. The social contract is an agreement of man with man; an agreement from which must result what we call society. In this, the notion of commutative justice, first brought forward by the primitive fact of exchange, ... is substituted for that of distributive justice ... Translating these words, contract, commutative justice, which are the language of the law, into the language of business, and you have commerce, that is to say, in its highest significance, the act by which man and man declare themselves essentially producers, and abdicate all pretension to govern each other.|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|''[[The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century|General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1851)}}

===John Rawls' ''Theory of Justice'' (1971)===
Building on the work of Immanuel Kant with its presumption of limits on the state,&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland, 2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part{{nbsp}}1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rawls]] (1921–2002), in ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), proposed a contractarian approach whereby rational people in a hypothetical "[[original position]]" would set aside their individual preferences and capacities under a "[[veil of ignorance]]" and agree to certain general principles of justice and legal organization. This idea is also used as a [[game theory|game-theoretical]] formalization of the notion of fairness.

===David Gauthier's ''Morals By Agreement'' (1986)===
{{Main|Contractarian ethics}}
[[David Gauthier]] "neo-Hobbesian" theory argues that cooperation between two independent and self-interested parties is indeed possible, especially when it comes to understanding morality and politics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/#SH3b |title=Social Contract Theory [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;#93; |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2004-10-15 |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauthier notably points out the advantages of cooperation between two parties when it comes to the challenge of the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. He proposes that, if two parties were to stick to the original agreed-upon arrangement and morals outlined by the contract, they would both experience an optimal result.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/#3 |title=Contractarianism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model for the social contract, factors including trust, rationality, and self-interest keep each party honest and dissuade them from breaking the rules.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Philip Pettit's ''Republicanism'' (1997)===
[[Philip Pettit]] (b. 1945) has argued, in ''Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government'' (1997), that the theory of social contract, classically based on the [[consent of the governed]], should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured]], Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract's only legitimacy.

==Critical theories==

===Consent of the governed===
An early critic of social contract theory was [[Rousseau]]'s friend, the philosopher [[David Hume]], who in 1742 published an essay "Of Civil Liberty". The second part of this essay, entitled "Of the Original Contract",&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;{{cite book|url= |author=Hume, David|title= Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay XII, Of The Original Contract|publisher= |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stresses that the concept of a "social contract" is a convenient fiction: {{quote|As no party, in the present age can well support itself without a philosophical or speculative system of principles annexed to its political or practical one; we accordingly find that each of the factions into which this nation is divided has reared up a fabric of the former kind, in order to protect and cover that scheme of actions which it pursues. ... The one party [defenders of the absolute and divine right of kings, or Tories], by tracing up government to the DEITY, endeavor to render it so sacred and inviolate that it must be little less than sacrilege, however tyrannical it may become, to touch or invade it in the smallest article. The other party [the Whigs, or believers in constitutional monarchy], by founding government altogether on the consent of the PEOPLE suppose that there is a kind of original contract by which the subjects have tacitly reserved the power of resisting their sovereign, whenever they find themselves aggrieved by that authority with which they have for certain purposes voluntarily entrusted him. |David Hume, "On Civil Liberty" [II.XII.1]&lt;ref name="Hume"/&gt;}}

Hume argued that [[consent of the governed]] was the ideal foundation on which a government should rest, but that it had not actually occurred this way in general. {{quote|My intention here is not to exclude the consent of the people from being one just foundation of government where it has place. It is surely the best and most sacred of any. I only contend that it has very seldom had place in any degree and never almost in its full extent. And that therefore some other foundation of government must also be admitted. |Ibid II.XII.20}}

===Natural law and constitutionalism===
Legal scholar [[Randy Barnett]] has argued&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.randybarnett.com/ Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty]'', Randy Barnett (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; that, while presence in the territory of a society may be necessary for consent, this does not constitute consent to ''all'' rules the society might make regardless of their content. A second condition of consent is that the rules be consistent with underlying principles of justice and the protection of natural and social rights, and have procedures for effective protection of those rights (or liberties). This has also been discussed by O.{{nbsp}}A. Brownson,&lt;ref name="brownson"/&gt; who argued that, in a sense, three "constitutions" are involved: first, the ''constitution of nature'' that includes all of what the Founders called "[[natural law]]"; second, the ''constitution of society'', an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it does establish the third, a ''constitution of government''. To consent, a necessary condition is that the rules be ''[[constitution]]al'' in that sense.

===Tacit consent===
The theory of an implicit social contract holds that by remaining in the territory controlled by some society, which usually has a government, people give consent to join that society and be governed by its government, if any. This consent is what gives legitimacy to such a government.

Other writers have argued that consent to join the society is not necessarily consent to its government. For that, the government must be set up according to a constitution of government that is consistent with the superior unwritten constitutions of nature and society.&lt;ref name="brownson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution.org/oab/am_rep.htm |author=O. A. Brownson |title=''The American Republic: its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny'' |year=1866 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit Consent ===
The theory of an implicit social contract also goes under the principles of explicit consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/gaining-explicit-consent-under-the-gdpr-2/|title=Gaining explicit consent under the GDPR|date=2017-07-05|work=IT Governance Blog|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main difference between Tacit consent and explicit consent is that explicit consent is meant to leave no room for misinterpretation.  Moreover, you should directly state what it is that you want and the person has to respond in a concise manner that either confirms or denies the proposition.

===Voluntarism===
According to the will theory of contract, a contract is not presumed valid unless all parties voluntarily agree to it, either tacitly or explicitly, without coercion. [[Lysander Spooner]], a 19th-century lawyer and staunch supporter of a right of contract between individuals, argued in his essay ''[[No Treason]]'' that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. As a result, he maintains that such an agreement is not voluntary and therefore cannot be considered a legitimate contract at all.

Modern Anglo-American law, like European civil law, is based on a will theory of contract, according to which all terms of a contract are binding on the parties because they chose those terms for themselves. This was less true when Hobbes wrote ''Leviathan''; at that time more importance was attached to consideration, meaning a mutual exchange of benefits necessary to the formation of a valid contract, and most contracts had implicit terms that arose from the nature of the contractual relationship rather than from the choices made by the parties. Accordingly, it has been argued that social contract theory is more consistent with the contract law of the time of Hobbes and Locke than with the contract law of our time, and that certain features in the social contract which seem anomalous to us, such as the belief that we are bound by a contract formulated by our distant ancestors, would not have seemed as strange to Hobbes' contemporaries as they do to us.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kary, "Contract Law and the Social Contract: What Legal History Can Teach Us About the Political Theory of Hobbes and Locke", 31 Ottawa Law Review 73 (Jan. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socioscientific Issues (SSI)''' are controversial social issues which relate to science.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Keefer, M. (2003). The role of moral reasoning and the status of socioscientific issues in science education: Philosophical, psychological and pedagogical considerations. In D.L. Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt; They are ill-structured, open-ended problems which have multiple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D. (2004). Informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: A critical review of research. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41, 513-536&lt;/ref&gt;

SSI are utilized in [[science education]] in order to promote [[scientific literacy]], which emphasizes the ability to apply scientific and moral reasoning to real-world situations.  Some examples of SSI include issues such as [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], [[animal testing]] for medical purposes, oil drilling in national parks, and "fat taxes" on "unhealthy" foods, among many others.  Research studies have shown SSI to be effective at increasing students' understanding of science in various contexts, [[Argumentation theory|argumentation skills]], [[empathy]], and [[Moral philosophy|moral reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2005). The significance of content knowledge for informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: Applying genetics knowledge to genetic engineering issues. Science Education, 89(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., &amp; Sadler, T. D. (2008). The role of moral reasoning in argumentation: Conscience, character and care. In S. Erduran &amp; M. Pilar Jimenez-Aleixandre (Eds.), Argumentation in science education: Perspectives from classroom-based research (pp. 201-216). The Netherlands: Springer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals of SSI ==
Supporters of SSI argue that it can:
* 1) Cultivate a scientifically literate citizens who are able to apply evidence-based scientific content knowledge to real-world socioscientific scenarios;
* 2) Foster a collective [[social conscience]] whereby students consistently reflect upon the formation and implications of their own reasoning;
* 3) Encourage [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]] skills that are essential for thinking and reasoning processes and mirror the types of discourse utilized in real-world scientific deliberations;
* 4) Promote [[critical thinking]] skills, such as analysis, inference, explanation,
evaluation, interpretation, and self-regulation&lt;ref&gt;Facione, P. A. (2007). Critical thinking: What it is and why it counts (2007 update). Millbrae, CA: Insight Assessment/California Academic Press LLC. Retrieved April 28, 2009, from www.insightassessment.com/pdf_files/what&amp;why2006. pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Science educators often refer to all of these aspects together as,"functional scientific literacy."&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context of SSI ==

=== Scientific Literacy - Vision I and II ===
Scientific literacy has been defined by two competing visions. A Vision I approach to scientific literacy is characterized by content-driven, decontextualized science knowledge.  A Vision II approach to scientific literacy is a context-driven, student-centered approach which seeks to prepare students for informed [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, D.A. (2007). Scientific literacy / science literacy. In S.K. Abell &amp; N.G. Lederman (Eds.), Handbook of research on science education (pp. 729-780). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSI framework follows a Vision II approach as it is believed to provide an opportunity for contextualized learning of science content as well as an opportunity for moral development.

=== SSI Distinguished from Science, Technology, and Society (STS) ===
SSI is conceptually related to [[Science, technology and society|Science, Technology, and Society]] (STS) education.  However, while both approaches connect science to societal issues, SSI is distinguished from STS because of its emphasis on the development of character and virtue as well as content knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidler|first=D.|author2=Sadler, T.D. |author3=Simmons, M.L. |author4=Howes, E.V. |title=Beyond STS: A Research-Based|journal=Science Education|year=2005|volume=89|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1002/sce.20048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSI and Moral Reasoning ==
Research suggests that SSI creates [[cognitive dissonance]] by compelling students to consider claims that may be at odds with their own beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Nichols, B.H. (2009). Socioscientific Issues: Theory and Practice. Journal of Elementary Science Education, 21, 2, 49-58&lt;/ref&gt; Dissonance of this nature is believed by some to advance [[moral reasoning]] by ‘empowering students to consider how science based issues and the decisions made concerning them reflect, in part, the moral principles and qualities of [[virtue]] that encompass their own lives, as well as the physical and social world around them.'&lt;ref&gt;
Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Supporting SSI ==
SSI education has been [[empirically]] investigated and linked to particular outcomes including:
• Promoting developmental changes in reflective judgment;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D., Sadler, T., Applebaum, S., &amp; Callahan, B. (2009). Advancing reflective
judgment through socioscientific issues. Journal of Research in Science Teaching,

Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt;
• Improve [[argumentation]] skills;&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Donnelly, L. A. (2006). Socioscientific argumentation: The effects of content knowledge and
morality. International Journal of Science Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
• Promote understanding of eco-justice and [[environmental awareness]];&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, M.P. &amp; Zeidler, D.L. (2010). Moral-ethical character and science education:

M., van Eijck &amp; Adams, J. (Eds), Cultural studies and environmentalism: The
confluence of ecojustice, place-based (science) education, and indigenous
knowledge systems (pp 105-128). New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and
• Engage students’ interest in the [[Inquiry-based science|inquiry of science]].

More recently, SSI research has been focused on cross-cultural comparisons and research has reflected international partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.; Chang, H., Choi, K., Kim, S., Zeidler, D.L. (2011). "Developing Character and Values for Global Citizens: Analysis of pre-service science". International Journal of Science Education: 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized by some that more advanced stages of epistemological reasoning allows individuals to apply a kind of socioscientific reasoning (SSR)&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D., Barab, S.A. and Scott, B. 2006. What do students gain by engaging in socio‐scientific inquiry?. Research in Science Education, 37: 371–391.&lt;/ref&gt; akin to scientific habits of mind. SSR is a theoretical construct that entails the ability to tap key traits while negotiating SSI. These include [[skepticism]], [[complexity]], [[multiple perspective]] and [[inquiry]].

== SSI in the Classroom ==

Teachers utilize SSI to foster understanding of science content and consequences involved in everyday scientific issues.  For example, in a study of [[ecology]], an elementary class might consider whether pesticides confer more benefit or harm to our ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, C., &amp; Davis, E. A. (2008a). Exploring preservice elementary teachers’ critique and adaptation of science curriculum materials in respect to socioscientific issues. Science and Education, 17(8–9),829–854.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis would require students to research the interractions between organisms in food webs and food chains, as well as the human impacts of pesticides. Students could make [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based decisions]] and discuss them through various means including whole-class discussions, [[debates]], [[discussion boards|online discussion boards]], etc... Similarly, older grades might consider issues such as whether [[genetic engineering]] should be used to treat genetic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2004). Negotiating gene therapy controversies. The
American Biology Teacher, 66, 428–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of analysis would require extensive study of genetics and modern genetic engineering techniques, as well as the ethical issues involved in [[personal freedom]]s, religious prohibitions on intervention, and so on.  Advocates suggest that, through evidence-based [[discourse]], students learn to formulate their own informed decisions and understand those whose views differ from themselves.  An essential aspect of the implementation of SSI is that the teacher is not promoting any particular belief; rather, the teacher's role is to promote evidence-based critical thinking and argumentation.

'''Structural pluralism''' is "the potential for political competition in communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1446508 | pmid=11189808 | volume=91 | issue=1 | title=Structural pluralism and all-cause mortality | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=136–8 | last1 = Young | first1 = FW | last2 = Lyson | first2 = TA | doi = 10.2105/ajph.91.1.136 | year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree of structural pluralism is used to examine how societies are structured, and specifically is a way to explain coverage differences in media markets.  Structural pluralism is studied in philosophical, sociological and communication literature.

Structural pluralism is what makes [[civic community]] a unique form of [[civil society]] (Morton, 2000). Structural pluralism represents the extent to which the community has an open and inclusive structure that permits minority voices and opinions to be heard when citizens and citizen groups are addressing community problems (Young, 1999).

Communities are discussed in terms of having common institutions, such as governing or other political bodies, religious, educational and economic institutions.  These bodies or institutions help to maintain the [[social order]] within the community.

This concept comes from the field of [[sociology]], but prior to that, stems from writings by [[Hegel]] (1821) on civic society.  This comes also from the functionalist writings of [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] (Hindman, 1999).

Durkheim writes that there are two organizating principle types of societies, that most like the premodern communities, called [[mechanical solidarity]] in which ethnic and extended families were central; and that called [[organic solidarity]] which examines the relationships of interdependence based on other components, such as work, and social organizations (Durkheim, 1933).  These are equated to today's rural and urban societies respectively.

== In journalism ==

Olien, Donohue and Tichenor (1978; Tichenor, Olien, &amp; Donohue, 1980) helped to fold this concept into the [[communication]] discipline when they noted that structural pluralism has an effect on the way in which news is presented.  Through several studies and publications, they built a model of structural pluralism, and later showed how power relationships work through a systems approach (Donohue, Olien, &amp; Tichenor, 1985; Tichenor, Olien, &amp; Donohue, 1980).

As media are typically supportive of the social system and institutions, as well as dependent upon them for gaining access to and gathering material that will be useful to the public, they often reflect the power structure of the community.  Movements, groups or discussions that are critical of the social structure are often excluded from newspapers in communities where there is a strongly centralized power structure.  An example of such a community would be a town in which a significant portion of adults are employed by one business or industry.  Criticism of this business or industry may erode the faith of community members in it and lead to social unrest.

Initially the work of the Olien, Tichenor and Donohue camp allowed us to see how diversity in communities is reflected in the reporting style of news organizations.  Conflict within communities is more often reported in larger and less homogeneous areas.

However, prior to the Olien, Tichenor, Donohue writings came those of Breed (1958) and Paletz, Reichert and McIntyre (1971). In their original pieces, the lack of criticism by the press on central powerholders was discussed.

Other studies of the impact of structural pluralism on [[journalism]] have looked shown that women are more often represented in areas that are more ethnically diverse (Armstrong, 2002); that newspapers in more diverse communities will be less likely to ignore protest stories or report them in an abbreviated fashion (Stein, et al., 2003); and others.

Structural pluralism has been discussed in law journals as a paradigmatic shift regarding the privatization of government entities (Roberts, 2001).

'''''The Mind of the Maker''''' (1941) is a Christian [[Theology|theological]] book, written by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (who was better known for her crime and mystery novels and other fiction, particularly for the character [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]). It used the experience she had of literary creativity to illuminate Christian doctrine about the nature of [[Doctrine of the Trinity|the Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mind of the Maker'', preface&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has a Latin dedication to Saint [[Athanasius]] and to British Christian leaders.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Regarded in the [[Christian world]] as something of a classic, it is often quoted.
:''"In The Mind of the Maker, one of her most profound works, Sayers contends that the creative process in art works in ways that correspond to the dynamic relation among the three Persons of the Trinity in Christian theology — and that the activity of one illuminates the activity of the other."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=In God’s Image: The virtue of creativity | last=Wolfe | first=Gregory | work=National Review online | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/wolfe200505270758.asp | date=27 May 2005 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly well received, Sayers' work even finds readers beyond the religious world, such as in the software management book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''.
:''"Dorothy Sayers, in her excellent book, The Mind of the Maker, divides creative activity into three stages: the idea, the implementation, and the interaction. A book, then, or a computer, or a program comes into existence first as an ideal construct, built outside time and space, but complete in the mind of the author. It is realized in time and space, by pen, ink, and paper, or by wire, silicon, and ferrite. The creation is complete when someone reads the book, uses the computer, or runs the program, thereby interacting with the mind of the maker. This description, which Miss Sayers uses to illuminate not only human creative activity but also the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, will help us in our present task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering | last=Brookes | first=Frederick P. jr. | work= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4468/The-Mythical-ManMonth-Essays-on-Software-Engineering-20th-Anniversary-Ed-1995- | date=1975 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Tokamak à configuration variable''''' ('''''TCV''''', literally "variable configuration [[tokamak]]") is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] research [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactor of the [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]. Its distinguishing feature over other tokamaks is that its torus section is three times higher than wide. This allows studying several shapes of plasmas, which is particularly relevant since the shape of the plasma has links to the performance of the reactor. The TCV was set up in November 1992.

== Characteristics ==
* Plasma height: 1.40 metres
* Minor radius: 0.25 metre
* Major radius: 0.88 metre
* Plasma current: 1.2 megaamperes
* Plasma life span: 2 seconds maximum
* Toroidal magnetic field: 1.43 teslas
* Additional heating power: 4.5 megawatts

== Main studies ==
* Confinement studies
** confinement as a function of the shape of the plasma (triangular, square or elongated)
** Improvement of the confinement of the core
* Studies on vertically elongated plasmas 
* Studies with ECRH and ECCD ([[electron cyclotron resonance heating]] and [[electron cyclotron current drive]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://spc.epfl.ch/research_TCV_Heating TCV Auxiliary Heating.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 it had 16 poloidal plasma shaping coils and could achieve a variety of field configurations and plasma shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spc.epfl.ch/TCV-new-shapes TCV - Development of new plasma shapes. May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spc.epfl.ch/research_TCV_Tokamak ] diagram shows 16 shaping coils and 7 other poloidal coils&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The '''UK Native Seed Hub''' (UKNSH) is a project of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]'s [[Millennium Seed Bank Partnership]] growing and distributing seeds of UK native plant species. It is in part a response to the 2010 report Making Space for Nature by [[John Lawton (biologist)|Sir John Lawton]]. The project, located at [[Wakehurst Place]], in [[West Sussex]], in the [[Weald|High Weald]] of southern [[England]] ({{gbmapping|TQ340315}}), is dedicated to enhancing the resilience and coherence of the UK's [[ecological network]]s by improving the quality, quantity, and diversity of UK seed species available for use in conservation, rehabilitation, and restoration projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/business-centre/welcome-uk-native-seed Kew website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2011/09/restoring-native-plants-uk-5-questions-kew-michael-way/  "Restoring Native Plants in the UK: 5 Questions for Kew Scientist Michael Way"], Encyclopædia Britannica Blog, 23 September 2011, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-14545718 "Kew launches native flowers project at Wakehurst Place"], BBC News, Sussex, including 3:00 film clip, 17 August 2011, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The UKNSH makes available to conservation and restoration projects high quality Millennium Seed Bank seed collections, some of which are of species that are not available on the commercial seed market, and some are local provenance collections of species already available. As part of the Royal Botanic Gardens, the UKNSH is a [[nonprofit organization]] &lt;ref name="UKNSH licence agreement"&gt;[http://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/Uk%20native%20seed%20agreement.pdf UKNSH License Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; which provides seeds under a license agreement, ensuring use of the seed only for projects that directly support UK biodiversity and at a charge that only recoups the financial cost of recollection to replace seeds in the bank.&lt;ref name="UKNSH licence agreement" /&gt;

The provision of seed may be accompanied by technical training, advice and research that enable users of the seed and other commercial seed suppliers to improve the knowledge, use, and storage of native seed in the UK.&lt;ref name="UKNSH consultancy"&gt;[http://www.kew.org/business-centre/welcome-uk-native-seed/consultancy Kew consultancy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2011 the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]] gave £750,000 to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew to establish the UKNSH as part of the foundation's 50th Birthday celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esmeefairbairn.org.uk/what-we-fund/major-grants/archived-major-grants/50th-birthday-gifts Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; The funding was expected to establish the project over a period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/8704251/Kew-sets-up-UK-seed-hub-to-restore-wild-flower-meadows.html "Kew sets up 'UK seed hub' to restore wild flower meadows"], Louise Gray, ''The Telegraph'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Production began at the Wakehurst place nursery in 2011.  In 2012 seed production moved to the new production beds that are on display to the public at Wakehurst Place.  Production focused on regenerating grassland species such as ''[[Campanula rotundifolia]]'' (harebell) and ''[[Genista tinctoria]]'' (dyer’s greenweed) from seed in the Millennium Seed Bank's collections. In May 2014 suitable seed from the Millennium Seed Bank’s collections were made available by the UKNSH seed online list, making it possible for legitimate conservation projects to request seed from the available UKNSH collections.

==The Seed Hub==
The Seed Hub itself is the Wakehurst Place based production site, with a capacity of 28 beds on about a [[hectare]] of land in total, close to the Millennium Seed Bank building and the Visitor Centre (and shown on the visitor's map).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/PPCONT_008368_Primary_0.pdf Wakehurst Visitors' Map] PDF, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The site began construction in 2011 and is maintained by Kew’s horticultural staff.  Seed production is focused on species that are difficult to obtain on the commercial market, due to harvesting, germination, or processing difficulties. Species are often regenerated to create a large collection of seeds of a particular UK provenance, such as the [[South Downs]]’ ''[[Primula veris]]'' (cowslip), or from a particular environmental habitat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/aug/17/kew-native-seed-hub "Kew unveils native flower seed bank"], Camila Ruz, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 17 August 2011, accessed 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The site is also open to the public as part of a visit to Wakehurst, and provides a useful environment to observe and photograph plant [[pollinator]]s.

==The Seed List==
To support UK conservation and restoration projects the UKNSH makes the Millennium Seed Bank's high quality, UK origin seeds available to legitimate initiatives aiming to improve the UKs ecological network.&lt;ref name="UKNSH licence agreement" /&gt;  A few of these collections are supplied from the production beds at Wakehurst Place with some being made available from the suitable collections seed bank at the MSBP. Seed is only provided from appropriate collections in the MSBP when the collection is sufficiently large. Where there is not sufficient seed numbers to make a collection available for distribution the species may be bulked up on the production beds. All seed provided is “F1” generation in that is it the offspring of plants harvested from seeds collected directly from the wild. The seed list operates in such a way that the provision of seed to conservation projects will never completely deplete the collection in the bank.

==Support==
The UKNSH also provides a range of training for seeds producers, collectors, and users. This support ensures that seed users understand the importance of high quality seed of a UK origin for UK conservation work, as well as providing them with the skills needed to use the seed.  The support also ensures that appropriate species and provenance seeds are used for the projects location and habitat. Support covers the entire range of seed handling from harvesting, through processing, testing, and storage, to distribution, and sowing. The aim of this support is to improve best practice in UK native seed use. The UKNSH provides advice and services through consultancy to enable the continuation of the project beyond the four year funding of the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation.&lt;ref  name="UKNSH consultancy" /&gt;

[[Image:Rabbit-erosion.jpg|thumb|An [[erosion|erosion gully]] in Australia caused by rabbits. The release of [[rabbits in Australia]] for hunting purposes has had serious unintended ecological consequences.]]
In the [[social sciences]], '''unintended consequences''' (sometimes '''unanticipated consequences''' or '''unforeseen consequences''') are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/nyregion/robert-k-merton-versatile-sociologist-and-father-of-the-focus-group-dies-at-92.html Robert K. Merton, Versatile Sociologist and Father of the Focus Group, Dies at 92], Michael T. Kaufman, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:
* ''Unexpected benefit'':  A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as [[luck]], [[serendipity]] or a [[wikt:windfall|windfall]]).
* ''Unexpected drawback'':  An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while [[irrigation]] schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase [[waterborne diseases]] that have devastating health effects, such as [[schistosomiasis]]).
* ''Perverse result'': A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse). This is sometimes referred to as 'backfire'.

==History==
===John Locke===
The idea of ''unintended consequences'' dates back at least to [[John Locke]] who discussed the unintended consequences of [[interest rate]] [[regulation]] in his letter to Sir John Somers, Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/763#lf0128-04_head_002''The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes''], (London: Rivington, 1824 12th ed.). Vol. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Smith===
The idea was also discussed by [[Adam Smith]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and [[consequentialism]] (judging by results).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments|page=93|url=http://metalibri.wikidot.com/title:theory-of-moral-sentiments:smith-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] popularised this concept in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renowned Columbia Sociologist and National Medal of Science Winner Robert K. Merton Dies at 92|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mar03/indextwo.html Robert K. Merton Remembered] Footnotes, American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merton/&gt;

In "The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action" (1936), Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause [[social change]]. He emphasized that his term ''purposive action'', "[was exclusively] concerned with 'conduct' as distinct from 'behavior.' That is, with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives".&lt;ref name=Merton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=895|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton's usage included deviations from what [[Max Weber]] defined as rational social action: instrumentally rational and value rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton also stated that "no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of ''all'' social planning is warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=904|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everyday usage===
More recently, the ''law of unintended consequences'' has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a [[complex system]] tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Norton "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Norton |first=Rob |editor=[[David R. Henderson]] |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Unintended Consequences |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html  |year=2008 |edition= 2nd |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0865976658 |oclc=237794267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/mislj71&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/flsulr28&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=28 Florida State University Law Review 2000–2001 Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Exemplifying the Law of Unintended Consequences Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date=1993-06-18 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/antil65&amp;div=47&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin to [[Murphy's law]], it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the [[hubris]]tic belief that humans can fully control the world around them.

==Causes==
Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world's inherent [[complexity]] (parts of a system responding to changes in the environment), [[perverse incentive]]s, human [[stupidity]], [[self-deception]], failure to account for human nature, or other [[cognitive bias|cognitive]] or [[emotional bias|emotional]] biases. As a sub-component of complexity (in the scientific sense), the chaotic nature of the universe—and especially its quality of having small, apparently insignificant changes with far-reaching effects (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]])—applies.

[[Robert K. Merton]] listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences in 1936:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Merton, Robert K|title=On Social Structure and Science|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1996|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3626245.html|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ignorance, making it  impossible to anticipate everything, thereby leading to incomplete analysis.
# Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation.
# Immediate interests overriding long-term interests.
# Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long-term result might be unfavourable (these long-term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values).
# [[Self-defeating prophecy]], or, the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs, thus the non-occurrence of the problem is not anticipated.

In addition to Merton's causes, psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that [[groupthink]], described by [[Irving Janis]], has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Can Anything Save Us from Unintended Consequences? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=20-23 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919223200/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/can_anything_save_us_from_unintended_consequences |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial [[coral reefs]], which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers.

In [[medicine]], most [[Medication|drugs]] have unintended consequences ('[[side effect]]s') associated with their use. However, some are beneficial. For instance, [[aspirin]], a [[pain reliever]], is also an [[anticoagulant]] that can help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and reduce the severity and damage from [[thrombotic stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC15Feb2001&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1168850.stm |title=BBC 15 February 2001, ''Aspirin heart warning'' |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of beneficial [[side effect]]s also leads to [[off-label use]]—prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose. Famously, the drug [[Viagra]] was developed to lower blood pressure, with its use for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials.

The objective of microfinance initiatives is to foster micro-entrepreneurs but an unintended consequence can be informal intermediation: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413_Microfinance_for_poverty_alleviation_Do_transnational_initiatives_overlook_fundamental_questions_of_competition_and_intermediation|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103–117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] made [[bicycle helmet|safety helmets]] mandatory for all bicycle riders. While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries, there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists—fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries, assuming [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]]. The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased, possibly due to [[risk compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html |title=Evaluating Head Injuries and Helmet Laws in Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Vulcan, ''et al.'' found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Maxwell H. |last2=Vulcan |first2=A.

[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition in the 1920s United States]], originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade, drove many small-time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large-scale [[organized crime]] over the illegal alcohol industry. Since alcohol was still popular, criminal organisations producing alcohol were well-funded and hence also increased their other activities. Similarly, the [[War on Drugs]], intended to suppress the [[illegal drug trade]], instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", The New York Times, August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure," ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dominic Streatfeild |title=Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild |date=June 2000 |url=http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |publisher=Dominicstratfeild |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113201345/http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |archivedate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger-side [[airbag]]s in motorcars were intended as a safety feature, but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid-1990s as small children were being hit by deploying airbags during collisions. The supposed solution to this problem, moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle, led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles, some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/hot-car-death/ |work=Time |first1=Justin |last1=Worland/Ridgefield |title=Who's To Blame For Hot Car Deaths? |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk compensation, or the [[Risk compensation|Peltzman effect]], occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death (e.g. bike helmets, seatbelts, etc.). People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place. This may result in no change, or even an increase, in morbidity or mortality, rather than a decrease as intended.

The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, [[Cobra effect|offered a bounty for every dead cobra]]. This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, they scrapped the reward program, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse, becoming known as the [[Cobra effect]].

[[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Theobald Mathew]]'s temperance campaign in 19th-century [[Ireland]] resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] again.

Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s, the Canadian federal government gave the Catholic Church in Quebec $2.25 per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care, but only $0.75 a day per orphan. The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so the church could receive the larger amount of money. This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to 20,000 people, and the children are known as the [[Duplessis Orphans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 |title=The Spokesman-Review  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 |title=The Prescott Courier |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental intervention==

Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all [[environmental problem]]s, from chemical [[pollution]] to [[global warming]], are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. [[Traffic congestion]], deaths and injuries from car accidents, [[air pollution]], and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the [[automobile]]. [[Hospital infection]]s are the unexpected side-effect of [[antibiotic resistance]], and even [[human overpopulation]] is the side effect of various technological (i.e., [[Agricultural revolution (disambiguation)|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution|industrial]]) revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author1=Huesemann, Michael H.|author2=Joyce A. Huesemann|year=2011|url=http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org|title=Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment|chapter=Chapter 1, "The Inherent Unavoidability and Unpredictability of Unintended Consequences", and Chapter 2, "Some Unintended Consequences of Modern Technology"|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada|isbn=0865717044|pp=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the complexity of [[ecosystems]], deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have (usually negative) unintended consequences. Sometimes, these effects cause permanent [[irreversible change]]s. Examples include:
* During the [[Four Pests Campaign]] a killing of sparrows was declared. Chinese leaders later realized that sparrows ate a large amount of insects, as well as grains. Rather than being increased, rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last= Dikotter|title=Mao's Great Famine|location=New York|publisher=Walker &amp; Co.|year=2010|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The installation of [[smokestack]]s to decrease pollution in local areas, resulting in spread of pollution at a higher altitude, and [[acid rain]] on an international scale.&lt;ref name="Likens, G.

* After about 1900, public demand led the US government to fight [[forest fire]]s in the American West, and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires. This policy led to fewer fires, but also led to growth conditions such that, when fires did occur, they were much larger and more damaging. Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided, and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of [[forest ecology]].&lt;ref name="How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/23/159373691/how-the-smokey-bear-effect-led-to-raging-wildfires|work=npr.org|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9764">A '''word sort''' is a developmental word study activity espoused by the ''Words Their Way'' curriculum as written by Donald R. Bear, [[Marcia A. Invernizzi|Marcia Invernizzi]], Shane Templeton, and Francine Johnston. The activity focuses students' attention on critical features of words, namely sound, pattern, and meaning.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, D., Invernizzi, M., Templeton, S., Johnston, F. ''Words Their Way: Word Study For Phonics, Vocabulary, and Spelling Instruction''. 4th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Recent descriptions of comprehensive vocabulary programs identify fostering word consciousness (getting students really interested in and excited about words) as a crucial component of effective programs.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;Graves, M.F., &amp; Watts-Taffe, S. (2008, November). For the Love of Words: Fostering Word Consciousness in Young Readers. The Reading Teacher, 62(3), 185–193&lt;/ref&gt;  Word sorts are a method to foster word consciousness.

== Role of Word Sorts ==
The process of sorting words into various categories is the heart of word study. By categorizing different words by certain elements, young children make sense of words and patterns within words. Word sorts combine both [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist learning]] and [[Student-centred learning|teacher-directed instruction]].&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt;

Students receive a stack of cards containing either pictures or words that have several types of contrasting sounds, patterns, or meanings. Each student must then figure out the patterns that exist within the stack, and sort the cards accordingly. By doing this, students construct their own knowledge of words, creating a lasting understanding of how language works. This process contrasts greatly to the simple memorization related to traditional [[spelling test]]s.

The more students understand about the structure of words - their spelling or orthography - the more efficient and fluent their reading will be.  Word sorts place instructional emphasis on the exploration of patterns that can be detected in the sound, structure, and meaning features of words.  Thus, word sorts contribute to orthographic or spelling knowledge, the engine that drives efficient reading as well as efficient writing.&lt;ref name="Templeton and Morris"&gt;Templeton, S, &amp; Morris, D (1999, January). Questions teachers ask about spelling. Reading Research Quarterly, 34(1), 102-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Sorts ==
There are three different types of word sorts: sound sorts, picture sorts, and word sorts.

=== Sound Sorts ===
Sound sorts can take on many forms in a primary classroom and this is essential because sound is the first layer of English [[orthography]].&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; Sound study can be introduced at a very early stage and develop with a child’s individual ability. Sorting pictures or oral vocabulary is a manipulation of sounds, and this manipulation increases awareness. A simple introductory sort is by initial sound and this can develop to ending sound, vowel sounds, and word families sorts. The root of importance is student motivation and involvement in the sort. By “setting the scene with sounds,"&lt;ref name= "Moni"&gt;Moni, K. (2005). 20 Ways to Use Phonics Activities to Motivate Learners with Difficulties. Intervention in School and Clinic, 41(1) 42-5.&lt;/ref&gt; sorts may include concrete materials and pictures linked to learner interest. [[Phonemic awareness]], not phonics, is the understanding that our spoken sounds work together to make words. This is a very early understanding that can be developed in a variety of ways. Comparing sounds is the easiest task for developing phonemic awareness.&lt;ref name= "Holten"&gt;Holten, A. (2004). Children are best taught how to read by learning the sounds of letters. South Bend Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound sorts can be introduced very early on and develop strategically throughout primary learning.

An ability to sort sounds is essential for early reading because sound manipulation is a stepping stone to word study and decoding ability. For some students a direct instructional approach is not necessary in the development of sound study and sorting. Other children who have had less exposure or lack the understanding of sounds and their manipulability may need further instruction to develop their ability. Teachers have a responsibility to students they serve to identify their needs and implement instructional strategies to scaffold students’ understandings of sounds.

Intervention strategies may be necessary in remediating students who cannot correctly identify sounds in isolation on a given opportunity.&lt;ref name= "Joseph"&gt;Joseph, L. (2002). Facilitating Word Recognition and Spelling Using Word Boxes and Word Sort Phonic Procedures. The School Psychology Review, 31(1), 122-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs like [[Reading Recovery]] have contemporary phonemic techniques embedded in the program. Also, books and poems may specifically focus on word families and similar sound patterns for children to identify and understand in context.&lt;ref name= "Glazer"&gt;Glazer, S. (2005). To Phonic or Not to Phonic? Teaching Pre-K-8, 36(3), 71+.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound sorts can be integrated through programs, or very inexpensively through teacher-created materials. For example, students can sort pictures by beginning sound, rhyme, or ending sound. Students do not need to have strong phonics skills in order to engage in sound sorts. This can be a beginning phonemic awareness activity because students need only to identify the sound in order to complete the sort. Letter knowledge is not required, and phonemic development can mature as students do acquire more print knowledge.

=== Picture Sorts ===
Picture sorts are one component of word study and are used to help beginning readers develop Concept of Word, phonological awareness, and phonics.&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, D. (2005). The Howard Street tutoring manual: Teaching at-risk readers in the primary grades (2nd Ed). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Picture sorts most often begin with focusing on initial sound (single consonant, digraphs, or blends). By using picture sorts teachers are able to help students who do not have extensive reading vocabularies focus on isolated sounds (Initial, final, or medial) within a spoken word.&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; These sorts are often a child’s first introduction to word study and are most commonly used with students whose developmental skills are at the emergent, letter name-alphabetic, or early within word Spelling Stages.&lt;ref name="Bear &amp; Templeton"&gt;Bear, D. R., Templeton, S. (1998). Explorations in developmental spelling: Foundations for learning and teaching phonics, spelling, and vocabulary. The Reading Teacher, 52(3), 222-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word Sorts ===
Word sort activities involve students comparing, contrasting, and classifying words - considering words from a variety of perspectives.&lt;ref name="Templeton and Morris"/&gt; Bear et al. emphasized the importance of comparing those words that do fit into a particular category with those that don't.  This type of engagement with words will for most students lead to the abstraction of spelling patterns and the sounds to which they correspond.&lt;ref name="Bear"/&gt;

Word sorts can be teacher directed (closed) or student directed (open).  For example, students in the with-in-word pattern phase of word knowledge could sort words according to a vowel pattern; in such sorts there is always a miscellaneous category for words that do not follow the target categories.&lt;ref name="Templeton and Morris"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! cat !! make !! car !! miscellaneous
|-
| mad || race || star || fall
|-
| flat || game || hard || ball
|-
| cap || place || mark || x
|-
| grab || plate || park || x
|-
|}    

Game-like formats such as board games and card games can also be effective if they focus on words that reflect spelling patterns.  Word-building activities also facilitate abstraction of pattern: word wheels, flip charts, making words.  Spelling or word study notebooks may be used to record, collect, and organize information about words and spelling patterns learned from the word sort.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;Cunningham, P. (1995).  Phonics They Use. (2nd ed.) New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital Word Sorts ===
To complement the many 'hands on' activities students use for sorting words, digitized word sorts provide an efficient way for teachers to deliver spelling pattern differentiation.  A variety of these are ready-made, including [http://www.wordsortwizard.com wordsortwizard.com].

== Adjusting Word Sort Instruction for Students with Learning Problems ==

Research has shown that students who experience significant difficulty with spelling follow the same developmental course as other students, but do so at a slower pace.  In such cases, it is critical to provide word sort words at the appropriate developmental level, regardless of the students' age and grade.  Once the appropriate spelling instructional level is established - be it alphabetic, within-word pattern, or syllable juncture - instruction can be adapted by focusing on fewer words at a time, teaching spelling patterns in an explicit manner, and providing for copious amounts of practice and review.&lt;ref name="Worthy and Invernizzi"&gt;Worthy, M.J. Invernizzi, M. (1990). Spelling errors of normal and disabled students on achievement levels one through four: Instructional implications.  Annals of Dyslexia, 40, 138-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HancockCenterBraces.JPG|thumb|The John Hancock Tower has visible X-bracing on its exterior]]
'''X-bracing''' is a [[structural engineering]] practice where the lateral load on a building is reduced by transferring the load into the exterior columns. 

X-bracing was used in the construction of the 1908 [[Singer Building]], then the tallest building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the Singer Building Construction: Its Progress from Foundation to Flag Pole | publisher=Trow Press | author=Semsch, Otto Francis | year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some skyscrapers by engineer [[Fazlur Khan]], such as the 1969 [[John Hancock Center]], have a distinctive X-bracing exterior, allowing for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan (and usable floor space) if the architect desires.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mir (2001), ''Art of the Skyscraper: the Genius of Fazlur Khan'', Rizzoli International Publications, {{ISBN|0-8478-2370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
