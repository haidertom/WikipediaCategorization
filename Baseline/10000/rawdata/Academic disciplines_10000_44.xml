'''Acute inhalation injury''' may result from frequent and widespread use of household cleaning agents and industrial gases (including [[chlorine]] and [[ammonia]]). The airways and lungs receive continuous first-pass exposure to non-toxic and irritant or toxic gases via inhalation. Irritant gases are those that, on inhalation, dissolve in the water of the respiratory tract [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] and provoke an inflammatory response, usually from the release of acidic or alkaline radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Bessac BF, Jordt SE. (2010) Sensory detection and responses to toxic gases: mechanisms, health effects, and countermeasures. Proc Am Thorac Soc. 7: 269-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;do Pico GA. (1995) Toxic gas inhalation. Curr Opin Pulm Med. 1:102-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smoke]], [[chlorine]], [[phosgene]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[ozone]], and [[ammonia]] are common irritants.

Depending on the type and amount of irritant gas inhaled, victims can experience symptoms ranging from minor respiratory discomfort to acute airway and lung injury and even death. A common response cascade to a variety of irritant gases includes [[inflammation]], [[edema]] and epithelial [[sloughing]], which if left untreated can result in scar formation and pulmonary and airway remodeling. Currently, mechanical ventilation remains the therapeutic mainstay for pulmonary dysfunction following acute inhalation injury.

== Causes ==

===Smoke inhalation===
[[Smoke inhalation]] injury, either by itself but more so in the presence of body surface burn, can result in severe lung-induced morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Clark WR Jr. (1992) Smoke inhalation: diagnosis and treatment. World J Surg. 16: 24-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cause of death in burn centers is now respiratory failure. The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and [[forest fire]]s in [[U.S. state]]s such as [[California]] and [[Nevada]] are examples of incidents that have caused smoke inhalation injury.&lt;ref&gt;Mauer MP, Cummings KR. (2010) Impulse oscillometry and respiratory symptoms in World Trade Center responders, 6 years post-9/11. Lung 188:107-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buyantseva LV, Tulchinsky M, Kapalka GM, Chinchilli VM, Qian Z, Gillio R, Roberts A, Bascom. (2007) Evolution of lower respiratory symptoms in New York police officers after 9/11: a prospective longitudinal study. Occup Environ Med. 49:310-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Injury to the lungs and airways is not only due to deposition of fine [[particulate]] [[soot]] but also due to the gaseous components of smoke, which include phosgene, [[carbon monoxide]], and sulfur dioxide.

===Chlorine===
[[Chlorine]] is a relatively common gas in industry with a variety of uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including [[bleach]], contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a face shield and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form [[hypochlorous acid]], which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure.&lt;ref&gt;Martin JG, Campbell HR, Iijima H, Gautrin D, Malo JL, Eidelman DH, Hamid Q, Maghni K. (2003). Chlorine-induced injury to the airways in mice, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 168:568-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matalon S, Maull EA. (2010) Understanding and treating chlorine-induced lung injury. Proc Am Thorac Soc. 7: 253&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorine’s odor provides early warning signs of exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and broncospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level. .&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy SM, Enarson DA, Janssen RG, Chan-Yeung M. (1991) Lung health consequences of reported accidental chlorine gas exposures among pulpmill workers. Am Rev Respir Dis. 143:74-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Severe exposure may result in  changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in [[Pune]], [[India]], landed 20 individuals in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-8/pune/28360599_1_chlorine-gas-leakage-effluent-treatment-plant]&lt;/ref&gt; Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas has been used as a weapon of warfare since [[World War I]], most recently in [[Iraq War|2007 in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Heller/HELLER.asp |archive-url=https://www.webharvest.gov/peth04/20041017045619/http://www.cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Heller/HELLER.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-10-17 |title=Chemical Warfare in World War I |website=webharvest.gov |access-date=2016-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/world/middleeast/21cnd-baghdad.html|title=Iraqi Militants Use Chlorine in 3 Bombings|last=Cave|first=Damien|date=2007-02-21|last2=Fadam|first2=Ahmad|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Phosgene===
[[Phosgene]], notably used as a  [[chemical weapon]] during World War I, is also used as an industrial reagent and building block in [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[pharmaceuticals]] and other [[organic compound]]s. Because of safety issues, phosgene is almost always produced and consumed within the same plant and extraordinary measures are made to contain this gas. In low concentrations, phosgene’s odor resembles freshly cut hay or grass. Because of this, the gas may not be noticed and symptoms may appear slowly. Phosgene directly reacts with [[amine]], [[sulfhydryl]], and [[alcohol]] [[Functional group|groups]], adversely affecting cell macromolecules and metabolism. The direct toxicity to the cells leads to an increase in capillary permeability.&lt;ref&gt;Grainge C, Rice P. (2010) Management of phosgene-induced acute lung injury. Clin Toxicol. 48:497-508.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gift JS, McGaughy R, Singh DV, Sonawane B. (2008)Health assessment of phosgene: approaches for derivation of reference concentration. [[Regul Toxicol Pharmacol]]. 51:98-107&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when phosgene hydrolyzes it forms [[hydrochloric acid]], which can damage the cell surface and cause cell death in the [[alveoli]] and [[bronchiole]]s. The hydrochloric acid triggers an inflammatory response that attracts neutrophils to the lungs, which causes [[pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus AA, Devereaux A. (2002) Potential agents of chemical warfare. Worst-case scenario protection and decontamination methods. Postgrad Med. 112:133-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ammonia===
[[Ammonia]] is generally used in household cleaning products, as well as on farms and in some industrial and commercial locations, and this makes it easy for accidental or deliberate exposure to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Lalić H, Djindjić-Pavicić M, Kukuljan M. (2009) Ammonia intoxication on workplace--case report and a review of literature. Coll Antropol. 33:945-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiss SM, Lakshminarayan S. (1994) Acute inhalation injury. Clin Chest Med. 15:103-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witschi H. (1977) Environmental agents altering lung biochemistry. Fed Proc. 36:1631-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia interacts with moist surfaces to form [[ammonium hydroxide]], which causes [[necrosis]] of tissues. Exposure to high concentrations can cause bronchiolar and alveolar edema and airway destruction resulting in respiratory distress or failure. Although ammonia has a pungent odor, it also causes olfactory fatigue or adaptation, reducing awareness of prolonged exposure.

===Sulfur mustard===
[[Sulfur mustard]] was used as a chemical weapon in World War I and more recently in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Sulfur mustard is a vesicant alkylating agent with strong cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic properties. After exposure, victims show skin irritations and blisters.&lt;ref&gt;Adelipour M, Imani Fooladi AA, Yazdani S, Vahedi E, Ghanei M, Nourani MR. (2011) Smad molecules expression pattern in human bronchial airway induced by sulfur mustard. Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol. 10:147-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ghabili K, Agutter PS, Ghanei M, Ansarin K, Panahi Y, Shoja MM. (2011) Sulfur mustard toxicity: history, chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Crit Rev Toxicol. 41:384-403.&lt;/ref&gt; This agent also causes [[respiratory tract]] [[lesion]]s, [[Bone marrow suppression|bone marrow depression]], and eye damage, the epithelial tissues of these organs being predominately affected. Inhalation of high doses of this gas causes lesions in the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi with inflammatory reactions and necrosis. The alkylating agent affects more the upper parts of the respiratory tract, and only intensely exposed victims showed signs like bronchiolitis obliterans in the distal part. Secondary effects of sulfur mustard exposure lead to chronic lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis.

===Chloramine===
A common exposure involves accidental mixing of household ammonia with cleansers containing bleach, causing the irritant gas [[chloramine]] to be released.

===Mustard gas===
Mustards, vesicating agents, have been primarily used in warfare. They damage the upper airway mucosa. Pulmonary edema rarely occurs because mustard rarely affects the lung parenchyma and alveoli.

===Methyl isocyanate===
[[Methyl isocyanate]] is an intermediate chemical in the production of [[carbamate]] [[pesticide]]s (such as carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb).&lt;ref&gt;Mansour SA. (2004) Pesticide exposure--Egyptian scene. Toxicology 198: 91-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckett WS. (1998) Persistent respiratory effects in survivors of the Bhopal disaster. Thorax 53:S43-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in the production of rubbers and adhesives. As a highly toxic and irritating material, it is hazardous to human health, and was involved in the [[Bhopal disaster]]—which killed nearly 8,000 people initially and approximately 17,000 people in total.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett WS. (1998) Persistent respiratory effects in survivors of the Bhopal disaster. Thorax 53:S43-6.&lt;/ref&gt; When inhaled the vapor produces a direct inflammatory effect on the respiratory tract.

==Pathophysiology==
Respiratory damage is related to the concentration of the gas and its solubility. Irritant gas exposures predominantly affect the airways, causing [[tracheitis]], bronchitis, and [[bronchiolitis]]. Other inhaled agents may be directly toxic (e.g. [[cyanide]], [[carbon monoxide]]), or cause harm simply by displacing oxygen and producing [[asphyxia]] (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide). The effect of inhaling irritant gases depends on the extent and duration of exposure and on the specific agent&lt;ref&gt;Demnati R, Fraser R, Ghezzo H, Martin JG, Plaa G, Malo JL. (1998) Time-course of functional and pathological changes after a single high acute inhalation of chlorine in rats, Eur Respir J. 11:922-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkhorn SR, Garry VF. (2008) Agricultural lung diseases. Environ Health Perspect 108:705-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hlastala MP, Ralph DD, Babb AL, Influence of gas physical properties on pulmonary gas exchange, Adv Exp Med Biol. 227 (1988) 33-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are among the most important irritant gases. Hydrogen sulfide is also a potent cellular toxin, blocking the [[cytochrome]] system and inhibiting cellular respiration. More water-soluble gases (e.g. chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride) dissolve in the upper airway and immediately cause mucous membrane irritation, which may alert people to the need to escape the exposure. Permanent damage to the upper respiratory tract, distal airways, and lung parenchyma occurs only if escape from the gas source is impeded. Less soluble gases (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the respiratory tract, often reaching the lower airways.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson JC, Hlastala MP. (2007) Breath tests and airway gas exchange. Pulm Pharmacol Ther. 20:112-7.&lt;/ref&gt; These agents are less likely to produce early warning signs (phosgene in low concentrations has a pleasant odor), are more likely to cause severe bronchiolitis, and often have a lag of ≥ 12 h before symptoms of pulmonary edema develop.

===Acute lung injury===
[[Acute lung injury]] (ALI), also called non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, is characterized by the abrupt onset of significant hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of cardiac failure. The core pathology is disruption of the capillary-endothelial interface: this actually refers to two separate barriers – the endothelium and the basement membrane of the alveolus.&lt;ref&gt;Luh SP, Chiang CH. (2007) Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS): the mechanism, present strategies and future perspectives of therapies. J Zhejiang Univ Sci B 8:60-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flick MR. (1986) Mechanisms of acute lung injury. What have we learned from experimental animal models? Crit Care Clin. 2:455-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uchida T, Makita K. (2008) Acute lung injury and alveolar epithelial function. Masui. 57:51-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tang PS, Mura M, Seth R, Liu M. (2008) Acute lung injury and cell death: how many ways can cells die? Am J Physiol 294:L632-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the acute phase of ALI, there is increased permeability of this barrier and protein rich fluid leaks out of the capillaries. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells – Type 1 pneumocytes represent 90% of the cell surface area, and are easily damaged. Type 2 pneumocytes are more resistant to damage, which is important as these cells produce surfactant, transport ions and proliferate and differentiate into Type 1 cells. The damage to the endothelium and the alveolar epithelium results in the creation of an open interface between the lung and the blood, facilitating the spread of micro-organisms from the lung systemically, stoking up a systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, the injury to epithelial cells handicaps the lung’s ability to pump fluid out of airspaces. Fluid filled airspaces, loss of surfactant, microvascular thrombosis and disorganized repair (which leads to fibrosis) reduces resting lung volumes (decreased compliance), increasing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right to left shunt and the work of breathing. In addition, lymphatic drainage of lung units appears to be curtailed—stunned by the acute injury—which contributes to the build-up of extravascular fluid. Some patients rapidly recover from ALI and have no permanent sequelae. Prolonged inflammation and destruction of pneumocytes leads to fibroblastic proliferation, hyaline membrane formation, tracheal remodeling and lung fibrosis. This fibrosing alveolitis may become apparent as early as five days after the initial injury. Subsequent recovery may be characterized by reduced physiologic reserve, and increased susceptibility to further lung injuries. Extensive microvascular thrombosis may lead to pulmonary hypertension, myocardial dysfunction and systemic hypotension.

===Acute respiratory distress syndrome===
Clinically, the most serious and immediate complication is [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), which usually occurs within 24 h.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch JE, Cheek JM, Chan EY, Zwischenberger JB. (2006) Adjuncts to mechanical ventilation in ARDS. Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 18:20-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meduri GU, Yates CR. (2004) Systemic inflammation-associated glucocorticoid resistance and outcome of ARDS. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1024:24-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison RJ, Bidani A. (2002) Acute respiratory distress syndrome epidemiology and pathophysiology. Chest Surg Clin N Am. 12:301-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Those with significant lower airway involvement may develop bacterial infection. Importantly, victims suffering body surface burn and smoke inhalation are the most susceptible. Thermal injury combined with inhalation injury compromises pulmonary function, producing microvascular hyperpermeability that leads to a significant increase in lung lymph flow and pulmonary edema. The terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 left many people with impaired lung function.&lt;ref&gt;Banauch GI, Izbicki G, Christodoulou V, Weiden MD, Webber MP, Cohen H, Gustave J, Chavko R, Aldrich TK, Kelly KJ, Prezant DJ. (2008) Trial of prophylactic inhaled steroids to prevent or reduce pulmonary function decline, pulmonary symptoms, and airway hyperreactivity in firefighters at the world trade center site. Disaster Med Public Health Prep. 2:33-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berninger A, Webber MP, Weakley J, Gustave J, Zeig-Owens R, Lee R, Al-Othman F, Cohen HW, Kelly K, Prezant DJ. (2010) Quality of life in relation to upper and lower respiratory conditions among retired 9/11-exposed firefighters with pulmonary disability. Qual Life Res. 19:1467-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowley LE, Herbert R, Moline JM, Wallenstein S, Shukla G, Schechter C, Skloot GS, Udasin I, Luft BJ, Harrison D, Shapiro M, Wong K, Sacks HS, Landrigan PJ, Teirstein AS. (2011) Sarcoid like granulomatous pulmonary disease in World Trade Center disaster responders. Am J Ind Med. 54:175-84.&lt;/ref&gt; A study of firefighters and EMS workers enrolled in the FDNY WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, whose lung function was tested prior to 9/11, documented a steep decline in lung function in the first year after 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;Banauch GI, Izbicki G, Christodoulou V, Weiden MD, Webber MP, Cohen H, Gustave J, Chavko R, Aldrich TK, Kelly KJ, Prezant DJ. (2008) Trial of prophylactic inhaled steroids to prevent or reduce pulmonary function decline, pulmonary symptoms, and airway hyperreactivity in firefighters at the world trade center site. Disaster Med Public Health Prep. 2:33-9.&lt;/ref&gt; A new study that includes a thousand additional workers shows that the declines have persisted over time.&lt;ref&gt;Berninger A, Webber MP, Weakley J, Gustave J, Zeig-Owens R, Lee R, Al-Othman F, Cohen HW, Kelly K, Prezant DJ. (2010) Quality of life in relation to upper and lower respiratory conditions among retired 9/11-exposed firefighters with pulmonary disability. Qual Life Res. 19:1467-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 9/11, 3% of firefighters had below-normal lung function, one year after 9/11 nearly 19% did, and six years later it stabilized at 13%. Ten to 14 days after acute exposure to some agents (e.g. ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury), some patients develop [[bronchiolitis obliterans]] progressing to ARDS. [[Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia|Bronchiolitis obliterans with organized pneumonia]] can ensue when granulation tissue accumulates in the terminal airways and alveolar ducts during the body's reparative process. A minority of these patients develop late pulmonary fibrosis. Also at enhanced risk are persons with co-morbidities. Several studies report that both aged persons and smokers are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of inhalation injury.

==Treatment strategies==
Specific pretreatments, drugs to prevent chemically induced lung injuries due to respiratory airway toxins, are not available. Analgesic medications, oxygen, humidification, and ventilator support currently constitute standard therapy. In fact, mechanical ventilation remains the therapeutic mainstay for acute inhalation injury.&lt;ref&gt;Matthay MA, Zemans RL. (2011) The acute respiratory distress syndrome: pathogenesis and treatment. Annu Rev Pathol. 6:147-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/phemce.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of treatment is to keep the PaO2 &gt; 60 mmHg (8.0 kPa), without causing injury to the lungs with excessive O2 or volutrauma. Pressure control ventilation is more versatile than volume control, although breaths should be volume limited, to prevent stretch injury to the alveoli. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to improve oxygenation. Hemorrhaging, signifying substantial damage to the lining of the airways and lungs, can occur with exposure to highly corrosive chemicals and may require additional medical interventions. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered, and bronchodilators to treat bronchospasms. Drugs that reduce the inflammatory response, promote healing of tissues, and prevent the onset of pulmonary edema or secondary inflammation may be used following severe injury to prevent chronic scarring and airway narrowing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson ER, Matthay MA. (2010) Acute lung injury: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment, J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv. 23:243-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although current treatments can be administered in a controlled hospital setting, many hospitals are ill-suited for a situation involving mass casualties among civilians. Inexpensive positive-pressure devices that can be used easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, allopurinol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/phemce.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as [[insulin]], [[dopamine]], and [[allopurinol]] have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the ''AANA Journal'' discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as [[sevoflurane]], to be used as a bronchodilator that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meesun|first1=Vera|title=CRNA|journal=AANA Journal|date=June 2014|volume=82|issue=3|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/phemce.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. Mechanistic information based on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy. Mechanistic studies may also aid in the development of new diagnostic approaches. Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract.

Currently there are no clinically approved agents that can reduce pulmonary and airway cell dropout and avert the transition to pulmonary and /or airway fibrosis.

==Preclinical development of pulmonary protective strategies==
Given the constant threat of bioterrorist related events, there is an urgent need to develop pulmonary protective and reparative agents that can be used by first responders in a mass casualty setting. Use in such a setting would require administration via a convenient route for e.g. intramuscular via epipens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/phemce.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Other feasible routes of administration could be inhalation and perhaps to a lesser extent oral – swallowing can be difficult in many forms of injury especially if accompanied by secretions or if victim is nauseous. A number of in vitro and in vivo models lend themselves to preclinical evaluation of novel pulmonary therapies.

===In vitro===
In vitro, exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells or human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells to agents such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] or bleach produces a time and toxin-dose-dependent decrease in cellular viability.&lt;ref&gt;Rappeneau S, Baeza-Squiban A, Jeulin C, Marano F. (2000) Protection from cytotoxic effects induced by the nitrogen mustard mechlorethamine on human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Toxicol Sci. 54:212-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arita Y, Harkness SH, Kazzaz JA, Koo HC, Joseph A, Melendez JA, Davis JM, Chander A, Li Y. (2006) Mitochondrial localization of catalase provides optimal protection from H2O2-induced cell death in lung epithelial cells. Am J Physiol. 290:L978-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Song W, Wei S, Zhou Y, Lazrak A, Liu G, Londino JD, Squadrito GL, Matalon S. (2010) Inhibition of lung fluid clearance and epithelial Na+ channels by chlorine, hypochlorous acid, and chloramines. J Biol Chem. 285:9716-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Cells exposed to these agents demonstrate significant ATP depletion, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation, followed by death allowing for evaluation of novel cytoprotective agents. Potential tissue reparative agents can be evaluated in vitro by determining their effects on stimulation of pulmonary and airway epithelial cell proliferation.

===In vivo===
Test articles passing muster in vitro can be evaluated in a number of in vivo models (usually in mice) of ALI including chlorine inhalation, [[intratracheal instillation]] of [[bleomycin]] and in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) overexpressing transgenic mice exposed to high dose doxycycline.&lt;ref&gt;Matute-Bello G, Frevert CW, Martin TR.

(2008) Identification of transforming growth factor beta1-driven genetic programs of acute lung fibrosis. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 39:324-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia.&lt;ref&gt;Zarogiannis SG, Jurkuvenaite A, Fernandez S, Doran SF, Yadav AK, Squadrito GL, Postlethwait EM, Bowen L, Matalon S. (2011) Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 45:386-92&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death.&lt;ref&gt;Li X, Li S, Zhang M, Li X, Zhang X, Zhang W, Li C. (2010) Protective effects of a bacterially expressed NIF-KGF fusion protein against bleomycin-induced acute lung injury in mice.

(2009) Role of proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1beta in bleomycin-induced lung injury in humans and mice. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 41:661-70&lt;/ref&gt; Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Kang HR, Cho SJ, Lee CG, Homer RJ, Elias JA. (2007) Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 stimulates pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation via a Bax-dependent, bid-activated pathway that involves matrix metalloproteinase-12.

(2008) Identification of transforming growth factor beta1-driven genetic programs of acute lung fibrosis. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 39:324-36.&lt;/ref&gt; A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;Hamahata A, Enkhbaatar P, Sakurai H, Nozaki M, Traber DL. (2010) Sclerosis therapy of bronchial artery attenuates acute lung injury induced by burn and smoke inhalation injury in ovine model. Burns. 36:1042-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esechie A, Enkhbaatar P, Traber DL, Jonkam C, Lange M, Hamahata A, Djukom C, Whorton EB, Hawkins HK, Traber LD, Szabo C. (2009) Beneficial effect of a hydrogen sulphide donor (sodium sulphide) in an ovine model of burn- and smoke-induced acute lung injury. Br J Pharmacol. 158:1442-53.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.

'''Bad Day''' (also known as '''Badday''', {{citation needed span|text='''Computer rage''', or '''Office rage'''|date=April 2013}}) is a 27-second [[viral video]] where a frustrated [[office worker]] assaults his [[cubicle]] [[Personal computer|computer]]. It has circulated virally online since 1997. The video became a cultural embodiment of [[computer rage]], and is the subject of several parodies and ad campaigns.

==Plot==
In the [[surveillance]]-style video, a male [[office worker]] in his [[cubicle]] is becoming increasingly irritated with the [[computer]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; He slaps the [[computer display|monitor]] in frustration, punches the [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] before using it like a [[baseball bat]] to knock the monitor off of the desk.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; His neighbor peers over the partition twice in curiosity.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; The video ends with the [[protagonist]] kicking the monitor out of his cubicle.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

==Cast==
* Vinny Licciardi – Angry office worker
* Curious coworker

==Production and spread==
The video clip was staged and produced by [[Durango, Colorado]]-based Loronix Information Systems to demonstrate the benefits of their digital video surveillance system for release on a promotional CD.&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"/&gt; The video is an example of a potential use for the surveillance system.&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"/&gt; The video's subject is Vinny Licciardi, the company's shipping manager.&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"/&gt; Licciardi appeared in a series of promotional videos extolling the benefits of Loronix's special brand of digital video recording systems. Loronix was the first company to develop a digital video surveillance system to replace video tape recorders. {{As of|2008}}, Loronix is a subsidiary of [[Verint Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Bad Day has circulated online since at least 1997.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; It made its largest impression via email, where its reasonable size made distribution easy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The origin was revealed in 1998 originally by [[CNN]] and later in print by [[Security Distribution Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Keven Ellison, Marketing Manager, Loronix Information Systems (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The company first heard of the video's popularity in June 1998.&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"/&gt; Its popularity within the company created internal computer issues.&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"/&gt; The video is also frequently used in ''[[List of Internet phenomena|Angry German Kid]]'' parodies, with the office worker in the video often being portrayed as Leopold's [[father|dad]].

==Legacy==
According to [[user interaction]] expert Frank Thissen, though fictional, it provides an example of how user expectations from longstanding social conventions can be frustrated through poor programming. In the Bad Day scenario, "The expectations of the user are obviously badly neglected", and the computer's lack of reaction or poor reaction is understood in the context of a human social situation, such as someone walking away in the middle of a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Follow-ups to the video were featured on [[TechTV]] promos, where the same man is videotaped throwing the computer down a flight of stairs, and later running it over with his car. A 2005 spoof was produced by GoViral for the network security firm NetOp, showing a computer fighting back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">'''Bdelygmia''', deriving from a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "filth" or "nastiness", is a technique used in [[rhetoric]] to express hatred of a person, word or action through a series of criticisms.&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt; Bdelygmia often appears as an "abusive description of a character" or "by strong and inappropriate critique". It is synonymous with [[wikt:abominatio|abominatio]].&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Gregory T. |title=Dictionary of Rhetorical Terms |year=2010 |publisher=Xlibris Corporstion |isbn=1450020283 |pages=55, 56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn54SmsX-SEC&amp;dq=bdelygmia+and+rhetoric&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}, p.&amp;nbsp;55.{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that since common people do not belong to major decision-making groups, they cannot easily be swayed to feel a certain way.  Violence in rhetoric, according to Lynette Hunter, arose because of this notion. It has become the dominant form of commentary on social media sites and is often described as "verbal violence" because of its hateful nature.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=Lynette |title=Considering Issues of Violence and Rhetoric |journal=Parallax |year=2000 |volume=6 |issue=2 |doi=10.1080/13534640050083756 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13534640050083756 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd |issn=1460-700X |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bdelygmia in classical rhetoric ==

Bdelygmia is consistent with an appeal to [[pathos]]. If an individual is trying to move their audience emotionally, he or she must express the same emotion toward a view or individual{{spaced ndash}}in this case, hatred. Distinction is made between hatred and criticism.&lt;ref name="Howard"/&gt; In comparison with other rhetorical devices, bdelygmia is not considered a very sophisticated appeal to emotion.&lt;ref name="Nordquist"/&gt; As an appeal to pathos, effective bdelygmia employs strong language and knowledge of the intended. However, if gone about in the wrong way, employing bdelygmia in rhetoric can have severe repercussions, making the speaker seem intolerant and offensive. Rhetoric is used by politicians to instigate discourse between two opposing groups. Bdelygmia has a commonplace in political rhetoric because of the strong emotions evoked by the topics politicians often debate upon.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

== Violence in rhetoric ==

According to Lynette Hunter, one of the reasons rhetoric emerged in [[Athens]] around 500&amp;nbsp;BC was as a way to manage physical violence: "[R]hetoric instigates violence; impels people into the cycle of brutality that once started becomes self-justifying."&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

== Examples in recent and contemporary culture ==

===Online===
One of the most prominent uses of bdelygmia in society today has been portrayed through [[cyberbullying]]. An individual who expresses hatred for another person or criticizes them in a negative way is using bdelygmia to bully them.&lt;ref name="Nordquist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nordquist |first=Richard |title=Bdelygmia |url=http://grammar.about.com/od/ab/g/bdelygmiaterm.htm |publisher=About.com |year=2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynette Hunter implies that individuals who do not wish to resort to physical violence use a rhetorical device such as bdelygmia to try to attack someone through the delivery of words.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

===Politics===
When people disagree with one another, they often try to associate their opposition with negative [[connotation]]s. Lynette Hunter describes rhetorical violence in politics as a way to persuade people through the negative criticism of another rather than through physical force&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– when, for example, one party, through their criticisms and/or expressions of hatred or criticism, persuades a group to believe that the other party is treacherous.

===Literature and music===
''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' is an iconic piece of literature that uses the rhetorical device of bdelygmia to portray the main character, Mr. Grinch, as a terrible person. The lyrics not only allow the audience to understand that the Grinch is a bad person, but they use words such as "foul" and "nasty" [?to attribute with the Grinch].&lt;ref name="Nordquist"/&gt;

| quoted in {{lower|0.45em|&lt;ref name="Nordquist"/&gt;}}
}}

===Popular culture===
Another example of bdelygmia in popular culture is found in the movie "''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation''". When Clark Griswold finds out he will not get his expected bonus, he goes on a rant stating, "I want to look him straight in the eye and I want to tell him what a cheap, lying, no-good, rotten, four-flushing, low-life, snake-licking, dirt-eating, inbred, overstuffed, ignorant, blood-sucking, dog-kissing, brainless, ****less, hopeless, heartless, fat-***, bug-eyed, stiff-legged, spotty-lipped, worm-headed sack of monkey **** he is. Hallelujah. Holy sh**. Where's the Tylenol?" By offering a long string of criticisms about his boss, Griswold appeals to the audience to also feel negatively towards him.&lt;ref name="Tag Archives:Bdelygmia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tag Archives: Bdelygmia|url=http://wordnymph.com/tag/bdelygmia/|website=Word Nymph|publisher=Word Nymph|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13248">'''Loss of biodiversity''' or '''biodiversity loss''' is the [[extinction]] of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain [[habitat]].

The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the [[environmental degradation]] that leads to the loss is reversible through [[ecological restoration]] / [[ecological resilience]] or effectively permanent (e.g. through [[land loss]]). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.

Even though permanent [[global biodiversity|global]] [[species loss]] is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in [[species composition]], even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the [[food web]] and the [[food chain]] insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain ([[coextinction]]), leading to an overall reduction in [[biodiversity]], possible [[alternative stable states]] of an ecosystem notwithstanding. [[Ecological effects of biodiversity]] are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced [[ecosystem services]] and eventually poses an immediate danger for [[food security]], also for humankind.&lt;ref name=cardinale2012/&gt;

Locally bounded loss rates can be [[measurement|measured]] using [[species richness]] and its variation [[time series|over time]]. Raw [[Count data|count]]s may not be as ecologically relevant as relative or absolute [[Abundance (ecology)|abundances]]. Taking into account the [[relative frequencies]], a considerable number of [[biodiversity index]]es has been developed. Besides richness, evenness and heterogeneity are considered to be the main dimensions along which diversity can be measured.&lt;ref name=cardinale2012&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature11148 | title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity | year=2012 | last1=Cardinale | first1=Bradley | journal=Nature | volume=486 | pages=59–67|bibcode = 2012Natur.486...59C | pmid=22678280 | issue=7401|display-authors=etal|quote=...at the first [[Earth Summit]], the vast majority of the world’s nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth’s ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate.

As with all diversity measures, it is essential to accurately classify the spatial and temporal scope of the observation. "Definitions tend to become less precise as the complexity
of the subject increases and the associated spatial and temporal scales widen.&lt;ref name=tagliapietra&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological diversity and habitat diversity: a matter of Science and perception|url=http://www.unige.ch/sciences/near/pdf/Tagliapietra%20and%20Sigovini%202010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiversity itself is not a single concept but can be split up into various scales (e.g. [[ecosystem diversity]] vs. [[habitat]] diversity or even biodiversity vs. habitat diversity&lt;ref name=tagliapietra/&gt;) or different subcategories (e.g. [[phylogenetic diversity]], [[species diversity]], [[genetic diversity]], [[nucleotide diversity]]). The question of net loss in confined regions is often a matter of debate but longer observation times are generally thought to be beneficial to loss estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ecology|year=2016 |volume=97|issue=8|pages=1949–1960|doi=10.1890/15-1759.1|title=Estimating local biodiversity change: a critique of papers claiming no net loss of local diversity.|quote=two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others.

To compare rates between different geographic regions [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]] should also be considered.

The '''British Rail Research Division''' came into being in 1964 directly under the control of the [[British Railways Board]], moving into purpose-built premises at the [[Railway Technical Centre]] in [[Derby]]. The intention was to improve railway reliability and efficiency, while reducing costs and improving revenue. In so doing it became recognised as a centre of excellence and, in time, was providing consultancy to other railways around the world. While it became famous for the [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT), its activities extended into every area of railway operation. The theoretical rigor of its approach to railway engineering superseded the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously.
[[File:Apt-front.jpg|right|thumb|200px|APT-E at [[Shildon Locomotion Museum|''Locomotion'']], [[Shildon]], [[County Durham]] ]]

==Work==
The Research Division brought together personnel and expertise from all over the country, including the [[LMS Scientific Research Laboratory]]. Their remit was not simply the improvement of existing equipment, or the solution of existing problems, but fundamental research from first principles, into railway operation. The results of its work would go on to inform development by engineers, manufacturers and railways all over the world. For instance, once the initial APT-E experimental project was complete, it passed to the mechanical engineering department to build the APT-P prototype. In time, engineers would be seconded to other countries for varying periods under the trade name "Transmark".

One of the first major projects was the development of profiled/pre-worn wheels which helped counter the tendency of new wheels to [[Hunting oscillation|hunt]]. This led to research into vehicle suspensions, and the creation of the four-wheel [[High Speed Freight Vehicle]] (HSFV1) which proved stable at up to 140mph when tested on the roller rig.

Other work involved looking at the tamping of ballast, properties of subsoils, and rail prestressing. A large part of the network had been converted to continuous welded rail which, during a hot summer, caused many problems with rail buckling. Although there were no injuries, there were a number of derailments. Attention focused on the costs and benefits of tamping the ballast over the sleeper ends.

There were extended studies into [[fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]], and pioneering work in ultrasound crack detection at a time when it was being investigated elsewhere for medical diagnostics. The Research Division was involved in new [[Railway signalling|signalling]] systems, such as [[Solid State Interlocking]] (SSI) and the [[Integrated Electronic Control Centre]] (IECC), and in the design of the overhead lines for the [[West Coast Main Line]].
[[File:LEV1 at Weybourne Station.jpg|thumb|right|The prototype railbus LEV1]]

The Research Division developed two test tracks. The first was on the old [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GNR]] line between Egginton Junction and Derby Friargate (later used only as far as Mickleover) and was used by the Train Control Group. When the Advanced Passenger Train was being developed, a second test track was created on the line between Melton Junction and Edwalton (known as the [[Old Dalby Test Track]]), which was acquired specifically to test this revolutionary train. The Mickleover test track was closed and lifted in the early 1990s but Old Dalby is still in use today and has a bright future.

==End of the line==
In 1986 finance for the division was moved from the board to the operating divisions. Thus emphasis shifted from pure research to problem solving. In 1989, BR Research became a self-contained unit working under contract to British Rail and other customers, and the way was open for privatisation.
   
When British Rail was sold into private ownership, the Research Division (which had become "BR Research Limited") was bought by [[AEA Technology|AEA Technology plc]] in 1996. The resulting business, "AEA Technology Rail", was subsequently sold in 2006 to a venture capital company and became [[DeltaRail Group|DeltaRail Group Limited]]. Transmark, the consultancy arm, was sold to [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow]] to become Halcrow Transmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Network Rail launches international arm|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2012/07/09-network-rail-launches-international-arm.html|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Railnews|date=9 July 2012|quote=Transmark, which was the consultancy arm of the BR Research Division, was sold to Halcrow when the railways were privatised in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A somewhat dated display of material relating to the work of the Division was maintained in the [[Derby Industrial Museum]].

==Legacy==
The Research Division had an uneasy relationship with other parts of BR, and like most of the products of [[Harold Wilson]]'s "[[white heat of technology]]" speech, were killed off in the early 1980s. The basis of the unease was the traditional approach of most of BR compared with theoretical and aerospace approaches adopted by the Research Division. The hiring of graduates rather than training people up internally also caused tensions.

It could be somewhat tactless, or perhaps naive, at times. The APT-E was provided with a single driver position central in the cab, at a time when the unions were resisting the loss of the "second man" (the fireman in steam days). After its first run out to [[Duffield, Derbyshire|Duffield]] the APT-E was "blacked" by the unions for a year. 

Nevertheless, its empirical research into vehicle dynamics has produced today's high speed trains, both freight and passenger, including the [[High Speed Train]], [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] and worldwide. The concept of a tilting system for the APT became part of the  [[Pendolino]]{{fact|date=December 2017}}, while the products of its signalling and operations control research are used over a significant amount of the British railway system.

Observed bursts are named by the number of discrete action potentials they are composed of: a ''doublet'' is a two-spike burst, a ''triplet'' three and a ''quadruplet'' four. Neurons that are intrinsically prone to bursting behavior are referred to as ''bursters'' and this tendency to burst may be a product of the environment or the [[phenotype]] of the cell.

==Physiological context==

===Overview===
Neurons typically operate by firing single [[action potential]] spikes in relative isolation as discrete input [[postsynaptic potential]]s combine and drive the [[membrane potential]] across the [[threshold potential|threshold]]. Bursting can instead occur for many reasons, but neurons can be generally grouped as exhibiting ''input-driven'' or ''intrinsic'' bursting. Most cells will exhibit bursting if they are driven by a constant, subthreshold input&lt;ref name='nesb'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1142/S0218127400000840|title=Neural excitability, spiking and bursting|journal=International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos|date=2000-01-01|first=Eugene|last=Izhikevich|volume=10|issue=6|pages=1171–1266|id= |url=ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/odyssee/Team/Olivier.Faugeras/ArticlesCoursENS-MVA/izhikevich-nesb.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-11-30 |bibcode = 2000IJBC...10.1171I }}&lt;/ref&gt; and particular cells which are genotypically prone to bursting (called ''bursters'') have complex feedback systems which will produce bursting patterns with less dependence on input and sometimes even in isolation.&lt;ref name="jeffreys1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;

In each case, the physiological system is often {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} thought as being the action of two linked subsystems. The ''fast subsystem'' is responsible for each spike the neuron produces.  The ''slow subsystem'' modulates the shape and intensity of these spikes before eventually triggering quiescence.

Input-driven bursting often {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Neural coding|encodes]] the intensity of input into the bursting frequency&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; where a neuron then acts as an [[integrator]]. Intrinsic bursting is a more specialized phenomenon and is believed {{by whom|date=February 2014}} to play a much more diverse role in [[neural computation]]. {{clarify|date=February 2014}}

===Fast subsystem===
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}

===Slow subsystem===
Bursts differ from [[tonic (physiology)|tonic]] firing, rapid spiking at similar rates to bursting but continuing for long periods of time, in that bursting involves a physiological "slow subsystem" that eventually depletes as the bursting continues and then must be replenished before the cell can burst again (compare ''[[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]'').&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; During the bursting event, this slow subsystem modulates the timing and intensity of the emitted spikes and is thought {{by whom|date=February 2014}} to be important in the computational aspects {{clarify|date=February 2014}} of the resulting burst pattern. There are many discovered mechanisms of slow subsystems including voltage-&lt;ref name='prebot1'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Models of Respiratory Rhythm Generation in the Pre-Botzinger Complex. I.

The slow subsystem also is connected to [[endogenous]] bursting patterns in neurons, where the pattern can be maintained completely by internal mechanism without any [[synapse|synaptic]] input. This process also relies on [[calcium channel]]s, which [[Depolarization|depolarize]] the neuron by allowing an influx of calcium [[ion]]s. So long as internal calcium ion concentrations remain at an elevated level, the neuron will continue to undergo periods of rapid spiking. However, elevated calcium ion levels also trigger a [[Second messenger system|second messenger cascade]] within the cell which lower calcium influx and promote calcium efflux and [[buffer solution|buffering]]. As calcium concentrations decline, the period of rapid bursting ceases, and the phase of quiescence begins. When calcium levels are low, the original calcium channels will reopen, restarting the process and creating a bursting pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryne|first=John|title=Feedback/recurrent inhibition in nanocircuits|url=http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/introduction.html|work=Neuroscience Online|publisher=University of Texas Health Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical detection==
In isolation or in mathematical models bursting can be recognized since the environment and state of the neuron can be carefully observed and modulated. When observing neurons in the wild, however, bursting may be difficult to distinguish from normal firing patterns. In order to recognize bursting patterns in these contexts statistical methods are used to determine threshold parameters.

Bursting is characterized by a [[coefficient of variation]] (CV) of the interspike intervals (ISI) that is larger than one, or a [[Fano factor]] of the spike count that is larger than one, because bursting leads to spike patterns that are more irregular than a [[Poisson process]] (which has a CV and Fano factor equal to unity). Alternatively, the [[Serial correlation|serial correlation coefficient]] of the ISI sequence is positive for bursting patterns, because in this case short ISIs tend to be followed by more short ISIs (at least if the bursts consist of more than two spikes).

==Mathematical models==
Neuron behavior is often modeled as single-compartment, non-linear [[dynamical systems]], where the neuron states represent physiological quantities such as membrane voltage, current flow, and the concentrations of various ions intra- and extracellularly. These models most generally take the singularly [[perturbation theory|perturbed]] form

: ''fast subsystem'': &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x, u)&lt;/math&gt;
: ''slow subsystem'': &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = \mu g(x, u)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are both [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|Hodgkin–Huxley]] style relations, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector representing the cell parameters relevant to the fast subsystem, &lt;math&gt;\dot{u}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector representing the parameters of the slow modulation subsystem, and &lt;math&gt;\mu \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the time scales between the fast and slow subsystems.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;

Models of neuron dynamics generally exhibit a number of stable and unstable [[attractor]]s in [[phase space]] which represent resting states. When the system is sufficiently perturbed by input stimuli it may follow a complex return path back to the [[stable attractor]] representing an action potential. In bursting neurons, these dynamic spaces [[bifurcation theory|bifurcate]] between quiescent and bursting modes according to the dynamics of the slow system. These two bifurcations may take many forms and the choice of bifurcation both from quiescent to bursting and bursting to quiescent can affect the behavioral aspects of the burster.

The complete classification of quiescent-to-bursting and bursting-to-quiescent bifurcations leads to 16 common forms and 120 possible forms if the dimensionality of the fast subsystem is not constrained.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; Of the most common 16, a few are well studied.

===Square-wave burster===
The '''fold/homoclinic''', also called square-wave, burster is so named because the shape of the voltage trace during a burst looks similar to a square wave due to fast transitions between the resting state attractor and the spiking limit cycle.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;

==Purposes==
Bursting is a very general phenomenon and is observed in many contexts in many neural systems. For this reason it is difficult to find a specific meaning or purpose for bursting and instead it plays many roles. In any given circuit observed bursts may play a part in any or all of the following mechanisms and may have a still more sophisticated impact on the network.

===Multiplexing and routing===
Some neurons, sometimes called ''resonators'', exhibit sensitivity for specific input frequencies and fire either more quickly or exclusively when stimulated at that frequency. Intrinsically bursting neurons can use this [[band-pass filter]]ing effect in order to encode for specific destination neurons and [[multiplexing|multiplex]] signals along a single [[axon]].&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; More generally, due to short-term synaptic depression and [[Neural facilitation|facilitation]] specific synapses can be resonant for certain frequencies and thus become viable specific targets for bursting cells.&lt;ref name='izhikevich2003'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00034-1|title=Bursts as a unit of neural information: selective communication via resonance|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2003|first=Eugene|last=Izhikevich|author2=N Desai |author3=E Walcott |pmid=12591219|volume=26|issue=3|pages=161–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synchronization===
Burst synchronization refers to the alignment of bursting and quiescent periods in interconnected neurons. In general, if a network of bursting neurons is linked it will eventually synchronize for most types of bursting.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name='rulkov2001'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Regularization of synchronized chaotic bursts|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=March 2001|first=NF|last=Rulkov|volume=86|issue=1|pages=2194|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.183|pmid=11136124|bibcode=2001PhRvL..86..183R|arxiv = nlin/0011028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='belykh2005'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synchronization of bursting neurons: what matters in the network topology|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2005|first=I|last=Belykh|author2=E de Lange |author3=M Hasler |volume=94|issue=18|pages=2181|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.188101|bibcode=2005PhRvL..94r8101B|pmid=15904412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronization can also appear in circuits containing no intrinsically bursting neurons, however its appearance and stability can often be improved by including intrinsically bursting cells in the network.&lt;ref name="prebot2" /&gt; Since synchronization is related to [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] and [[memory]] via [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian plasticity]] and [[long-term potentiation]] the interplay with plasticity and intrinsic bursting is very important{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

===Information content and channel robustness===
Due to the all-or-nothing nature of action potentials, single spikes can only encode [[Information theory|information]] in their interspike intervals (ISI). This is an inherently low fidelity method of transferring information as it depends on very accurate timing and is sensitive to noisy loss of signal: if just a single spike is mistimed or not properly received at the synapse it leads to a possibly unrecoverable loss in coding{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Since intrinsic bursts are thought to be derived by a computational mechanism in the slow subsystem, each can represent a much larger amount of information in the specific shape of a single burst leading to far more robust transmission. Physiological models show that for a given input the interspike and interburst timings are much more variable than the timing of the burst shape itself&lt;ref name="kepecs2003" /&gt; which also implies that timing between events is a less robust way to encode information.

The expanded alphabet for communication enabled by considering burst patterns as discrete signals allows for a greater [[channel capacity]] in neuronal communications and provides a popular connection between [[neural coding]] and [[information theory]].

==Example bursting neuron circuits==

===Hippocampus===
The [[subiculum]], a component of the [[hippocampal formation]], is thought to perform relaying of signals originating in the hippocampus to many other parts of the brain.&lt;ref name='swanson1977'&gt;{{cite journal|title=An autoradiographic study of the organization of the efferent connections of the hippocampal formation in the rat|journal=Journal of Computational Neurology|date=1977-03-01|first=LW|last=Swanson|author2=WM Cowan|volume=172|issue=1|pages=49–84|pmid=65364 |url=|format=|doi=10.1002/cne.901720104 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2009-11-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to perform this function, it uses intrinsically bursting neurons to convert promising single stimuli into longer lasting burst patterns as a way to better focus attention on new stimuli and activate important processing circuits.&lt;ref name='cooper2002'/&gt;&lt;ref name='swadlow2002'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Activation of a cortical column by a thalamocortical impulse|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=2002-01-01|first=H|last=Swadlow|author2=A Gusev |author3=T Bezdudnaya |pmid=12196600|volume=22|issue=17|pages=7766–7773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these circuits have been activated, the subicular signal reverts to a single spiking mode.&lt;ref name='cooper2005'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Output-mode transitions are controlled by prolonged inactivation of sodium channels in pyramidal neurons of subiculum|journal=PLOS Biology|date=June 2005|first=DC|last=Cooper|author2=S Chung |author3=N Spruston |volume=3|issue=6|pages=1123|pmid=15857153|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030175|pmc=1088280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pre-Bötzinger complex===
The [[Pre-Botzinger complex|pre-Bötzinger complex]] (preBötC) is located in  ventrolateral [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] and is proposed to generate the rhythm underlying inspiratory efforts in mammals. Since the frequency that the lungs need to operate at can vary according to metabolic demand, preBötC activity is modulated over a wide range of frequencies and is able to entrain the respiratory system to meet metabolic demand. While pacemaker neurons do not necessarily require intrinsically bursting neurons&lt;ref name="rulkov2001" /&gt; the preBötC contains a heterogeneous population of both regular spiking and intrinsically bursting neurons. Intrinsically bursting neurons are thought to make the preBötC oscillations more robust to changing frequencies and the regularity of inspiratory efforts.&lt;ref name='prebot2'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Models of respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Botzinger complex.

===Cerebellar cortex===
[[Cerebellum|Cerebellar]] [[Purkinje cell|Purkinje neurons]] have been proposed to have two distinct bursting modes: [[Dendrite|dendritically]] driven, by dendritic [[Calcium channel|{{chem|Ca|2+}} spikes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forrest MD, Wall MJ, Press DA, Feng J |title=The Sodium-Potassium Pump Controls the Intrinsic Firing of the Cerebellar Purkinje Neuron |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e51169 |date=December 2012 |pmid=23284664 |pmc=3527461 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051169 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051169|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...751169F }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perikaryon|somatically]] driven, wherein the persistent [[Sodium channel|{{chem|Na|+}} current]] is the burst initiator and the [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|SK {{chem|K|+}} current]] is the burst terminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Mathematical Model of Bursting in Dissociated Purkinje Neurons |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=e68765 |date=August 2013 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068765 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068765|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...868765F |pmid=23967054 |pmc=3742666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purkinje neurons may utilise these bursting forms in information coding to the [[deep cerebellar nuclei]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1688">The '''Center for Mathematical Modeling''' (CMM) was created in 2000 to encompass research and training activities that were being conducted by members of the Department of Mathematical Engineering at [[Universidad de Chile]]. Today, it features a range of activities from fundamental research in applied mathematics to industry-oriented research and education. The Center is a base for international collaboration; it hosts an increasing number of engineering and Ph.D. students as well as postdoctoral fellows, and provides a scientific counterpart to their industrial partners.

==Origins==
The CMM was founded by members of the Department of Mathematical Engineering (DIM) at the Universidad de Chile with the aid of a FONDAP-[[CONICYT]] project. From its inception, the Center was an associated international unit of the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS), the first in mathematics outside France. The CMM is physically housed in the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Science, which contains the oldest, most prestigious and productive engineering school in [[Chile]]. As a consequence the Center has a strong link with departments in this school -industrial, mechanical, civil, electrical, computer science and earth science- and benefits from access to the 4.000 strong student population of the school and to more than 500 graduated students in diverse fields and engineering.

'''Climate sensitivity''' is the [[radiative equilibrium|equilibrium]] temperature change in response to changes of the [[radiative forcing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=PALAEOSENS Project Members|first=|date=|title=Making sense of palaeoclimate sensitivity|url=http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:162782/CONTENT/Paleosens_Project_Members_2012.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Nature|publication-date=28 November 2012|volume=491|issue=7426|pages=683–91|bibcode=2012Natur.491..683P|doi=10.1038/nature11574|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, climate sensitivity depends on the initial [[climate state]], but potentially can be accurately inferred from precise [[Proxy (climate)|palaeoclimate data]].

Although climate sensitivity is usually used in the context of radiative forcing by [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), it is thought of as a general property of the climate system: the change in surface air temperature (ΔT&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) following a unit change in [[radiative forcing]] (RF), and thus is expressed in units of °C/(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For this to be useful, the measure must be independent of the nature of the forcing (e.g. from [[greenhouse gases]] or [[solar variation]]); to first order this is indeed found to be so{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

The climate sensitivity specifically due to {{CO2}} is often expressed as the temperature change in °C associated with a doubling of the concentration of [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]].

For coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models (e.g. [[Coupled model intercomparison project|CMIP5]]) the climate sensitivity is an [[emergent property]]: it is not a model parameter, but rather a result of a combination of model physics and parameters. By contrast, simpler energy-balance models may have climate sensitivity as an explicit parameter.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_s = \lambda \cdot RF&lt;/math&gt;

The terms represented in the equation relate radiative forcing (RF) to linear changes in global surface temperature change (ΔT&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) via the climate sensitivity λ.

It is also possible to estimate climate sensitivity from observations; however, this is difficult due to uncertainties in the forcing and temperature histories.

==Equilibrium and transient climate sensitivity==
The '''equilibrium''' climate sensitivity (ECS) refers to the equilibrium change in global mean near-surface air temperature that would result from a sustained doubling of the atmospheric ([[Carbon dioxide equivalent|equivalent]]) carbon dioxide concentration (ΔT&lt;sub&gt;x2&lt;/sub&gt;). (Here it should be noted that the term "equilibrium," though widely used, is a misused; the climate system is far from the situation of a dynamic equilibrium, which requires equal and opposite fluxes on all paths; it is better characterized as a "steady state" or "near steady state." However the term "equilibrium" is widely used.) As estimated by the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] (''AR5'') "there is ''high confidence'' that ECS is ''extremely unlikely'' less than 1°C and ''medium confidence'' that the ECS is ''likely'' between 1.5°C and 4.5°C and ''very unlikely'' greater than 6°C."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis - IPCC Working Group I Contribution to AR5|author=Bindoff|first=Nathaniel L.|last2=Stott|first2=Peter A.|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|year=2013|isbn=|location=Geneva, Switzerland|pages=|chapter=10.8.2 Constraints on Long-Term Climate Change and the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author-link2=Peter A.

A comprehensive model estimate of equilibrium sensitivity thus requires a very long model integration; fully equilibrating ocean temperatures requires integrations of thousands of model years, although it is possible to produce an approximate estimate more quickly using the method of Gregory et al. (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregory|first=J.M.|displayauthors=et al.|date=|title=A new method for diagnosing radiative forcing and climate sensitivity|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL018747|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|publication-date=11 February 2004|volume=31|issue=3|pages=L03205|doi=10.1029/2003GL018747|via=|bibcode=2004GeoRL..31.3205G}}&lt;/ref&gt; A measure requiring shorter integrations is the [[Transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions|transient climate response]] (TCR) which is defined as the average temperature response over a twenty-year period centered at {{CO2}} doubling in a transient simulation with {{CO2}} increasing at 1% per year (compounded), i.e., 60 – 80 years following initiation of the increase in {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report.

Over the 50–100 year timescale, the climate response to forcing is likely to follow the TCR; for considerations of climate stabilization on the millennial time scale, the ECS is more pertinent.

An estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity may be made from combining the transient climate sensitivity with the known properties of the ocean reservoirs and the surface heat fluxes; this is the '''effective''' climate sensitivity. This "may vary with forcing history and climate state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

==Earth System Sensitivity==
A less commonly used concept, the '''Earth system sensitivity''' (ESS), can be defined which includes the effects of slower feedbacks, such as the albedo change from melting the large ice sheets that covered much of the northern hemisphere during the [[last glacial maximum]]. These extra feedbacks make the ESS larger than the ECS — possibly twice as large — but also mean that it may well not apply to current conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/target-co2/|title=Target {{CO2}}|last=|first=|date=7 April 2008|work=RealClimate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824042512/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/target-co2/|archive-date=24 August 2017|dead-url=No|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESS includes the 'whole' system, but omitting the carbon cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2013/01/on-sensitivity-part-i/|title=On sensitivity: Part I|publisher=RealClimate.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensitivity to carbon dioxide forcing ==

Climate sensitivity is often evaluated in terms of the change in equilibrium temperature due to radiative forcing due to the [[greenhouse effect]]. According to the [[Svante Arrhenius#Greenhouse effect|Arrhenius]] relation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Martin E.|date=|title=Earthquakes and Weatherquakes: Mathematics and Climate Change|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201010/rtx101001278p.pdf|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|publication-date=November 2010|volume=57|issue=10|pages=1278–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the radiative forcing (and hence the change in temperature) is proportional to the [[logarithm]] of the concentration of [[infrared]]-absorbing gasses in the atmosphere. Thus, the sensitivity of temperature to gasses in the atmosphere (most notably [[carbon dioxide]]) is often expressed in terms of the change in temperature per doubling of the concentration of the gas.

=== Radiative forcing due to doubled {{CO2}} ===

{{CO2}} climate sensitivity has a component directly due to radiative forcing by {{CO2}}, and a further contribution arising from [[climate change feedback|climate feedbacks]], both positive and negative. "Without any feedbacks, a doubling of {{CO2}} (which amounts to a forcing of 3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) would result in 1 °C [[global warming]], which is easy to calculate and is undisputed. The remaining uncertainty is due entirely to feedbacks in the system, namely, [[Water vapor feedback#Role of water vapor|the water vapor feedback]], the [[ice-albedo feedback]], the [[cloud feedback]], and the lapse rate feedback";&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2008/&gt; addition of these feedbacks leads to a value of the sensitivity to {{CO2}} doubling of approximately 3&amp;nbsp;°C ± 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C, which corresponds to a value of λ of 0.8 K/(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

In the earlier 1979 NAS report&lt;ref name=charney1979/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;7), the radiative forcing due to doubled {{CO2}} is estimated to be 4 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as calculated (for example) in [[Veerabhadran Ramanathan|Ramanathan]] et al. (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ramanathan|first=V.|author2=Lian|first2=M.S.|author3=Cess|first3=R.D.|date=|title=Increased Atmospheric {{CO2}}: Zonal and Seasonal Estimates of the Effect on Radiative Energy Balance and Surface Temperature|url=http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/files/pr21.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|publication-date=20 August 1979|volume=84|issue=C8|pages=4949–58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the IPCC adopted the revised value of 3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the difference attributed to a "stratospheric temperature adjustment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

=== Consensus estimates ===
A committee on [[global warming|anthropogenic global warming]] convened in 1979 by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and chaired by [[Jule Charney]]&lt;ref name=charney1979/&gt; estimated climate sensitivity to be 3&amp;nbsp;°C, plus or minus 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C. Only two sets of models were available; one, due to [[Syukuro Manabe]], exhibited a climate sensitivity of 2&amp;nbsp;°C, the other, due to [[James E. Hansen]], exhibited a climate sensitivity of 4&amp;nbsp;°C. "According to Manabe,
Charney chose 0.5 °C as a not-unreasonable margin of error, subtracted it from Manabe’s number, and added it to Hansen’s. Thus was born the 1.5 °C-to-4.5 °C range of likely climate sensitivity that has appeared in every greenhouse assessment since..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kerr|first=Richard A.|date=13 August 2004|title=Three Degrees of Consensus|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/305/5686/932|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=932–4|doi=10.1126/science.305.5686.932|pmid=15310873|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 4 of the "[[Jule Gregory Charney#Charney Report|Charney report]]" compares the predictions of the models: "We conclude that the predictions ... are basically consistent and mutually supporting.

====Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change====

The 1990 [[IPCC First Assessment Report]] estimated that equilibrium climate sensitivity to {{CO2}} doubling lay between 1.5 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C, with a "best guess in the light of current knowledge" of 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;''Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (1990),''  Report prepared for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by Working Group I, J.T. Houghton, G.J. Jenkins and J.J. Ephraums (eds.), [https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_05.pdf chapter 5, Equilibrium Climate Change — and its Implications for the Future], pp. 138–9&lt;/ref&gt; This used models with strongly simplified representations of the ocean dynamics. The [[IPCC supplementary report, 1992]] which used full ocean [[General circulation model|GCM]]s nonetheless saw "no compelling reason to warrant changing" from this estimate &lt;ref&gt;IPCC '92 p118 section B3.5&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]] found that "No strong reasons have emerged to change" these estimates,&lt;ref&gt;IPCC SAR p 34, technical summary section D.2&lt;/ref&gt; with much of the uncertainty attributed to cloud processes. As noted above, the IPCC TAR retained the likely range 1.5 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="albritton 2001 climate sensitivity"/&gt;

Authors of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] ([[Gerald Meehl|Meehl]] ''et al.'', 2007)&lt;ref name="meehl 2007 climate sensitivity"&gt;{{citation|author=Meehl, G.A.|first=|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report WG1 2007|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-5.html#box-10-2|volume=|pages=|chapter=Ch. 10: Global Climate Projections; Box 10.2: Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; stated that confidence in estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity had increased substantially since the TAR.

&lt;/ref&gt; IPCC authors concluded that the global mean equilibrium warming for doubling {{CO2}} (to a concentration of 560 [[parts per notation|ppmv]]), or equilibrium climate sensitivity, very likely is greater than 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (2.7&amp;nbsp;°F) and likely to lie in the range 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (4 to 8.1&amp;nbsp;°F), with a most likely value of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C (5&amp;nbsp;°F). For fundamental physical reasons, as well as data limitations, the IPCC states a climate sensitivity higher than 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (8.1&amp;nbsp;°F) cannot be ruled out, but that agreement for these values with observations and [[proxy (climate)|"proxy" climate data]] is generally worse compared to values in the 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (4 to 8.1&amp;nbsp;°F) range.&lt;ref name="epa climate sensitivity"/&gt;

The TAR uses the word "likely" in a qualitative sense to describe the likelihood of the 1.5 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C range being correct.&lt;ref name="meehl 2007 climate sensitivity"/&gt; AR4, however, quantifies the probable range of climate sensitivity estimates:&lt;ref name="solomon 2007 uncertainty"&gt;{{citation|author=Solomon, S.|first=|title=Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis|volume=|pages=|at=[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-2.html Box TS.1: Treatment of Uncertainties in the Working Group I Assessment]|chapter=Technical summary|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}

*2–4.5&amp;nbsp;°C is "likely", = greater than 66% chance of being correct
*less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C is "very unlikely" = less than 10%

The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] stated: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (high
confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1&amp;nbsp;°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6&amp;nbsp;°C (medium confidence).

These are [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] probabilities; although they are based on an expert assessment of the available evidence,&lt;ref name="solomon 2007 uncertainty"/&gt; every Bayesian procedure is an [[admissible decision rule|admissible statistical method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bayesian Theory|last=Bernardo|first=José M.|last2=Smith|first2=Adrian F.M.|publisher=Wiley|year=|isbn=0-471-92416-4|location=|publication-date=January 1994|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculations of {{CO2}} sensitivity from observational data==

=== Sample calculation using industrial-age data ===
Rahmstorf (2008)&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2008/&gt; provides an informal example of how climate sensitivity might be estimated empirically, from which the following is modified. Denote the sensitivity, i.e. the equilibrium increase in global mean temperature including the effects of feedbacks due to a sustained forcing by doubled {{CO2}} (taken as 3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), as ''x'' °C. If [[Earth]] were to experience an equilibrium temperature change of ΔT (°C) due to a sustained forcing of ΔF (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), then one might say that ''x''/(ΔT) = (3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(ΔF), i.e. that ''x'' = ΔT * (3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/ΔF. The global temperature increase since the beginning of the industrial period (taken as 1750) is about 0.8&amp;nbsp;°C, and the radiative forcing due to {{CO2}} and other long-lived greenhouse gases (mainly methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons) emitted since that time is about 2.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Neglecting other forcings and considering the temperature increase to be an equilibrium increase would lead to a sensitivity of about 1.1&amp;nbsp;°C. However, ΔF also contains contributions due to solar activity (+0.3 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), aerosols (−1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), ozone (0.3 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and other lesser influences, bringing the total forcing over the industrial period to 1.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; according to best estimate of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|IPCC AR4]], albeit with substantial uncertainty. Additionally the fact that the climate system is not at equilibrium must be accounted for; this is done by subtracting the planetary heat uptake rate H from the forcing; i.e., ''x'' = ΔT * (3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(ΔF-H). Taking planetary heat uptake rate as the rate of ocean heat uptake, estimated by the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|IPCC AR4]] as 0.2 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, yields a value for ''x'' of 2.1&amp;nbsp;°C. (All numbers are approximate and quite uncertain.)

=== Sample calculation using ice-age data ===

In 2008, Farley wrote: "... examine the change in temperature and solar forcing between [[glaciation]] (ice age) and [[interglacial]] (no ice age) periods. The change in temperature, revealed in [[ice core]] samples, is 5&amp;nbsp;°C, while the change in solar forcing is 7.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The computed climate sensitivity is therefore 5/7.1 = 0.7&amp;nbsp;K(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. We can use this empirically derived climate sensitivity to predict the temperature rise from a forcing of 4&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, arising from a doubling of the atmospheric {{CO2}} from pre-industrial levels. The result is a predicted temperature increase of 3&amp;nbsp;°C."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=John W.|date=|title=The Scientific Case for Modern Anthropogenic Global Warming|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2008/07/01/the-scientific-case-for-modern-anthropogenic-global-warming|journal=[[Monthly Review]]|publication-date=5 July 2008|volume=60|issue=3|pages=|doi=10.14452/MR-060-03-2008-07_5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on analysis of uncertainties in total forcing, in Antarctic cooling, and in the ratio of global to Antarctic cooling of the [[last glacial maximum]] relative to the present, Ganopolski and Schneider von Deimling (2008) infer a range of 1.3 to 6.8&amp;nbsp;°C for climate sensitivity determined by this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Ganopolski|first=Andrey|author2=von Deimling|first2=Thomas Schneider|date=|title=Comment on "Aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity deduced from the Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene transition" by Petr Chylek and Ulrike Lohmann|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2008GL033888|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|publication-date=5 December 2008|volume=35|issue=23|pages=L23703|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3523703G|doi=10.1029/2008GL033888|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lower figure was calculated in a 2011 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper by Schmittner ''et al.'', who combined temperature reconstructions of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] with climate model simulations to suggest a rate of global warming from doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide of a median of 2.3&amp;nbsp;°C and uncertainty 1.7–2.6&amp;nbsp;°C (66% probability range), less than the earlier estimates of 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C as the 66% probability range. Schmittner et al. said their "results imply less probability of extreme climatic change than previously thought." Their work suggests that climate sensitivities &gt;6&amp;nbsp;°C "cannot be reconciled with paleoclimatic and geologic evidence, and hence should be assigned near-zero probability."&lt;ref name="Schmittner11"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmittner|first=Andreas|author2=Urban|first2=Nathan M.|author3=Shakun|first3=Jeremy D.|author4=Mahowald|first4=Natalie M.|author5=Clark|first5=Peter U.|author6=Bartlein|first6=Patrick J.|author7=Mix|first7=Alan C.|author8=Rosell-Melé|first8=Antoni|date=9 December 2011|title=Climate Sensitivity Estimated from Temperature Reconstructions of the Last Glacial Maximum|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6061/1385.abstract?sid=a7ab01bf-f2e5-413d-bbf0-c2c5ac2362df|journal=Science|volume=334|issue=6061|pages=1385–8|bibcode=2011Sci...334.1385S|doi=10.1126/science.1203513|pmid=22116027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/geowissenschaften/climate_sensitivity_limited_extreme_projections_186483.html Climate sensitivity to CO2 more limited than extreme projections], news article re Schmittner et al., ''Innovations Report'',  25 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis and [[Judith Curry|Curry]] (2014) estimated that equilibrium climate sensitivity was 1.64&amp;nbsp;°C, based on the 1750-2011 time series and "the uncertainty ranges for forcing components" in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Nicholas|last2=Curry|first2=Judith A.|date=25 September 2014|title=The implications for climate sensitivity of AR5 forcing and heat uptake estimates|url=|journal=Climate Dynamics|volume=45|issue=3–4|pages=1009–23|bibcode=2015ClDy...45.1009L|doi=10.1007/s00382-014-2342-y|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature reviews===

A literature review by [[Reto Knutti|Knutti]] and [[Gabriele C. Hegerl|Hegerl]] (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Knutti|first1=Reto|last2=Hegerl|first2=Gabriele C.|date=26 October 2008|title=The equilibrium sensitivity of the Earth's temperature to radiation changes|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n11/abs/ngeo337.html|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|issue=11|pages=735–43|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..735K|doi=10.1038/ngeo337|accessdate=3 July 2010|via=}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; concluded, "various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C, with a likely range of about 2–4.5&amp;nbsp;°C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to difficulties in ruling out higher values." A subsequent literature survey by Knutti and others (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knutti|first=Reto|last2=Rugenstein|first2=Maria A. A.|last3=Hegerl|first3=Gabriele C.|date=|title=Beyond equilibrium climate sensitivity|url=http://iacweb.ethz.ch/staff/mariaru/BeyondEquilibriumClimateSensitivity/KnuttiRugensteinHegerl17.pdf|journal=Nature Geoscience|publication-date=4 September 2017|volume=10|issue=10|pages=727–36|doi=10.1038/ngeo3017|via=|bibcode=2017NatGe..10..727K}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended that range to 1.5–4.5&amp;nbsp;°C, but suggested that transient climate response may be a more important measure of climate sensitivity than equilibrium sensitivity.

A review by [[Piers Forster|Forster]] (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forster|first=Piers M.|date=|title=Inference of Climate Sensitivity from Analysis of Earth's Energy Budget|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piers_Forster/publication/301915695_Inference_of_Climate_Sensitivity_from_Analysis_of_Earth%27s_Energy_Budget/links/574ecaa608aec50945bb2033/Inference-of-Climate-Sensitivity-from-Analysis-of-Earths-Energy-Budget.pdf?origin=publication_detail|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|publication-date=June 2016|volume=44|pages=85–106|doi=10.1146/annurev-earth-060614-105156|via=|bibcode=2016AREPS..44...85F}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that recent attempts to diagnose equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) from changes in Earth’s energy budget point toward values of around 2&amp;nbsp;°C, but with tentative evidence that this underestimates the true ECS from a doubling of carbon dioxide.

==Radiative forcing functions==
A number of different inputs can give rise to radiative forcing. In addition to the downwelling radiation due to the greenhouse effect, the [[IPCC First Assessment Report|IPCC First Scientific Assessment Report]] listed solar radiation variability due to orbital changes, variability due to changes in solar irradiance, direct aerosol effects (''e.g.,'' changes in albedo due to cloud cover), indirect aerosol effects, and surface characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;''Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (1990),''  Report prepared for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by Working Group I, J.T. Houghton, G.J. Jenkins and J.J. Ephraums (eds.), [https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_02.pdf chapter 2, Radiative Forcing of Climate], pp. 41–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensitivity to solar forcing==
[[Solar irradiance]] is about 0.9 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; brighter during [[solar maximum]] than during [[solar minimum]]. Analysis by Camp and Tung shows that this correlates with a variation of ±0.1&amp;nbsp;°C in measured average global temperature between the peak and minimum of the 11-year solar cycle.&lt;ref name="solar-climate"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Camp|first=Charles D.|author2=Tung|first2=Ka Kit|date=|title=Surface warming by the solar cycle as revealed by the composite mean difference projection|url=http://depts.washington.edu/amath/research/articles/Tung/journals/GRL-solar-07.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|publication-date=18 July 2007|volume=34|issue=14|pages=L14703|bibcode=2007GeoRL..3414703C|doi=10.1029/2007GL030207|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113025833/http://depts.washington.edu/amath/research/articles/Tung/journals/GRL-solar-07.pdf|archivedate=13 January 2012|accessdate=20 January 2012|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this data (incorporating the Earth's albedo and the fact that the solar absorption cross-section is 1/4 of the surface area of the Earth), Tung, Zhou and Camp (2008) derive a transient sensitivity value of 0.69 to 0.97&amp;nbsp;°C/(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tung|first=Ka Kit|author2=Zhou|first2=Jiansong|author3=Camp|first3=Charles D.|date=|title=Constraining model transient climate response using independent observations of solar-cycle forcing and response|url=https://www.calpoly.edu/~camp/Publications/Tung_etal_GRL_2008.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|publication-date=12 September 2008|volume=35|issue=17|pages=L17707|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3517707T|doi=10.1029/2008GL034240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would correspond to a transient climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide doubling of 2.5 to 3.6 K, similar to the range of the current scientific consensus. However, they note that this is the transient response to a forcing with an 11-year cycle; due to lag effects, they estimate the equilibrium response to forcing would be about 1.5 times as high.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17297">'''Conservation development''', also known as '''conservation design''', is a controlled-growth [[land use]] development that adopts the principle for allowing limited [[sustainable development]] while protecting the area's natural environmental features in perpetuity, including preserving [[Open space reserve|open space]] landscape and vista, protecting [[Arable land|farmland]] or natural [[habitat]]s for wildlife, and maintaining the character of rural communities.&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide To Creating Open Space Networks |last=Arendt |first=Randall G. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Island Press |location=Washington |isbn=978-1-55963-489-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conservation development is usually defined as a project that dedicates a minimum of 50 percent of the total development parcel as [[Open space reserve|open space]]. The management and ownership of the land are often formed by the partnership between private land owners, land-use conservation organizations and [[local government]]. It is a growing trend in many parts of the country, particularly in the [[Western United States]]. In the [[Eastern United States]], conservation design has been promoted by some [[State governments of the United States|state]] and local governments as a technique to help preserve [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Dover, DE; and Brandywine Conservancy, Chadds Ford, PA.

This type of planning is becoming increasingly more relevant as "[[land conversion]] for [[housing development]] is a leading cause of [[habitat loss]] and [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]]".&lt;ref name="Pejchar"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pejchar|first=Liba|author2=Margaret R.

Conservation Development differs from other land protection approaches by aiming to protect land and environmental resources on parcels slated for immediate development—to protect land here and now. In contrast, a [[green belt]] approach typically aims to protect land from future development, and in a region beyond areas currently slated for development. It seeks to offer a gradient between urban regions and open countryside, beyond what a line on a map—typically a highway—currently provides. This approach seeks to avoid the dichotomy of economic urbanism on one side of such a street while on the other lies completely protected woodlands and farm fields, devoid of inclusion in that economy. Addressing the theoretical illusion that humanity walled off is better-off, Conservation Development recognizes that design of how we live is far more important than we allot credit; that instead of walling off a problem we need to face that problem and drastically lower our impact on the sites where we live, and indeed raise the performance of our communities toward a level where such walls are no longer considered first response requirements.

== History ==
Conservation development was formulated in the early 1980s by a British-trained planner Randall Arendt. He pulled together several concepts from the 1960s. He combined the idea of cluster and open space design with Ian McHarg's "design with nature" philosophy.&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doyle |first=Donna L. |title=Planning for Greener Development: Conservation Development and Landon Bay East |journal=FES Outstanding Graduate Student Paper Series |year=2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation development ==
Conservation development seeks to protect a variety of ecological resources and services such as biodiversity, productive farmland, [[ecosystem services]], scenic landscapes and historic and cultural resources.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; This is achieved by identifying the ecologically sensitive and valuable areas. The protected lands can be under an easement to prevent development on it. Housing is then built around the protected areas. Density, lots sizes, types of housing and amount of protected area is dependent on the type of conservation development.

While not a prevalent type of development, it's estimated that conservation development takes up between 2.5%-10% of the total US real estate development.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; Conservation development is usually applied to rural, exurban or suburban residential subdivisions, though it does have a few urban applications (Doyle 4). 

While there are several types of conservation developments, they all have several features in common.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; All developments have conservation land set aside, either held by a conservation organization or protected by a conservation easement. These developments must have ongoing stewardship for the protected portion of the parcel.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; Secondly, the development finances the projected area. Third, each development begins by surveying the land's ecological features and resources. A decision can then be made about where to build and what areas need to be protected. Lastly, these developments also use a variety of design features to reduce some of the negative impacts inherent in development. Examples include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact stormwater management systems]], and landscape design.

== Types ==
Milder cites four principal conservation development techniques found in the United States.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; The first two he groups together as having a "conservation with development" philosophy. Conservation is the main goal with development as a means to that end. The latter two types fall under the "development with conservation" ethos. These two types of projects are done through private developers whose goal is turn a profit at the end of the day, but in a "conservation-friendly matter".&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; Table 1 provides an excellent summary of the different conservation development techniques.

=== Conservation buyer projects ===
The first type he calls conservation buyer projects. In this situation, a land trust buys the property and places the ecologically important areas under a conservation easement. They then resell the land, including the easement, to a conservation buyer. The buyer cannot build on the easement, but may do so on the remaining, unprotected portion. This technique usually results in a few houses being built on the piece of land, resulting in a low density.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; According to a study undertaken by Milder &amp; Clark, 98.4% of the total land receives protection, the highest amongst the four conservation development types.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milder|first=Jeffery C.|author2=Story Clark|title=Conservation Development Practices, Extent and Land-Use Effects in the United States|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2001|volume=25|issue=4|pages=697–707|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01688.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation and limited development projects ===
The second type identified by Milder is called conservation and limited development projects (CLDP). They are often carried out by land trusts, and occasionally by conservation-minded developers or landowners. Real estate is developed for sale on an open market, and the profit is used to finance conservation of the nearly land. Milder &amp; Clark found that 93.5% of the total land area is protected under this type of development.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt; Recent studies done on the effectiveness of CLDPs in protecting, restoring and managing threatened resources reveal that it is significantly more effective at doing so, in comparison to conservation subdivisions and conventional development.

=== Conservation subdivisions ===
Conservation subdivisions are the third and best-known type of conservation development. This is a development that "sets aside a major portion of the site as conservation land" and clusters housing on the remaining portion.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; The houses are built on lots smaller than usual, meaning the density of the development nears the maximum allowed by zoning. Unlike conservation and limited development projects, a homeowners' association manages the protected land. These associations may lack knowledge and have different goals regarding the lands' management, which may result in a less than ideally managed conservation. As a result of this and other factors, a study found that on average only 57.1% of the total land area is protected from development.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt;

=== Conservation-oriented planned development projects ===
The final type identified by Milder is called conservation-oriented planned development projects. These are large-scale development projects found in suburban and exurban areas. The scale of the projects means large tracts of land can be protected. They typically have densities nearing the zoned maximum and feature of a mix of housing types and land uses. The resulting percentage of protected land is 71.3.&lt;ref name="Milder_Clark"/&gt;

== Advantages ==
The biggest advantage of conservation development is that it can protect species and ecosystems, preventing further habitat fragmentation and loss. By surveying the land and identifying the primary conservation areas where ecosystems are most at risk, communities are created without huge disruption to the environment.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt; Conservation development also provides for secondary conservation areas, which provide corridors for animals to hunt, mate and travel through.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

However, any development will have some impact on the land. But by studying it, there are ways in which this can be mitigated. A developer can have native vegetation planted. Wildlife friendly native species could be introduced,&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; while invasive species are monitored and controlled.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|Stormwater management]] systems are also used to "promote natural flow patterns and infiltration", considered a very important factor in minimizing a development's impact.&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt;

There are several benefits from an economic standpoint. Conservation development allows developers to make themselves distinct in a competitive housing market.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; A developer can use an environmentally oriented marketing strategy, highlighting the benefits of the development to possible buyer with a green thumb.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; A final advantage of conservation development is that homes in these developments tend appreciate faster than their conventional counterparts.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt;

Pejchar et al. and Arendt cite a number of economic benefits that accrue to municipalities through conservation development. They include fewer public costs on maintenance and infrastructure, protecting open space without losing tax revenues, and avoiding the loss of ecological services like landscape stabilization, flood control and clean water.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; A municipality also experiences a reduced demand for public green space since it has been provided free of charge by the development.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt;

Lastly, there are a few social and recreational advantages to conservation development.&lt;ref name="Arendt"/&gt; With the smaller lots that accompany these houses, homeowners are likely to move into public green space and engage with their neighbours. Community events such as picnics or parties are more common. The protected green space also provides excellent recreational activities, such as hiking, jogging, or simply observing nature. It's hopeful that with this experience, people can reconnect with nature and develop a land ethic.&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
There are several drawbacks to conservation development. The first problem encountered is the perceived risk by both developers and homebuyers.&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; In protecting sensitive areas, developers and homeowners see a risk in the possible elimination of desired sites to build homes. This might be a large enough risk to discourage developers. This could be a place for government intervention, which could provide tax breaks to developers building a development this way.

Conservation subdivisions and conservation-oriented planned development projects have been "criticized for protecting land at too small a scale to provide meaningful conservation benefits, while simultaneously promoting "leapfrog" development".&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; This pushes sprawl further from the city and contributes to a more fragmented rural area.

== Implications ==
This type of planning is becoming increasingly more relevant as "land conversion for housing development is a leading cause of habitat loss and fragmentation".&lt;ref name="Pejchar"/&gt; With a loss or fragmentation of a species' habitat, it results in the endangerment of a species and pushes them towards premature extinction.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Without biodiversity, we lose the many benefits we derive from it, including economic and ecological services, genetic information, and recreational pleasure, just to name a few.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; Land conversion also contributes to the reduction of agriculturally productive land,&lt;ref name="Milder"/&gt; already shrinking due to climate change.

'''Demolition''' or '''razing''' is the tearing down of [[building]]s and other man-made [[structure]]s. Demolition contrasts with [[deconstruction (building)|deconstruction]], which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes.

For small buildings, such as [[house]]s, that are only two or three stories high, demolition is a rather simple process. The building is pulled down either manually or mechanically using large hydraulic equipment: elevated work platforms, cranes, [[excavator]]s or [[bulldozer]]s. Larger buildings may require the use of a [[wrecking ball]], a heavy weight on a cable that is swung by a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] into the side of the buildings. Wrecking balls are especially effective against masonry, but are less easily controlled and often less efficient than other methods. Newer methods may use rotational hydraulic shears and silenced rock-breakers attached to excavators to cut or break through wood, steel, and concrete. The use of shears is especially common when flame cutting would be dangerous.

The tallest planned demolition of a building was the 47-story [[Singer Building]] in [[New York City]], which was built in 1908 and torn down in 1967–1968 to be replaced by [[One Liberty Plaza]].

Before any demolition activities can take place, there are many steps that must be carried out beforehand, including performing [[asbestos abatement]], removing hazardous or regulated materials, obtaining necessary permits, submitting necessary notifications, disconnecting utilities, rodent baiting and the development of site-specific safety and work plans.

The typical razing of a building is accomplished as follows:

Hydraulic excavators may be used to topple one- or two-story buildings by an undermining process. The strategy is to undermine the building while controlling the manner and direction in which it falls. The demolition project manager/supervisor will determine where undermining is necessary so that a building is pulled in the desired manner and direction. The walls are typically undermined at a building's base, but this is not always the case if the building design dictates otherwise. Safety and cleanup considerations are also taken into account in determining how the building is undermined and ultimately demolished.

In some cases a crane with a [[wrecking ball]] is used to demolish the structure down to a certain manageable height. At that point undermining takes place as described above. However crane mounted demolition balls are rarely used within demolition due to the uncontrollable nature of the swinging ball and the safety implications associated.

High reach demolition excavators are more often used for tall buildings where explosive demolition is not appropriate or possible.  Excavators with shear attachments are typically used to dismantle steel structural elements.  Hydraulic hammers are often used for concrete structures and concrete processing attachments are used to crush concrete to a manageable size, and to remove reinforcing steel.  For tall concrete buildings, where neither explosive or high reach demolition with an excavator is safe or practical, the "inside-out" method is used, whereby remotely operated mini-excavators demolish the building from the inside, whilst maintaining the outer walls of the building as a scaffolding, as each floor is demolished.

To control dust, fire hoses are used to maintain a wet demolition. Hoses may be held by workers, secured in fixed location, or attached to lifts to gain elevation.

Loaders or bulldozers may also be used to demolish a building. They are typically equipped with "rakes" (thick pieces of steel that could be an I-beam or tube) that are used to ram building walls. Skid loaders and loaders will also be used to take materials out and sort steel.

The technique of Vérinage is used in France to weaken and buckle the supports of central floors promoting the collapse of the top part of a building onto the bottom resulting in a rapid, symmetrical, collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2td63_hd20h20070822chunk2_news |title=HD_20h_20070822_chunk_2 - Vidéo Dailymotion |publisher=Dailymotion.com |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese company [[Kajima Construction]] has developed a new method of demolishing buildings which involves using computer-controlled [[hydraulic jack]]s to support the bottom floor as the supporting columns are removed. The floor is lowered and this process is repeated for each floor. This technique is safer and more environmentally friendly, and is useful in areas of high [[population density]].&lt;ref name=popsci-kajima&gt;{{cite news | title=Kajima Demolition Tech |url=http://www.popsci.com/bown/2008/product/kajima-demolition-tech | publisher=Popular Science | date=December 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To demolish bridges, [[Hoe ram|hoe rams]] are typically used to remove the concrete road deck and piers, while hydraulic shears are used to remove the bridge's [[structural steel]].

== Building implosion ==
{{main|Building implosion}}

[[File:Demolition of the New Haven Coliseum.gif|thumb|right|The demolition of the [[New Haven Coliseum]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]]]
Large buildings, tall [[chimney]]s, [[smokestack]]s, bridges, and increasingly some smaller structures may be destroyed by building implosion using [[explosive]]s. Imploding a structure is very fast—the collapse itself only takes seconds—and an expert can ensure that the structure falls into its own footprint, so as not to damage neighboring structures. This is essential for tall structures in dense urban areas.

Any error can be disastrous, however, and some demolitions have failed, severely damaging neighboring structures. One significant danger is from flying debris, which, when improperly prepared for, can kill onlookers.

Another dangerous scenario is the partial failure of an attempted implosion. When a building fails to collapse completely the structure may be unstable, tilting at a dangerous angle, and filled with un-detonated but still primed explosives, making it difficult for workers to approach safely.

A third danger comes from air overpressure that occurs during the implosion. If the sky is clear, the [[shock wave]], a wave of energy and sound, travels upwards and disperses, but if cloud coverage is low, the shock wave can travel outwards, breaking windows or causing other damage to surrounding buildings.&lt;ref name=bnet&gt;{{cite news | title=Blasting a path to world markets |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n1-2_v118/ai_19118720/pg_3 | first=Curtice | last=Cultice | publisher=BNET Business Network | year=1997 | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Kegley of CST Environmental described shock waves by saying, "The shock wave is like a water hose. If you put your hand in front of the water as it comes out, it fans to all sides. When cloud coverage is below 1,200 feet, it reacts like the hand in front of the hose. The wave from the shock fans out instead of up toward the sky."&lt;ref name=Kegley&gt;{{cite news | first=Maura | last=Bohart | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | title=Demolition Eliminates Final Remnant of Charlotte Hornets |url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=9327 | date=26 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controlled implosion, being spectacular, is the method that the general public often thinks of when discussing demolition; however, it can be dangerous and is only used as a last resort when other methods are impractical or too costly. The destruction of large buildings has become increasingly common as the massive [[housing project]]s of the 1960s and 1970s are being leveled around the world. At {{convert|439|ft|m}} and {{convert|2200000|sqft|m2}}, the [[J. L. Hudson Department Store and Addition]] is the tallest steel framed building and largest single structure ever [[Building implosion|imploded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.controlled-demolition.com/default.asp?reqLocId=7&amp;reqItemId=20030225133807 |title=J.L. Hudson Department Store |publisher=Controlled Demolition, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation ===
It takes several weeks or months to prepare a building for implosion. All items of value, such as copper wiring, are stripped from a building. Some materials must be removed, such as [[glass]] that can form deadly projectiles, and insulation that can scatter over a wide area. Non-load bearing partitions and [[drywall]] are removed.&lt;ref name = "Nova1"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] |title=Interview with Stacey Loizeaux |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/loizeaux.html |work=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA Online]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |date=December 1996 |accessdate=2009-04-29 |quote=She learned the fine art of demolition from her father, Mark Loizeaux, and her uncle, Doug Loizeaux—president and vice-president of the company. NOVA spoke with Ms. Loizeaux a few days before Christmas, 1996.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected columns on floors where explosives will be set are drilled and [[high explosives]] such as [[nitroglycerin]], [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[RDX]], or C4 are placed in the holes. Smaller columns and walls are wrapped in [[detonating cord]]. The goal is to use as little explosive as possible so that the structure will fail in a [[progressive collapse]] therefore only a few floors are rigged with explosives, so that it is safer (fewer explosives) and costs less. The areas with explosives are covered in thick [[geotextile]] fabric and fencing to absorb flying debris.&lt;ref name="Nova1"/&gt; Far more time-consuming than the demolition itself is the clean-up of the site, as the debris is loaded into trucks and hauled away.

== Deconstruction ==
{{main|Deconstruction (building)}}
A new approach to demolition is the deconstruction of a building with the goal of minimizing the amount of materials going to [[landfill]]s. This "green" approach is applied by removing the materials by type material and segregating them for reuse or [[recycling]]. With proper planning this approach has resulted in landfill diversion rates that exceed 90% of an entire building and its contents in some cases. It also vastly reduces the [[carbon dioxide emissions|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] of the removing of a building in comparison to demolition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 85%]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of plant and equipment has allowed for the easier segregation of [[demolition waste]] types on site and the reuse within the construction of the replacement building. On site crushers allow the demolished concrete to be reused as type 1 crushed aggregate either as a piling mat for ground stabilization or as aggregate in the mixing of concrete.

Timber waste can be shredded using specialist timber shredders and composted, or used to form manufactured timber boards, such as [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] or [[Particle board|chipboard]].

Safety is paramount; a site safety officer is usually assigned to each project to enforce all safety rules and regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">In the [[mental health]] field, a '''dual relationship''' is a situation where multiple roles exist between a [[therapist]], or other mental health practitioner, and a client.&lt;ref name=Zur&gt;{{cite web|last=Zur|first=O.|title=Dual relationships, multiple relationships &amp; boundaries in psychotherapy, counseling &amp; mental health|url=http://www.zurinstitute.com/dualrelationships.html|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dual relationships are also referred to as '''multiple relationships''', and these two terms are used interchangeably in the research literature.&lt;ref name = Zur /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=M. B.|title=Professional boundaries: The dilemma of dual and multiple relationships in rural clinical practice.|journal=Counseling and Clinical Psychology Journal|year=2004|volume=1|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]] (also referred to as the APA [[ethics code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Psychological Association|title=Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct|url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a resource that outlines ethical standards and principles to which practitioners are expected to adhere. Standard 3.05 of the APA ethics code outlines the definition of multiple relationships. Dual or multiple relationships occur when:

*a professional and personal relationship take place simultaneously between the psychologist and the client
* the psychologist has a relationship with a person closely related to or connected to their client
* the psychologist has intentions to enter into a future relationship with the client or someone closely related to the client

In addition, the standard provides a description of when to avoid multiple relationships (e.g., when the relationship causes harm to the client or impairs the psychologist's competence) and when these relationships are ''not'' considered unethical (e.g., when the relationship does not exploit the client or impair competence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=L.W.|author2=Battaglia, J. |author3=Epstein, R.S. |title=Frontier ethics: Mental health care needs and ethical dilemmas in rural communities|journal=[[Psychiatric Services]]|year=1999|volume=50|issue=4|pages=497–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=M.B.|title=Professional boundaries: The dilemma of dual and multiple relationships in rural clinical practice|journal=Counseling and Clinical Psychology Journal|year=2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werth|first=J.L.|author2=Hastings, S.L. |author3=Riding-Malon, R. |title=Ethical challenges of practicing in rural areas|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=105–127|doi=10.1002/jclp.20681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Other Fields==
Several "helping" fields which are not strictly psychological in nature, but which still involve a therapeutic counseling environment, also have stringent policies involving dual relationships and the avoidance of such relationships. For example, the National Association of Social Workers [NASW], which regulates 132,000 social workers across the world, names multiple types of dual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics|url=http://socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|publisher=National Association of Social Workers|page=Section 1.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes sexual, financial, personal or religious relationships which could become exploitative due to the differences in power between the worker and the client. Social workers are advised by the NASW to communicate with their clients when such a relationship arises or could arise, and are advised to take steps to avoid dual relationships wherever possible. The NASW recognizes, however, that dual relationships can be unavoidable in some types of communities, such as in rural communities or military installations.

[[File:EFR-1.png|thumb|EFR enables an immune response to elf18, a sequence of EF-Tu&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;]]
'''EF-Tu receptor''', abbreviated as '''EFR''', is a [[Pattern recognition receptor|pattern-recognition receptor]] (PRR) that binds to the prokaryotic protein [[EF-Tu]] (elongation factor thermo unstable) in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.   This receptor is an important part of the plant immune system as it allows the plant cells to recognize and bind to EF-Tu, preventing genetic [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and protein synthesis in pathogens such as ''Agrobacterium''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zipfel|first=Cyril|last2=Kunze|first2=Gernot|last3=Chinchilla|first3=Delphine|last4=Caniard|first4=Anne|last5=Jones|first5=Jonathan D.G.|last6=Boller|first6=Thomas|last7=Felix|first7=Georg|title=Perception of the Bacterial PAMP EF-Tu by the Receptor EFR Restricts Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867406005010|journal=Cell|volume=125|issue=4|pages=749–760|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The plant ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' has a genome with only around 135 megabase pairs (Mbp), making it small enough to fully synthesize. It also makes it relative easy to study, leading to its use as a common [[model organism]] in the field of plant genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/genAnnotation/gene_structural_annotation/agicomplete.jsp|title=TAIR - Genome Assembly|website=www.arabidopsis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rensink|first=W.

Plant pathogens are able to travel through a plant's vascular system, but plants do not have specific immune cells that can travel this way. Plants also do not have an adaptive immune system, so other forms of immunity are required. One is the use of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) to bind to [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMP), which are highly-conserved structures on the outside of many invasive organisms. This form of immunity acts on intercellular pathogens, which are ones outside of individual plant cells. PRRs are [[transmembrane protein]]s, which have an anchor inside the cell and portions that extend beyond the membrane. They are part of the innate immune system and bind to and prevent the proliferation of pathogens with the PAMPs that they can bind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jonathan D.

== Biological function ==

=== Synthesis ===
EFR, like other proteins, undergoes translation in a cell's ribosomes. After the primary structure of the protein has been formed it must fold into its three dimensional [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] to become functional. This occurs in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). While in the ER, this primary polypeptide chain undergoes a regulatory process known as ER-quality control (ER-QC) to help ensure it folds into the correct 3-D structure. and avoids. ER-QC process consists of a series of chaperone proteins that help guide the folding of the EFR polypeptide chains, preventing the aggregation of many polypeptide chains into one large group. Proteins that have not folded are kept in the ER until they have folded into their correct 3-D shape. If folding does not occur then the unfolded protein is eventually destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anelli|first=Tiziana|last2=Sitia|first2=Roberto|date=2008-01-23|title=Protein quality control in the early secretory pathway|url=http://emboj.embopress.org/content/27/2/315|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|pages=315–327|doi=10.1038/sj.emboj.7601974|issn=0261-4189|pmid=18216874|pmc=2234347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nekrasov|first=Vladimir|last2=Li|first2=Jing|last3=Batoux|first3=Martine|last4=Roux|first4=Milena|last5=Chu|first5=Zhao-Hui|last6=Lacombe|first6=Severine|last7=Rougon|first7=Alejandra|last8=Bittel|first8=Pascal|last9=Kiss‐Papp|first9=Marta|date=2009-11-04|title=Control of the pattern‐recognition receptor EFR by an ER protein complex in plant immunity|url=http://emboj.embopress.org/content/28/21/3428|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=28|issue=21|pages=3428–3438|doi=10.1038/emboj.2009.262|issn=0261-4189|pmid=19763086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the control mechanisms of EFR is the protein Arabidopsis stromal-derived factor-2 (SDF2). A genetic variant of the ''A. thaliana'' plant that did not have the gene to encode for this protein had a far lower production of functional EFR proteins. SDF2 also cannot be substituted for other enzymes in EFR production. Experimental analysis indicated that EFR is destroyed in the cell when it is produced without SDF2, though the mechanism of this action is unknown. Other proteins that are required for the proper synthesis of EFR include Arabidopsis CRT3 and UGGT, which are members of the EFR-QC and act as [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]] to help folding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Role in plant immunity ===
EFR receptors have a high affinity for the EF-Tu PAMP. This has been proven analytically through competitive binding assays and [[SDS-page|SDS-PAGE]] analysis. When EFR binds to EF-Tu, the basal resistance is activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This response happens after an infection has already been established and it is important to the plant immune system because it prevents the spread of the pathogen throughout the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niks|first=Rients E.|last2=Marcel|first2=Thierry C.|date=2009-06-01|title=Nonhost and basal resistance: how to explain specificity?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02849.x/abstract|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=182|issue=4|pages=817–828|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02849.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only bacteria that have a high amount of EF-Tu are effectively inhibited by EFR, such as ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Similarities to FLS2 ===
Like EFR, FLS2 (flagellin-sensing 2) is a plant receptor-like kinase that acts as a PRR in the plant innate immune system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Gómez|first=L.|last2=Boller|first2=T.|date=June 2000|title=FLS2: an LRR receptor-like kinase involved in the perception of the bacterial elicitor flagellin in Arabidopsis|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=5|issue=6|pages=1003–1011|issn=1097-2765|pmid=10911994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of binding to EF-Tu, it binds to [[flagellin]], another highly conserved structure present on many pathogens. It, like EF-Tu, is a good target for the plant immune system since it is so widespread. It also triggers an immune response in a larger variety of plants than EF-Tu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The immune response triggered by FLS2 is very similar to the one that is triggered by EFR and the enzymes that are activated by both receptors likely come from a common pool that is found in many cells. This indicates that the two receptor pathways converge, which has been shown to occur at the ion channels in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeworutzki|first=Elena|last2=Roelfsema|first2=M.

== Applications ==
EFR is found only in the ''[[Brassicaceae]]'' family of plants, meaning it has a limited effect in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Experiments have demonstrated the ability to successfully transfer EFR to plants in other families, such as ''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'', a relative of tobacco, and ''[[Tomato|Solanum lycopersicum]]'', the tomato plant. The ability to transfer PRRs between plants and have them retain their effectiveness broadens genetic engineering techniques to promote disease resistance in crops. It can also reduce chemical wastes associated with mass agriculture and enable the transfer of immunity rapidly and without traditional breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lacombe|first=Séverine|last2=Rougon-Cardoso|first2=Alejandra|last3=Sherwood|first3=Emma|last4=Peeters|first4=Nemo|last5=Dahlbeck|first5=Douglas|last6=van Esse|first6=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10040">'''Ecological efficiency''' describes the [[efficiency]] with which [[energy]] is transferred from one [[trophic level]] to the next. It is determined by a combination of efficiencies relating to organismic resource acquisition and assimilation in an ecosystem.

== Energy transfer ==

[[File:Energy transfer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A diagram of energy transfer between trophic levels]]

[[Primary production]] occurs in [[autotroph]]ic organisms of an [[ecosystem]]. [[Photoautotroph]]s such as [[vascular plant]]s and [[algae]] convert energy from the sun into energy stored as [[carbon compounds]]. [[Photosynthesis]] is carried out in the [[chlorophyll]] of green plants. The energy converted through photosynthesis is carried through the trophic levels of an ecosystem as organisms consume members of lower trophic levels.

Primary production can be broken down into gross and net primary production. Gross primary production is a measure of the energy that a photoautotroph harvests from the sun. Take, for example, a blade of grass that takes in ''x'' [[joule]]s of energy from the sun. The [[photosynthetic efficiency|fraction of that energy]] that is converted into [[glucose]] reflects the gross productivity of the blade of grass. The energy remaining after respiration is considered the net primary production. In general, gross production refers to the energy contained within an organism before respiration and net production the energy after respiration. The terms can be used to describe energy transfer in both autotrophs and [[heterotroph]]s.

Energy transfer between trophic levels is generally inefficient, such that net production at one trophic level is generally only 10% of the net production at the preceding trophic level (the [[#Ten percent law|Ten percent law]]). Due to non-predatory death, [[egestion]], and [[cellular respiration|respiration]], a significant amount of energy is lost to the environment instead of being absorbed for production by consumers. The figure approximates the fraction of energy available after each stage of energy loss in a typical ecosystem, although these fractions vary greatly from ecosystem to ecosystem and from trophic level to trophic level. The loss of energy by a factor of one half from each of the steps of non-predatory death, defecation, and respiration is typical of many living systems. Thus, the net production at one trophic level is &lt;math&gt;1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/8&lt;/math&gt; or approximately ten percent that of the trophic level before it.

For example, assume 500 units of energy are produced by trophic level 1. One half of that is lost to non-predatory death, while the other half (250 units) is ingested by trophic level 2. One half of the amount ingested is expelled through defecation, leaving the other half (125 units) to be assimilated by the organism. Finally one half of the remaining energy is lost through respiration while the rest (63 units) is used for growth and reproduction. This energy expended for growth and reproduction constitutes to the net production of trophic level 1, which is equal to &lt;math&gt;500 * 1/2 *1/2 * 1/2 = 63&lt;/math&gt; units.

== Quantifying ecological efficiency ==

Ecological efficiency is a combination of several related efficiencies that describe [[resource utilization]] and the extent to which resources are converted into [[biomass]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6TMvdZQiySoC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=exploitation+efficiency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b54H-dCCzF&amp;sig=57Ffq6a0yKFi3nehpu72_l-Bngw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9wX5SaezFMSGtgf9-PCyDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
* Exploitation efficiency is the amount of [[food]] ingested divided by the amount of [[prey]] production (&lt;math&gt;I_n/P_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;)
* Assimilation efficiency is the amount of [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] divided by the amount of food [[ingestion]] (&lt;math&gt;A_n/I_n&lt;/math&gt;)
* Net Production efficiency is the amount of consumer production divided by the amount of assimilation (&lt;math&gt;P_n/A_n&lt;/math&gt;)
* Gross Production efficiency is the assimilation efficiency multiplied by the net [[production efficiency]], which is equivalent to the amount of consumer production divided by amount of ingestion (&lt;math&gt;P_n/I_n&lt;/math&gt;)
* Ecological efficiency is the [[exploitation efficiency]] multiplied by the assimilation efficiency multiplied by the net production efficiency, which is equivalent to the amount of consumer production divided by the amount of prey production (&lt;math&gt;P_n/P_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;)

Theoretically, it is easy to calculate ecological efficiency using the mathematical relationships above.  It is often difficult, however, to obtain accurate measurements of the values involved in the calculation.  Assessing ingestion, for example, requires knowledge of the gross amount of food consumed in an [[ecosystem]] as well as its [[caloric content]].  Such a measurement is rarely better than an educated estimate, particularly with relation to ecosystems that are largely inaccessible to ecologists and tools of measurement.  The ecological efficiency of an ecosystem is as a result often no better than an approximation.  On the other hand, an approximation may be enough for most ecosystems, where it is important not to get an exact measure of efficiency, but rather a general idea of how energy is moving through its [[trophic level]]s.

== Applications ==

In agricultural environments, maximizing [[energy transfer]] from producer (food) to [[consumer]] ([[livestock]]) can yield economic benefits. A sub-field of [[agricultural science]] has emerged that explores methods of monitoring and improving ecological and related efficiencies.

In comparing the net efficiency of energy utilization by cattle, breeds historically kept for [[beef production]], such as the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], outperformed those kept for [[dairy production]], such as the Holstein, in converting energy from feed into stored energy as tissue.&lt;ref&gt;Gareett, W.N. Energetic Efficiency of Beef and Dairy Steers. Journal of Animal Science.1971. 32:451-456&lt;/ref&gt; This is a result of the beef cattle storing more body fat than the dairy cattle, as energy storage as protein was at the same level for both breeds. This implies that cultivation of cattle for slaughter is a more efficient use of feed than is cultivation for milk production.

While it is possible to improve the efficiency of energy use by livestock, it is vital to the [[world food]] question to also consider the differences between animal husbandry and plant agriculture. [[Caloric concentration]] in [[fat tissue]]s are higher than in plant tissues, causing high-fat organisms to be most energetically-concentrated; however, the energy required to cultivate feed for livestock is only partially converted into fat cells. The rest of the energy input into cultivating feed is respired or egested by the livestock and unable to be used by humans.

Out of a total of 96.8 &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; 10^15 [[BTU]] of energy used in the US in 1999, 10.5% was used in food production,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, 2004: Annual energy review 2003. Rep. DOE/EIA-0384(2003), Energy Information Administration, 390 pp&lt;/ref&gt; with the percentage accounting for food from both producer and primary consumer [[trophic level]]s. In comparing the cultivation of animals versus plants, there is a clear difference in magnitude of energy efficiency. Edible kilocalories produced from kilocalories of energy required for cultivation are: 18.1% for chicken, 6.7% for grass-fed beef, 5.7% for farmed salmon, and 0.9% for shrimp.  In contrast, potatoes yield 123%, corn produce 250%, and soy results in 415% of input calories converted to calories able to be utilized by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Eshel, Gidon and Martin, Pamela A. Diet, Energy, and Global Warming. Earth Interactions. 2005. 10: 1- 17&lt;/ref&gt; This disparity in efficiency reflects the reduction in production from moving up trophic levels. Thus, it is more energetically efficient to form a diet from lower trophic levels.

== Ten percent law ==

The '''Ten percent law''' of transfer of energy from one [[trophic level]] to the next was introduced by [[Raymond Lindeman]] (1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindeman | first1 = RL  | year = 1942 | title = The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 399–418 | doi=10.2307/1930126}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, during the transfer of energy from organic food from one trophic level to the next, only about ten percent of the energy from organic matter is stored as flesh. The remaining is lost during transfer, broken down in respiration, or lost to incomplete [[digestion]] by higher trophic level.

=== The food chain ===
{{main|Food chain}}
When organisms are consumed, 10% of the energy in the food is fixed into their flesh and is available for next trophic level ([[carnivores]] or [[omnivores]]). When a carnivore or an omnivore consumes that animal, only about 10% of energy is fixed in its flesh for the higher level.

For example, the Sun releases 1000 J of energy, then plants take only 100 J of energy from sunlight; thereafter, a deer would take 1 J from the plant. A wolf eating the deer would only take 0.1 J. A human eating the wolf would take 0.01J, etc.

The ten percent law provides a basic understanding on the cycling of food chains. Furthermore, the ten percent law shows the inefficiency of energy capture at each successive trophic level. The rational conclusion is that energy efficiency is best preserved by sourcing food as close to the initial energy source as possible.

=== Formula ===

 Energy at n(th) level =(energy given by sun)/(10)^(n+1). 
                   Or Energy at n(Th) level =(energy given by plant)/(10)^(n-1)
             {Remember to count only from plant for both equation}

Global concerns about the '''gender disparity in computing''' occupations have gained more importance with the emerging [[information age]]. These concerns motivated [[public policy]] debates addressing [[gender equality]] as computer applications exerted increasing influence in society. This dialogue helped to expand information technology innovations and to reduce the consequences of [[sexism]].

By the 1960s, while computer programming was still touted as a good field for women to go into, major shifts were beginning to take place that would help push women out of the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men who were programming started to make the field more "prestigious," creating professional associations, education requirements for work and by actively discouraging hiring women in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hiring tools were introduced in which answers were shared among all-male groups and clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way to push women out of the field was to use [[Personality test|personality tests]] that favored people who were not interested in working with others, which was slanted towards a certain type of male applicant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After these trends were entrenched in the industry, it has continued to perpetuate itself into the modern day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some computer science programs, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], in the mid-1960s wouldn't even admit women into their program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4892094/google-diversity-history-memo/|title=Women in Tech and the History Behind That Controversial Google Diversity Memo|last=Waxman|first=Olvia B.|date=8 August 2017|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender gap==
A survey, conducted by SWIFT ("Supporting Women in Information Technology") based in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, asked 7,411 participants questions about their career choices. The survey found that females tend to believe that they lack the skill set needed to be successful in the field of computing. This study (as well as others) provides a strong base for a positive correlation between perceived ability and career choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Chan, Vania |author2=Stafford, Katie |author3=Klawe, Maria |author4=Chen, Grace |title=Gender Differences in Vancouver Secondary Students' Interests Related to Information Technology Careers |publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia |year=2000 |url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc |access-date=2016-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221164825/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc# |archive-date=2007-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A project based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society" (SIGIS) released its findings based on research conducted in 48 separate case studies all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, Wendy (2004).

These techniques range from the introduction of role models, advertisement campaigns, and the allocation of quotas, in order to make the computing field appear more gender neutral.&lt;ref name="sigis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof Robin Williams|title=Getting More Women in Computer Science and Engineering|publisher=University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225701/http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf#|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating reforms, which will increase the quality of the educating body and technological facilities, are also suggested.&lt;ref name="sigis" /&gt;

Research suggests that [[Malaysia]] has a much more equal split that varies around the half-way mark.&lt;ref name="mala"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Vivian Anette Lagesen |title=A Cyberfeminist Utopia?: Perceptions of Gender and Computer Science among Malaysian Women Computer Science Students and Faculty|publisher=Sage Publications|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A job in the computing industry also implies a safe work environment. Strong belief by the previous generation that IT would be a flourishing sector with many job opportunities caused parents to encourage their children to take a computing career, no matter the gender.&lt;ref name="mala" /&gt;

In India, a growing number of women are studying and taking careers in technical fields. The percentage of women engineers graduating from IIT Bombay grew from 
1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simard |first=Caroline |url=http://anitaborginstitute.org/files/womenhightechworld.pdf |format=PDF |title= The state of women and technology fields around the world |publisher= Anita Borg Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women in Arab societies|Arab women]] made up 59% of students enrolled in computer science in 2014 at government universities located in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Islam|2017|p=13}} Women in [[Eastern Europe]], especially in Bulgaria and Romania, have high rates of pursuing coding and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/women-in-tech-why-bulgaria-and-romania-are-leading-in-software-engineering/|title=Women in tech: Why Bulgaria and Romania are leading in software engineering {{!}} ZDNet|last=Fiscutean|first=Andrada|date=13 June 2017|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women remain underrepresented in information technology fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varma | first1 = Roli | year = 2010 | title = Computing self-efficiency among women in India | url = http://www.unm.edu/~varma/print/JWMSE_CS%20Self%20Efficacy.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 257–274 | doi=10.1615/jwomenminorscieneng.v16.i3.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics in education===
In the United States, the proportion of women represented in undergraduate [[computer science]] education and the white-collar [[information technology]] workforce peaked in the mid-1980s, and has declined ever since. In 1984, 37.1% of [[Computer Science]] degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy (2001). [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~women/resources/aroundTheWeb/hostedPapers/Syllabus-Camp.pdf "Women in Computer Science: Reversing the Trend"]. Colorado School of Mines.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[Computing Research Association]] Taulbee Survey indicate that fewer than 12% of Computer Science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women at U.S. PhD-granting institutions in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CS_Degree_and_Enrollment_Trends_2010-11.pdf "Computing Degree and Enrollment Trends"], 2010-2011 CRA Taulbee Survey. The Computing Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although teenage girls are now using computers and the Internet at rates similar to their male peers, they are five times less likely to consider a technology-related career or plan on taking post-secondary technology classes.&lt;ref&gt;Melkymuka, Kathleen (8 January 2001). [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590257/it-personnel/if-girls-don-t-get-it---it-won-t-get-girls.html "If Girls Don't Get IT, IT Won't Get Girls"], Computer World.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]] (NCWIT) reports that of the [[SAT]] takers who intend to major in computer and information sciences, the proportion of girls has steadily decreased relative to the proportion of boys, from 20 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, Randall  (15 November 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16digi.html?_r=0 "What Has Driven Women Out of Computer Science?"], The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  While this number has been decreasing, in 2001, the total number of these students (both boys and girls) reached its peak at 73,466.

According to a [[College Board]] report, in 2006 there were slightly more girls than boys amongst SAT takers that reported to having "course work or experience" in [[computer literacy]], word processing, internet activity, and creating spreadsheets/databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2006/national-report.pdf 2006 College-Bound Seniors - Total Group Profile Report], CollegeBoard SAT.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also determined that more boys than girls (59% vs 41%) reported course work or experience with [[computer programming]], although this may likely be caused by false reporting. Of the 146,437 students (13%) who reported having ''no'' course work or experience, 61% were girls and 39% were boys.

More boys than girls take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) Computer Science exams. According to the College Board in 2006, 2,594 girls and 12,068 boys took the AP Computer Science A exam, while 517 girls and 4,422 boys took the more advanced AP Computer Science AB exam. From 1996 to 2004, girls made up 16–17% of those taking the AP Computer Science A exam and around 10% of those taking AP Computer Science AB exam.

===Statistics in the workforce===
Women's representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling from a peak of 38% in the mid-1980s. From 1993 through 1999, NSF's SESTAT reported that the percentage of women working as computer/information scientists (including those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher in an S&amp;E field or have a bachelor's degree or higher and are working in an S&amp;E field) declined slightly from 33.1% to 29.6% percent while the absolute numbers increased from 170,500 to 185,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/us-workforce/ "Characteristics of Scientists and Engineers in the US"], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Catalyst in 2006 indicated that women comprise 27-29% of the computing workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Misa, ed. (2010). ''Gender Codes: Why Women Are Leaving Computing''. Wiley/IEEE Computer Society Press. pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; A [[National Public Radio]] report in 2013 stated that about 20% of all U.S. computer programmers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

==Benefits of gender diversity==
A gender-diverse team is more likely to create products that meet people's requirements. When women are underrepresented, many technical decisions are based on men's experiences, opinions, and judgement, resulting in a male-slanted bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/research/solving-the-equation/|title=Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women's Success in Engineering and Computing|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a review of research on gender-diverse teams reveals that gender-diverse teams are more productive, more creative, and more able to stay on schedule and within budget, compared to homogenous teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/impactgenderdiversitytechbusinessperformance_print.pdf|title=What Is the Impact of Gender Diversity on Technology Business Performance?: Research Summary|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other research review suggests that the results are mixed, with many studies showing no result, non-linear results or even negative results of gender diversity on team performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/16372408/received-wisdom-relationship-between-diversity-organizational-performance|title=RECEIVED WISDOM AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research conducted by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] showed that companies with women in top management were more financially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/is_there_a_payoff_from_top-team_diversity|title=Is there a payoff from top-team diversity?|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast analysis of sample major US companies showed no effect of inclusion of women (or minority members) on financial performance, these varied results give no conclusive evidence of the benefits of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x/abstract|title=The Gender and Ethnic Diversity of US Boards and Board Committees and Firm Financial Performance|accessdate=25 August 2015 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x|volume=18|journal=Corporate Governance: An International Review|pages=396–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide'' states that the lack of participation of females in computing excludes them from the "new economy", which calls for sophisticated computer skills in exchange for high salary positions.&lt;ref name="digital divide"&gt;Cooper, J.; Weaver, K. (2003). ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors contributing to lack of female participation==

===Education===
Diminished participation by women relative to men in computer science dates from about 1984&lt;ref name=NSFstatistics&gt;{{cite web|title=TABLE 33. Computer sciences degrees awarded, by degree level and sex of recipient: 1966–2010|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13327/pdf/tab33.pdf|publisher=NSF|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following mass marketing of personal computers to boys as toys to play games. Fiddling with computers by boys resulted in increased interest and readiness for computer science classes by young men.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Henn|title=When Women Stopped Coding|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding|accessdate=December 26, 2014|work=Morning Edition|publisher=NPR|date=October 21, 2014|quote=The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of over 7000 high school students in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]] showed that the degree of interest in the field of [[computer science]] for young women is comparably lower than that of young men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Handcock, Mark S. et al. (2004). [https://www.webcitation.org/67YOr88gp?url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html "Focus on Women in Computer Science"], University of British Columbia. Archived from [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html the original] on 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is seen in higher education; for instance, only 4% of female college freshmen expressed intention to major in computer science in the US.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Research has shown that some aspects about computing may discourage women. One of the biggest turn-offs is the "geek factor". High school girls often envisage a career in computing as a lifetime in an isolated cubicle writing code. The "geek factor" affects both male and female high school students, but it seems to have more of a negative effect on the female students.&lt;ref name="dean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|title=Computer Science Takes Steps to Bring Women to the Fold|work=[[New York Times]]|date=17 April 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/science/17comp.html?_r=2&amp;8dpc=&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, computer programmers depicted in popular media are overwhelmingly male, contributing to an absence of role models for would-be female computer programmers.  However, in 2015, computer science has for the first time become the most popular major for female students at Stanford University.&lt;ref name=stanfordcs&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Sarah|title=Computer science now top major for women at Stanford University|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-technology-stanford-idUSKCN0S32F020151009|website=Reuters US Edition|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part to qualify for federal education funding distributed through the states, most U.S. states and districts now focus on ensuring that all students are at least "proficient" in mathematics and reading, making it difficult for teachers to focus on teaching concepts beyond the test. According to a Rand Corporation study, such a concentration on testing can cause administrators to focus resources on tested subjects at the expense of other subjects (e.g., science) or distract their attention from other needs.&lt;ref&gt;Stecher, B. M. (2002).  "Consequences of large-scale, high-stakes testing on school and classroom practice". In: Hamilton, L. S., B. M. Stecher, and S. P. Klein (Eds.). ''Making sense of test-based accountability in education''. Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, computational thinking is unlikely to be taught either standalone or as integrated into other areas of study (e.g., mathematics, biology) anytime in the near future. The National Center for Women &amp; IT distributes free resources for increasing awareness of the need for teaching computer science in schools, including the "Talking Points" card, "Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529040434/http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}, [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female and male perspectives===
[[File:Not_boyfriends_computer.jpg|thumb|The sticker reads, "No, this is not my boyfriend's computer."]]
According to a 1998–2000 ethnographic study by Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], men and women viewed computers very differently. Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, J. et al. (1999). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 ''Unlocking the Clubhouse''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713080000/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 |date=July 13, 2012 }}. The MIT Press. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were "geeks," with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers "become their life."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.

A two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that "Girls approach the computer as a "tool" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a "toy" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse "real" power and power on a screen. "I see a computer as a tool," a high school girl declares. "You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way."&lt;ref&gt;AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000). [http://history.aauw.org/files/2013/01/TechSavvy.pdf "Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age"], p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed as far back as 2000 that boys and girls use computers at about the same rates, albeit for somewhat different purposes.

Nearly 1000 students in [[University of Akron]] were surveyed, and it was discovered that females hold a more negative attitude towards computers than males.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Another study assessed the computer-related attitude of over 300 students in [[University of Winnipeg]] and obtained similar results.&lt;ref name="digital divide" /&gt;

This is thought to contribute to the gender disparity phenomenon in computing, in particular the females' early lack of interest in the field.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt;

===Barriers to advancement===
Research on the barriers that women face in undergraduate computing&lt;ref&gt;Cohoon, J. McGrath; Aspray, William (2006). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 ''Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035820/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 |date=January 6, 2012 }}, Chapter 5. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted such factors as:

* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the "weedout" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.
* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.
* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that "women can do computing as well as men".
* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.

Just like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need "extra help" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the "extra help" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.

===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===
Women in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: "I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work".&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

However, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"&gt;(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies "Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.

===Stereotyping computer scientists===
Other research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it has been found that a women’s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors. (Research).|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|date=2002|volume=80|issue=4|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases that subvert the stereotype of typical people in computing include the person coming from a family that is already involved in computing or a related field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kekelis|first1=Linda S.|last2=Ancheta|first2=Rebecca Wepsic|last3=Heber|first3=Etta|title=Hurdles in the pipeline: girls and technology careers.|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2005|volume=26|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, coming from a family of a higher socioeconomic status is correlated to a higher likelihood of women choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002" /&gt; Yet, many computing companies only search for employees from prestigious schools, which leaves fewer opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017" /&gt;

===Fraternity-like startup environments===
The disproportionate number of startups in the computing industry, and the disproportionate hiring of primarily young workers, have created an environment in which many firms' technical teams consist largely of workers who are recent college graduates, sometimes giving the businesses fraternity-like cultures, leading to [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism]] that discourages female participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/09/18/heres-the-conversation-men-need-to-have-about-sexism-as-told-by-a-man/|title=Sexism In Startups: The Frank Conversation We Need To Be Having|first=Joseph|last=Steinberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of fraternity-like environments among technology teams of startup firms has been termed ''brogrammer culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-01/the-rise-of-the-brogrammer|title=The Rise of the 'Brogrammer'|first=Douglas MacMillan|last=dmac1|date=2 March 2012|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bringing women into computing==
[[File:Computer_Repairing_Lilongwe_Malawi.jpg|thumb|Computer Repairing Lilongwe Malawi]]
The majority of data collected about women in IT has been qualitative analysis such as interviews and case studies. This data has been used to create effective programs addressing the underrepresentation of women in IT.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J W; Beise, C M; Woszczynski, A B; Myers, M E. (2003).

The number of female college entrants expressing interest in majoring in computer science decreased in the 2000s to pre-1980's levels.&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy |last=Eggers |title=Interest in computer science is volatile |url=http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |publisher=The Institute of Quantitative Social Science |date=17 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67YOs9Pdz?url=http://blogs.iq.harvard.edu/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study was initialized by Allan Fisher, then Associate Dean for Undergraduate Computer Science Education at Carnegie Mellon University, and Jane Margolis, a social scientist and expert in gender equity in education, into the nature of this problem.

[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lblum/PAPERS/women_in_computer_science.pdf "Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience"], Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities across North America are changing their computer science programs to make them more appealing to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/23/358238982/to-get-women-to-work-in-computer-science-schools-get-them-to-class | title=To Get Women To Work In Computer Science, Schools Get Them To Class | publisher=NPR | date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proactive and positive exposures to early computer experiences, such as The Alice Project,&lt;ref name="Alice"&gt;[http://www.alice.org/index.php The Alice Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508000054/http://alice.org/index.php# |date=2012-05-08 }}, Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the late [[Randy Pausch]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], are thought to be effective in terms of retention and creation of enthusiasm for women who may later consider entering the field. Institutions of higher education are also beginning to make changes regarding the process and availability of mentoring to women that are undergraduates in technical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|author2=Kristen Moore |title=Time Talk: On Small Changes that Enact Infrastructural Mentoring for Undergraduate Women in Technical Fields|journal=Journal of Technical Writing &amp; Communication|year=2013|volume=43|issue=3|pages=333–354|doi=10.2190/TW.43.3.f|url=http://0-pq9se9hp4e.search.serialssolutions.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/?genre=article&amp;issn=00472816&amp;title=Journal+of+Technical+Writing+%26+Communication&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=3&amp;date=20130901&amp;atitle=Time+Talk%3a+On+Small+Changes+that+Enact+Infrastructural+Mentoring+for+Undergraduate+Women+in+Technical+Fields.&amp;spage=333&amp;pages=333-354&amp;sid=EBSCO:Academic+Search+Complete&amp;aulast=Sullivan%2c+Patricia|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy for addressing this issue has been early outreach to elementary and high-school girls. Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt; A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cips.ca/women "Women in IT"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.

Additionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.

=== 2000s efforts ===

====National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology====
[[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology|The National Center for Women &amp; IT]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or "fitting in" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;DuBow, Wendy M., et al.

====Postsecondary education organization====
Numerous postsecondary education institutions have student-run organizations that focus on the advancement of women in computer science. In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC). The organization aims to promote women in computing across a variety of schools and industries, educate women on the profession of computer science, and provide opportunities for women in technical fields. WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2014/02/10/harvard-wecode-conference-welcomes-more-women-into-tech/jAlzh5KVabxMJQjhsjZa9N/blog.html|title=Harvard's WECode conference welcomes more women into tech|work=Boston.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/02/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science/|title=Closing the gender gap in computer science|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacesetters====
In an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called "Pacesetters". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 "Net New Women" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&amp;T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:

*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.
*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,
*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.

''Athena Unbound - The advancement of women in science and technology'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-511-03833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in the sciences from an early childhood interest, through university, to graduate school and finally into the academic workplace.

According to J. McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2011 | title = Gender And Computing Conference Papers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 72–80 | doi=10.1145/1978542.1978561}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72–79 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that "...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing according to Paul De Palma. In his article Why Women Avoid Computer Science, he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who usually are given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other "boy-related" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore more participation of women in the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;De Palma, Paul.

Guerrilla (Spanish for "little war"), as applied to theatrical events, describes the act of spontaneous, surprise performances in unlikely public spaces to an unsuspecting audience. Typically these performances intend to draw attention to a political/social issue through [[satire]], [[protest]], and carnivalesque techniques. Many of these performances were a direct result of the radical [[social movement]]s of the late 1960s through mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Webster’s College Dictionary.

==Origins==
The term ''Guerrilla Theater'' was coined by Peter Berg, who in 1965 suggested it to [[R.G. Davis]] as the title of his essay on the actions of the  [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], an essay that was first published in 1966.&lt;ref name="BraunsteinDoyle02"&gt;Peter Braunstein, Michael William Doyle (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=R178zShWUtIC ''Imagine nation: the American counterculture of the 1960s and '70s''], p.93 note #9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"&gt;{{cite book

Cody, Evert Sprinchorn (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 1''], pp.568-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernesto Guevara]] ''Guerrilla Warfare'', Thomas M.

Davis had studied [[Mime artist|mime]] and modern dance in the 1950s and had discovered [[commedia dell'arte]]. In autumn 1966 around 20 members of the San Francisco Mime Troupe broke off and started their own collective called [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]], who took their name from [[Diggers|a group of 17th century radicals in England]].

== Guerrilla theater in practice ==

Guerrilla theater shares its origins with many forms of political protest and street theatre including [[agitprop]] (agitation-propaganda), [[carnival]], [[parades]], [[Procession|pageants]], [[political protest]], [[performance art]], [[happening]]s, and, most notably, the Dada movement and [[street art|guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;Random House ''Webster's College Dictionary''.  New York: Random House, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this movement is widely studied in Theater History classrooms, the amount of research and documentation of guerrilla theater is surprisingly lacking.  The term, "Guerrilla Theater" seems to have emerged during the mid-1960s primarily as an upshot of activist [[Radical Theater]] groups such as [[The Living Theatre]], [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], El [[Teatro Campesino]], and the Free Southern Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Cruz, Jan, ed.  ''Radical Street Performance''.  New York: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has important roots in [[Allan Kaprow]]'s "happenings".

The first widely documented guerrilla performances were carried out under the leadership of [[Abbie Hoffman]] and the [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies).  One of their most publicized events occurred on August 24, 1967, at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] where Hoffman and other Yippies threw dollar bills onto the trading floor below.  Creating a media frenzy, the event was publicized internationally.  In his later publication, ''Soon to be a Major Motion Picture'' (1980), Hoffman refers to his television appearances with specially planned subversive tactics as "guerrilla theater."&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar.  ''History of the Theatre''.  7th ed.  Needham Heights, Massachusetts: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, pg. 575.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla theater was used as a protest demonstration by the anti-war organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. An article from the summer of 1971 published in the glossy magazine ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' detailed one such performance in [[Washington, D.C.]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A squad of soldiers moved through the part adjoining the U.S. Capitol. They were grubby looking troopers, clad in jungle fatigues and "boonie hats" with wide brims turned up. Jumping a low fence, they began shouting at a group of tourists. 'All right. Hold it. Hold it. Nobody move. Nobody move.' Their voices were full of tension and anger. A man broke out of the crowd and started running. Several soldiers fired at once, and the man fell, clutching his stomach. Blood could be seen on the clean sidewalk. The tourists turned away in horror. 'Get a body count,' a soldier yelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Another squad of soldiers emerged from under the Capitol steps. 'All right. ID. ID,' they screeched. 'You got no ID and you [[Viet Cong|VC]].' They quickly grabbed a young woman and led her away, binding her wrists behind her back and prodding her with their rifles.... They grabbed [a] young man and threw him on the ground, tying his hands behind his back. Several of the soldiers kicked him, seeming to aim for his groin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Then someone took out a long, thick hunting knife and lifted up the man's shirt, holding the knife to his bare stomach, and pushed against it slightly. 'You VC? You VC?' The man said nothing. He was pushed to his feet and shoved down again. Then he was told to get up. This time the knife was pushed to the side of his neck, and the same question was repeated. Still no answer. The man was dragged away.... Then the soldiers left, and a smaller, less angry group of men dressed in khaki fatigues passed out leaflets to the astonished tourists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"''"A US Infantry platoon just passed through here!"'' the pink colored piece of paper read in big bold letters. ''"If you had been Vietnamese... We might have burned your house. We might have shot your dog. We might have shot you... HELP US END THE WAR BEFORE THEY TURN YOUR SON INTO A BUTCHER OR A CORPSE."''&lt;ref&gt;Art Goldberg, "Vietnam Vets: The Anti-War Army," ''Ramparts,'' vol. 10, no. 1 (July 1971), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Post-1970s performance theater==

Another guerrilla performance group that continued the use of the term was the [[Guerrilla Girls]].  This group of feminist artist-activists was established in New York City in 1985 with the purpose of bringing attention to the lack of female artists in major [[art galleries]] and [[museum]]s.  The Guerrilla Girls began their work through guerrilla art tactics which broadened to include guerrilla theater.  Some common practices in their guerrilla theater techniques that have been replicated by other groups include appearing in costume, using assumed names, and disguising their identity.

==Guerrilla theater groups==

The origins and legacy of guerrilla theater can be seen in the work of these political/performance groups:

* [[ACT UP]]
* [[Billionaires for Bush]]
* [[Billionaires for Wealthcare]]
* [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]
* [[The Church of Euthanasia]]
* [[Circus Amok]]
* [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]]

[[File:Pierre-Simon Laplace.jpg|thumb|250 px|[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis]]

The history of scientific thought about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System]] begins with the [[Copernican Revolution]].
The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=etymoline|title=Solar|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=solar+system&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary view==
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}
The most widely accepted theory of planetary formation, known as the [[nebular hypothesis]], maintains that 4.6 billion years ago, the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a giant [[molecular cloud]] which was [[light year]]s across. Several [[star]]s, including the [[Sun]], formed within the collapsing cloud. The gas that formed the Solar System was slightly more massive than the Sun itself. Most of the mass collected in the centre, forming the Sun; the rest of the mass flattened into a [[protoplanetary disc]], out of which the [[planet]]s and other bodies in the Solar System formed.

There are, however, arguments against this hypothesis.

==Formation hypothesis==
French philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] was the first to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his ''Le Monde'' (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and was on the right track with condensation and contraction. However, this was before Newton's theory of gravity and we now know matter does not behave in this fashion.&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
The vortex model of 1944,&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; formulated by German physicist and philosopher Baron [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], which harkens back to the Cartesian model,  involved a pattern of turbulence-induced eddies in a Laplacian nebular disc. In it a suitable combination of clockwise rotation of each vortex and anti-clockwise rotation of the whole system can lead to individual elements moving around the central mass in Keplerian orbits so there would be little dissipation of energy due to the overall motion of the system but material would be colliding at high relative velocity in the inter-vortex boundaries and in these regions small roller-bearing eddies would coalesce to give annular condensations. It was much criticized as turbulence is a phenomenon associated with disorder and would not spontaneously produce the highly ordered structure required by the hypothesis. As well, it does not provide a solution to the angular momentum problem and does not explain lunar formation nor other very basic characteristics of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Woolfson|Woolfson, Michael Mark]], ''The Origin and Evolution of universe and the Solar System'', Taylor and Francis, 2000 ; completely considered that collision of the two suns produce the solar system and universe in the entire 100,00 years of the evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weizsäcker model was modified&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; in 1948 by Dutch theoretical physicist Dirk Ter Haar, in that regular eddies were discarded and replaced by random turbulence which would lead to a very thick nebula where gravitational instability would not occur. He concluded the planets must have formed by accretion and explained the compositional difference (solid and liquid planets) as due to the temperature difference between the inner and outer regions, the former being hotter and the latter being cooler, so only refractories (non-volatiles) condensed in the inner region. A major difficulty is that in this supposition turbulent dissipation takes place in a time scale of only about a millennium which does not give enough time for planets to form.

The nebular hypothesis was first proposed in 1734 by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. 1734, (Principia) Latin: Opera Philosophica et Mineralia (English: Philosophical and Mineralogical Works), (Principia, Volume 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  and later elaborated and expanded upon by [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1755. A similar theory was independently formulated by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1909| title= The Past History of the Earth as Inferred from the Mode of Formation of the Solar System| journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume=48 | pages=119 | author=See, T. J. J. |jstor=983817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] conceived the idea that the planets were formed when a comet collided with the Sun, sending matter out to form the planets. However, Laplace refuted this idea in 1796, showing that any planets formed in such a way would eventually crash into the Sun. Laplace felt that the near-circular orbits of the planets were a necessary consequence of their formation.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Today, comets are known to be far too small to have created the Solar System in this way.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Solar System: Its Origin and Evolution |author=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |quote=Physics Department, University of New York |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=34 |pages=1–20 |date=1993 |bibcode=1993QJRAS..34....1W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, Immanuel Kant speculated that observed [[nebulae]] may in fact be regions of star and planet formation. In 1796, Laplace elaborated by arguing that the nebula collapsed into a star, and, as it did so, the remaining material gradually spun outward into a flat disc, which then formed the planets.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===Alternative theories===
However plausible it may appear at first sight, the nebular hypothesis still faces the obstacle of [[angular momentum]]; if the Sun had indeed formed from the collapse of such a cloud, the planets should be rotating far more slowly. The Sun, though it contains almost 99.9 percent of the system's mass, contains just 1 percent of its angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=313 |title=Rotation in the Solar System |issue=1524 |date=1984 |pages=5 |bibcode=1984RSPTA.313....5W |doi=10.1098/rsta.1984.0078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Sun should be spinning much more rapidly.

====Tidal theory====
Attempts to resolve the angular momentum problem led to the temporary abandonment of the nebular hypothesis in favour of a return to "two-body" theories.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; For several decades, many astronomers preferred the ''tidal'' or ''near-collision'' hypothesis put forward by [[James Jeans]] in 1917, in which the planets were considered to have been formed due to the approach of some other star to the Sun. This near-miss would have drawn large amounts of matter out of the Sun and the other star by their mutual [[tidal force]]s, which could have then condensed into planets.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; However, in 1929 astronomer [[Harold Jeffreys]] countered that such a near-collision was massively unlikely.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Objections to the hypothesis were also raised by the American astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]], who showed that it ran into problems with [[angular momentum]] for the outer planets, with the planets struggling to avoid being reabsorbed by the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Crowell|title=Conservation Laws|publisher=lightandmatter.com|date=1998–2006|chapter=5|url=http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/2cl/ch05/ch05.html|isbn=0-9704670-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Chamberlin-Moulton model====
Forest Moulton in 1900 had also shown that the nebular hypothesis was inconsistent with observations because of the angular momentum. Moulton and Chamberlin in 1904 originated the planetesimal hypothesis&lt;ref name="Sherrill, T.J 1999"&gt;Sherrill, T.J. 1999. A Career of Controversy: the Anomaly of T.J.J. See. J. Hist. Astrn. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs/1999JHA.&lt;/ref&gt;(see [[Chamberlin–Moulton planetesimal hypothesis]]). Along with many astronomers of the day they came to believe the pictures of "spiral nebulas" from the Lick Observatory were direct evidence of forming solar systems. These turned out to be galaxies instead but the Shapley-Curtis debate about these was still 16 years in the future. One of the most fundamental issues in the history of astronomy was distinguishing between nebulas and galaxies.

Moulton and Chamberlin suggested that a star had passed close to the Sun early in its life to cause tidal bulges and that this, along with the internal process that leads to solar prominences,  resulted in the ejection of filaments of matter from both stars. While most of the material would have fallen back, part of it would remain in orbit. The filaments cooled into numerous, tiny, solid fragments, ‘planetesimals’, and a few larger protoplanets.  This model received favourable support for about 3 decades but passed out of favour by the late '30s and was discarded in the '40s by the realization it was incompatible with the angular momentum of Jupiter, but a part of it, planetesimal accretion, was retained.&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt;

====Lyttleton's scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt;====
In 1937 and 1940, [[Raymond Arthur Lyttleton|Ray Lyttleton]] postulated that a companion star to the Sun collided with a passing star. Such a scenario was already suggested and rejected by Henry Russell in 1935. Lyttleton showed terrestrial planets were too small to condense on their own so suggested one very large proto-planet broke in two because of rotational instability, forming Jupiter and Saturn, with a connecting filament from which the other planets formed. A later model, from 1940 and 1941, involves a triple star system, a binary plus the Sun, in which the binary merges and later breaks up because of rotational instability and escapes from the system leaving a filament that formed between them to be captured by the Sun. Objections of Lyman Spitzer apply to this model also.

====Band-structure model====
In 1954, 1975, and 1978&lt;ref&gt;Alfvén, H. 1978. Band Structure of the Solar System. In Origin of the Solar System, S.F. Dermot, ed, pp. 41–48. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish astrophysicist Hannes  Alfvén included electromagnetic effects in equations of particle motions, and angular momentum distribution and compositional differences were explained. In 1954 he first proposed the band structure in which he distinguished an A-cloud, containing mostly helium, but with some solid- particle impurities ("meteor rain"), a B-cloud, with mostly hydrogen, a C-cloud, having mainly carbon, and a D-cloud, made mainly of silicon and iron. Impurities in the A-cloud form Mars and the Moon (later captured by Earth), in the B-cloud they condense into Mercury, Venus, and Earth, in the C-cloud they condense into the outer planets, and Pluto and Triton may have formed from the D-cloud.

====Interstellar cloud theory====
In 1943, the Soviet astronomer [[Otto Schmidt]] proposed that the Sun, in its present form, passed through a dense [[interstellar cloud]], emerging enveloped in a cloud of dust and gas, from which the planets eventually formed. This solved the angular momentum problem by assuming that the Sun's slow rotation was peculiar to it, and that the planets did not form at the same time as the Sun.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Extensions of the model, together forming the Russian school, include Gurevich and Lebedinsky (in 1950), Safronov (in 1967,1969), Safronov and Vityazeff (in 1985), Safronov and Ruskol (in 1994), and Ruskol (in 1981), among others&lt;ref&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis was severely dented by [[Victor Safronov]] who showed that the amount of time required to form the planets from such a diffuse envelope would far exceed the Solar System's determined age.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

[[Raymond Arthur Lyttleton|Ray Lyttleton]] modified the theory by showing that a 3rd body was not necessary and proposing that a mechanism of line accretion described by Bondi and Hoyle in 1944 would enable cloud material to be captured by the star (Williams and Cremin, 1968, loc. cit.)

====Hoyle's hypothesis====
In this model&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; (from 1944) the companion went nova with ejected material captured by the Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova.  In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength would have to be 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. It was Alfvén who formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines.

====Kuiper's theory====
[[Gerard Kuiper]] (in 1944)&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; argued, like Ter Haar, that regular eddies would be impossible and postulated that large gravitational instabilities might occur in the solar nebula, forming condensations. In this, the solar nebula could be either co-genetic with the Sun or captured by it. Density distribution would determine what could form: either a planetary system or a stellar companion. The 2 types of planets were assumed to be due to the Roche limit. No explanation was offered for the Sun's slow rotation which Kuiper saw as a larger G-star problem.

====Whipple's theory====
In [[Fred Whipple]]'s 1948 scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; a smoke cloud about 60,000 AU in diameter and with 1 [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) contracts and produces the Sun. It has a negligible angular momentum thus accounting for the Sun's similar property. This smoke cloud captures a smaller one with a large angular momentum. The collapse time for the large smoke and gas nebula is about 100 million years and the rate is slow at first, increasing in later stages. The planets would condense from small clouds developed in, or captured by, the 2nd cloud, the orbits would be nearly circular because accretion would reduce eccentricity due to the influence of the resisting medium, orbital orientations would be similar because the small cloud was originally small and the motions would be in a common direction. The protoplanets might have heated up to such high degrees that the more volatile compounds would have been lost and the orbital velocity decreases with increasing distance so that the terrestrial planets would have been more affected. The weaknesses of this scenario are that practically all the final regularities are introduced as a priori assumptions and most of the hypothesizing was not supported by quantitative calculations. For these reasons it did not gain wide acceptance.

====Urey's model====
American chemist [[Harold Urey]], who founded cosmochemistry, put forward a scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; in 1951, 1952, 1956, and 1966 based largely on meteorites and using Chandrasekhar's stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. In order that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. In order to form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, Moon-size objects, gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable, would have to form in the disk with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions considerable ionization would be present and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun. He postulated that these lunar-size bodies were destroyed by collisions, with the gas dissipating, leaving behind solids collected at the core, with the resulting smaller fragments pushed far out into space and the larger fragments staying behind and accreting into planets. He suggested the Moon was just such a surviving core.

====Protoplanet theory====
In 1960, 1963, and 1978,&lt;ref&gt;McCrea, W. H.  1978.  The Formation of the Solar System: a Protoplanet Theory (Chp. 5). In: S.F. Dermot, Ed. Origin of the Solar System. John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William McCrea (astronomer)|W. H. McCrea]] proposed the ''protoplanet theory'', in which the Sun and planets individually coalesced from matter within the same cloud, with the smaller planets later captured by the Sun's larger gravity.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; It includes fission in a protoplanetary nebula and there is no solar nebula. Agglomerations of floccules (which are presumed to compose the supersonic turbulence assumed to occur in the interstellar material from which stars are born) formed the Sun and protoplanets, the latter splitting to form planets. The 2 portions can not remain gravitationally bound to each other,  are at a mass ratio of at least 8 to 1, and for inner planets they go into independent orbits while for outer planets one of the portions exits the Solar System. The inner protoplanets were Venus-Mercury and Earth-Mars. The moons of the greater planets were formed from "droplets" in the neck connecting the 2 portions of the dividing protoplanet and these droplets could account for some of the asteroids. Terrestrial planets would have no major moons which does not account for Luna.  It predicts certain observations such as the similar angular velocity of Mars and Earth with similar rotation periods and axial tilts. In this scheme there are 6 principal planets: 2 terrestrial, Venus and Earth, 2 major, Jupiter and Saturn, and 2 outer, Uranus and Neptune; and 3 lesser planets: Mercury, Mars, and Pluto.

This theory has a number of problems, such as explaining the fact that the planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction, which would appear highly unlikely if they were each individually captured.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

====Cameron's hypothesis====
In American astronomer [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]]'s hypothesis (from 1962 and 1963),&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; the protosun has a mass of about 1–2 Suns with a diameter of around 100,000 AU is gravitationally unstable, collapses, and breaks up into smaller subunits. The magnetic field is of the order of 1/100,000 gauss. During the collapse the magnetic lines of force are twisted. The collapse is fast and is done by the dissociation of H molecules followed by the ionization of H and the double ionization of He. Angular momentum leads to rotational instability which produces a Laplacean disk.  At this stage radiation will remove excess energy and the disk will be quite cool in a relatively short period (about 1 mln. yrs.) and the condensation into what Whipple calls cometismals takes place. Aggregation of these produces giant planets which in turn produce disks during their formation from which evolve into lunar systems. The formation of terrestrial planets, comets, and asteroids involved disintegration, heating, melting, solidification, etc. He also formulated the Big Splat or Giant Impactor Hypothesis for the origin of the Moon.

====Capture theory====
The ''capture theory'', proposed by [[Michael Woolfson|Michael Mark Woolfson]] in 1964, posits that the Solar System formed from [[Tidal force|tidal]] interactions between the Sun and a low-density [[protostar]]. The Sun's gravity would have drawn material from the diffuse atmosphere of the protostar, which would then have collapsed to form the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The capture theory and planetary condensation |author1=J. R. Dormand |author2=Michael Mark Woolfson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=307 |date=1971 |bibcode=1971MNRAS.151..307D |doi=10.1093/mnras/151.3.307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the capture theory predicts a different age for the Sun than for the planets,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} whereas the similar ages of the Sun and the rest of the Solar System indicate that they formed at roughly the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Weidenschilling, S. J. |author2=Spaute, D. |author3=Davis, D.

As captured planets would have initially eccentric orbits Dormand and Woolfson in 1974 and 1977 and Woolfson&lt;ref&gt;Woolfson, Michael Mark, "The Evolution of the solar system", in S. F. Dermot, Ed., ''Origin of the Solar System'', Wiley, New York (NY), 1978, pp.199–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the possibility of a collision.  A filament is thrown out by a passing proto-star which is captured by the Sun and planets form from it. In this there were 6 original planets, corresponding to 6 point-masses in the filament,  with planets A and B,  the 2 innermost, colliding, the former at twice the mass of Neptune, and ejecting out of the Solar System, and the latter at 1/3 the mass of Uranus, and splitting into Earth and Venus. Mars and the Moon are former moons of A. Mercury is either a fragment of B or an escaped moon of A. The collision also produced the asteroid belt and the comets.

T.J.J. See was an American astronomer and Navy Captain who at one time worked under Ellery Hale at the Lowell Observatory. He had a cult following largely because of his many (some 60) articles in ''Popular Astronomy'' but also in ''Astronomische Nachrichte'' (Astronomical News) (mostly in English). While at the USNO's Mare Island, Cal. station, he developed a model which he called capture theory, published in 1910, in his  "Researches on the Evolution of the Stellar Systems: v. 2. The capture theory of cosmical evolution, founded on dynamical principles and illustrated by phenomena observed in the spiral nebulae, the planetary system, the double and multiple stars and clusters and the star-clouds of the Milky Way",  which proposed that the planets formed in the outer Solar System and were captured by the Sun; the moons were formed in thus manner and were captured by the planets. This caused a feud with Forest Moulton, who co-developed the planetesimal hypothesis. A preview was presented in 1909 at a meeting of the ASP (Astronomical Society of the Pacific) at the Chabot Observatory in Oakland, Cal., and newspaper headlines blared "Prof. See's Paper Causes Sensation" (San Francisco Call) and "Scientists in Furore Over Nebulae" (San Francisco Examiner). Our current knowledge of dynamics makes capture most unlikely as it requires special conditions.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, T.J 1999"/&gt;

====Solar fission====
Swiss astronomer Louis Jacot (in 1951, 1962, 1981),&lt;ref&gt;Jacot, Louis. 1986. Heretical Cosmology (transl. of Science et bon sense, 1981). Exposition-Banner.&lt;/ref&gt; like Weisacker and Ter Haar, continued the Cartesian idea of vortices but proposed a hierarchy of vortices or vortices within vortices, i.e., a lunar system vortex, a Solar System vortex, and a galactic vortex.  He put forward the notion that planetary orbits are spirals, not circles or ellipses. Jacot also proposed the expansion of galaxies (stars move away from the hub),  and that moons move away from their planets.

He also maintained that planets were expelled, one at a time, from the Sun, specifically from an equatorial bulge caused by rotation, and that one of them shattered in this expulsion leaving the asteroid belt. The Kuiper Belt was unknown at the time, but presumably it, too, would be the result of the same kind of shattering. The moons, like the planets, originated as equatorial expulsions, but, of course,  from their parent planets, with some shattering, leaving the rings, and Earth is supposed to eventually expel another moon.

In this model there were 4 phases to the planets: no rotation and keeping the same side to the Sun "as Mercury does now" (we've known, of course, since 1965, that it doesn't),  very slow, accelerated, and finally, daily rotation.

He explained the differences between inner and outer planets and inner and outer moons through vortex behaviour. Mercury's eccentric orbit was explained by its recent expulsion from the Sun and Venus' slow rotation as its being in the "slow rotation phase", having been expelled second to last.

The [[Tom Van Flandern]] model&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, T. 1999. Dark Matter, Missing Planets, and New Comets. North Atlantic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, T. 2007. The challenge of the exploded planet hypothesis. Intl. J. Astrobiol. 6: 185- 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Flandern, T. 2008. Our Original Solar System-a 21st Century Perspective. MetaRes. Bull. 17: 2–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MetaResearch ({{cite web |url=http://www.metaresearch.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527164707/http://metaresearch.org/ |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was first proposed in 1993 in the first edition of his book. In the revised version from 1999 and later, the original Solar System had 6 pairs of twin planets each fissioned off from the equatorial bulges of an overspinning Sun (outward centrifugal forces exceed the inward gravitational force) at different times so having different temperatures, sizes, and compositions, and having condensed thereafter with the nebular disk dissipating after some 100 million years, with 6 planets exploding. Four of these were helium dominated, fluid, and unstable (helium class planets). These were V (Bellatrix) (V standing for the 5th planet, the first 4 including Mercury and Mars), K (Krypton), T (transneptunian), and Planet X. In these cases, the smaller moons exploded because of tidal stresses leaving the 4 component belts of the 2 major planetoid zones.  Planet LHB-A, the explosion for which is postulated to have caused the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] (about 4 eons ago), was twinned with Jupiter, and LHB-B, the explosion for which is postulated to have caused another LHB, was twinned with Saturn. In planets LHB-A, Jupiter, LHB-B, and Saturn,  being gigantic, Jovian planets, the inner and smaller partner in each pair was subjected to enormous tidal stresses causing it to blow up. The explosions took place before they were able to fission off moons. As the 6 were fluid they left no trace. Solid planets fission off only one moon and Mercury was a moon of Venus but drifted away because of the Sun's gravitational influence. Mars was a moon of Bellatrix.
	
One major argument against exploding planets and moons is that there would not be an energy source powerful enough to cause such explosions. 
====Herndon's model====
In [[J. Marvin Herndon]]'s model,&lt;ref&gt;
Herndon, J. Marvin. 2013. New indivisible planetary science paradigm. ''Current Science'' 105: 450–461 (nuclearplanet.com).
&lt;/ref&gt;
inner (large-core) planets form by condensation and raining-out from within giant gaseous protoplanets at high pressures and high temperatures. Earth's complete condensation included a c. 300 Earth-mass gas/ice shell that compressed the rocky kernel to about 66% of Earth's present diameter (Jupiter equates to about 300 Earth masses, which equals c. 2000 trillion trillion kg; Earth is at about 6 trillion trillion kg). T Tauri (see [[T Tauri type stars]]) eruptions of the Sun stripped the gases away from the inner planets. Mercury was incompletely condensed and a portion of its gases were stripped away and transported to the region between Mars and Jupiter, where it fused with in-falling oxidized condensate from the outer reaches of the Solar System and formed the parent material for ordinary chondrite meteorites, the Main-Belt asteroids, and veneer for the inner planets, especially Mars.  The differences between the inner planets are primarily the consequence of different degrees of protoplanetary compression. There are two types of responses to decompression-driven planetary volume increases: cracks, which form to increase surface area, and folding, creating mountain ranges,  to accommodate changes in curvature.

This planetary formation theory represents an extension of the Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics (WEDD) model,&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
which includes natural nuclear-fission reactors in planetary cores; Herndon elaborates, expounds, and elucidates it in 11 articles in ''Current Science'' from 2005 to 2013 and in five books published from 2008 to 2012. He refers to his model as "indivisible" – meaning that the fundamental aspects of Earth are connected logically and causally, and can be deduced from its early formation as a Jupiter-like giant.

In 1944 the German chemist and physicist [[Arnold Eucken]] considered the thermodynamics of Earth condensing and raining-out within a giant protoplanet at pressures of 100–1000 atm. In the 1950s and early 1960s discussion of planetary formation at such pressures took place, but Cameron's 1963 low-pressure (c. 4–10 atm.) model largely supplanted the idea.

====Classification of the theories====
Jeans, in 1931,  divided the various models into 2 groups: those where the material for planet formation came from the Sun and those where it didn't and may be concurrent or consecutive.&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. [http://ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 	
	
William McCrea, in 1963, divided them into 2 groups also: those that relate the formation of the planets to the formation of the Sun and those where it is independent of the formation of the Sun, where the planets form after the Sun becomes a normal star.&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"/&gt;

Ter Haar and Cameron&lt;ref&gt;Ter Haar, D. and Cameron, A.G.W. 1963. Historical Review of the Origin of the Solar System. In: Origin of the Solar System, Robert Jastrow and A. G. W. Cameron, eds., pp. 1–37. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished between those theories that consider a closed system, which is a development of the Sun and possibly a solar envelope, that starts with a protosun rather than the Sun itself, and state that Belot calls these theories monistic; and those that consider an open system, which is where there is an interaction between the Sun and some foreign body that is supposed to have been the first step in the developments leading to the planetary system, and state that Belot calls these theories dualistic.

Hervé Reeves' classification&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H. 1978. Origin of the Solar System. In: The Origin of the Solar System, S.F. Dermott, ed., pp. 1–18. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  also categorizes them as co-genetic with the Sun or not but also as formed from altered or unaltered stellar/interstellar material. He as well recognizes 4 groups:  1) models based on the solar nebula, originated by Swedenborg, Kant, and Laplace in the 1700s; 2) the ones proposing a cloud captured from interstellar space, major proponents being Alfvén and Gustaf Arrhenius (in 1978) and Alfvén and Arrhenius; 3) the binary hypotheses which propose that a sister star somehow disintegrated and a portion of its dissipating material was captured by the Sun, principal hypothesizer being Lyttleton in the '40s; 4) and the close-approach-filament ideas of Jeans, Jeffreys, and Woolfson and Dormand.

In Williams and Cremin&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"/&gt; the categories are: (1) models that regard the origin and formation of the planets as being essentially related to the Sun, with the 2 formation processes taking place concurrently or consecutively, (2) models that regard formation of the planets as being independent of the formation process of the Sun, the planets forming after the Sun becomes a normal star; this has 2 subcategories: a) where the material for the formation of the planets is extracted either from the Sun or another star, b) where the material is acquired from interstellar space. They conclude that the best models are Hoyle's magnetic coupling and McCrea's floccules.

Woolfson&lt;ref&gt;Woolfson, Michael Mark, ''The Origin and Evolution of the Solar System'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; recognized 1) monistic, which included Laplace, Descartes, Kant, and Weisacker, and 2) dualistc, which included Leclerc (comte de Buffon), Chamberlin-Moulton, Jeans, Jeffreys, and Schmidt-Lyttleton.

===Reemergence of the nebular hypothesis===
[[File:HST betaPictoris comb.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Beta Pictoris seen by the Hubble Space Telescope]]
In 1978, astronomer A. J. R. Prentice revived the Laplacian nebular model in his Modern Laplacian Theory by suggesting that the angular momentum problem could be resolved by drag created by dust grains in the original disc which slowed down the rotation in the centre.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Prentice, A.

First, a number of apparently young stars, such as [[Beta Pictoris]], were found to be surrounded by discs of cool dust, much as was predicted by the nebular hypothesis. Second, the [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]], launched in 1983, observed that many stars had an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared radiation]] that could be explained if they were orbited by discs of cooler material.

The refined nebular model was developed entirely on the basis of observations of the Solar System because it was the only one known until the mid-1990s.

The detailed features of the planets are another problem. The solar nebula hypothesis predicts that all planets will form exactly in the ecliptic plane. Instead, the orbits of the [[classical planets]] have various (but small) inclinations with respect to the ecliptic. Furthermore, for the gas giants it is predicted that their rotations and moon systems will also not be inclined with respect to the ecliptic plane. However, most gas giants have substantial axial tilts with respect to the ecliptic, with [[Uranus]] having a 98° tilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apl.ucl.ac.uk/iopw/uworkshop_060905.pdf|title=Uranus nears Equinox|author=Heidi B.

==Solar evolution hypotheses==
Attempts to isolate the physical source of the Sun's energy, and thus determine when and how it might ultimately run out, began in the 19th century. At that time, the prevailing scientific view on the source of the Sun's heat was that it was generated by [[gravitational contraction]]. In the 1840s, astronomers J. R. Mayer and J. J. Waterson first proposed that the Sun's massive weight causes it to collapse in on itself, generating heat, an idea expounded upon in 1854 by both [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Lord Kelvin]], who further elaborated on the idea by suggesting that heat may also be produced by the impact of meteors onto the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sun: A Biography|author=David Whitehouse|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-470-09296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Sun only has enough [[gravitational potential energy]] to power its [[luminosity]] by this mechanism for about 30&amp;nbsp;million years—far less than the age of the Earth. (This collapse time is known as the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Carl J. Hansen |author2=Steven D.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s development of the [[theory of relativity]] in 1905 led to the understanding that nuclear reactions could create new elements from smaller precursors, with the loss of energy. In his treatise ''Stars and Atoms'', [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested that pressures and temperatures within stars were great enough for hydrogen nuclei to fuse into helium; a process which could produce the massive amounts of energy required to power the Sun.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements might also form within stars.&lt;ref name=hoyle&gt;{{cite book|title=Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science|author=Simon Mitton|publisher=Aurum|date=2005|chapter=Origin of the Chemical Elements|pages=197–222|isbn=0-309-09313-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral evidence collected after 1945 showed that the distribution of the commonest chemical elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, iron etc., was fairly uniform across the galaxy. This suggested that these elements had a common origin.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt; A number of anomalies in the proportions hinted at an underlying mechanism for creation. Lead has a higher atomic weight than gold, but is far more common. Hydrogen and helium (elements 1 and 2) are virtually ubiquitous yet lithium and beryllium (elements 3 and 4) are extremely rare.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt;

===Red giants===
{{main|Red giant}}
While the unusual spectra of red giant stars had been known since the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=s process in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars|author1=Oscar Straniero |author2=Roberto Gallino |author3=Sergio Cristallo |journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=777 |date= 17 October 2006|pages= 311–339|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2005.01.011|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037594740500028X|arxiv = astro-ph/0501405 |bibcode = 2006NuPhA.777..311S }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[George Gamow]] who, in the 1940s, first understood that they were stars of roughly solar mass that had run out of hydrogen in their cores and had resorted to burning the hydrogen in their outer shells.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This allowed [[Martin Schwarzschild]] to draw the connection between red giants and the finite lifespans of stars. It is now understood that red giants are stars in the last stages of their life cycles.

[[Fred Hoyle]] noted that, even while the distribution of elements was fairly uniform, different stars had varying amounts of each element. To Hoyle, this indicated that they must have originated within the stars themselves. The abundance of elements peaked around the atomic number for iron, an element that could only have been formed under intense pressures and temperatures. Hoyle concluded that iron must have formed within giant stars.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt; From this, in 1945 and 1946, Hoyle constructed the final stages of a star's life cycle. As the star dies, it collapses under its own weight, leading to a stratified chain of fusion reactions: carbon-12 fuses with helium to form oxygen-16; oxygen-16 fuses with helium to produce neon-20, and so on up to iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fred Hoyle, Red Giants and beyond|author=J. Faulkner|bibcode=2003Ap&amp;SS.285..339F|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=285|issue=2|pages= 339–339|date=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1025432324828}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, no known method by which carbon-12 could be produced. Isotopes of beryllium produced via fusion were too unstable to form carbon, and for three helium atoms to form carbon-12 was so unlikely as to have been impossible over the age of the Universe. However, in 1952 the physicist [[Ed Salpeter]] showed that a short enough time existed between the formation and the decay of the beryllium isotope that another helium had a small chance to form carbon, but only if their combined mass/energy amounts were equal to that of carbon-12. Hoyle, employing the [[anthropic principle]], showed that it must be so, since he himself was made of carbon, and he existed. When the matter/energy level of carbon-12 was finally determined, it was found to be within a few percent of Hoyle's prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Bent Chains, and the Anthropic Principle|author=The Nuclear Physics Group|work=The University of Birmingham|url=http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm|accessdate=2008-04-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812061136/http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm |archivedate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White dwarfs===
{{main|White dwarf}}
The first white dwarf discovered was in the [[triple star system]] of [[40 Eridani]], which contains the relatively bright [[main sequence]] star [[40 Eridani A]], orbited at a distance by the closer [[binary star|binary system]] of the white dwarf [[40 Eridani B]] and the [[main sequence]] [[red dwarf]] [[40 Eridani C]]. The pair 40 Eridani B/C was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on January 31, 1783;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/106749 Catalogue of Double Stars], William Herschel, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' '''75''' (1785), pp. 40–126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;73&lt;/sup&gt; it was again observed by [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] in 1825 and by [[Otto Wilhelm von Struve]] in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926BAN.....3..128V The orbit and the masses of 40 Eridani BC], W. H. van den Bos, ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands'' '''3''', #98 (July 8, 1926), pp. 128–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974AJ.....79..819H Astrometric study of four visual binaries], W. D. Heintz, ''Astronomical Journal'' '''79''', #7 (July 1974), pp. 819–825.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1910, it was discovered by [[Henry Norris Russell]], [[Edward Charles Pickering]] and [[Williamina Paton Stevens Fleming|Williamina Fleming]] that despite being a dim star, 40 Eridani B was of [[stellar classification|spectral type]] A, or white.&lt;ref name="holberg"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AAS...20720501H How Degenerate Stars Came to be Known as White Dwarfs], J. B. Holberg, ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society'' '''37''' (December 2005), p. 1503.&lt;/ref&gt;

White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery. If a star is in a [[binary star|binary]] system, as is the case for Sirius B and 40 Eridani B, it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit. This was done for Sirius B by 1910,&lt;ref&gt;''Preliminary General Catalogue'', L. Boss, Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Institution, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; yielding a mass estimate of {{Solar mass|0.94|link=y}}.  (A more modern estimate is {{Solar mass|1.00}}.)&lt;ref name="apj_630"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/w2005ApJ...630L..69L The Age and Progenitor Mass of Sirius B], James Liebert, Patrick A. Young, David Arnett, J. B. Holberg, and Kurtis A. Williams, ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''630''', #1 (September 2005), pp. L69–L72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since hotter bodies radiate more than colder ones, a star's surface brightness can be estimated from its [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]], and hence from its [[spectrum]]. If the star's distance is known, its overall luminosity can also be estimated. Comparison of the two figures yields the star's radius. Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius B and 40 Eridani B must be very dense. For example, when [[Ernst Öpik]] estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the [[Sun]]'s, which was so high that he called it "impossible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916ApJ....44..292O The Densities of Visual Binary Stars], E. Öpik, ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''44''' (December 1916), pp. 292–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such densities are possible because white dwarf material is not composed of [[atom]]s bound by [[chemical bond]]s, but rather consists of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of unbound [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[electron]]s. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer to each other than [[atomic orbital|electron orbital]]s—the regions occupied by electrons bound to an atom—would normally allow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924MNRAS..84..308E On the relation between the masses and luminosities of the stars], A. S. Eddington, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''84''' (March 1924), pp. 308–332.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddington, however, wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy which kept the atoms ionized was no longer present.&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926MNRAS..87..114F On Dense Matter], R. H. Fowler, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''87''' (1926), pp. 114–122.&lt;/ref&gt;  This paradox was resolved by [[R. H. Fowler]] in 1926 by an application of the newly devised [[quantum mechanics]]. Since electrons obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no two electrons can occupy the same [[quantum state|state]], and they must obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2990270 The Development of the Quantum Mechanical Electron Theory of Metals: 1900–28], Lillian H. Hoddeson and G. Baym, ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences'' '''371''', #1744 (June 10, 1980), pp. 8–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  At zero temperature, therefore, electrons could not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ''[[ground state|ground]]'', state; some of them had to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the ''[[Fermi sea]]''. This state of the electrons, called ''[[degenerate matter|degenerate]]'', meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.

===Planetary nebulae===
{{main|Planetary nebula}}
&lt;!---[[File:NGC7293 (2004).jpg|thumb|150px|left|NGC 7293, [[Helix Nebula]]]]---&gt;
Planetary nebulae are generally faint objects, and none are visible to the [[naked eye]]. The first planetary nebula discovered was the [[Dumbbell Nebula]] in the constellation of [[Vulpecula]], observed by [[Charles Messier]] in 1764 and listed as M27 in his [[Messier object|catalogue]] of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae somewhat resembled the gas giants, and [[William Herschel]], discoverer of [[Uranus]], eventually coined the term 'planetary nebula' for them, although, as we now know, they are very different from planets.

The central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot. Their [[luminosity]], though, is very low, implying that they must be very small. Only once a star has exhausted all its nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size, and so planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding, and so the idea arose that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.

==Lunar origins hypotheses==
{{main|Geology of the Moon#Formation}}
[[File:George Darwin sepia tone.jpg|thumb|George Darwin]]
Over the centuries, many scientific hypotheses have been advanced concerning the origin of [[Moon|Earth's Moon]]. One of the earliest was the so-called ''[[Geology of the Moon#Co-accretion hypothesis|binary accretion model]]'', which concluded that the Moon accreted from material in orbit around the Earth left over from its formation. Another, the ''[[Geology of the Moon#Fission hypothesis|fission model]]'', was developed by [[George Darwin]] (son of [[Charles Darwin]]), who noted that, as the Moon is gradually receding from the Earth at a rate of about 4&amp;nbsp;cm per year, so at one point in the distant past it must have been part of the Earth, but was flung outward by the momentum of Earth's then–much faster rotation. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the Moon's density, while less than Earth's, is about equal to that of Earth's rocky [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], suggesting that, unlike the Earth, it lacks a dense iron core. A third hypothesis, known as the ''[[lunar capture|capture model]]'', suggested that the Moon was an independently orbiting body that had been snared into orbit by Earth's gravity.&lt;ref name=moon&gt;{{cite book|title=The Once and Future Moon|author=Paul D. Spudis|chapter=Whence the Moon?|pages=157–169|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|date=1996|isbn=0-522-84826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Apollo'' missions===
However, these hypotheses were all refuted by the late 1960s and early 1970s ''[[Apollo program|Apollo]]'' lunar missions, which introduced a stream of new scientific evidence; specifically concerning the Moon's composition, its age, and its history. These lines of evidence contradict many predictions made by these earlier models.&lt;ref name=moon /&gt; The rocks brought back from the Moon showed a marked decrease in water relative to rocks elsewhere in the Solar System, and also evidence of an ocean of magma early in its history, indicating that its formation must have produced a great deal of energy. Also, oxygen [[isotope]]s in lunar rocks showed a marked similarity to those on Earth, suggesting that they formed at a similar location in the solar nebula. The capture model fails to explain the similarity in these isotopes (if the Moon had originated in another part of the Solar System, those isotopes would have been different), while the co-accretion model cannot adequately explain the loss of water (if the Moon formed in a similar fashion to the Earth, the amount of water trapped in its mineral structure would also be roughly similar). Conversely, the fission model, while it can account for the similarity in chemical composition and the lack of iron in the Moon, cannot adequately explain its high orbital inclination and, in particular, the large amount of angular momentum in the Earth–Moon system, more than any other planet–satellite pair in the Solar System.&lt;ref name=moon /&gt;

===Giant impact hypothesis===
{{main|Giant impact hypothesis}}
For many years after ''Apollo'', the binary accretion model was settled on as the best hypothesis for explaining the Moon's origins, even though it was known to be flawed. Then, at a conference in Kona, Hawaii in 1984, a compromise model was composed that accounted for all of the observed discrepancies. Originally formulated by two independent research groups in 1976, the ''giant impact'' model supposed that a massive planetary object, the size of Mars, had collided with Earth early in its history. The impact would have melted Earth's crust, and the other planet's heavy core would have sunk inward and merged with Earth's. The superheated vapour produced by the impact would have risen into orbit around the planet, coalescing into the Moon. This explained the lack of water (the vapour cloud was too hot for water to condense), the similarity in composition (since the Moon had formed from part of the Earth), the lower density (since the Moon had formed from the Earth's crust and mantle, rather than its core), and the Moon's unusual orbit (since an oblique strike would have imparted a massive amount of angular momentum to the Earth–Moon system).&lt;ref name=moon /&gt;

===Outstanding issues===
However, the giant impact model has been criticised for being too explanatory; it can be expanded to explain any future discoveries and as such, is unfalsifiable. Also, many claim that much of the material from the impactor would have ended up in the Moon, meaning that the isotope levels would be different, but they are not. Also, while some volatile compounds such as water are absent from the Moon's crust, many others, such as manganese, are not.&lt;ref name=moon/&gt;

===Other natural satellites===
While the co-accretion and capture models are not currently accepted as valid explanations for the existence of the Moon, they have been employed to explain the formation of other natural satellites in the Solar System.

== History of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs ==
Approximately 78% of earth's atmosphere is N gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is an inert compound and biologically unavailable to most organisms. In order to be utilized in most biological processes, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be converted to reactive N (Nr), which includes inorganic reduced forms (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), inorganic oxidized forms (NO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and organic compounds ([[urea]], [[amine]]s, and [[protein]]s).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a strong triple bond, and so a significant amount of energy (226 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) is required to convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Nr.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Prior to industrial processes, the only sources of such energy were solar radiation and electrical discharges.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Utilizing a large amount of metabolic energy and the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], some [[bacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]] convert atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a process known as biological [[nitrogen fixation]] (BNF).&lt;ref name="Schles"&gt;Schlesinger, W. H. 1997. ''Biogeochemistry : An analysis of global change'', San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropogenic analogue to BNF is the [[Haber-Bosch]] process, in which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reacted with atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at high temperatures and pressures to produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=smil&gt;Smil, V. 2001. ''Enriching the earth : Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the transformation of world food production''. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted to NO by energy from [[lightning]], which is negligible in current temperate ecosystems, or by [[fossil fuel]] combustion.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

Until 1850, natural BNF, cultivation-induced BNF (e.g., planting of [[leguminous]] crops), and incorporated organic matter were the only sources of N for agricultural production.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; Near the turn of the century, Nr from [[guano]] and [[sodium nitrate]] deposits was harvested and exported from the arid Pacific islands and South American deserts.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; By the late 1920s, early industrial processes, albeit inefficient, were commonly used to produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Due to the efforts of [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]], the Haber-Bosch process became the largest source of nitrogenous fertilizer after the 1950s, and replaced BNF as the dominant source of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; From 1890 to 1990, anthropogenically created Nr increased almost ninefold.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; During this time, the human population more than tripled, partly due to increased food production.

Since the [[industrial revolution]], an additional source of anthropogenic N input has been [[fossil fuel]] combustion, which is used to generate energy (e.g., to power automobiles). During combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, high temperatures and pressures provide energy to produce NO from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Additionally, when [[fossil fuel]] is extracted and burned, fossil N may become reactive (i.e., NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; During the 1970s, scientists began to recognize that N inputs were accumulating in the environment and affecting ecosystems.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

== Impacts of anthropogenic inputs on the nitrogen cycle ==
Between 1600 and 1990, global reactive nitrogen (Nr) creation had increased nearly 50%.&lt;ref name=gallocowl&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0064:RNATWY]2.0.CO;2|year=2002|volume=31|pages=64|title=Reactive Nitrogen and the World: 200 Years of Change|last1=Galloway|first1=James N.|last2=Cowling|first2=Ellis B.|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, atmospheric emissions of Nr species reportedly increased 250% and deposition to marine and terrestrial ecosystems increased over 200%.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; Additionally, there was a reported fourfold increase in riverine dissolved inorganic N fluxes to coasts.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; Nitrogen is a critical limiting nutrient in many systems, including forests, wetlands, and coastal and marine ecosystems; therefore, this change in emissions and distribution of Nr has resulted in substantial consequences for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitousek | first1 = P. | last2 = Howarth | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1007/BF00002772 | title = Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: How can it occur? | journal = Biogeochemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | year = 1991 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raba"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0102:NIAE]2.0.CO;2|year=2002|volume=31|pages=102|title=Nitrogen in Aquatic Ecosystems|last1=Rabalais|first1=Nancy N.|authorlink1=Nancy Rabalais|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
Atmospheric N inputs mainly include oxides of N (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems,&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; from [[fossil fuel]] and biomass combustion.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

In [[agroecosystem]]s, fertilizer application has increased microbial [[nitrification]] (aerobic process in which microorganisms oxidize ammonium [NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] to nitrate [NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]) and [[denitrification]] (anaerobic process in which microorganisms reduce NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to atmospheric nitrogen gas [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]). Both processes naturally leak nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; Of particular concern is N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which has an average atmospheric lifetime of 114–120 years,&lt;ref&gt;[[John T. Houghton]], Y. Ding, D. J. Griggs, M. Noguer, P. J. van der Linden, X. Dai, K. Maskell, and C. A. Johnson. 2001. ''IPCC Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

[[global climate change]]; 5) decreased agricultural productivity due to [[ozone]] deposition; and 6) ecosystem acidification&lt;ref name=houdijk&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Houdijk | first1 = A. L.

===Biosphere===

Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems receive Nr inputs from the atmosphere through wet and dry deposition.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Atmospheric Nr species can be deposited to ecosystems in precipitation (e.g., NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, organic N compounds), as gases (e.g., NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and gaseous nitric acid [HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]), or as aerosols (e.g., ammonium nitrate [NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Aquatic ecosystems receive additional nitrogen from [[surface runoff]] and [[river]]ine inputs.&lt;ref name="raba"/&gt;
 
Increased N deposition can acidify soils, streams, and lakes and alter forest and grassland productivity. In grassland ecosystems, N inputs have produced initial increases in productivity followed by declines as critical thresholds are exceeded.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Nitrogen effects on [[biodiversity]], [[carbon cycling]], and changes in species composition have also been demonstrated. In highly developed areas of near shore coastal ocean and estuarine systems, rivers deliver direct (e.g., [[surface runoff]]) and indirect (e.g., groundwater contamination) N inputs from agroecosystems.&lt;ref name="raba"/&gt; Increased N inputs can result in [[freshwater acidification]] and [[eutrophication]] of marine waters.

====Terrestrial ecosystems====

=====Impacts on productivity and nutrient cycling=====

Much of terrestrial growth in temperate systems is limited by N; therefore, N inputs (i.e., through deposition and fertilization) can increase N availability, which temporarily increases N uptake, plant and microbial growth, and N accumulation in plant biomass and [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=aber89&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1311067 Aber, J.

''Bioscience'' 39:378–386]&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of greater amounts of N in organic matter decreases C:N ratios, increasing mineral N release (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) during organic matter decomposition by heterotrophic [[microbe]]s (i.e., [[ammonification]]).&lt;ref name=aber92&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aber | first1 = J.

NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, the product of nitrification, is highly mobile and can be leached from the soil, along with positively charged alkaline minerals such as calcium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; In acid soils, mobilized aluminium ions can reach toxic concentrations, negatively affecting both terrestrial and adjacent aquatic ecosystems.

Anthropogenic sources of N generally reach upland forests through [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1314369|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0375:INDATN]2.0.CO;2|year=2003|volume=53|pages=375|title=Is Nitrogen Deposition Altering the Nitrogen Status of Northeastern Forests?|last1=Aber|first1=John D.|last2=Goodale|first2=Christine L.|last3=Ollinger|first3=Scott V.|last4=Smith|first4=Marie-Louise|last5=Magill|first5=Alison H.|last6=Martin|first6=Mary E.|last7=Hallett|first7=Richard A.|last8=Stoddard|first8=John L.|journal=BioScience|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential concern of increased N deposition due to human activities is altered [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] in forest ecosystems.

However, ecosystem responses to N additions are contingent upon many site-specific factors including climate, land-use history, and amount of N additions. For example, in the Northeastern United States, hardwood stands receiving chronic N inputs have demonstrated greater capacity to retain N and increase annual net primary productivity (ANPP) than conifer stands.&lt;ref name=magill&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Magill | first1 = A.

When available N exceeds the ecosystem's (i.e., vegetation, soil, and [[microbe]]s, etc.) uptake capacity, N [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] occurs and excess N is lost to surface waters, groundwater, and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=aber89/&gt;&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt;&lt;ref name=magill/&gt; N saturation can result in nutrient imbalances (e.g., loss of calcium due to nitrate leaching) and possible forest decline.&lt;ref name=aber92/&gt;

A 15-year study of chronic N additions at the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research ([[LTER]]) program has elucidated many impacts of increased nitrogen deposition on nutrient cycling in temperate forests. It found that chronic N additions resulted in greater leaching losses, increased pine mortality, and cessation of biomass accumulation.&lt;ref name=magill/&gt; Another study reported that chronic N additions resulted in accumulation of non-photosynthetic N and subsequently reduced photosynthetic capacity, supposedly leading to severe carbon stress and mortality.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt; These findings negate previous hypotheses that increased N inputs would increase NPP and [[carbon sequestration]].

=====Impacts on plant species diversity=====

Many plant communities have evolved under low nutrient conditions; therefore, increased N inputs can alter biotic and abiotic interactions, leading to changes in community composition. Several nutrient addition studies have shown that increased N inputs lead to dominance of fast-growing plant species, with associated declines in species richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Laura Foster Huenneke |author2=Steven P.

In a more recent experimental study of N fertilization and disturbance (i.e., tillage) in old field succession, it was found that species richness decreased with increasing N, regardless of disturbance level. Competition experiments showed that competitive dominants excluded competitively inferior species between disturbance events. With increased N inputs, competition shifted from belowground to aboveground (i.e., to competition for light), and patch colonization rates significantly decreased. These internal changes can dramatically affect the community by shifting the balance of competition-colonization tradeoffs between species.&lt;ref name=wiltil/&gt; In patch-based systems, regional coexistence can occur through tradeoffs in competitive and colonizing abilities given sufficiently high disturbance rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hastings | first1 = A. | title = Disturbance, coexistence, history, and competition for space | doi = 10.1016/0040-5809(80)90059-3 | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 363–373 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, with inverse ranking of competitive and colonizing abilities, plants can coexist in space and time as disturbance removes superior competitors from patches, allowing for establishment of superior colonizers. However, as demonstrated by Wilson and Tilman, increased nutrient inputs can negate tradeoffs, resulting in competitive exclusion of these superior colonizers/poor competitors.&lt;ref name=wiltil/&gt;

====Aquatic ecosystems====

Aquatic ecosystems also exhibit varied responses to nitrogen enrichment. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; loading from N saturated, terrestrial ecosystems can lead to [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] of downstream freshwater systems and [[eutrophication]] of downstream marine systems. [[Freshwater acidification]] can cause aluminium toxicity and mortality of pH-sensitive fish species. Because marine systems are generally nitrogen-limited, [[Nutrient pollution|excessive N inputs]] can result in water quality degradation due to toxic algal blooms, oxygen deficiency, habitat loss, decreases in [[biodiversity]], and fishery losses.&lt;ref name=raba/&gt;

=====Acidification of freshwaters=====

Atmospheric N deposition in terrestrial landscapes can be transformed through soil microbial processes to biologically available nitrogen, which can result in surface-water [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]], and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]]. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; inputs from terrestrial systems and the atmosphere can acidify freshwater systems when there is little buffering capacity due to [[soil acidification]].&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; N pollution in Europe, the Northeastern United States, and Asia is a current concern for [[freshwater acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings%5CBioSci.51.180.198.pdf Driscoll, C.

''Acidic Deposition in the Northeastern United States: Sources and Inputs, Ecosystem Effects, and Management Strategies''. pp. 180-198]&lt;/ref&gt; Lake acidification studies in the Experimental Lake Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario clearly demonstrated the negative effects of increased acidity on a native fish species: lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) recruitment and growth dramatically decreased due to extirpation of its key prey species during acidification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mills | first1 = K.

=====Eutrophication of marine systems=====

Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers.&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; Increased nutrient inputs to marine systems have shown both short-term increases in productivity and fishery yields, and long-term detrimental effects of [[eutrophication]]. Tripling of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; loads in the Mississippi River in the last half of the 20th century have been correlated with increased fishery yields in waters surrounding the Mississippi delta;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1577/1548-8446(2001)026&lt;0017:FPATMR&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=2001|volume=26|pages=17-26|title=Fishery Production and the Mississippi River Discharge|last1=Grimes|first1=Churchill B.|journal=Fisheries|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, these nutrient inputs have produced seasonal [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (oxygen concentrations less than 2–3&amp;nbsp;mg L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, "[[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]s") in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; In estuarine and coastal systems, high nutrient inputs increase primary production (e.g., [[phytoplankton]], sea grasses, macroalgae), which increase [[turbidity]] with resulting decreases in light penetration throughout the water column. Consequently, submerged vegetation growth declines, which reduces habitat complexity and oxygen production. The increased primary (i.e., phytoplankton, macroalgae, etc.) production leads to a flux of carbon to bottom waters when decaying organic matter (i.e., senescent primary production) sinks and is consumed by aerobic bacteria lower in the water column. As a result, oxygen consumption in bottom waters is greater than diffusion of oxygen from surface waters. Additionally, certain algal blooms termed harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce toxins that can act as neuromuscular or organ damaging compounds. These algal blooms can be harmful to other marine life as well as to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skulberg|first=Olav M.|last2=Codd|first2=Geoffrey A.|last3=Carmichael|first3=Wayne W.|date=1984-01-01|title=Toxic Blue-Green Algal Blooms in Europe: A Growing Problem|jstor=4313034|journal=Ambio|volume=13|issue=4|pages=244–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=V.H.|last2=Tilman|first2=G.D.|last3=Nekola|first3=J.C.|title=Eutrophication: impacts of excess nutrient inputs on freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=100|issue=1–3|pages=179–196|doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(99)00091-3|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration ==
The above system responses to reactive nitrogen (Nr) inputs are almost all exclusively studied separately; however, research increasingly indicates that nitrogen loading problems are linked by multiple pathways transporting nutrients across system boundaries.&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt; This sequential transfer between ecosystems is termed the nitrogen cascade.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; ([http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050802102955/http://www.unep.org/GEO/yearbook/yb2003/089.htm see illustration from United Nations Environment Programme]). During the cascade, some systems accumulate Nr, which results in a time lag in the cascade and enhanced effects of Nr on the environment in which it accumulates. Ultimately, anthropogenic inputs of Nr are either accumulated or denitrified; however, little progress has been made in determining the relative importance of Nr accumulation and [[denitrification]], which has been mainly due to a lack of integration among scientific disciplines.&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=davseit&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = E.

Most Nr applied to global [[agroecosystem]]s cascades through the atmosphere and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems until it is converted to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, primarily through [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt; Although terrestrial [[denitrification]] produces gaseous intermediates (nitric oxide [NO] and nitrous oxide [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]), the last step—microbial production of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;— is critical because atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a sink for Nr.&lt;ref name=davseit/&gt; Many studies have clearly demonstrated that managed buffer strips and wetlands can remove significant amounts of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) from agricultural systems through [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name="Jackson2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = R.

In fact, due to long-term impacts on food webs, Nr inputs are widely considered the most critical pollution problem in marine systems.&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; In both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, responses to N enrichment vary; however, a general re-occurring theme is the importance of thresholds (e.g., nitrogen [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]]) in system nutrient retention capacity. In order to control the N cascade, there must be integration of scientific disciplines and further work on Nr storage and [[denitrification]] rates.&lt;ref name=davseit/&gt;

==Notes==
* '''Uranium''': The symbol for Uranium is sometimes given as Ur instead of U. According to Ulrich Schmidt&lt;ref name="Schmidt03"/&gt; and others, plants' concentration of uranium is considerably increased by an application of [[citric acid]], which solubilizes the uranium (and other metals).
* '''Radionuclides''': Cs-137 and Sr-90 are not removed from the top 0.4 meters of soil even under high rainfall, and migration rate from the top few centimeters of soil is slow.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/h68009j27515440m/] J.A. Entry, N.C. Vance, M.A. Hamilton, D. Zabowski, L.S. Watrud, D.C. Adriano. ''Phytoremediation of soil contaminated with low concentrations of radionuclides.'' Water, Air, and Soil Pollution, 1996. 88: 167-176. Cited in Westhoff99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': Plants with mycorrhizal associations are often more effective than non-mycorrhizal plants at the uptake of radionuclides.&lt;ref name= "Entry94"&gt;J.A. Entry, P. T.

Cited in Westhoff99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': In general, soils containing higher amounts of organic matter will allow plants to accumulate higher amounts of radionuclides.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"/&gt; See also note on ''Lolium multiflorum'' in Paasikallio 1984.&lt;ref name="Paasikallio84"/&gt; Plant uptake is also increased with a higher cation exchange capacity for Sr-90 availability, and a lower base saturation for uptake of both Sr-90 and Cs-137.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"/&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': Fertilizing the soil with nitrogen if needed will indirectly increase the take-up of radionuclides by generally boosting the plant's overall growth and more specifically roots' growth. But some fertilizers such as K or Ca compete with the radionuclides for cation exchange sites, and will not increase the take-up of radionuclides.&lt;ref name= "Entry96"/&gt;
* '''Radionuclides''': Zhu and Smolders, lab test:&lt;ref name="Zhu00"&gt;[http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/51/351/1635] Y-G. Zhu and E. Smolders, ''Plant uptake of radiocaesium: a review of mechanisms, regulation and application.'' Journal of Experimental Botany, Vol. 51, No. 351, pp. 1635-1645, October 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Cs uptake is mostly influenced by K supply. The uptake of radiocaesium depends mainly on two transport pathways on plant root cell membranes: the K+ transporter and the K+ channel pathway. Cs is likely transported by the K+ transport system. When external concentration of K is limited to low levels, le K+ transporter shows little discrimination against Cs+; if K supply is high, the K+ channel is dominant and shows high discrimination against Cs+. Caesium is very mobile within the plant, but the ratio Cs/K is not uniform within the plant. Phytoremediation as a possible option for the decontamination of caesium-contaminated soils is limited mainly by that it takes tens of years and creates large volumes of waste.

Broadley and N.J. Willey. ''Differences in root uptake of radiocaesium by 30 plant taxa''. Environmental Pollution 1997, Volume 97, Issues 1-2, Pages 11-15&lt;/ref&gt; find that across 30 taxa studied, ''Gramineae'' and ''Chenopodiaceae'' show the strongest correlation between Rb (K) and Cs concentration. The fast-growing ''Chenopodiaceae'' discriminate approx. 9 times less between Rb and Cs than the slow-growing''Gramineae'', and this correlate with highest and lowest concentrations achieved respectively.
* '''Caesium''': In Chernobyl-derived radioactivity, the amount of contamination is dependent on the roughness of bark, absolute bark surface and the existence of leaves during the deposition. The major contamination of the shoots is from direct deposition on the trees.&lt;ref name="EZ91"/&gt;

'''Irrumatio''' is a form of oral sex where a man [[pelvic thrust|thrusts]] his [[penis]] into someone else's mouth, in contrast to ''fellatio'' where the penis is being actively orally excited by a fellator. The difference lies mainly in which party takes the active part. By extension, ''irrumatio'' can also refer to the sexual technique of thrusting the penis between the thighs of a partner ([[intercrural sex]]), or between the [[abdomen|abdomens]] of two men.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/irrumatio|title=irrumatio in Sex-Lexis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Latin erotic terminology actually distinguishes two acts. First, ''fellation'', in which the man’s penis is orally excited by the fellator. Second, ''irrumation'', in which the man (the irrumator)&amp;nbsp;... engages in motions by moving his hips and body in a rhythm of his own choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=G.|first=Legman|title=[[Oragenitalism]]: Oral Techniques in Genital Excitation|publisher=The Julian Press|year=1969|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Latin]] synonym for "irrumator" is ''labda'' (Varr. ap. Non. 70,11; Aus. Epigr. 126).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis &amp; Charles Short : ''A Latin Dictionary''. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press. (s.v {{Clarify|date=December 2012}} "2. labda").&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|ancient Roman sexual vocabulary]], ''irrumatio'' is strictly a form of [[oral rape]] (''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|os impurum]]''), in which a man forces his penis into someone else's mouth, almost always that of another man.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "The Meaning of irrumare in Catullus and Martial", Classical Philology 76.1 (1981) 40–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and history ==
{{originalresearch|section|date=May 2016}}
The [[English language|English]] noun ''irrumatio'' or ''irrumation'' and verb ''irrumate'' come from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|irrumare}}'', to force receptive male oral sex.&lt;ref name="Whitaker irrumare"&gt;[http://archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=irrumatio Whitaker's Words: irrumatio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=269544|title=Richlin, A.  1981.

Hooper's edition of ''The Priapus Poems'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2000/2000-02-23.html|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2000.02.23|last=James L. Butrica|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[text corpus|corpus]] of poems known as ''[[Priapeia]]'' in Latin, states that "some [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sexual practices, like ''irrumatio'', lack simple English equivalents".&lt;ref name="."&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard W. Hooper (ed. {{Clarify|date=December 2012}})|title=The Priapus Poems|publisher=Urbana and Chicago, IL, University of Illinois Press|year=1999|isbn=0-252-06752-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some conjecture among linguists, as yet unresolved, that ''irrŭmātio'' may be connected with the Latin word ''rūmen, rūminis'', the throat and gullet, whence 'ruminate', to chew the cud, therefore meaning 'insertion into the throat'. Others&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1982), ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; connect it with ''rūma'' or ''rūmis'', an obsolete word for a teat, hence it would mean "giving milk", "giving to suck". (Compare the word ''fellō'', which literally meant "suck (milk)" before it acquired its sexual sense.)

As the [[quotation]] from Butrica suggests and an article by W.&amp;nbsp;A. Krenkel shows, ''irrumatio'' was a distinct sexual practice in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krenkel, W.&amp;nbsp;A.|title="Fellatio and Irrumatio" in W.&amp;nbsp;Bernard and C.&amp;nbsp;Reitz (eds.).

N. Adams states that "it was a standard joke to speak of ''irrumatio'' as a means of silencing someone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams, J.&amp;nbsp;N.|title=''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary''|publisher=Baltimore|year=1982|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|Oral sex]] was considered to be an act of defilement: the mouth had a particularly defined role as the organ of oratory, as in [[Greece]], to participate in the central public sphere, where discursive powers were of great importance. Thus, to penetrate the mouth could be taken to be a sign of massive power differential within a relationship. [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Erotic art from Pompeii]] depicts ''irrumatio'' along with ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male–female sex|fututio]]'', [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Cunnilingus and fellatio|fellatio and cunnilingus]], and ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|pedicatio]]'' or anal sex.&lt;ref name="Pomp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusarticle.com/children/article349.htm |title=Roman Sex ?C Hot Sex from the Frescos in Pompeii |last=Tarkovsky, S. |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094859/http://www.focusarticle.com/children/article349.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extant wall paintings depicting explicit sex often appear to be in bathhouses and brothels, and oral sex was something usually practiced with [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]] because of their lowly status.
Craig A. Williams argues that ''irrumatio'' was regarded as a degrading act, even more so than anal rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams, C.&amp;nbsp;A.|title=''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity''|publisher=Oxford:  Oxford University Press:|year=1999|pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.&amp;nbsp;Tarkovsky states that, despite being popular, it was thought to be a hostile act, "taken directly from the Greek, whereby the Greek men would have to force the fellatio by violence".&lt;ref name="Pomp"/&gt; Furthermore, as A.&amp;nbsp;Richlin has shown in an article in the ''[[Journal of the History of Sexuality]]'', it was also accepted as "oral [[rape]]", a [[punitive]] act against [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3704392|title=Preview of "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the Cinaedus and the Roman Law against Love between Men"|pages=523–573|last1=Richlin|first1=A.|volume=3|issue=4|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catullus]] threatens two friends who have insulted him with both ''irrumatio'' and ''pedicatio'' in his [[Catullus 16|''Carmen'' 16]], although the use could also mean "go to hell," rather than being a literal threat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Micaela Wakil Janan|title=When the Lamp Is Shattered: Desire and Narrative in Catullus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gG9Zcc6aeUC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=26 May 2016|date=18 January 1994|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-1765-3|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English, the term "fellatio" has expanded to incorporate ''irrumatio'', and the latter has fallen out of widespread use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/fellatio|title="Fellatio" in Sex-Lewis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''irrumatio'' might today be called "forced fellatio" or "oral rape". The concept remains in more vulgar expressions like ''face-fuck'' and ''skull-fuck''.

Another synonym for ''irrumatio'' is ''Egyptian rape'' or simply ''Egyptian''; this goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E.

'''Johann Jakob Wettstein''' (also '''Wetstein'''; 5 March 1693 – 23 March 1754) was a Protestant Swiss theologian, best known as a [[New Testament]] critic.

==Biography==

===Youth and study===
Johann Jakob Wettstein was born in [[Basel]]. Among his tutors in theology was [[Samuel Werenfels]] (1657–1740), an influential anticipator of modern critical [[exegesis]]. While still a student, Wettstein began to direct his attention to the special pursuit of his life, the text of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[New Testament]]. A relative, Johann Wettstein, who was the university librarian, gave him permission to examine and collate the principal [[manuscript]]s of the New Testament in the library, and he copied the various readings which they contained into his copy of [[Gerard of Maastricht]]'s edition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] text.

In 1713 in his public examination he defended a dissertation entitled ''De variis Novi Testamenti lectionibus'', and sought to show that variety of readings did not detract from the authority of the Bible. Wettstein paid great attention also to [[Aramaic]] and [[Talmud]]ic Hebrew. In the spring of 1714 he undertook an academic tour, which led him to Paris and England, the great object of his inquiry everywhere being to examine manuscripts of the New Testament. In 1716 he made the acquaintance of [[Richard Bentley]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]; Bentley took great interest in his work and persuaded him to return to Paris to collate carefully the ''Codex Ephraemi'', Bentley having then in view a critical edition of the New Testament.

===Basel===
In July 1717 Wettstein returned to take the office of a minister at large (''diaconus communis'') at Basel, a post which he held for three years, after which he became his father's colleague and successor in the parish of St Leonard's. At the same time he pursued his favourite study, and gave private lectures on New Testament [[exegesis]]. It was then that he decided to prepare a [[textual criticism|critical edition]] of the [[Textus Receptus]] (Greek New Testament}. He had in the meantime broken with Bentley, whose famous ''Proposals'' appeared in 1720. His earlier teachers, however, [[J. C. Iselin]] and [[J. L. Frey]], who were engaged upon work similar to his own, became so unfriendly towards him that after a time he was forbidden any further use of the manuscripts in the library.

A rumour began to be circulated that Wettstein's projected text would take the [[Socinian]] side in the case of such passages as [[First Epistle to Timothy|i Timothy]] iii. 16;&lt;ref&gt;See [[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in other ways (e.g. by regarding Jesus's temptation as a subjective experience, and by explaining some of the miracles in a naturalistic way) he began to be suspected of [[heresy]]. At length in 1729 the charge of projecting an edition of the Greek Testament savouring of [[Arianism|Arian]] and Socinian views was formally laid against him. The end of the long and unedifying trial was his dismissal, on 13 May 1730, from his office of minister of St Leonard's.

===Amsterdam===
He then moved from Basel to [[Amsterdam]], where another relative, [[Johann Heinrich Wettstein]] (1649–1726), had an important printing and publishing business. Here excellent editions of the classics were being published, as well as Gerard of Maastricht's edition of the Greek Testament. Wettstein had begun to print an edition of the Greek Testament, but this was suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. As soon as he reached Amsterdam, in 1730, he published anonymously the ''Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci editionem'', which he had proposed should accompany his Greek Testament, and which was later republished by him, with additions, in 1751. The next year (1731) the [[Remonstrants]] offered him the chair of philosophy in their college at [[Amsterdam]], vacated by the illness of [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Leclerc]], on condition that he clear himself of the suspicion of [[heresy]]. He returned to Basel, and received a reversal (22 March 1732) of the previous decision, and re-admission to all his clerical offices. But, on his becoming a candidate for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] chair at Basel, his [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] opponents blocked his appointment, and he retired to Amsterdam.

At length, he was allowed to instruct the Remonstrant students in philosophy and Hebrew on certain humiliating conditions. For the rest of his life he continued as professor in the Remonstrant college, declining in 1745 the Greek chair at Basel. In 1746 he once more visited England, and collated [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscripts for his final, great work. At last this appeared in 1751–1752, in two folio volumes, under the title ''Novum Testamentum Graecum editionis receptae cum lectionibus variantibus codicum'' manuscripts, etc. He did not venture to put new readings in the body of his page, but consigned them to a place between the Textus Receptus and the full list of various readings. Beneath the latter he gave a commentary, consisting principally of a mass of valuable illustrations and parallels drawn from classical and rabbinical literature, which has formed a storehouse for all later commentators. In his ''Prolegomena'' he gave an admirable methodical account of the manuscripts, the versions and the readings of the fathers, as well as the troubled story of the difficulties with which he had had to contend in the prosecution of the work of his life. He was the first to designate uncial manuscripts by Roman capitals, and cursive manuscripts by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] figures. He did not long survive the completion of this work. He died in Amsterdam. 
&lt;!--OUT OF DATE
Wettstein's New Testament has never been republished in its entirety. The London printer, [[William Bowyer]], published, in 1763, a text in which he introduced the readings recommended by Wettstein; [[J. S. Semler]] republished the ''Prolegomena'' and appendix (''Wetstenii libelli ad crisin atque interpretationem Novi Testamenti'', Halle, 1764); [[A. Lotze]] commenced a new edition of the work, but the ''Prolegomena'' only appeared later (Rotterdam, 1831), and this with much negative criticism --&gt;

===Work===
Wettstein rendered service to textual criticism by his collection of various readings and his methodical account of the manuscripts and other sources.

Through his laborious study of [[Codex Alexandrinus]], he found misinterpretations or calculated mistakes of New Testament written in Greek that question the very basis of Christianity. For example, the misreading of Greek word "God" with "who", so the passage from the book of I Timothy no longer read: "Christ as God made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit", but instead read: "Christ who was made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit". This finding, and some others led him to question his faith in the Divinity of Christ, which is evidenced by his later works.

Some opponents considered his work to be less valuable because of his prejudice against the Latin version and the principle of grouping manuscripts in families which had been recommended by Richard Bentley and [[Johann Albrecht Bengel|J. A. Bengel]].

See Wettstein's account of his labours and trials in his ''Nov. Test. i.'': 1751. ''Novum Testamentum Græcum editionis receptæ, cum Lectionibus Variantibus Codicum MSS., Editionum aliarum, Versionum et Patrum, necnon Commentario pleniore ex Scriptoribus veteribus, Hebræis, Græcis, et Latinis, historiam et vim verborum illustrante'', in two volumes. Amsterdam: Amstelædami. Reprinted in 1962 by Graz, Austria: Akademische Druck-u. Verlagsanstalt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6955">'''Modern studies''' is a subject unique to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish secondary school curriculum|secondary school curriculum]]. The focus of Modern Studies is to develop learners' knowledge and understanding of contemporary political and social issues in local, Scottish, United Kingdom and international contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/45629.html|title=SQA|last=resources@sqa.org.uk|first=Scottish Qualifications Authority, Resource Management,|website=www.sqa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Studies is offered both at National Qualification level and also in the Broad General Education stage of Scottish education. Pupils in primary school and up to S3 in secondary school have the opportunity to study Modern Studies concepts through the 'People in Society, Economy and Business' area of the broader Social Studies Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.scot/Documents/social-studies-eo.pdf|title=Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=Education Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senior Phase, Modern Studies is offered as a discrete subject. Ray Gunnion, history teacher in Brannock High School until 2004, was largely involved in introducing Modern Studies into the Scottish Education system as he felt it was a valuable subject for kids in Scotland.

== The Value of a Modern Studies Course ==
Modern Studies helps you develop knowledge and understanding of the processes that determine political, social and economic life. These processes are studied locally, nationally and internationally.

Modern Studies helps you develop important skills. For example you will become better at critically evaluating information, analysing complex sources and report writing. In some instances, the skills involved in using information technology will also be developed.

Together, the knowledge you acquire and the skills you develop will allow you to become a more informed individual, able to participate more effectively in society in a more tolerant and responsible manner.

== Study Themes ==
Common study themes exist across Modern Studies qualifications, from Broad General Education to Senior Phase.

=== Democracy in the UK ===
Pupils are given the opportunity to learn about the democratic processes of the United Kingdom with a focus on either UK democracy or Scottish democracy.  This includes examining rights and responsibilities, the political process, participation and representation at various levels.

=== Social Issues ===
Pupils examine social issues in society using sociological processes.  The focus of this unit is either Social Inequality or Crime and the Law.

A focus on social inequalities would examine issues of health, education, income and wealth inequalities in the UK by studying selected groups such as the unemployed, working poor, women, children, the elderly, [[LGBT|LBGT]]* people, [[Black and Minority Ethnic|BME]] people and others.

A focus on Crime and the Law would explore the types of crime committed in the UK, the sociological and individualistic theories of the causes of crime, the impact of crime and attempts to tackle crime.  The unit would examine the role of the criminal justice system, the police and the government.

=== International Issues ===
The International Issues unit is intended to broaden the scope of pupils' experiences to international contexts.  The focus of this unit will examine either a World Power or a World Issue.

A focus on a World Power will consist of a socioeconomic and political study of a [[G20]] country (excluding the United Kingdom).  This focus will be on the country's constitutional arrangements and opportunities for participation, the nature of recent socioeconomic issues and attempts to revolve them and the international influence of the world power.

A focus on a World Issue would put in the spotlight a contemporary significant conflict or issue which extends beyond the borders of a single country and has had impacts regionally or globally.  Examples of areas of study in this area would be [[terrorism]] or the [[Syrian Civil War]].  A study of a world issue would focus on the causes of, the impacts of and attempts to resolve the issue.

==The Primary Curriculum==

All schools in Scotland follow the 3-18 Curriculum for Excellence. Modern Studies is not offered as a discrete subject at primary school level, rather, it is delivered within the integrated Social Studies curricular area (which also encompasses history and geography themes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the early, first and second stages (P1-P7); pupils are introduced to social studies key themes and are encouraged to develop analytical and evaluative skills.

==In S1, S2 &amp; S3==
Each school has the freedom to develop a course to suit the needs and interests of both pupils and teachers within the parameters of the Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes.

==National Qualifications==
Modern Studies is offered at National 3, 4 &amp; 5 levels and at Higher and Advanced Higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is scope for a great deal of personalisation and choice across the NQ levels within the Course Assessment Specification. There are three areas of study and within these areas, teachers have the opportunity to teach a number of combinations of topic; these are:
* Democracy in Scotland and the UK:
** Democracy in Scotland OR
** Democracy in the United Kingdom
* Social Issues
** Social Inequality OR
** Crime and the Law
* International Issues
** World Power OR
** World Issue
At Advanced Higher level, there is a greater emphasis on depth of knowledge and so, one area of study is chosen from: Political Issues OR Law and Order OR Social Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Studies Advanced Higher Course Assessment Specification|last=|first=|publisher=SQA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each level above National 3, there also exists the requirement for pupils to complete an independent research project under the supervision of their teacher.  This project makes up some of the final overall award.

==University==

Modern Studies does not exist as a separate subject at [[University]] level though it is a sound basis for further study of a range of subjects from which Modern Studies is composed, such as Crime and the Law, [[Politics]], [[International Relations]], [[Sociology]], [[Criminology]], [[Economics]], [[Social Policy]] and [[Public Policy]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}
A '''mummy''' is a deceased [[human]] or an [[animal]] whose [[skin]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], extreme cold, very low [[humidity]], or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions. Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately [[embalming|embalmed]] with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally [[desiccation|desiccated]] bodies goes back to at least 1615 AD (See the section [[#Etymology and meaning|Etymology and meaning]]).

Mummies of humans and other animals have been found on every continent,&lt;ref name="Penn" /&gt; both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. Over one million [[animal mummies]] have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats.&lt;ref name="pets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0915_040915_petmummies.html|title=Egyptian Animals Were Mummified Same Way as Humans|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are [[sacred ibis]], and radiocarbon dating suggests  the Egyptian Ibis mummies that have been analyzed were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasef|first=S.|last2=Wood|first2=R.|last3=Merghani|first3=S. El|last4=Ikram|first4=S.|last5=Curtis|first5=C.|last6=Holland|first6=B.|last7=Willerslev|first7=E.|last8=Millar|first8=C.D.|last9=Lambert|first9=D.M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of Sacred Ibis mummies from ancient Egypt|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352409X15301243|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume=4|pages=355–361|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.09.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the well-known mummies of [[ancient Egypt]], deliberate mummification was a feature of several ancient cultures in areas of America and Asia with very dry climates. The [[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave mummies]] of Fallon, Nevada in North America were accurately dated at more than 9,400 years old. Before this discovery, the oldest known deliberate mummy was a child, one of the [[Chinchorro mummies]] found in the Camarones Valley, Chile, which dates around 5050 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartkusa |first=Luke |last2=Amarasiriwardena |first2=Dulasiri |last3=Arriaza |first3=Bernardo |last4=Bellis |first4=David |last5=Yañez |first5=Jorge |year=2011 |title=Exploring lead exposure in ancient Chilean mummies using a single strand of hair by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) |journal=Microchemical Journal |volume=98 |pages=267–274 |doi=10.1016/j.microc.2011.02.008 |issn=0026-265X |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a [[decapitation|severed head]] dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 AD at the site named Inca Cueva No. 4 in South America.&lt;ref name="head"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeometry.org/paleoamerican.htm|title=Andean Head Dated 6,000 Years Old|publisher=archaeometry.org|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Etymology and meaning ==
&lt;!-- Do not change "Etymology" to "Egyptology" --&gt;
The English word ''mummy'' is derived from medieval Latin ''mumia'', a borrowing of the medieval Arabic word ''mūmiya'' (مومياء) and from a Persian word ''mūm'' (wax),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mummy |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: mummy |publisher=etymonline.com |accessdate= 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant an embalmed corpse, and as well as the bituminous embalming substance, and also meant "[[Asphalt|bitumen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mummy |title=origin of word "mummy" |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}} Also "mummy" in [https://archive.org/stream/oed6barch#page/763/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']. Also "momie" in [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/momie CNRTL.fr (in French)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English|Medieval English]] term "mummy" was defined as "medical preparation of the substance of mummies", rather than the entire corpse, with [[Richard Hakluyt]] in 1599 AD complaining that "these dead bodies are the Mummy which the Phisistians and Apothecaries doe against our willes make us to swallow".&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Mummy, 1", citing Hakluyr's "Voyages, II, 201"&lt;/ref&gt; These substances were defined as [[mummia]].

The [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] defines a mummy as "the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial", citing sources from 1615 AD onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 1, 2, 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chamber's ''Cyclopædia'']] and the Victorian zoologist [[Francis Trevelyan Buckland]]&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 3c&lt;/ref&gt; define a mummy as follows: "A human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air. Also applied to the frozen carcase of an animal imbedded in prehistoric snow".

Wasps of the genus ''[[Aleiodes]]'' are known as "mummy wasps" because they wrap their caterpillar prey as "mummies".

While interest in the study of mummies dates as far back as [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Greece]], most structured scientific study began at the beginning of the 20th century.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=1-2}} Prior to this, many rediscovered mummies were sold as curiosities or for use in [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] novelties such as [[mummia]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=1}} The first modern scientific examinations of mummies began in 1901, conducted by professors at the English-language Government School of Medicine in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The first [[X-ray]] of a mummy came in 1903, when professors [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] and [[Howard Carter]] used the only X-ray machine in Cairo at the time to examine the mummified body of [[Thutmose IV]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=3}} British chemist Alfred Lucas applied chemical analyses to Egyptian mummies during this same period, which returned many results about the types of substances used in embalming. Lucas also made significant contributions to the analysis of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=16}}

Pathological study of mummies saw varying levels of popularity throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=14-15}} In 1992, the First World Congress on Mummy Studies was held in [[Puerto de la Cruz]] on [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].  More than 300 scientists attended the Congress to share nearly 100 years of collected data on mummies. The information presented at the meeting triggered a new surge of interest in the subject, with one of the major results being integration of [[Medical research|biomedical]] and [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] information on mummies with existing databases. This was not possible prior to the Congress due to the unique and highly specialized techniques required to gather such data.{{sfn| Aufderheide|2003|p=2}}

In more recent years, CT scanning has become an invaluable tool in the study of mummification by allowing researchers to digitally "unwrap" mummies without risking damage to the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldock |first1=C |last2=Hughes |first2=SW |last3=Whittaker |first3=DK |last4=Taylor |first4=J |last5=Davis |first5=R |last6=Spencer |first6=AJ |last7=Tonge |first7=K |last8=Sofat |first8=A |year=1994 |title=3-D reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian mummy using x-ray computer tomography |url= http://eprints.qut.edu.au/29982/|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=87 |issue= |pages=806–808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of detail in such scans is so intricate that small linens used in tiny areas such as the nostrils can be digitally reconstructed in [[Stereoscopy|3-D]].&lt;ref name=Gewolb&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gewolb |first=Josh |title=Computer identifies mummy |journal=Science |date=28 September 2001 |volume=293 |issue=5539 |page=2383 |doi=10.1126/science.293.5539.2383a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such modelling has been utilized to perform digital autopsies on mummies to determine cause of death and lifestyle, such as in the case of [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name=DeChant&gt;{{cite web |last=De Chant |first=Tim |title=Did King Tut Die in a Chariot Accident? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/ancient/did-king-tut-die-in-a-chariot-accident/ |work=Nova Next |publisher=PBS |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Anthropogenic|Spontaneous|Natural}}Types ==

Mummies are typically divided into one of two distinct categories: anthropogenic or spontaneous. Anthropogenic mummies were deliberately created by the living for any number of reasons, the most common being for religious purposes. Spontaneous mummies, such as [[Ötzi]], were created unintentionally due to natural conditions such as extremely dry heat or cold, or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions such as those found in [[bog body|bogs]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=2}} While most individual mummies exclusively belong to one category or the other, there are examples of both types being connected to a single culture, such as those from the ancient Egyptian culture and the Andean cultures of South America.&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt;

{{Main article|Ancient Egyptian burial customs}}
The earliest [[ancient Egypt]]ian mummies were created naturally due to the environment in which they were buried. In the era prior to 3500 BC,&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Egyptian Mummy |publisher=Penn Museum |url=http://www.penn.museum/long-term-exhibits/the-egyptian-mummy.html |accessdate = 9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Amandine [https://www.academia.edu/8963492/On_the_Origins_of_the_Egyptian_Mummification ON THE ORIGINS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIFICATION], Kmt 52, 2014, pp. 52-57&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians buried the dead in pit graves, without regard to [[social status]]. Pit graves were often shallow. This characteristic allowed for the hot, dry sand of the desert to [[dehydration|dehydrate]] the bodies, leading to natural mummification.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunn |first=Jimmy |title=An Overview of Mummification in Ancient Egypt |date=22 August 2011 |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/mummification.htm |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural preservation of the dead had a profound effect on [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Deliberate mummification became an integral part of the rituals for the dead beginning as early as the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|2nd dynasty]] (about 2800 BC).&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; New research of an 11-year study by [[University of York]], [[Macquarie University]] and [[University of Oxford]] suggests mummification occurred 1,500 years earlier than first thought.&lt;ref name="uyork"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2014/research/mummification/ | title=Embalming study ‘rewrites’ key chapter in Egyptian history | publisher=University of York | date=13 August 2014 | accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians saw the preservation of the body after death as an important step to [[Coffin Texts|living well in the afterlife]]. As Egypt gained more prosperity, burial practices became a status symbol for the wealthy as well. This cultural hierarchy lead to the creation of elaborate [[tomb]]s, and more sophisticated methods of embalming.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Joann |title=Mummies Around the World |date=17 February 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/mummies_01.shtml |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]] (about 2600 BC) Egyptian embalmers began to achieve "true mummification" through a process of [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], followed by preserving the body in various minerals and oils.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Much of this early experimentation with mummification in Egypt is unknown.

The few documents that directly describe the mummification process date to the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman period]]. The majority of the [[Papyrus|papyri]] that have survived only describe the ceremonial rituals involved in embalming, not the actual surgical processes involved. A text known as ''[[The Ritual of Embalming Papyrus|The Ritual of Embalming]]'' does describe some of the practical logistics of embalming, however, there are only two known copies and each is incomplete.&lt;ref name="Riggs"&gt;{{cite web |last=Riggs |first=Christina |title=Funerary Rituals (Ptolemaic and Roman Periods) |publisher=UCLA Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures |date=January 2010 |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x347 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Wade |first2=Ronald S. |last=Brier |first=Bob |title=Surgical procedures during ancient Egyptian mummification |publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca |date=June 2001 |jstor=27802174 |volume=33 |pages=117–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to mummification shown in images, there are apparently also very few. The tomb of Tjay designated [[TT23]],  is one of only two known which show the wrapping of a mummy (Riggs 2014).&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Riggs |first=Christina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdtgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=The+Ritual+of+Embalming+Papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nh-TVd6yKsv8Ut30gaAD&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ritual%20of%20Embalming%20Papyrus&amp;f=false |title=Unwrapping Ancient Egypt: The Shroud, the Secret and the Sacred (p.82-83) |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing 5 Jun 2014, 336 pages, {{ISBN|0857855077}} |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text that describes the processes being used in latter periods is [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]. Written in Book 2 of the ''Histories'' is one of the most detailed descriptions of the Egyptian mummification process, including the mention of using [[natron]] in order to dehydrate corpses for preservation.&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Greek historian Herodotus on the process of mummification -- and he has been proven accurate| publisher = utexas.edu| url = http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| accessdate = 9 November 2013| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023202442/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| archivedate = 23 October 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these descriptions are short and fairly vague, leaving scholars to infer the majority of the techniques that were used by studying mummies that have been unearthed.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

By utilizing current advancements in technology, scientists have been able to uncover a plethora of new information about the techniques used in mummification. A series of [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] performed on a 2,400-year-old mummy in 2008 revealed a tool that was left inside the [[cranial cavity]] of the skull.&lt;ref name="Jarus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarus |first=Owen |title=Oops! Brain-Removal Tool Left in Mummy's Skull |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=14 December 2012 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/oops-brain-removal-tool-left-mummys-skull-160456836.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool was a rod, made of an organic material, that was used to break apart the brain to allow it to drain out of the nose. This discovery helped to dispel the claim within Herodotus' works that the rod had been a hook made of iron.&lt;ref name="Herodotus" /&gt; Earlier experimentation in 1994 by researchers [[Bob Brier]] and Ronald Wade supported these findings. While attempting to replicate Egyptian mummification, Brier and Wade discovered that removal of the brain was much easier when the brain was liquefied and allowed to drain with the help of [[Gravitation|gravity]], as opposed to trying to pull the organ out piece-by-piece with a hook.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

Through various methods of study over many decades, modern [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologists]] now have an accurate understanding of how mummification was achieved in ancient Egypt. The first and most important step was to halt the process of decomposition, by removing the internal organs and washing out the body with a mix of spices and palm wine.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; The only organ left behind was the heart, as tradition held the heart was the seat of thought and feeling and would therefore still be needed in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; After cleansing, the body was then dried out with natron inside the empty body cavity as well as outside on the skin. The internal organs were also dried and either sealed in individual jars, or wrapped to be replaced within the body. This process typically took forty days.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

After dehydration, the mummy was wrapped in many layers of [[linen]] cloth. Within the layers, Egyptian priests placed small [[amulet]]s to guard the decedent from evil.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Once the mummy was completely wrapped, it was coated in a resin in order to keep the threat of moist air away. Resin was also applied to the coffin in order to seal it. The mummy was then sealed within its tomb, alongside the worldly goods that were believed to help aid it in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Riggs" /&gt;

=== Mummification and rank ===
Mummification is one of the defining customs in [[ancient Egyptian society]] for people today. The practice of preserving the human body is believed to be a quintessential feature of Egyptian life. Yet even mummification has a history of development and was accessible to different ranks of society in different ways during different periods. There were at least three different processes of mummification according to [[Herodotus]]. They range from "the most perfect" to the method employed by the "poorer classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Most perfect" method ====

The most expensive process was to preserve the body by dehydration and protect against pests, such as insects. Almost all of the actions Herodotus described serve one of these two functions.
[[File:Mòmia Nesi BMVB 2964.jpg|alt=Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer. Vilanova i la Geltrú. Spain|thumb|Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). [[Biblioteca Museu Víctor Balaguer]]. Vilanova i la Geltrú. Spain]]
First, the [[brain]] was removed from the [[cranium]] through the nose; the gray matter was discarded. Modern mummy excavations have shown that instead of an iron hook inserted through the nose as Herodotus claims, a rod was used to [[wiktionary:liquefy|liquefy]] the brain via the cranium, which then drained out the nose by gravity. The embalmers then rinsed the skull with certain drugs that mostly cleared any residue of brain tissue and also had the effect of killing bacteria. Next, the embalmers made an incision along the [[Flank (anatomy)|flank]] with a sharp blade fashioned from an [[Ethiopia]]n stone and removed the contents of the abdomen. Herodotus does not discuss the separate preservation of these organs and their placement either in special jars or back in the cavity, a process that was part of the most expensive embalming, according to archaeological evidence.

The [[abdominal cavity]] was then rinsed with palm wine and an infusion of crushed, fragrant herbs and spices; the cavity was then filled with spices including [[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], and, Herodotus notes, "every other sort of spice except [[frankincense]]", also to preserve the person.

The body was further dehydrated by placing it in [[natron]], a naturally occurring salt, for seventy days. Herodotus insists that the body did not stay in the natron longer than seventy days. Any shorter time and the body is not completely dehydrated; any longer, and the body is too stiff to move into position for wrapping. The embalmers then wash the body again and wrapped it with linen bandages. The bandages were covered with a gum that modern research has shown is both waterproofing agent and an antimicrobial agent.

At this point, the body was given back to the family. These "perfect" mummies were then placed in wooden cases that were human-shaped. Richer people placed these wooden cases in stone sarcophagi that provided further protection. The family placed the sarcophagus in the tomb upright against the wall, according to Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |pages=50–51 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Avoiding expense ====

The second process that Herodotus describes was used by middle-class people or people who "wish to avoid expense". In this method, an oil derived from [[Cedrus|cedar trees]] was injected with a syringe into the abdomen. A rectal plug prevented the oil from escaping. This oil probably had the dual purpose of liquefying the internal organs but also of disinfecting the abdominal cavity. (By liquefying the organs, the family avoided the expense of [[canopic jar]]s and separate preservation.) The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days. At the end of this time, the body was removed and the cedar oil, now containing the liquefied organs, was drained through the [[rectum]]. With the body dehydrated, it could be returned to the family. Herodotus does not describe the process of burial of such mummies, but they were perhaps placed in a [[shaft tomb]]. Poorer people used coffins fashioned from [[terracotta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inexpensive method ====

The third and least-expensive method the embalmers offered was to clear the [[intestines]] with an unnamed liquid, injected as an [[enema]]. The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days and returned to the family. Herodotus gives no further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=ToLiveForever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=52 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the mummies of Egypt, there have been instances of mummies being discovered in other areas of the [[African continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steyn|first=Maryna|last2=Binneman|first2=Johan|last3=Loots|first3=Marius|date=2007|title=The Kouga Mummified Human Remains|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/5758/Steyn_Kouga(2007).pdf?sequence=1|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=62|pages=3-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosothwane|first=Morongwa|date=2011|title=The Tuli Mummy: A Preliminary Report from Northeastern Botswana|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/19039/Mosothwane_Tuli(2011).pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=66|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies show a mix of anthropogenic and spontaneous mummification, with some being thousands of years old.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Libya ====

The mummified remains of an infant were discovered during an expedition by archaeologist [[Fabrizio Mori]] to [[Libya]] during the winter of 1958–1959 in the natural cave structure of [[Uan Muhuggiag]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281}} After curious deposits and cave paintings were discovered on the surfaces of the cave, expedition leaders decided to excavate. Uncovered alongside fragmented animal bone tools was the mummified body of an infant, wrapped in animal skin and wearing a necklace made of ostrich egg shell beads. Professor Tongiorgi of the University of Pisa radiocarbon-dated the infant to between 5,000–8,000 years old. A long incision located on the right abdominal wall, and the absence of internal organs, indicated that the body had been eviscerated [[Autopsy|post-mortem]], possibly in an effort to preserve the remains.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=282}} A bundle of herbs found within the body cavity also supported this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=Science: Older than Egypt?|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865145,00.html|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=Time|date=21 December 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research revealed that the child had been around 30 months old at the time of death, though gender could not be determined due to poor preservation of the sex organs.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281-282}}&lt;ref name=Wan&gt;{{cite web|title=Wan Muhuggiag|url=http://www.temehu.com/wan-muhuggiag.htm|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
[[File:Momie de Jingzhou.jpg|thumb|300px|Mummy in the history museum of [[Jingzhou]]]]

The mummies of Asia are usually considered to be accidental. The decedents were buried in just the right place where the environment could act as an agent for preservation. This is particularly common in the desert areas of the Tarim Basin and Iran. Mummies have been discovered in more humid Asian climates, however these are subject to rapid decay after being removed from the grave.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard" /&gt;

==== China ====
[[File:Xin Zhui 3.JPG|thumb|left|The mummy of [[Xin Zhui]].]]
Mummies from various [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]] throughout [[China]]'s history have been discovered in several locations across the country. They are almost exclusively considered to be unintentional mummifications. Many areas in which mummies have been uncovered are difficult for preservation, due to their warm, moist climates.

Also known as Lady Dai, she was discovered in the early 1970s at the [[Mawangdui]] archaeological site in [[Changsha]].&lt;ref name="Bonn-Muller"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bonn-Muller |first=Eti |title=China's Sleeping Beauty |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=10 April 2009 |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/mawangdui/ |accessdate=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the wife of the marquis of Dai during the [[Han dynasty]], who was also buried with her alongside another young man often considered to be a very close relative.&lt;ref name="K.Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirst |first=K.

Some of the more infamous mummies to be discovered in China are those termed [[Tarim mummies]] because of their discovery in the [[Tarim Basin]]. The dry desert climate of the basin proved to be an excellent agent for desiccation. For this reason, over 200 Tarim mummies, which are over 4,000 years old, were excavated from a cemetery in the present-day [[Xinjiang]] region.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |title=A Host of Mummies, a Forest of Secrets |publisher=New York Times |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16archeo.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies were found buried in upside-down boats with hundreds of 13-foot long wooden poles in the place of tombstones.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt; [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] data&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert J. |last=Saiget |title=Caucasians preceded East Asians in basin |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |work=The Washington Times |publisher=News World Communications |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2007-08-20 |quote=A study last year by [[Jilin]] University also found that the mummies' DNA had Europoid genes. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420224622/http://washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |archivedate=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--a major newspaper as is legitimate a source as any other publication.--&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, but unpublished research is not.

As of 2012, at least eight mummified human remains have been recovered from the Douzlakh Salt Mine at Chehr Abad in northwestern [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Aali"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Abar |first2=Aydin |last3=Boenke |first3=Nicole |last4=Pollard |first4=Mark |last5=Rühli |first5=Frank |last=Aali |first=Abolfazl |last6=Stöllne |first6=Thomas |title=Ancient salt mining and salt men: the interdisciplinary Chehrabad Douzlakh project in north-western Iran |journal=Antiquity |volume=086 |issue=333 |publisher=Department of Archaeology, Durham University |location=Durham, UK |date=September 2012 |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/aali333/ |accessdate=10 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their salt preservation, these bodies are collectively known as [[Saltmen]].&lt;ref name="Chehr Abad"&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Chehr Abad "Salt men" and the isotopic ecology of humans in ancient Iran| journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology| date = November 2010| pmid = 20949607| doi = 10.1002/ajpa.21314| volume=143| issue=3| pages=343–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon-14]] testing conducted in 2008 dated three of the bodies to around 400 BC. Later [[isotope|isotopic]] research on the other mummies returned similar dates, however, many of these individuals were found to be from a region that is not closely associated with the mine. It was during this time that researchers determined the mine suffered a major collapse, which likely caused the death of the miners.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt; Since there is significant archaeological data that indicates the area was not actively inhabited during this time period, current consensus holds that the accident occurred during a brief period of temporary mining activity.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt;

==== Siberia ====
In 1993, a team of Russian archaeologists led by Dr. [[Natalia Polosmak]] discovered the [[Siberian Ice Maiden]], a [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Siberian woman, on the [[Ukok Plateau]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] near the Mongolian border.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes"&gt;{{cite web| title = Siberian Princess reveals her 2,500 year old tattoos| publisher = The Siberian Times| date = 14 August 2012| url = http://siberiantimes.com/culture/others/features/siberian-princess-reveals-her-2500-year-old-tattoos/| accessdate = 10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummy was naturally frozen due to the severe climatic conditions of the Siberian steppe. Also known as Princess Ukok, the mummy was dressed in finely detailed clothing and wore an elaborate headdress and jewelry. Alongside her body were buried six decorated horses and a symbolic meal for her last journey.&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adkins |first=Jan |title=Unquiet Mummies |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/unquiet-mummies.html |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her left arm and hand were tattooed with [[animal style]] figures, including a highly stylized [[deer]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

The Ice Maiden has been a source of some recent controversy. The mummy's skin has suffered some slight decay, and the tattoos have faded since the excavation. Some residents of the [[Altai Republic]], formed after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], have requested the return of the Ice Maiden, who is currently stored in [[Novosibirsk]] in [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polosmak"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polosmak |first=Natalya |title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven |journal=[[National Geographic Magazine]] |pages=80–103 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Siberian mummy, a man, was discovered much earlier in 1929. His skin was also marked with tattoos of two monsters resembling [[griffin]]s, which decorated his chest, and three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat on his left arm.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

==== Philippines ====
Philippine mummies are called [[Kabayan Mummies]]. They are common in [[Igorot]] culture and their heritage. The mummies are found in some areas named [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Sagada, Mountain Province|Sagada]] and among others. The mummies are dated between the 14th and 19th centuries.

=== Europe ===
The European continent is home to a diverse spectrum of spontaneous and anthropogenic mummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/solved-the-mystery-of-britains-bronze-age-mummies-48475 |title=Solved: the mystery of Britain’s Bronze Age mummies |last=Booth |first=Tom |date=24 Nov 2015 |website=The Conversation |access-date=3 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best-preserved mummies have come from bogs located across the region. The Capuchin monks that inhabited the area left behind hundreds of intentionally-preserved bodies that have provided insight into the customs and cultures of people from various eras. One of the oldest, and most infamous, mummies (nicknamed [[Ötzi]]) was discovered on this continent. New mummies continue to be uncovered in Europe well into the 21st Century.

==== Bog bodies ====
{{Main article|Bog body}}
The [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]] have produced a number of [[Bog body|bog bodies]], mummies of people deposited in [[bog|sphagnum bogs]], apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, low temperature and lack of oxygen combined to [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] the body's skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved on emerging from the bog, with skin and internal organs intact; it is even possible to determine the decedent's last meal by examining [[stomach]] contents. A famous case is that of the [[Haraldskær Woman]], who was discovered by labourers in a bog in [[Jutland]] in 1835. She was erroneously identified as an early medieval Danish queen, and for that reason was placed in a royal [[sarcophagus]] at the Saint Nicolai Church, [[Vejle]], where she currently remains. Another famous bog body, also from Denmark, known as the [[Tollund Man]] was discovered in 1950. The corpse was noted for its excellent preservation of the face and feet, which appeared as if the man had recently died. To this day, only the head of Tollund Man remains, due to the decomposition of the rest of his body, which was not preserved along with the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Library |first1=Silkeborg Public |last2=Museum |first2=Silkeborg |url=http://www.tollundman.dk/et-lig-dukker-op.asp |title=A Body Appears |work=The Tollund Man – A Face from Prehistoric Denmark |accessdate=22 September 2007 |publisher=Silkeborg Public Library |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canary Islands ====

{{Main article|Guanche mummies}}
The mummies of the [[Canary Islands]] belong to the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Guanches|Guanche]] people and date to the time before 14th Century Spanish explorers settled in the area. All deceased people within the Guanche culture were mummified during this time, though the level of care taken with embalming and burial varied depending on individual social status. Embalming was carried out by specialized groups, organized according to gender, who were considered unclean by the rest of the community. The techniques for embalming were similar to those of the ancient Egyptians; involving evisceration, preservation, and stuffing of the evacuated bodily cavities, then wrapping of the body in animal skins. Despite the successful techniques utilized by the Guanche, very few mummies remain due to looting and desecration.&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Ireland |first2=Robert |last=Horne |first=Patrick |title=Moss and a Guanche Mummy: An Unusual Utilization |journal=The Bryologist |year=1991 |volume=94 |issue=4 |page=407 |jstor=3243832 |publisher=American Bryological and Lichenological Society |doi=10.2307/3243832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockburn"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cockburn |editor1-first=Aidan |editor2-last=Cockburn |editor2-first=Eve |editor3-last=Reyman |editor3-first=Theodore A. |title=Mummies, Disease and Ancient Cultures |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=University Press, Cambridge, UK |page=284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KZHa5vHOS0C&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=Guanche+mummies |edition=2nd |accessdate=11 November 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Czech Republic ====
[[File:Brno CZ Crypt at the Capuchin Monastery 02.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Mummies in the [[Capuchin Crypt in Brno]]]]
The majority of mummies recovered in the [[Czech Republic]] come from underground crypts. While there is some evidence of deliberate mummification, most sources state that desiccation occurred naturally due to unique conditions within the crypts.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=192}}&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlasCapu /&gt;

The [[Capuchin Crypt in Brno]] contains three hundred years of mummified remains directly below the main altar.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion&gt;{{cite web|title=MUMMIES and MUMMIFIED REMAINS|url=http://www.orchestrion.cz/mummy.htm|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 18th Century when the crypt was opened, and continuing until the practice was discontinued in 1787, the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin monks]] of the monastery would lay the deceased on a pillow of bricks on the ground. The unique air quality and topsoil within the crypt naturally preserved the bodies over time.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlasCapu&gt;{{cite web|title=The Czech's Capuchin Crypt|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/czechs-capuchin-crypt|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately fifty mummies were discovered in an abandoned crypt beneath the [[Church of St. Procopius of Sázava]] in [[Vamberk]] in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=Agentura&gt;{{cite web|title=Monastery of Broumov|url=http://www.broumovsko.cz/en/monastery-of-broumov/monastery-of-broumov|publisher=Agentura pro rozvoj Broumovska|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workers digging a trench accidentally broke into the crypt, which began to fill with waste water. The mummies quickly began to deteriorate, though thirty-four were able to be rescued and stored temporarily at the District Museum of the Orlické Mountains until they could be returned to the monastery in 2000.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The mummies range in age and social status at time of death, with at least two children and one priest.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The majority of the Vamberk mummies date from the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt;

The [[Klatovy]] catacombs currently house an exhibition of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] mummies, alongside some aristocrats, that were originally interred between 1674–1783. In the early 1930s, the mummies were accidentally damaged during repairs, resulting in the loss of 140 bodies. The newly updated airing system preserves the thirty-eight bodies that are currently on display.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klatovy&gt;{{cite web|title=New exposition|url=http://www.katakomby.cz/klatovycatacombs/newexposition.aspx|publisher=Klatovské katakomby|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
[[File:Skrudstrupspigen.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a grave mound in Denmark.]]
Apart from several bog bodies, Denmark has also yielded several other mummies, such as the three Borum Eshøj mummies, the Skrydstrup Woman and the [[Egtved Girl]], who were all found inside burial mounds, or [[tumuli]].

In 1875, the Borum Eshøj grave mound was uncovered, which had been built around three coffins, which belonged to a middle aged man and woman as well as a man in his early twenties.&lt;ref name=Natmus /&gt; Through examination, the woman was discovered to be around 50–60 years old. She was found with several artifacts made of bronze, consisting of buttons, a belt plate, and rings, showing she was of higher class. All of the hair had been removed from the skull later when farmers had dug through the casket. Her original hairstyle is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldtiden.natmus.dk/udstillingen/bronzealderen/familien_i_borum_eshoej/kvinden_fra_borum_eshoej/language/uk/ |title=The woman from Borum Eshøj – Oldtiden |publisher=Oldtiden.natmus.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men wore kilts, and the younger man wore a sheath which contained a bronze dagger. All three mummies were dated to 1351–1345 BC.&lt;ref name=Natmus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-bronze-age/the-family-from-borum-eshoej/ |title= The family in Borum Eshøj |publisher= http://natmus.dk/ |accessdate= 11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a [[tumulus]] in Southern Jutland, in 1935. Carbon-14 dating showed that she had died around 1300 BC; examination also revealed that she was around 18–19 years old at the time of death, and that she had been buried in the summertime. Her hair had been drawn up in an elaborate hairstyle, which was then covered by a horse hair hairnet made by the [[sprang]] technique. She was wearing a blouse and a necklace as well as two golden earrings, showing she was of higher class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaul |first=Flemming |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/skrydstrup |title=Skrydstrup, We know where she lived – 1001 Stories of Denmark |publisher=Kulturarv.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egtved Girl]], dated to 1370 BC, was also found inside a sealed coffin within a tumulus, in 1921. She was wearing a [[bodice]] and a skirt, including a belt and bronze bracelets. Found with the girl, at her feet, were the cremated remains of a child and, by her head, a box containing some bronze pins, a hairnet, and an [[Bradawl|awl]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

==== Hungary ====

In 1994, 265 mummified bodies were found in the crypt of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church in [[Vác]], Hungary from the 1729–1838 period. The discovery proved to be scientifically important, and by 2006 an exhibition was established in the Museum of Natural History in [[Budapest]]. Unique to the Hungarian mummies are their elaborately decorated coffins, with no two being exactly alike.&lt;ref name=AtlObs1&gt;{{cite web|title=MUMMIES OF VÁC, HUNGARY|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mummies-v-c-hungary|publisher=AtlasObscura|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
[[File:Monks' Corridor.jpg|thumb|right|Mummies in the Monks' Corridor of the [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]].]]
The varied geography and climatology of Italy has led to many cases of spontaneous mummification.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=193}} Italian mummies display the same diversity, with a conglomeration of natural and intentional mummification spread across many centuries and cultures.

The oldest natural mummy in Europe was discovered in 1991 in the [[Ötztal Alps]] on the Austrian-Italian border. Nicknamed [[Ötzi]], the mummy is a 5,300-year-old male believed to be a member of the [[Tamins-Carasso-Isera]] cultural group of [[South Tyrol]].&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{cite web |last=Owen |first=James |title=5 Surprising Facts About Otzi the Iceman |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131016-otzi-ice-man-mummy-five-facts/ |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=11 November 2013 |date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OtziCulture&gt;{{cite web|title=Which cultural group did Ötzi belong to?|url=http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|publisher=South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology|accessdate=11 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111110719/http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his age, a recent DNA study conducted by [[Walther Parson]] of [[Innsbruck Medical University]] revealed Ötzi has 19 living genetic relatives.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

The [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini|Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo]] were built in the 16th century by the monks of Palermo’s Capuchin monastery. Originally intended to hold the deliberately mummified remains of dead friars, interment in the catacombs became a status symbol for the local population in the following centuries. Burials continued until the 1920s, with one of the most famous final burials being that of [[Rosalia Lombardo]]. In all, the catacombs host nearly 8000 mummies. (See: [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]])

The most recent discovery of mummies in Italy came in 2010, when sixty mummified human remains were found in the [[crypt]] of the Conversion of St Paul church in Roccapelago di [[Pievepelago]], Italy. Built in the 15th century as a cannon hold and later converted in the 16th century, the crypt had been sealed once it had reached capacity, leaving the bodies to be protected and preserved. The crypt was reopened during restoration work on the church, revealing the diverse array of mummies inside. The bodies were quickly moved to a museum for further study.&lt;ref name=Huddersfield&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Stefano Vanin’s forensic expertise is used to learn lessons from the extraordinary Mummies of Roccapelago|url=http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|publisher=University of Huddersfield|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=24 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111111205/http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===

The mummies of North America are often steeped in controversy, as many of these bodies have been linked to still-existing native cultures. While the mummies provide a wealth of historically-significant data, native cultures and tradition often demands the remains be returned to their original resting places. This has led to many legal actions by Native American councils, leading to most museums keeping mummified remains out of the public eye.&lt;ref name=Spirit /&gt;

In 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned [[Inuit]] settlement called [[Qilakitsoq]], in Greenland. The "Greenland Mummies" consisted of a six-month-old baby, a four-year-old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago. Their bodies were naturally mummified by the sub-zero temperatures and dry winds in the cave in which they were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deem |first=James M. |title=World Mummies: Greenland Mummies |url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/greenland.htm |publisher=Mummy Tombs |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=16 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208160451/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/greenland.htm |archivedate=8 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hart Hansen |editor1-first=Jens Peder |editor2-last=Meldgaard |editor2-first=Jørgen |editor3-last=Nordqvist |editor3-first=Jørgen |title=The Greenland Mummies |location=London |publisher=British Museum Publications |year=1991 |isbn=0-7141-2500-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
[[File:Placid death.JPG|left|190px|thumb|A mummy from Guanajuato]]
Intentional mummification in [[pre-Columbian Mexico]] was practiced by the [[Aztec]] culture. These bodies are collectively known as [[Aztec mummy|Aztec mummies]]. Genuine Aztec mummies were "bundled" in a woven wrap and often had their faces covered by a ceremonial mask.&lt;ref name=Langely&gt;{{cite web |last=Langely |first=James |title=NOTES I-3: TEOTIHUACAN INCENSARIOS: THE 'V' MANTA AND ITS MESSAGE |url=http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/notes/JL/notes1_3.htm |publisher=Internet Journal for Teotihuacan Archaeology and Iconography |accessdate=12 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112060653/http://archaeology.asu.edu/teo/notes/JL/notes1_3.htm |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public knowledge of Aztec mummies increased due to traveling exhibits and museums in the 19th and 20th centuries, though these bodies were typically naturally desiccated remains and not actually the mummies associated with Aztec culture. (See: [[Aztec mummy]])

Natural mummification has been known to occur in several places in Mexico, though the most famous are the [[mummies of Guanajuato]].&lt;ref name=prof&gt;{{cite news |title= Professor unravels secrets of the Guanajuato mummies |newspaper=US Fed News Service, Including US State News |location=Washington, D.C. |date=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of these mummies, most of which date to the late 19th century, have been on display at ''El Museo de las Momias'' in the city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] since 1970. The museum claims to have the smallest mummy in the world on display (a mummified [[fetus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guanajuato: Guia para descubrir los encantos del estado |editor1=Jimenez Gonzalez |editor2=Victor Manuel |isbn=978-607-400-177-8 |year=2009 |publisher=Solaris |location=Madrid, Spain |language=Spanish |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was thought that minerals in the soil had the preserving effect, however it may rather be due to the warm, arid climate.&lt;ref name=prof /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Detroit Science Center: The Accidental Mummies of Guanajuato Touring Exhibition to Make World Debut in Detroit |newspaper=Pediatrics Week.  |location=Atlanta |date=27 June 2009 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexican mummies are also on display in the small town of [[Encarnación de Díaz]], [[Jalisco]].

==== United States ====
[[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave Man]] was discovered in 1940 during salvage work prior to [[guano]] mining activity that was scheduled to begin in the area. The mummy is a middle-aged male, found completely dressed and lying on a blanket made of animal skin. Radiocarbon tests in the 1990s dated the mummy to being nearly 9,000 years old. The remains are currently held at the [[Nevada State Museum, Carson City|Nevada State Museum]]. There has been some controversy within the local Native American community, who began petitioning to have the remains returned and reburied in 1995.&lt;ref name=Spirit&gt;{{cite web|title=Spirit Cave Man|url=http://museums.nevadaculture.org/new_exhibits/cc-UnderOneSky/spiritcave.htm|publisher=Nevada State Museum|accessdate=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112081148/http://museums.nevadaculture.org/new_exhibits/cc-UnderOneSky/spiritcave.htm|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muska /&gt;&lt;ref name=Asher&gt;{{cite web |last=Asher |first=Laura |title=Oldest North American Mummy |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9609/newsbriefs/nevada.html |work=Archaeology |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |accessdate=12 November 2013 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oceania ===
[[File:Robley with mokomokai collection 2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Horatio Gordon Robley with his mokomokai collection.]]

Mummies from the [[Oceania]] are not limited only to [[Australia]]. Discoveries of mummified remains have also been located in [[New Zealand]], and the [[Torres Strait]],{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=289}} though these mummies have been historically harder to examine and classify.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=277}} Prior to the 20th Century, most literature on mummification in the region was either silent or anecdotal.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; However, the boom of interest generated by the scientific study of Egyptian mummification lead to more concentrated study of mummies in other cultures, including those of Oceania.

==== Australia ====

The aboriginal mummification traditions found in [[Australia]] are thought be related to those found in the [[Torres Strait]] islands,&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawson |first=Warren |title=Mummification in Australia and in America |journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |year=1928 |volume=58 |pages=115–138 |jstor=4619529}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inhabitants of which achieved a high level of sophisticated mummification techniques (See:[[Mummy#Torres Strait|Torres Strait]]). Australian mummies lack some of the technical ability of the Torres Strait mummies, however much of the ritual aspects of the mummification process are similar.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; Full-body mummification was achieved by these cultures, but not the level of artistic preservation as found on smaller islands. The reason for this seems to be for easier transport of bodies by more nomadic tribes.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;

==== Torres Strait ====

The mummies of the Torres Strait have a considerably higher level of preservation technique as well as creativity compared to those found on Australia.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; The process began with removal of viscera, after which the bodies were set in a seated position on a platform and either left to dry in the sun or smoked over a fire in order to aid in desiccation. In the case of smoking, some tribes would collect the fat that drained from the body to mix with ocher to create red paint that would then be smeared back on the skin of the mummy.&lt;ref name=Melanesia&gt;{{cite web |last=Deem |first=James |title=Melanesia Mummies |url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |accessdate=15 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015193124/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |archivedate=15 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies remained on the platforms, decorated with the clothing and jewelry they wore in life, before being buried.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Melanesia /&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main article|Mokomokai}}

Some [[Māori people|Māori]] tribes from New Zealand would keep mummified heads as trophies from tribal warfare.&lt;ref name=Maori1 /&gt; They are also known as [[Mokomokai]]. In the 19th Century, many of the trophies were acquired by Europeans who found the tattooed skin to be a phenomenal curiosity. Westerners began to offer valuable commodities in exchange for the uniquely tattooed mummified heads. The heads were later put on display in museums, 16 of which being housed across France alone. In 2010, the Rouen City Hall of France returned one of the heads to New Zealand, despite earlier protests by the Culture Ministry of France.&lt;ref name=Maori1&gt;{{cite web|title=Mummified Maori head returned to NZ|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=10 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204030056/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|archivedate=4 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that some Maori tribes may have practiced full-body mummification, though the practice is not thought to have been widespread.&lt;ref name=Orchiston&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orchiston |first=D. Wayne |title=THE PRACTICE OF MUMMIFICATION AMONG THE NEW ZEALAND MAORI |journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |year=1968 |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=186–190 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_77_1968/Volume_77,_No._2/The_practice_of_mummification_among_the_New_Zealand_Maori,_by_Wayne_Orchiston,_p_186_-_190/p1 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of Maori mummification has been historically controversial, with some experts in past decades claiming that such mummies have never existed.&lt;ref name=Tregear&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tregear |first=Edward |title=Maori Mummies |journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |year=1916 |volume=25 |issue=100 |pages=167–168 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=1053 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary science does now acknowledge the existence of full-body mummification in the culture. There is still controversy, however, as to the nature of the mummification process. Some bodies appear to be spontaneously created by the natural environment, while others exhibit signs of deliberate practices. General modern consensus tends to agree that there could be a mixture of both types of mummification, similar to that of the ancient Egyptian mummies.&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

=== South America ===
The [[South America]]n continent contains some of the oldest mummies in the world, both deliberate and accidental.&lt;ref name="head" /&gt; The bodies were preserved by the best agent for mummification: the environment. The Pacific coastal desert in [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] is one of the driest areas in the world and the dryness facilitated mummification. Rather than developing elaborate processes such as later-dynasty ancient Egyptians, the early South Americans often left their dead in naturally dry or frozen areas, though some did perform surgical preparation when mummification was intentional.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Earliest Mummies| publisher = The Field Museum| url = http://mummies.fieldmuseum.org/behind-the-scenes/south-american-mummies| accessdate = 9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for intentional mummification in South America include memorialization, immortalization, and religious offerings.&lt;ref name="Arriaza"&gt;{{cite web |last2=Hapke |first2=Russell A. |last3=Standen |first3=Vivien G. |last=Arriaza |first=Bernardo |title=Making the Dead Beautiful: Mummies as Art |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=16 December 1998|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/chinchorro/ |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of mummified bodies have been found in pre-Columbian cemeteries scattered around Peru.

==== Chinchorro mummies ====
[[File:Momia cultura chinchorro año 3000 AC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chinchorro mummies are the oldest deliberate mummies.]]
{{Main article|Chinchorro mummies}}
The [[Chinchorro mummies]] are the oldest intentionally prepared mummified bodies ever found. Beginning in [[5th millennium BC]] and continuing for an estimated 3,500 years,&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; all human burials within the Chinchorro culture were prepared for mummification. The bodies were carefully prepared, beginning with removal of the internal organs and skin, before being left in the hot, dry climate of the [[Atacama Desert]], which aided in desiccation.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of Chinchorro mummies were also prepared by skilled artisans to be preserved in a more artistic fashion, though the purpose of this practice is widely debated.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt;

==== Inca mummies ====
[[File:Llullaillaco mummies in Salta city, Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco]] mummy in [[Salta Province]] ([[Argentina]]).]]
Several naturally-preserved, unintentional mummies dating from the [[Inca Empire|Incan]] period (1438–1532 AD) have been found in the colder regions of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]]. These are collectively known as "ice mummies".&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The first Incan ice mummy was discovered in 1954 atop [[Cerro El Plomo|El Plomo Peak]] in Chile, after an eruption of the nearby volcano [[Sabancaya]] melted away ice that covered the body.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liesl |title=Ice Mummies of the Inca |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/ice-mummies-inca.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plomo Mummy|Mummy of El Plomo]] was a male child who was presumed to be wealthy due to his well-fed bodily characteristics. He was considered to be the most well-preserved ice mummy in the world until the discovery of Mummy Juanita in 1995.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

[[Mummy Juanita]] was discovered near the summit of [[Ampato]] in the Peruvian section of the [[Andes]] mountains by archaeologist [[Johan Reinhard]].&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; Her body had been so thoroughly frozen that it had not been desiccated; much of her skin, muscle tissue, and internal organs retained their original structure.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; She is believed to be a ritual sacrifice, due to the close proximity of her body to the Incan capital of [[Cusco]], as well as the fact she was wearing highly intricate clothing to indicate her special social status. Several Incan ceremonial artifacts and temporary shelters uncovered in the surrounding area seem to support this theory.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

More evidence that the Inca left sacrificial victims to die in the elements, and later be unintentionally preserved, came in 1999 with the discovery of the [[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco mummies]] on the border of Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Yancey |title=Interview: "Inca Mummy Man" Johan Reinhard |publisher=National Geographic |date=28 October 2010 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0621_050621_incamummy.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three mummies are children, two girls and one boy, who are thought to be sacrifices associated with the ancient ritual of ''[[qhapaq hucha]]''.&lt;ref name="Handwerk"&gt;{{cite web |last=Handwerk |first=Brian |title=Inca Child Sacrifice Victims Were Drugged |publisher=National Geographic |date=29 July 2013 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130729-inca-mummy-maiden-sacrifice-coca-alcohol-drug-mountain-andes-children/?rptregcta=reg_free_np&amp;rptregcampaign=20131016_rw_membership_r1p_us_se_w#finished |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[biochemistry|biochemical analysis]] of the mummies has revealed that the victims had consumed increasing quantities of [[alcohol]] and [[coca]], possibly in the form of [[chicha]], in the months leading up to sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt; The dominant theory for the drugging reasons that, alongside ritual uses, the substances probably made the children more docile. Chewed coca leaves found inside the eldest child's mouth upon her discovery in 1999 supports this theory.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt;

'''Inca emperors.''' The bodies of Inca emperors and wives were mummified after death.  In 1533, the [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s of the Inca Empire viewed the mummies in the Inca capital of Cuzco. The mummies were displayed, often in lifelike positions, in the palaces of the deceased emperors and had a retinue of servants to care for them.  The Spanish were impressed with the quality of the mummification which involved removal of the organs, embalming, and freeze-drying.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney&lt;/ref&gt;

The population revered the mummies of the Inca emperors.  This reverence seemed idolatry to the [[Roman Catholic]] Spanish and in 1550 they confiscated the mummies. The mummies were taken to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] where they were displayed in the San Andres Hospital.  The mummies deteriorated in the humid climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;McCaa, Robert, Nimlos, Aleta, and Hampe Martinez, Teodoro (nd) "Why Blame Smallpox"; http://users.pop.umn.edu/~rmccaa/aha2004/why_blame_smallpox.pdf, accessed 27 Jan 2017; Pringle, Harriet (2011), "Inca Empire", ''National Geographic'', http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/inca-empire/pringle-text/2, accessed 27 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to find the mummies of the Inca emperors beneath the San Andres hospital in 2001 was unsuccessful.  The archaeologists found a crypt, but it was empty.  Possibly the mummies had been removed when the building was repaired after an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle &lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-mummification ==
{{Main article|Buddhist mummies|Sokushinbutsu}}
Monks whose bodies remain [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]] without any traces of deliberate mummification are venerated by some Buddhists who believe they successfully were able to mortify their flesh to death. Self-mummification was practiced until the late 1800s in Japan and has been outlawed since the early 1900s.

Many Mahayana Buddhist monks were reported to know their time of death and left their last testaments and their students accordingly buried them sitting in [[lotus position]], put into a vessel with drying agents (such as wood, paper, or [[Calcium oxide|lime]]) and surrounded by bricks, to be exhumed later, usually after three years. The preserved bodies would then be decorated with paint and adorned with gold.

Bodies purported to be those of self-mummified monks are exhibited in several Japanese shrines, and it has been claimed that the monks, prior to their death, stuck to a sparse diet made up of salt, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s, [[root]]s, [[pine]] bark, and ''[[Toxicodendron vernicifluum|urushi]]'' tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic.net/~anomaly/japan/dbuddha.htm |title=The Buddhist Mummies of Japan |publisher=Sonic.net |date=24 August 1998 |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern mummies ==
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]] wished to be mummified after he died.]]

=== Jeremy Bentham ===
In the 1830s, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of [[utilitarianism]], left instructions to be followed upon his death which led to the creation of a sort of modern-day mummy. He asked that his body be displayed to illustrate how the "horror at dissection originates in ignorance"; once so displayed and lectured about, he asked that his body parts be preserved, including his skeleton (minus his skull, which despite being mis-preserved, was displayed beneath his feet until theft required it to be stored elsewhere),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miss Cellania |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |title=6 Restless Corpses |publisher=Mental Floss |accessdate=9 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119161451/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were to be dressed in the clothes he usually wore and "seated in a Chair usually occupied by me when living in the attitude in which I am sitting when engaged in thought". His body, outfitted with a wax head created because of problems preparing it as Bentham requested, is on open display in the [[University College London]].

=== Vladimir Lenin ===
During the early 20th century, the Russian movement of [[Russian cosmism|Cosmism]], as represented by [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]], envisioned scientific resurrection of dead people. The idea was so popular that, after [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s death, [[Leonid Krasin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]] suggested to [[Cryonics|cryonically preserve]] his body and brain in order to revive him in the future.&lt;ref name="azbuka"&gt;See the article: А.М. и А.А. Панченко «Осьмое чудо света», in the book Панченко А.М. О русской истории и культуре. St. Petersburg: Azbuka, 2003. Page 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Necessary equipment was purchased abroad, but for a variety of reasons the plan was not realized.&lt;ref name="azbuka" /&gt; Instead his body was [[Embalming|embalmed]] and placed on permanent exhibition in the [[Lenin's Mausoleum|Lenin Mausoleum]] in Moscow, where it is displayed to this day. The mausoleum itself was modeled by [[Alexey Shchusev]] on the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] and the [[Tomb of Cyrus]].

===Gottfried Knoche===
In late 19th-century Venezuela, a German-born doctor named [[Gottfried Knoche]] conducted experiments in mummification at his laboratory in the forest near [[La Guaira]]. He developed an [[embalming fluid]] (based on an [[aluminum chloride]] compound) that mummified corpses without having to remove the internal organs. The formula for his fluid was never revealed and has not been discovered. Most of the several dozen mummies created with the fluid (including himself and his immediate family) have been lost or were severely damaged by vandals and looters.

=== Summum ===
In 1975, an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] organization by the name of [[Summum]] introduced "Modern Mummification", a service that utilizes modern techniques along with aspects of ancient methods of mummification. The first person to formally undergo Summum's process of modern mummification was the founder of Summum, [[Claude Nowell|Summum Bonum Amen Ra]], who died in January 2008.&lt;ref name="CNNBeliefBlog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ravitz |first=Jessica |title=Summum: Homegrown spiritual group, in news and in a pyramid |publisher=CNN |date=11 June 2010 |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/11/summum-a-belief-system-in-the-news-%E2%80%93-and-unlike-any-other/ |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summum is currently considered to be the only "commercial mummification business" in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Grant |title=Summum: Religious group performs mummification rituals in Utah pyramid |publisher=KSL.com |date=30 October 2010 |url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=22660276 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alan Billis ===
In 2010, a team led by forensic archaeologist Stephen Buckley mummified Alan Billis using techniques based on 19 years of research of 18th-dynasty Egyptian mummification.

=== Plastination ===
{{Main article|Plastination}}
[[Plastination]] is a technique used in [[anatomy]] to conserve bodies or body parts. The water and fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most microscopic properties of the original sample.

The technique was invented by [[Gunther von Hagens]] when working at the anatomical institute of the [[Heidelberg University]] in 1978. Von Hagens has patented the technique in several countries and is heavily involved in its promotion, especially as the creator and director of the [[Body Worlds]] traveling exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com |title=Body Worlds Official Web Site |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting plastinated human bodies internationally. He also founded and directs the Institute for Plastination in [[Heidelberg]].

More than 40 institutions worldwide have facilities for plastination, mainly for medical research and study, and most affiliated to the International Society for Plastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.plastination.org/ |title=International Society for Plastination |publisher=Isp.plastination.org |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment of ancient mummies in modern times ==
In the [[Middle Ages]], based on a mistranslation from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for bitumen, it was thought that mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. When actual mummies became unavailable, the [[Desiccation|sun-desiccated]] corpses of criminals, slaves and [[Suicide|suicidal]] people were substituted by mendacious merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/bodies/cases/case18.html | title = What was mummy medicine? | accessdate =8 February 2008 | publisher = [[Channel 4]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice developed into a wide-scale business that flourished until the late 16th century. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties to stop bleeding, and were sold as [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] in powdered form as in [[mellified man]].&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Daly |first=N. |year=1994 |title=That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy |journal=Novel: A Forum on Fiction |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=24–51 |doi=10.2307/1345912 |jstor=1345912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists also made use of Egyptian mummies; a brownish pigment known as [[mummy brown]], based on ''[[mummia]]'' (sometimes called alternatively ''[[caput mortuum]]'', Latin for ''death's head''), which was originally obtained by grinding human and animal Egyptian mummies. It was most popular in the 17th century, but was discontinued in the early 19th century when its composition became generally known to artists who replaced the said pigment by a totally different blend -but keeping the original name, mummia or mummy brown-yielding a similar tint and based on ground minerals (oxides and fired earths) and or blends of powdered gums and oleoresins (such as myrrh and frankincense) as well as ground bitumen. These blends appeared on the market as forgeries of powdered mummy pigment but were ultimately considered as acceptable replacements, once antique mummies were no longer permitted to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm Mumie - nicht lieferbar!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215033915/http://www.kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm |date=15 February 2012 }} article by Kremer Pigmente GmbH &amp; Co NYC,  (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;   Many thousands of mummified cats were also sent from Egypt to England to be processed for use in [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wake |first=Jehanne |author-link=Jehanne Wake |title=Kleinwort, Benson: the history of two families in banking |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-828299-0 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qm1fHrcgZuoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA118&amp;dq=mummified+cats+fertilizer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, following the discovery of the first tombs and artifacts in Egypt, Egyptology was a huge fad in Europe, especially in [[Victorian era|Victorian England]]. European aristocrats would occasionally entertain themselves by purchasing mummies, having them unwrapped, and holding observation sessions.&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping" /&gt; These sessions destroyed hundreds of mummies, because the exposure to the air caused them to disintegrate.

The use of mummies as [[fuel]] for [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] was documented by [[Mark Twain]] (likely as a joke or humor),&lt;ref name="Straight"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/020222.html | publisher = [[The Straight Dope]] |  title = Do Egyptians burn mummies as fuel? | date = 22 February 2002 | accessdate =16 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the truth of the story remains debatable.

{{Performing arts}}
'''Music''' is an art form and [[culture|cultural]] activity whose medium is sound organized in time. In general [[definitions of music]] will include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muse]]s").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[glossary of musical terminology]].

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the [[harmony of the spheres]]" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the [[Hip Hop Movement]]''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and [[sheet music]] and scores to customers.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muses]]").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''musica'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'')." This is derived from the "...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]]."&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album "Hubardo" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music "score"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "[[big band]]s." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as "common practice" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought… |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d.

==Elements==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate [[musical notation]]s" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the elements of music" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the "rudimentary elements of music" and the "perceptual elements of music".

===Rudimentary elements===
In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Clementi, M. (1974). Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte: Da Capo Pr. Cohen, D., &amp; Dubnov, S. (1997). [[Gestalt phenomena]] in musical texture: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niecks, F. (1884). A concise dictionary of musical terms. The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, 25(498), 473. doi: 10.2307/3357513&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella &lt;ref&gt;Estrella, E. (2015). The Elements of music. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2015, 2015, from http://musiced.about.com/od/beginnerstheory/a/musicelements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: "the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."&lt;ref&gt;Element. (n.d.). In Dictionary.com unabridged.   Retrieved 10 Jun 2015, from  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the "inter-related dimensions of music" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four "psychological attributes of sound". These were: "pitch, loudness, time, and timbre" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the "elements of music" but referred to them as "elemental components" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: "Pitch" and "timbre" match exactly, "loudness" links with dynamics and "time" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase "the elements of music" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: "a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods"&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.

Although writers of lists of "rudimentary elements of music" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]"  {{audio|Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|Play}}]]

A [[melody]] (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the "[[white notes]]" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the "white notes" and "black notes" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] ("keys"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the "home note" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or "home note" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:
* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or "tune") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.
* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a "thicker" or "denser" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).

====Timbre or "tone color"====
Timbre, sometimes called "color" or "tone color" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. "Articulation." ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey "an indication of mood, spirit, character etc." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life. ASME XXth National Conference Proceeding. Australian Society for Music Education. |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.

In music, [[Musical form|form]] describes how  the overall structure or plan of a song or piece of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt-Jones |first=Catherine |title=Form in Music |url=http://cnx.org/content/m10842/2.14/ |website=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandt |first=Anthony |title=Musical Form |url=http://cnx.org/content/m11629/1.13/ |publisher=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs and [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]] songs were often in [[AABA form|AABA]] [[32 bar form]], in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody and the B section provided a contrasting melody and/or harmony for 8 bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] ("refrain") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].
Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as "sectional, developmental, or variational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keil |first=Charles |title=Urban blues |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wennerstrom |first=Mary |editor=Wittlich, Gary |title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music |year=1975 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-049346-0 |chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music |ref=CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
This form is defined by its "unrelieved repetition" ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of "unrelieved variation": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.

;Binary form
[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, "simple binary" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.
b
;Ternary form
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. "repeat from the top") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the "middle eight". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called "episodes". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a "development" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only "section" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] – a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].
This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|Sep2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the "A" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the "B" part (the [[musical development|development]]) – thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

The ancient [[Egyptians]] credited one of their gods, [[Thoth]], with the invention of music, with [[Osiris]] in turn used as part of his effort to civilize the world. The earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic period]], but the evidence is more securely attested in the [[Old Kingdom]] when [[harp]]s, [[flute]]s and [[double clarinet]]s were played.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Exhibits/MIRE/Introduction/AncientEgypt/AncientEgypt.html Music of Ancient Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013114158/http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Exhibits/MIRE/Introduction/AncientEgypt/AncientEgypt.html |date=2015-10-13 }}.

[[Asian music]] covers the music cultures of [[Arabic music|Arabia]], [[Central Asian music|Central Asia]], [[East Asian music|East Asia]], [[South Asian music|South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asian music|Southeast Asia]]. [[Chinese classical music]], the traditional art or court music of China, has a history stretching over around three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12) as does European-influenced music. [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] is the music of [[Iran|Persia]] and Persian language countries: ''musiqi'', the science and art of music, and ''muzik'', the sound and performance of music (Sakata 1983).

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe," the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text," writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul."&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

Greek [[music theory]] included the Greek [[musical mode]]s, that eventually became the basis for Western [[religious music|religious]] and [[European classical music|classical]] music.

The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Lucio Vivaldi]].

The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument.

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th and 21st century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}

In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things |show=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]] of electric bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s and digital ones and computers since the 1990s. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form," it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody."

==Performance==

Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)—which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song "[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional" or as a "folk song". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

In music, an "ornament" is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]].

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by Boldini of a woman playing the piano]]
Philosophy of music is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:
* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''the Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

==Psychology==
{{Main|Music psychology}}
Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], skill, [[intelligence]], creativity, and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]
Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

===Cognitive musicology===
{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}
Cognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laske |first=Otto |title=Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O.

Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;Graci, C. (2009–2010) A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena. ''Journal of Educational Technology Systems'', 38(2), 181–211.&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999.

{{Further|Hearing (sense)}}
Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[speech]] and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]].

===Evolutionary musicology===
{{Main|Evolutionary musicology}}

Evolutionary musicology concerns the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology."

===Culture in music cognition===
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Ethnomusicology}}

An individual's culture or [[ethnicity]] plays a role in their [[music cognition]], including their [[Psychology of music preference|preferences]], [[Music and emotion|emotional reaction]], and [[music-related memory|musical memory]]. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soley |first=G. |last2=Hannon |first2=E.

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. "The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene." in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball (2010). [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]
Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s pop-music scene, "[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erika White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the '60s &amp;#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women "...were not socialized to see themselves as people who create [music]."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "...to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=2016-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recorded artists is [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
The music that composers make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room or [[theatre music|theatre]]. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played "live." Recording, even of essentially live styles such as rock, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings that may be considered "better" than the actual performance.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ "Canned Music on Trial"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] or watching a music video, became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a "[[prosumer]]" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

==Business==

{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are "[[independent record label|independent]]," while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

===Intellectual property laws===
{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}
In spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.

====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

====Ethnomusicology====
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]
In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures ("[[world music]]" or the field of "ethnomusicology"), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic "[[melting pot]]" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872–950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, "Music a Remedy"&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it "a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy." He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to "make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout."&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are
troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.

[[Albert Einstein]] had a lifelong love of music (particularly the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/einstein&amp;music.pdf |title=Einstein and his love of music |last=Foster |first=Brian |magazine=Physics World |date=2005 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; once stating that life without playing music would be inconceivable to him. In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that "whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties." Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', "would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, "as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made. This perspective parallels, remarkably, Einstein’s views on the ultimate simplicity of nature and its explanation and statement via essentially simple mathematical expressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/06/the_musical_mind_of_albert_einstein.html |title=The Musical Mind of Albert Einstein: Great Physicist, Amateur Violinist and Devotee of Mozart |website=Open Culture |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review suggests that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jesperson |first=Kira |date=13 August 2015 |title=Music for insomnia in adults |journal=The Cochrane Library |volume= |issue=8 |pages= CD010459|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010459.pub2 |pmid=26270746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music is also being used in clinical rehabilitation of cognitive and motor disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322792.php|title=Why does bass make you want to dance?|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1806">This group of standards, created by the [[OPC Foundation]], provides [[Component Object Model|COM]] specifications for communicating data from devices and applications that provide historical data, such as databases. The specifications provides for access to raw, [[interpolated]] and [[aggregate data]] (data with calculations).

OPC Historical Data Access, also known as OPC HDA, is used to exchange archived process data. This is in contrast to the [[OPC Data Access]] (OPC DA) specification that deals with real-time data. OPC technology is based on client / server architecture. Therefore, an OPC client, such as a trending application or spreadsheet, can retrieve data from an OPC compliant data source, such as a historian, using OPC HDA.

Similar to the [[OPC Data Access]] specification, OPC Historical Data Access also uses Microsoft's [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] to transport data. [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] also provides OPC HDA with full security features such as user authentication and authorization, as well as communication encryption services. OPC HDA Clients and Servers can reside on separate PCs, even if they are separated by a firewall. To do this, system integrators must configure DCOM properly as well as open ports in the firewall. If using the Windows firewall, users only need to open a single port.

'''Open form''' is a term coined by [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] in 1915 to describe a characteristic of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]] opposed to the "closed form" of the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] {{harv|Wölfflin|1915|loc=chapter 3}}. Wölfflin tentatively offered several alternative pairs of terms, in particular "a-tectonic" and "tectonic" (also free/strict and irregular/regular), but settled on open/closed because, despite their undesirable ambiguity, they make a better distinction between the two styles precisely because of their generality. In an open form, which is characteristic of 17th-century painting, the style "everywhere points out beyond itself and purposely looks limitless", in contrast to the self-contained entity of a closed form, in which everything is "pointing everywhere back to itself" {{harv|Wölfflin|1950|loc=124}}. In general, the closed compositions of the 16th century are dominated by the vertical and horizontal, and by the opposition of these two dimensions. Seventeenth-century painters, by contrast, de-emphasize these oppositions so that, even when they are present, they lose their tectonic force. The diagonal, on the other hand, becomes the main device used to negate or obscure the rectangularity of the picture space {{harv|Wölfflin|1950|loc=125–26}}.

Although the term first occurred only in this book, the foundations for this concept had already been articulated by Wölfflin in 1888, in his earlier book ''Renaissance und Barock'' {{harv|Kaletha|2004|loc=121, n79}}. The closed/open pairing was one of five pairs of opposed categories to contrast the differences between the two periods. The others were the [[Line art|linear]] and the [[Painterliness|painterly]], [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] and [[Perspective (visual)|depth]], multiplicity and unity, and clearness and unclearness {{harv|Podro|2010}}.

The concept was soon adopted in other fields. Although in Wölfflin's opinion architecture could only be tectonic and therefore "closed" {{harv|Wölfflin|1950|loc=149}}, the notion of openness found its way into the theory of architecture by 1932, when [[Helmuth Plessner]] gave a lecture on [[Modern architecture|modernist architecture]] in Germany to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] {{harv|Plessner|[1932] 2001}}. 

The essentially dynamic character of the [[Film|film medium]] was seen as an essentially open form, in contrast to the closed form of selected "[[Film still|stills]]" from the same film, which could be appreciated for their pictorial composition {{harv|Read|1945|loc=142}}.

'''Paul Saltman''' (11 April 1928 &amp;ndash; 27 August 1999) was a Professor of Biology at the [[University of California, San Diego]], for more than three decades, and an internationally renowned nutrition expert.  He received a B.S. in chemistry (1949) and Ph.D. in biochemistry (1953) from the [[California Institute of Technology]].  He commenced employment at the [[Keck School of Medicine]] at USC, until 1967, when he accepted the position of provost of [[Revelle College]] at the University of California, San Diego, "to bring undergraduate education to the same high level of academic excellence that marks the graduate program at the heavily science-oriented college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cen-v049n012.p054 Paul Saltman Frontiersman of science education]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 Saltman was appointed Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. In 1980, he returned to full-time research and teaching at UCSD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/jsaltman.htm NOTED UCSD BIOLOGIST, NUTRITION EXPERT AND ACCLAIMED TEACHER PAUL SALTMAN DIES AUG 27.]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, from prostate cancer in 1999, the Paul D. Saltman Endowed Chair in Science Education was established by UCSD to recognize a distinguished senior member of Biological Sciences faculty for his/her commitment to, and success in teaching science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology.ucsd.edu/alumni/biosphere/2010-winter/saltman.html Professor Saltman Lives on in our Hearts and Minds]&lt;/ref&gt;  Saltman was married to Barbara Saltman for over 50 years, and is survived by sons David and Joshua, and five grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.usc.edu/#!/article/8490/Paul-D-Saltman-Biologist-Nutritionist-Dies-at-71/ Paul D. Saltman, Biologist, Nutritionist, Dies at 71]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to nutrition==
Saltman's research focussed on the chemistry, biochemistry and nutritional role of trace metals such as [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] and [[manganese]].  His approach to nutrition made the point that it is an exact science, and can be accurately measured and tested.  He often clearly differentiated between the concept of eating food, about which he noted: "food is not in itself a science, it is a sensual experience required for survival", and nutrition.  Nutritional requirements, he maintained, could in theory be provided with [[total parenteral nutrition]].  "With TPN feeding all of the nutrients that a human being needs, from the time of infancy to the latter years, one can be maintained alive and well and growing without ever eating a morsel of food or drinking a drop of liquid."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessexcellence.org/WN/NM/saltnm.php Food For Thought: An Interview with Nutrition Scientist Dr. Paul Saltman]&lt;/ref&gt;

His discoveries allowed for improvements in dietary and supplement strategies to prevent anemia, enhance physical performance and decrease the chance of heart disease.   Clinical applications of his research included reduction of free radical damage to hearts, prevention of anemia, enhanced physical performance, and better bone and skeletal metabolism.  His findings were of interest to the food industry and he was a consultant to Procter and Gamble, Mars and other food manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=saltman-paul-cr.xml Saltman, Paul]&lt;/ref&gt;  His academic writings are able to be purchased from Chemical and Engineering News,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cen-v049n012.p054 C&amp;EN Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; and are also held in the Mandeville Special Collections Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/mscl/ Mandeville Special Collections Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308151218/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/mscl/ |date=2013-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1985 lecture in the [[Leon Pape#Leon Pape Memorial Lecture Series|Leon Pape Memorial Lecture Series]] reflected his overall philosophy, and was titled "Science Is With People: A Tribute to Leon Pape".

He was an advocate of eating all types of food, including red meat and occasional "[[junk food]]", while always stressing the importance of exercise and supplements.  He wrote "The University of California San Diego Nutrition Book" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3967318-the-university-of-california-san-diego-nutrition-book The University of California San Diego Nutrition Book]&lt;/ref&gt; as a popular science book for the layperson, and believed that science has a duty to assist and educate not only university students, but also the general public.  He was "the antithesis of the ivory tower academic, and expanded his role as a teacher to include the public at large. He did a half-hour series called "Patterns of Life" for National Educational Television and a series for PBS."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/28/news/mn-4442 Paul Saltman; UC San Diego Biochemist, Innovator]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also considered an outstanding teacher, and an inspiration to his students. Robert C. Dynes, UCSD Chancellor wrote of him : " His love of learning, his enthusiasm for science, his communication skills, made him a role model for students and faculty alike. My tenure here has been enriched by knowing him—by his advice, his personal integrity, his passion for teaching and for life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/jsaltman.htm NOTED UCSD BIOLOGIST, NUTRITION EXPERT ACCLAIMED TEACHER PAUL SALTMAN DIES AUG 27.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Appearance==

Dr. Saltman appeared as a contestant on the 22 October 1959 episode of Groucho Marx's TV quiz program "[[You Bet Your Life]]".  He won $300 and his wit and charm made him a delightful guest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks_Mq3A-jk0&amp;index=87&amp;list=PLHaioNpr_GDbvsTj_taM-jO6C1658N1PC&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peace Cafés''' are [[peace]]-positive cafés in [[Canada]] that have declared an adherence to [[Manifesto 2000]], in addition to [[fair trade]], [[living wage]], and local [[organic foods]] standards while also utilizing their space for community gatherings on [[social justice]] and peace issues.  The designation is a registered [[trade mark]] of [[Canadian Centres for Teaching Peace]] (CCTP).

==Origin==
In 2006, CCTP founder Robert "Bob" Stewart drafted a prospectus for creating community-based centres for public peace education, called "Peace Cafés." Initiatives began in [[Hamilton, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activistmagazine.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=777&amp;Itemid=143 "Centre for Teaching Peace and Peace Café opens in Hamilton"], Activist Magazine 21 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calgary, Alberta]] in 2007 to secure partnerships with existing cafés or to open completely new spaces. In December 2007, the Hamilton initiative secured a partnership with the downtown Sky Dragon Community Development Co-operative, with Robert Porter as local director. In 2008, Robert Porter extended the Peace Café family with a partnership in his rural hometown of [[Walkerton, Ontario]], with the White Rose Coffeehouse.

As of March 2009 there are groups in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Nelson, British Columbia]],&lt;ref name="selkirk0309"&gt;[http://selkirk.ca/about/news/name-15490-en.php Peace Café Advocates Change in Thinking], Selkirk College / Peace Café Nelson partnership announcement 09 march 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12926 "Cafe with peace on the menu opens soon"], University of Calgary Gauntlet 23 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; working towards additional partnerships in their respective communities.

==Philosophy==
Peace Cafés are described as "safe community spaces dedicated to developing a [[Peace|Culture of Peace]] at the community level through dialogue, conversation, workshops, and a library of peace resources along with wholesome food and drink options."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62612">'''Perceptual control theory''' ('''PCT''') is a model of [[behavior]] based on the principles of [[negative feedback]], but differing in important respects from [[Control theory|engineering control theory]]. Results of PCT experiments have demonstrated that an organism controls neither its own behavior, nor external environmental variables, but rather its own perceptions of those variables. Actions are not controlled, they are varied so as to cancel the effects that unpredictable environmental disturbances would otherwise have on controlled perceptions. As a catch-phrase of the field puts it, "behavior is the control of perception." PCT demonstrates circular causation in a negative feedback loop closed through the environment. This fundamentally contradicts the classical notion of linear causation of behavior by stimuli, in which environmental stimuli are thought to cause behavioral responses, mediated (according to [[cognitive psychology]]) by intervening cognitive processes.  &lt;sup&gt;[[citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Numerous computer simulations of specific behavioral situations demonstrate its efficacy,&lt;ref&gt;For example in [http://mindreadings.com/demos.htm this collection].&lt;/ref&gt; with extremely high correlations to observational data (0.95 or better), which are vanishingly rare in the so-called 'soft' sciences.&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt; While the adoption of PCT in the scientific community has not been widespread, it has been applied not only in [[experimental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], but also in sociology, linguistics, and a number of other fields, and has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]].

==The place of purpose (intention) and causation in psychology==

A tradition from Aristotle through William James recognizes that behavior is ''purposeful'' rather than merely reactive. However, the only evidence for intentions was subjective. Behaviorists following [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]], [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndyke]], [[John B. Watson|Watson]], and others rejected introspective reports as data for an objective science of psychology. Only observable behavior could be admitted as data.&lt;ref&gt;"The behaviorist asks: Why don't we make what we can observe the real field of psychology? Let us limit ourselves to things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only those things. Now what can we observe? We can observe behavior—what the organism does or says." Watson, J.B. (1924). ''Behaviorism''. New York: People's Institute Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

There follows from this stance the assumption that environmental events (stimuli) cause behavioral actions (responses). This assumption persists in [[cognitive psychology]], which interposes [[cognitive maps]] and other postulated [[information processing]] between stimulus and response, but otherwise retains the assumption of linear causation from environment to behavior.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =You say you had a revolution: Methodological foundations of closed-loop psychology | journal =Review of General Psychology | volume =13 | issue =2 | pages =137–145 | publisher = | location = | date =June 2009 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/a0015106 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more specific reason for psychologists' rejecting notions of purpose or intention was that they could not see how a goal (a state that did not yet exist) could cause the behavior that led to it. PCT resolves these philosophical arguments about [[teleology]] because it provides a model of the functioning of organisms in which purpose has objective status without recourse to [[introspection]], and in which causation is circular around [[feedback loops]].&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PCT has roots in insights of [[Claude Bernard]] and 20th century [[control systems engineering]] and [[cybernetics]]. It was originated as such, and given its present form and experimental methodology, by [[William T. Powers]].&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =Casting nets and testing specimens: Two grand methods of psychology | publisher =Praeger | edition = | date =1990 | location =New York | page =103 | isbn =0-275-93533-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cziko.TWD&gt;{{Citation | last =Cziko | first =Gary | author-link = | title =The things we do: Using the lessons of Bernard and Darwin to understand the what, how, and why of our behavior | place =Cambridge, MA | publisher =MIT Press | year =2000 | page =9 | isbn =0-262-03277-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers recognized that to be purposeful implies control, and that the concepts and methods of engineered control systems could be applied to biological control systems. A key insight is that the variable that is controlled is not the output of the system (the behavioral actions), but its input, that is, a sensed and transformed function of some state of the environment that could be affected by the control system's output. Because some of these sensed and transformed inputs appear as consciously perceived aspects of the environment, Powers labelled the controlled variable "perception". The theory came to be known as "Perceptual Control Theory" or PCT rather than "Control Theory Applied to Psychology" because control theorists often assert or assume that it is the system's output that is controlled.&lt;ref name=Astrom&gt;{{cite book | last =Astrom | first =Karl J. | last2 =Murray | first2 =Richard M. | title =Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers | publisher =Princeton University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2008 | location = | pages = | language = | url =http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/am08-complete_28Sep12.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn =0-691-13576-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In PCT it is the internal representation of the state of some variable in the environment—a "perception" in everyday language—that is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;For additional information about the history of PCT, see interviews with William T. Powers in the "Audio" section under "External links".&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principles of PCT were first published by Powers, Clark, and MacFarland as a "general feedback theory of behavior" in 1960,&lt;ref name=PCM1960&gt;{{cite journal | last =Powers | first =William T. | last2 =Clark | first2 =R.K. | last3 =McFarland | first3 =R.L. | title =A general feedback theory of human behavior (Part I) | journal =Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume =11 | issue =1 | pages =71–88 | publisher = | location = | date =1960 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.2466/pms.1960.11.1.71| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }} and {{cite journal | last =Powers | first =William T. | last2 =Clark | first2 =R.K. | last3 =McFarland | first3 =R.L. | title =A general feedback theory of human behavior (Part II) | journal =Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume =11 | issue =3 | pages =309–323 | publisher = | location = | date =1960 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.2466/pms.1960.11.3.309| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }} [Reprinted in {{citation | last =Bertalanffy | first =Ludwig von | last2 =Rapoport | first2 =Anatol | title =General Systems: Yearbook of the Society for General Systems Research | place =Ann Arbor, Michigan | publisher =Society for General Systems Research | series = | volume =5 | orig-year =1960 | year = | month= | edition = | chapter = | chapter-url = | page = | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }},  pages 63-73, 75-83.

==Example==

A simple negative feedback control system is a [[cruise control]] system for a car. A cruise control system has a sensor which "perceives" speed as the rate of spin of the drive shaft directly connected to the wheels. It also has a driver-adjustable 'goal' specifying a particular speed. The sensed speed is continuously compared against the specified speed by a device (called a "comparator") which subtracts the currently sensed input value from the stored goal value. The difference (the error signal) determines the throttle setting (the accelerator depression), so that the engine output is continuously varied to prevent the speed of the car from increasing or decreasing from that desired speed as environmental conditions change. This type of classical negative feedback control was worked out by engineers in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="black93"&gt;Harold Black and the Negative-Feedback Amplifier, Ronald Kline, IEEE Control Systems, Aug 1993, Volume 13, Issue 4, Pages 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bennett | first =Stuart | author-link = | title =A brief history of automatic control | journal =IEEE Control Systems Magazine | volume =16 | issue =3 | pages =17–25 | publisher = | location = | date =June 1996 | language = | url =http://ieeecss.org/CSM/library/1996/june1996/02-HistoryofAutoCtrl.pdf | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1109/37.506394| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the speed of the car starts to drop below the goal-speed, for example when climbing a hill, the small increase in the error signal, amplified, causes engine output to increase, which keeps the error very nearly at zero. If the speed begins to exceed the goal, e.g. when going down a hill, the engine is throttled back so as to act as a brake, so again the speed is kept from departing more than a barely detectable amount from the goal speed (brakes being needed only if the hill is too steep). The result is that the cruise control system maintains a speed close to the goal as the car goes up and down hills, and as other disturbances such as wind affect the car's speed. This is all done without any planning of specific actions, and without any blind reactions to stimuli. Indeed, the cruise control system does not sense disturbances such as wind pressure at all, it only senses the controlled variable, speed. Nor does it control the power generated by the engine, it uses the 'behavior' of engine power as its means to control the sensed speed.

The same principles of negative feedback control (including the ability to nullify effects of unpredictable external or internal disturbances) apply to living control systems.&lt;ref name=Wiener48/&gt; The thesis of PCT is that animals and people do not control their behavior; rather, they vary their behavior as their means for controlling their perceptions, with or without external disturbances. This directly contradicts the historical and still widespread assumption that behavior is the final result of stimulus inputs and cognitive plans.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Miller| first =George |author2=Galanter, Eugene |author3=Pribram, Karl| title =Plans and the structure of behavior| publisher =[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]| year =1960| location =[[New York City|New York]]| isbn=0-03-010075-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model==

The principal datum in PCT methodology is the controlled variable. The fundamental step of PCT research, the test for controlled variables, begins with the slow and gentle application of disturbing influences to the state of a variable in the environment which the researcher surmises is already under control by the observed organism. It is essential not to overwhelm the organism's ability to control, since that is what is being investigated. If the organism changes its actions just so as to prevent the disturbing influence from having the expected effect on that variable, that is strong evidence that the experimental action disturbed a controlled variable. It is crucially important to distinguish the perceptions and point of view of the observer from those of the observed organism. It may take a number of variations of the test to isolate just which aspect of the environmental situation is under control, as perceived by the observed organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =77–79  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marken.center.fielder&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Controlled variables: psychology as the center fielder views it | journal =American Journal of Psychology | volume =114 | issue =2 | pages =259–281 | publisher =University of Illinois Press | location = | date =2001 | language = | url = | jstor =1423517 | issn = | doi =10.2307/1423517 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCT employs a [[black box]] methodology. The controlled variable as measured by the observer corresponds quantitatively to a reference value for a perception that the organism is controlling. The controlled variable is thus an objective index of the purpose or intention of those particular behavioral actions by the organism&amp;mdash;the goal which those actions consistently work to attain despite disturbances. With few exceptions, in the current state of [[neuroscience]] this internally maintained reference value is seldom directly observed as such (e.g. as a rate of firing in a neuron), since few researchers trace the relevant electrical and chemical variables by their specific pathways while a living organism is engaging in what we externally observe as behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. works [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2EgcIyIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en listed here].&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a working negative feedback system simulated on a digital computer performs essentially identically to observed organisms, then the well understood negative feedback structure of the simulation or model (the white box) is understood to demonstrate the unseen negative feedback structure within the organism (the black box).&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt;

Data for individuals are not aggregated for statistical analysis;&lt;ref&gt;See Runkel 1990 on the limitations of statistical methods and the value of individual performance data.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, a generative model is built which replicates the data observed for individuals with very high fidelity (0.95 or better). To build such a model of a given behavioral situation requires careful measurements of three observed variables:

{|
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The input quantity, that aspect of the stimulus which the subject perceives and has been demonstrated to be controlling.
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The output quantity, that aspect of the subject's behavior which affects the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
|- valign="top"
| ''d'' || The disturbance, a value summing the effects that any other influences in the environment have on the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. In a controlled experiment one aims to have just one disturbing influence that is under the control of the investigator, but in naturalistic observation the situation is frequently more complex.
|}

A fourth value, the internally maintained reference ''r'' (a variable ′setpoint′), is deduced from the value at which the organism is observed to maintain ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', as determined by the test for controlled variables (described at the beginning of this section).

With two variables specified, the controlled input ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the reference ''r'', a properly designed control system, simulated on a digital computer, produces outputs ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' that almost precisely oppose unpredictable disturbances ''d'' to the controlled input. Further, the variance from perfect control accords well with that observed for living organisms.&lt;ref name=Powers2008&gt;{{cite book | last =Powers | first =William T. | title =Living Control Systems III: The fact of control | publisher =Benchmark Publications | date =2008 | location =New Canaan, CT | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-9647121-8-8 }} [Mathematical appendix by Dr. Richard Kennaway. Includes computer programs for the reader to demonstrate and experimentally test the theory.]&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect control would result in zero effect of the disturbance, but living organisms are not perfect controllers, and the aim of PCT is to model living organisms. When a computer simulation performs with &gt;95% conformity to experimentally measured values, opposing the effect of unpredictable changes in ''d'' by generating (nearly) equal and opposite values of ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', it is understood to model the behavior and the internal control-loop structure of the organism.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCM1960/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;

By extension, the elaboration of the theory constitutes a general model of cognitive process and behavior. With every specific model or simulation of behavior that is constructed and tested against observed data, the general model that is presented in the theory is exposed to potential challenge that could call for revision or could lead to refutation.

==Mathematics==

To illustrate the mathematical calculations employed in a PCT simulation, consider a pursuit tracking task in which the participant keeps a mouse cursor aligned with a moving target on a computer monitor.

The model assumes that a perceptual signal within the participant represents the magnitude of the input quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. (This has been demonstrated to be a rate of firing in a neuron, at least at the lowest levels.)&lt;ref name=Powers73&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Behavior: The Control of Perception]]| year=1973| first=William T.| last=Powers| isbn=0-7045-0092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yin.BG2014&gt;{{cite journal | last =Yin | first =Henry H. | author-link = | title =How Basal Ganglia Outputs Generate Behavior | journal =Advances in Neuroscience | volume =2014 | issue =768313 | pages =28 | publisher =Hindawi Publishing Corporation | location = | date =18 November 2014  | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1155/2014/768313 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tracking task, the input quantity is the vertical distance between the target position ''T'' and the cursor position ''C'', and the random variation of the target position acts as the disturbance ''d'' of that input quantity. This suggests that the perceptual signal ''p'' quantitatively represents the cursor position ''C'' minus the target position T, as expressed in the equation ''p''=''C''&amp;ndash;''T''.

Between the perception of target and cursor and the construction of the signal representing the distance between them there is a delay of ''&amp;Tau;'' milliseconds, so that the working perceptual signal at time ''t'' represents the target-to-cursor distance at a prior time, ''t'' &amp;ndash; ''&amp;Tau;''. Consequently, the equation used in the model is

1. ''p''(''t'') = ''C''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'') &amp;ndash; ''T''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'')

The negative feedback control system receives a reference signal ''r'' which specifies the magnitude of the given perceptual signal which is currently intended or desired. (For the origin of ''r'' within the organism, see under "[[#A hierarchy of control|A hierarchy of control]]", below.) Both ''r'' and ''p'' are input to a simple neural structure with ''r'' excitatory and ''p'' inhibitory. This structure is called a "comparator".&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt; The effect is to subtract ''p'' from ''r'', yielding an error signal ''e'' that indicates the magnitude and sign of the difference between the desired magnitude ''r'' and the currently input magnitude ''p'' of the given perception. The equation representing this in the model is:

2. ''e'' = ''r&amp;ndash;p''

The error signal ''e'' must be transformed to the output quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' (representing the participant's muscular efforts affecting the mouse position). Experiments have shown that in the best model for the output function, the mouse velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' is proportional to the error signal ''e'' by a gain factor ''G'' (that is, ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''G''*''e''). Thus, when the perceptual signal ''p'' is smaller than the reference signal ''r'', the error signal ''e'' has a positive sign, and from it the model computes an upward velocity of the cursor that is proportional to the error.

The next position of the cursor ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current position ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus the velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' times the duration ''dt'' of one iteration of the program. By simple algebra, we substitute ''G''*''e'' (as given above) for ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'', yielding a third equation:

3. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''G''*''e''*''dt''

These three simple equations or program steps constitute the simplest form of the model for the tracking task. When these three simultaneous equations are evaluated over and over with the same random disturbances ''d'' of the target position that the human participant experienced, the output positions and velocities of the cursor duplicate the participant's actions in the tracking task above within 4.0% of their peak-to-peak range, in great detail.

This simple model can be refined with a damping factor ''d'' which reduces the discrepancy between the model and the human participant to 3.6% when the disturbance ''d'' is set to maximum difficulty.

3'. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + [(''G''*''e'')&amp;ndash;(''d''*''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'')]*''dt''

Detailed discussion of this model in (Powers 2008)&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; includes both source and executable code, with which the reader can verify how well this simple program simulates real behavior. No consideration is needed of possible nonlinearities such as the [[Weber-Fechner Law|Weber-Fechner law]], potential noise in the system, continuously varying angles at the joints, and many other factors that could afflict performance if this were a simple linear model. No [[inverse kinematics]] or predictive calculations are required. The model simply reduces the discrepancy between input ''p'' and reference ''r'' continuously as it arises in real time, and that is all that is required&amp;mdash;as predicted by the theory.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers73" /&gt;

==PCT as a solution to GOFAI complexity==

[Symbolic_artificial_intelligence|Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI)] is an early (1960s) approach to building intelligent systems. GOFAI assumes that AI programs are more complex versions of existing software designs, and that they can be built by extending existing procedural approaches and standard software methodologies. Objections to GOFAI can be separated into those based on program semantics, and those based on algorithmic complexity.

Implicit in the  theoretical approach  to GOFAI is the belief that minds (animal and human) are essentially syntactic, that is, made from symbols combined into expressions, a stance known as the [[Physical symbol system|Physical Symbol Systems Hypothesis]]. In recent years, this belief has been challenged by those who believe that minds are essentially semantic, i.e. they process embodied and situated meaning, not abstract data symbols. The 'poster child' of this oppositional stance is a thought experiment (Gedankenexperiment) called [[Chinese Room|Searle's Chinese Room (SCR)]], named after its inventor, philosopher [[John Searle]]. PCT is inherently situated, embodied, and dynamic.

Practical attempts  to building GOFAI soon run into asymptotic increases in algorithmic complexity, so-called 'complexity explosions'. They arise from the control paradigm assumed by GOFAI practitioners, which views governance (= feedforward command + feedback control) as modeling. In other words, for a GOFAI system to 'reason' about the world, it must first build an internal symbolic model of that world upon which it can apply sequences of symbolic manipulations in accord with the principles of [[Turing machine|Turing]] and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] abstract machines. Even small changes in the world must be updated by the GOFAI program, in case they might be critical to its logical output. But any world model which contains sufficient detail to ensure correct GOFAI output is inevitably too complex, with too many moving parts to be practical, so that by the time world changes are updated, the world has already moved on.

PCT avoids the complexity issues of GOFAI by basing its real-time governance on a perceptual window (dimensionally reduced projection) of the world, which is much more tractable than the entire world. [[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, Dyer,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and Powers arrived independently at this insight, which is important for robotics.

==Distinctions from engineering control theory==

In the artificial systems that are specified by [[Control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference signal is considered to be an external input to the 'plant'.&lt;ref name=Astrom/&gt; In engineering control theory, the reference signal or set point is public; in PCT, it is not, but rather must be deduced from the results of the test for controlled variables, as described above in the [[#The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model|methodology section]]. This is because in living systems a reference signal is not an externally accessible input, but instead originates within the system. In the hierarchical model, error output of higher-level control loops, as described in the [[#A hierarchy of control|next section below]], evokes the reference signal ''r'' from synapse-local memory, and the strength of ''r'' is proportional to the (weighted) strength of the error signal or signals from one or more higher-level systems.&lt;ref name=levels&gt;{{Citation | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | first2 =Powers | last2 =William T. | contribution =Levels of intention in behavior | year =1989 | title =Volitional Action | editor-last =Hershberger | editor-first =Wayne | pages =409–430 | place =Amsterdam | publisher =Elsevier B.V. | series =Advances in psychology | volume =62 | isbn =978-0-444-88318-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering control systems, in the case where there are several such reference inputs, a 'Controller' is designed to manipulate those inputs so as to obtain the effect on the output of the system that is desired by the system's designer, and the task of a control theory (so conceived) is to calculate those manipulations so as to avoid instability and oscillation. The designer of a PCT model or simulation specifies no particular desired effect on the output of the system, except that it must be whatever is required to bring the input from the environment (the perceptual signal) into conformity with the reference. In Perceptual Control Theory, the input function for the reference signal is a weighted sum of internally generated signals (in the canonical case, higher-level error signals), and loop stability is determined locally for each loop in the manner sketched in the preceding section on the [[#Mathematics of PCT|mathematics of PCT]] (and elaborated more fully in the [[#References|referenced literature]]). The weighted sum is understood to result from [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|reorganization]].

Engineering control theory is computationally demanding, but as the [[#Mathematics of PCT|preceding section]] shows, PCT is not. For example, contrast the implementation of a model of an [[inverted pendulum]] in engineering control theory&lt;ref&gt;Documented e.g. at [http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1 Miranda, José Luis Corona. 2009.

This is one of many computer demonstrations that are available, with source code, at [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==A hierarchy of control==

Perceptions, in PCT, are constructed and controlled in a hierarchy of levels. For example, visual perception of an object is constructed from differences in light intensity or differences in sensations such as color at its edges. Controlling the shape or location of the object requires altering the perceptions of sensations or intensities (which are controlled by lower-level systems). This organizing principle is applied at all levels, up to the most abstract philosophical and theoretical constructs.

The Russian physiologist Nicolas Bernstein&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Nicolas. 1967. ''Coordination and regulation of movements''. New York: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; independently came to the same conclusion that behavior has to be multiordinal—organized hierarchically, in layers. A simple problem led to this conclusion at about the same time both in PCT and in Bernstein's work. The spinal reflexes act to stabilize limbs against disturbances. Why do they not prevent centers higher in the brain from using those limbs to carry out behavior? Since the brain obviously does use the spinal systems in producing behavior, there must be a principle that allows the higher systems to operate by incorporating the reflexes, not just by overcoming them or turning them off. The answer is that the reference value (setpoint) for a spinal reflex is not static; rather, it is varied by higher-level systems as their means of moving the limbs. This principle applies to higher feedback loops, as each loop presents the same problem to subsystems above it.

Whereas an engineered control system has a reference value or [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] adjusted by some external agency, the reference value for a biological control system cannot be set in this way. The setpoint must come from some internal process. If there is a way for behavior to affect it, any perception may be brought to the state momentarily specified by higher levels and then be maintained in that state against unpredictable disturbances. In a hierarchy of control systems, higher levels adjust the goals of lower levels as their means of approaching their own goals set by still-higher systems. This has important consequences for any proposed external control of an autonomous living control system (organism). At the highest level, reference values (goals) are set by heredity or adaptive processes.

==Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning==

If an organism controls inappropriate perceptions, or if it controls some perceptions to inappropriate values, then it is less likely to bring progeny to maturity, and may die. Consequently, by [[natural selection]] successive generations of organisms evolve so that they control those perceptions that, when controlled with appropriate setpoints, tend to maintain critical internal variables at optimal levels, or at least within non-lethal limits. Powers called these critical internal variables "intrinsic variables" (Ashby's "essential variables").

The mechanism that influences the development of structures of perceptions to be controlled is termed "reorganization", a process within the individual organism that is subject to natural selection just as is the evolved structure of individuals within a species.&lt;ref name="Byte"&gt;For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection].&lt;/ref&gt;

This "reorganization system" is proposed to be part of the inherited structure of the organism. It changes the underlying parameters and connectivity of the control hierarchy in a random-walk manner. There is a basic continuous rate of change in intrinsic variables which proceeds at a speed set by the total error (and stops at zero error), punctuated by random changes in direction in a hyperspace with as many dimensions as there are critical variables. This is a more or less direct adaptation of Ashby's "[[homeostat]]", first adopted into PCT in the 1960 paper&lt;ref name=PCM1960 /&gt; and then changed to use E. coli's method of navigating up gradients of nutrients, as described by Koshland (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Koshland, Daniel. (1980). ''Bacterial chemotaxis as a model behavioral system''. New York: Raven Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reorganization may occur at any level when loss of control at that level causes intrinsic (essential) variables to deviate from genetically determined set points. This is the basic mechanism that is involved in trial-and-error learning, which leads to the acquisition of more systematic kinds of learning processes.&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Without Miracles]]| year=1995| first=Gary| last=Cziko| isbn=0-262-03232-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==

In a hierarchy of interacting control systems, different systems at one level can send conflicting goals to one lower system. When two systems are specifying different goals for the same lower-level variable, they are in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]]. Protracted conflict is experienced by human beings as many forms of psychological distress such as anxiety, obsession, depression, confusion, and vacillation. Severe conflict prevents the affected systems from being able to control, effectively destroying their function for the organism.

Higher level control systems often are able to use known strategies (which are themselves acquired through prior reorganizations) to seek perceptions that don't produce the conflict. Normally, this takes place without notice. If the conflict persists and systematic "problem solving" by higher systems fails, the reorganization system may modify existing systems until they bypass the conflict or until they produce new reference signals (goals) that are not in conflict at lower levels.

When reorganization results in an arrangement that reduces or eliminates the error that is driving it, the process of reorganization slows or stops with the new organization in place. (This replaces the concept of reinforcement learning.) New means of controlling the perceptions involved, and indeed new perceptual constructs subject to control, may also result from reorganization. In simplest terms, the reorganization process varies things until something works, at which point we say that the organism has learned. When simulations of this method are done in the right way, they demonstrate that this method is surprisingly efficient.

==Psychotherapy: the method of levels (MOL)==
{{Main|Method of levels}}

The reorganization concept has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]] (MOL). Using MOL, the therapist aims to help the patient shift his or her awareness to higher levels of perception in order to resolve conflicts and allow reorganization to take place.&lt;ref name=Mansell.Carey.2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mansell |first1=Warren |last2=Carey |first2=Timothy A |last3=Tai |first3=Sara |title=A transdiagnostic approach to CBT using method of levels therapy: distinctive features |year=2012 |series=The CBT distinctive features series |location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415507639 |oclc=774499959 |doi=10.4324/9780203081334 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==

===Learning===

Currently, no one theory has been agreed upon to explain the synaptic, neuronal or systemic basis of learning. Prominent since 1973, however, is the idea that [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) of populations of [[synapse]]s induces learning through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (Bliss &amp; Lømo, 1973; Bliss &amp; Gardner-Medwin, 1973). LTP is a form of [[Hebbian learning]], which proposed that high-frequency, tonic activation of a circuit of neurones increases the efficacy with which they are activated and the size of their response to a given stimulus as compared to the standard neurone (Hebb, 1949).&lt;ref name=Hebb49&gt;{{cite book | last =Hebb | first =Donald | title =The organization of behavior: A neuropsychological theory | publisher =Wiley &amp; Sons | date =1949 | location =New York | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are the principles behind Hebb's famously simple explanation: "Those that fire together, wire together" (Hebb, 1949).

LTP has received much support since it was first observed by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 and is still the subject of many modern studies and clinical research. However, there are possible alternative mechanisms underlying LTP, as presented by Enoki, Hu, Hamilton and Fine in 2009, published in the journal ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]''. They concede that LTP is the basis of learning. However, they firstly propose that LTP occurs in individual synapses, and this plasticity is graded (as opposed to in a binary mode) and bidirectional (Enoki et al., 2009). Secondly, the group suggest that the synaptic changes are expressed solely presynaptically, via changes in the probability of transmitter release (Enoki et al., 2009). Finally, the team predict that the occurrence of LTP could be age-dependent, as the plasticity of a neonatal brain would be higher than that of a mature one. Therefore, the theories differ, as one proposes an on/off occurrence of LTP by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and the other proposes only presynaptic changes, graded ability, and age-dependence.

These theories do agree on one element of LTP, namely, that it must occur through physical changes to the synaptic membrane/s, i.e. synaptic plasticity. Perceptual control theory encompasses both of these views. It proposes the mechanism of [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|'reorganisation']] as the basis of learning. Reorganisation occurs within the inherent control system of a human or animal by restructuring the inter- and intraconnections of its hierarchical organisation, akin to the neuroscientific phenomenon of neural plasticity. This reorganisation initially allows the trial-and-error form of learning, which is seen in babies, and then progresses to more structured learning through association, apparent in infants, and finally to systematic learning, covering the adult ability to learn from both internally and externally  generated stimuli and events. In this way, PCT provides a valid model for learning that combines the biological mechanisms of LTP with an explanation of the progression and change of mechanisms associated with developmental ability (Plooij 1984,&lt;ref name=Plooij1984&gt;{{cite book | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | title =The behavioral development of free-living chimpanzee babies and infants. | publisher =Ablex | date =1984 | location =Norwood, N.J. | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1987,&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1987&gt;{{cite journal | last =van de Rijt-Plooij | first =Hetty | last2 =Plooij | first2 =Frans | author-link = | title =Growing independence, conflict and learning in mother-infant relations in free-ranging chimpanzees | journal =Behaviour | volume =101 | issue = | pages =1–86 | publisher = | location = | date =1987 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1163/156853987x00378| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003,&lt;ref name=Plooij2003&gt;{{Citation | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | contribution = | year =2003 | title =The trilogy of mind | editor-last =Heimann | editor-first =M. | volume =Regression periods in human infancy | pages =185–205 | place =Mahwah, New Jersey | publisher =Erlbaum | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plooij &amp; Plooij (1990),&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1990&gt;{{cite journal | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | last2 =van de Rijt-Plooij | first2 =Hetty | title =Developmental transitions as successive reorganizations of a control hierarchy | journal =American Behavioral Scientist | volume =34 | issue = | pages =67–80 | publisher = | location = | date =1990 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1177/0002764290034001007| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013&lt;ref name="Plooij-Plooij2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=[[The Wonder Weeks]]: How to Stimulate Your Baby's Mental Development and Help Him Turn His 10 Predictable, Great, Fussy Phases into Magical Leaps Forward|last=van de Rijt-Plooij|first=Hetty|last2=Plooij|first2=Frans|date=October 22, 2013|publisher=Kiddy World Publishing|year=|isbn=9491882007|location=Arnhem, Netherlands|pages=480|language=|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Powers (2008) produced a simulation of arm co-ordination.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; He suggested that in order to move your arm, fourteen control systems that control fourteen joint angles are involved, and they reorganise simultaneously and independently. It was found that for optimum performance, the output functions must be organised in a way so as each control system's output only affects the one environmental variable it is perceiving. In this simulation, the reorganising process is working as it should, and just as Powers suggests that it works in humans, reducing outputs that cause error and increasing those that reduce error. Initially, the disturbances have large effects on the angles of the joints, but over time the joint angles match the reference signals more closely due to the system being reorganised. Powers (2008) suggests that in order to achieve coordination of joint angles to produce desired movements, instead of calculating how multiple joint angles must change to produce this movement the brain uses negative feedback systems to generate the joint angles that are required. A single reference signal that is varied in a higher-order system can generate a movement that requires several joint angles to change at the same time.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt;

===Hierarchical organisation===

Botvinick (2008) proposed that one of the founding insights of the cognitive revolution was the recognition of hierarchical structure in human behavior. Despite decades of research, however, the computational mechanisms underlying hierarchically organized behavior are still not fully understood. Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito (2009) propose that the fundamental goal in cognitive neuroscience is to characterize the functional organization of the frontal cortex that supports the control of action.

Recent neuroimaging data has supported the hypothesis that the frontal lobes are organized hierarchically, such that control is supported in progressively caudal regions as control moves to more concrete specification of action. However, it is still not clear whether lower-order control processors are differentially affected by impairments in higher-order control when between-level interactions are required to complete a task, or whether there are feedback influences of lower-level on higher-level control (Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito 2009).

Botvinik (2008) found that all existing models of hierarchically structured behavior share at least one general assumption – that the hierarchical, part–whole organization of human action is mirrored in the internal or neural representations underlying it. Specifically, the assumption is that there exist representations not only of low-level motor behaviors, but also separable representations of higher-level behavioral units. The latest crop of models provides new insights, but also poses new or refined questions for empirical research, including how abstract action representations emerge through learning, how they interact with different modes of action control, and how they sort out within the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

Perceptual control theory (PCT) can provide an explanatory model of neural organisation that deals with the current issues. PCT describes the hierarchical character of behavior as being determined by control of hierarchically organized perception. Control systems in the body and in the internal environment of billions of interconnected neurons within the brain are responsible for keeping perceptual signals within survivable limits in the unpredictably variable environment from which those perceptions are derived. PCT does not propose that there is an internal model within which the brain simulates behavior before issuing commands to execute that behavior. Instead, one of its characteristic features is the principled lack of cerebral organisation of behavior. Rather, behavior is the organism's variable means to reduce the discrepancy between perceptions and reference values which are based on various external and internal inputs (Cools, 1985). Behavior must constantly adapt and change for an organism to maintain its perceptual goals. In this way, PCT can provide an explanation of abstract learning through spontaneous reorganisation of the hierarchy. PCT proposes that conflict occurs between disparate reference values for a given perception rather than between different responses (Mansell 2011), and that learning is implemented as trial-and-error changes of the properties of control systems (Marken &amp; Powers 1989),&lt;ref name=levels/&gt; rather than any specific response being ''reinforced''. In this way, behavior remains adaptive to the environment as it unfolds, rather than relying on learned action patterns that may not fit.

Hierarchies of perceptual control have been simulated in computer models and have been shown to provide a close match to behavioral data. For example, Marken&lt;ref name=Marken86&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Perceptual organization of behavior: A hierarchical control model of coordinated action. | journal =Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume =12 | issue =3 | pages =267–276 | publisher = | location = | date =Aug 1986 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/0096-1523.12.3.267 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an experiment comparing the behavior of a perceptual control hierarchy computer model with that of six healthy volunteers in three experiments. The participants were required to keep the distance between a left line and a centre line equal to that of the centre line and a right line. They were also instructed to keep both distances equal to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. They had 2 paddles in their hands, one controlling the left line and one controlling the middle line. To do this, they had to resist random disturbances applied to the positions of the lines. As the participants achieved control, they managed to nullify the expected effect of the disturbances by moving their paddles. The correlation between the behavior of subjects and the model in all the experiments approached .99. It is proposed that the organization of models of hierarchical control systems such as this informs us about the organization of the human subjects whose behavior it so closely reproduces.

==Robotics==

PCT has significant implications for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. The architecture, of a hierarchy of perceptual controllers, is an ideal and comparatively simple implementation for artificial systems by avoiding the need to generate specific actions whether by complex models of the external world or the computation from input-output mappings. 
This is in stark contrast to traditional methodologies, such as the computational approach and Behavior-based Robotics.

The application of perceptual control to Robotics was outlined in a seminal paper &lt;ref name=Young2017&gt;{{cite journal | last =Young| first =Rupert | author-link = | title =A General Architecture for Robotics Systems: A Perception-Based Approach to Artificial Life. | journal =Artificial Life| volume =23 | issue =2 | pages =236–286 | date =Jun 2017 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Artificial Life journal by Rupert Young of Perceptual Robots in 2017.  The architecture has been applied to a number of real-world robotic systems including robotic rovers,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional approaches to robotics, which generally depend upon the computation of actions in specific situations, result in inflexible, clumsy robots unable to cope with the dynamic nature of the world. PCT robots, on the other hand, demonstrate robots that inherently resist and counter the chaotic, unpredictable world.

==Current situation and prospects==

The preceding explanation of PCT principles provides justification of how this theory can provide a valid explanation of neural organisation and how it can explain some of the current issues of conceptual models.

Perceptual control theory currently proposes a hierarchy of 11 levels of perceptions controlled by systems in the human mind and neural architecture. These are: intensity, sensation, configuration, transition, event, relationship, category, sequence, program, principle, and system concept. Diverse perceptual signals at a lower level (e.g. visual perceptions of intensities) are combined in an input function to construct a single perception at the higher level (e.g. visual perception of a color sensation). The perceptions that are constructed and controlled at the lower levels are passed along as the perceptual inputs at the higher levels. The higher levels in turn control by adjusting the reference levels (goals) of the lower levels, in effect telling the lower levels what to perceive.&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"/&gt;

While many computer demonstrations of principles have been developed, the proposed higher levels are difficult to model because too little is known about how the brain works at these levels. Isolated higher-level control processes can be investigated, but models of an extensive hierarchy of control are still only conceptual, or at best rudimentary.

Perceptual control theory has not been widely accepted in mainstream psychology, but has been effectively used in a considerable range of domains&lt;ref&gt;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/november-2015/perceptual-control-revolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/book-review-behavior-the-control-of-perception/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJHCS"&gt;The June 1999 Issue of ''The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' contained papers ranging from tracking through cockpit layout to self-image and crowd dynamics.&lt;/ref&gt; in human factors,&lt;ref name="CBUT"&gt;PCT lies at the foundation of [[Component-Based Usability Testing]].&lt;/ref&gt; clinical psychology, and psychotherapy (the "[[Method of Levels]]"), it is the basis for a considerable body of research in sociology,&lt;ref&gt;For example: McClelland, Kent A. and Thomas J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">'''Phosphate-buffered saline''' (abbreviated '''PBS''') is a [[buffer solution]] commonly used in [[biology|biological research]]. It is a water-based salt solution containing [[disodium hydrogen phosphate]], [[sodium chloride]] and, in some formulations, [[potassium chloride]] and [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. The buffer helps to maintain a constant pH. The [[osmolarity]] and ion concentrations of the solutions match those of the human body ([[tonicity|isotonic]]).

==Applications==
PBS has many uses because it is isotonic and non-toxic to most cells. These uses include substance dilution and cell container rinsing. PBS with [[EDTA]] is also used to disengage attached and clumped cells. [[Divalent metal]]s such as [[zinc]], however, cannot be added as this will result in precipitation.  For these types of applications, [[Good's buffers]] are recommended.

==Preparation==
There are many different ways to prepare PBS solutions (one of them is [[Renato Dulbecco|Dulbecco's]] phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), which has a lower phosphate concentration than standard PBS&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlRSvfNFRc ''Difference between phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS)]&lt;/ref&gt;). Some formulations do not contain potassium and magnesium, while other ones contain calcium and/or magnesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dulbecco | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1954 | title = Plaque formation and isolation of pure lines with poliomyelitis viruses | url = | journal = J.

Start with 800 mL of distilled water to dissolve all salts. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl. Add distilled water to a total volume of 1 liter. The resultant 1x PBS should have a final concentration of 10 mM PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl.

'''The pH of PBS is ~7.4.''' When making buffer solutions, it is good practice to always measure the pH directly using a pH meter. If necessary, pH can be adjusted using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.

PBS can also be prepared by using commercially made PBS buffer tablets or pouches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicago.se/sites/default/files/pdf/productsheets/PBS_Buffer_v._01.pdf Medicago AB, (2010) Phosphate buffered saline specification sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

If used in cell culturing, the solution can be dispensed into aliquots and sterilized by [[autoclaving]] or [[filtration]]. Sterilization may not be necessary depending on its use. PBS can be stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. However, concentrated stock solutions may [[precipitate]] when cooled and should be kept at room temperature until precipitate has completely dissolved before use.

==Medical uses==

===Dietary supplement===

The uses of KI include as a nutritional supplement in animal feeds and also the human diet. For the latter, it is the most common additive used to "iodize" [[sodium chloride|table salt]] (a public health measure to prevent [[iodine deficiency]] in populations that get little seafood). The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from [[iodised salt]]s that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Katarzyna |last1=Waszkowiak |first2=Krystyna |last2=Szymandera-Buszka |title=Effect of storage conditions on potassium iodide stability in iodised table salt and collagen preparations |journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=895–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01538.x |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Potassium iodate|Potassium iod''ate'']] ([[Potassium|K]][[Iodine|I]][[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is used to add iodine to some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation. [[Dextrose]] or [[sodium thiosulfate]] are often added to iodized table salt to stabilize potassium iodide thus reducing loss of the volatile chemical.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.saltinstitute.org/news-articles/iodized-salt/| publisher = Salt Institute| title = Iodized Salt| date = July 13, 2013| accessdate = June 13, 2013| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131016171353/http://www.saltinstitute.org/news-articles/iodized-salt/| archivedate = October 16, 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thyroid protection===
[[File:Pheochromocytoma Scan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pheochromocytoma]] seen as dark sphere in center of the body. Image is by [[MIBG]] [[scintigraphy]] with radiation from [[Isotopes of iodine#Notable radioisotopes|radioiodine]] in the MIBG. However, note unwanted uptake of radioiodine from the pharmaceutical by the thyroid gland in the neck, in both images (front and back) of the same patient. Radioactivity is also seen in the bladder.]]
Thyroid iodine uptake blockade with potassium iodide is used in [[nuclear medicine]] [[scintigraphy]] and therapy with some radioiodinated compounds that are not targeted to the thyroid, such as [[iobenguane]] ([[MIBG]]), which is used to image or treat neural tissue tumors, or iodinated [[fibrinogen]], which is used in [[fibrinogen scan]]s to investigate clotting. These compounds contain iodine, but not in the iodide form. However, since they may be ultimately metabolized or break down to radioactive iodide, it is common to administer non-radioactive potassium iodide to ensure that iodide from these radiopharmaceuticals is not sequestered by the normal affinity of the thyroid for iodide.

U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]-approved dosing of potassium iodide for this purpose with iobenguane, is as follows (per 24 hours): infants less than 1 month old, 16&amp;nbsp;mg; children 1 month to 3 years, 32&amp;nbsp;mg; children 3 years to 18 years, 65&amp;nbsp;mg; adults 130&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalsky RJ, Falen, SW. Radiopharmaceuticals in Nuclear Pharmacy and Nuclear Medicine. 2nd ed. Washington DC: American Pharmacists Association; 2004.{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some sources recommend alternative dosing regimens.&lt;ref name="eanm.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007201923/https://www.eanm.org/scientific_info/guidelines/gl_paed_mibg.pdf?PHPSESSID=46d05b62d235c36a12166bf939b656c7 | title=Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all sources are in agreement on the necessary ''duration'' of thyroid blockade, although agreement appears to have been reached about the ''necessity'' of blockade for both [[scintigraphic]] and therapeutic applications of iobenguane. Commercially available iobenguane is labeled with [[iodine-123]], and product labeling recommends administration of potassium iodide 1 hour prior to administration of the radiopharmaceutical for all age groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearpharmacy.uams.edu/resources/adreview.pdf |title=43-2035 AdreView Panel PI 091908:Layout 1 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823113112/http://nuclearpharmacy.uams.edu/resources/adreview.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[European Association of Nuclear Medicine]] recommends (for iobenguane labeled with either isotope), that potassium iodide administration begin one day prior to radiopharmaceutical administration, and continue until the day following the injection, with the exception of new-borns, who do not require potassium iodide doses following radiopharmaceutical injection.&lt;ref name="eanm.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NUREG1250"&gt;US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Report on the Accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, NUREG-1250. {{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1250/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708022907/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1250/ |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product labeling for diagnostic [[iodine-131]] iobenguane recommends potassium iodide administration one day before injection and continuing 5 to 7 days following administration, in keeping with the much longer half-life of this isotope and its greater danger to the thyroid.&lt;ref&gt;Iobenguane Sulfate I 131 Injection Diagnostic package insert. Bedford, MA: CIS-US, Inc. July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Iodine-131 iobenguane used for therapeutic purposes requires a different pre-medication duration, beginning 24–48 hours prior to iobenguane injection and continuing 10–15 days following injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007202042/https://www.eanm.org/scientific_info/guidelines/gl_radio_ther_benzyl.pdf?PHPSESSID=46d05b62d235c36a12166bf939b656c7 | title=Wayback Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved potassium iodide to protect [[thyroid]] glands from [[radioiodine|radioactive iodine]] involving accidents or fission emergencies.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In an accidental event or attack on a [[nuclear power plant]], or in [[Nuclear fallout|nuclear bomb fallout]], volatile [[fission product]] [[radionuclides]] may be released. Of these products, {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131|link=yes}} is one of the most common and is particularly dangerous to the thyroid gland because it may lead to [[thyroid cancer]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} By saturating the body with a source of stable iodide prior to exposure, inhaled or ingested {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} tends to be excreted, which prevents radioiodine uptake by the thyroid. According to one 2000 study "KI administered up to 48 h before {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} exposure can almost completely block thyroid uptake and therefore greatly reduce the thyroid absorbed dose. However, KI administration 96 h or more before {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} exposure has no significant protective effect. In contrast, KI administration after exposure to radioiodine induces a smaller and rapidly decreasing blockade effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zanzonico PB, Becker DV |title=Effects of time of administration and dietary iodine levels on potassium iodide (KI) blockade of thyroid irradiation by 131I from radioactive fallout |journal=Health Phys |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=660–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10832925 |doi= 10.1097/00004032-200006000-00008|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For optimal [[Prophylaxis#Prophylaxis|prevention]], KI must be dosed daily until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodine by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists.

Emergency 130 milligrams potassium iodide doses provide 100&amp;nbsp;mg iodide (the other 30&amp;nbsp;mg is the potassium in the compound), which is roughly 700 times larger than the normal nutritional need (see [[recommended dietary allowance]]) for iodine, which is 150 micrograms (0.15&amp;nbsp;mg) of iodine (as iodide) per day for an adult. The typical tablet actually weighs 160&amp;nbsp;mg. 130&amp;nbsp;mg of which is potassium iodide, and 30&amp;nbsp;mg being excipients, such as binding agents.

Potassium iodide cannot protect against any other mechanisms of [[radiation poisoning]], nor can it provide any degree of protection against [[dirty bomb]]s that produce radionuclides other than those of iodine.

The potassium iodide in [[iodized salt]] is insufficient for this use.&lt;ref name=who-japan&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs: Japan nuclear concerns|url=http://www.who.int/hac/crises/jpn/faqs/en/index6.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401222354/http://www.who.int/hac/crises/jpn/faqs/en/index6.html|archivedate=1 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A likely [[lethal dose]] of salt (more than a kilogram&lt;ref name=cfr&gt;By {{CodeFedReg|21|184|1634}}, the maximum allowable concentration of iodine in salt in the U.S. is .01%&lt;/ref&gt;) would be needed to equal the potassium iodide in one tablet.&lt;ref name=nacl-msds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/SO/sodium_chloride.html|title=Safety (MSDS) data for sodium chloride}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] does not recommend KI prophylaxis for adults over 40 years, unless the radiation dose from inhaled radioiodine is expected to threaten thyroid function, because the KI side effects increase with age and may exceed the KI protective effects; "...unless doses to the thyroid from inhalation rise to levels threatening thyroid function, that is of the order of about 5 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]]. Such radiation doses will not occur far away from an accident site."&lt;ref name="WHO_Guidelines"/&gt;

The U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] restated these two years later as "The downward KI (potassium iodide) dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard (daily) dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65&amp;nbsp;mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., &gt;70&amp;nbsp;kg [154&amp;nbsp;lbs]) should receive the full adult dose (130&amp;nbsp;mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16&amp;nbsp;mg) of KI."&lt;ref name="HHS_Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1233/ML12339A632.pdf|format=PDF|title=Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)|date=December 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415202737/https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1233/ML12339A632.pdf|archivedate=2017-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSKI (i.e., the "saturated solution of KI" rather than tablets) may be used in radioiodine-contamination emergencies (i.e., nuclear accidents) to "block" the thyroid's uptake of radioiodine, at a dose of two drops of SSKI per day for an adult. This is not the same as blocking the thyroid's release of thyroid hormone, for which the adult dose is different (and is actually higher by a factor of 7 or 8), and for which KI anti-radiation pills (not a common medical treatment form of KI) are not usually available in pharmacies, or normally used in hospitals, or by physicians. Although the two forms of potassium iodide are completely interchangeable, normally in practice the SSKI solution, which is the historical medical form of high dose iodine, is generally used for all medical purposes save for radioiodine prophylaxis. For protection of the thyroid against radioiodine (iodine-131) contamination, the convenient standard 130&amp;nbsp;mg KI pill is used, if available. As noted, the equivalent two drops of SSKI (equaling the dose of one KI pill) may be used for this purpose, if the pills are not available.

==Side effects==
There is reason for caution with prescribing the ingestion of high doses of potassium iodide and iodate, as their unnecessary use can cause conditions such as the [[Jod-Basedow phenomenon|Jod-Basedow phenomena]], trigger and/or worsen [[hyperthyroidism]] and [[hypothyroidism]], and then cause temporary or even permanent thyroid conditions. It can also cause [[sialadenitis]] (an inflammation of the salivary gland), gastrointestinal disturbances, and rashes. Potassium iodide is also not recommended for people with [[dermatitis herpetiformis]] and [[hypocomplementemic vasculitis]]&amp;nbsp;– conditions that are linked to a risk of iodine sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thyroid-info.com/potassium-iodide.htm |title=Information on Radiation, Health and the Thyroid, Including Iodine Testing, Potassium Iodide, and Thyroid Testing |publisher=Thyroid-info.com |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304063106/http://thyroid-info.com/potassium-iodide.htm |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some reports of potassium iodide treatment causing swelling of the [[parotid gland]] (one of the three [[glands]] that secrete [[saliva]]), due to its stimulatory effects on saliva production.&lt;ref name="Pathophysiology"&gt;McCance; Huether. "Pathophysiology: The biological basis for disease in Adults and Children". 5th Edition. Elsievier Publishing{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A saturated solution of KI (SSKI) is typically given orally in adult doses several times a day (5 drops of SSKI assumed to be {{Frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;mL) for thyroid blockade (to prevent the thyroid from excreting thyroid hormone) and occasionally this dose is also used, when iodide is used as an expectorant (the total dose is about one gram KI per day for an adult). The anti-radioiodine doses used for {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} uptake blockade are lower, and range downward from 100&amp;nbsp; mg a day for an adult, to less than this for children (see table). All of these doses should be compared with the far lower dose of iodine needed in normal nutrition, which is only 150&amp;nbsp;μg per day (150 micrograms, not milligrams).

At maximal doses, and sometimes at much lower doses, side effects of iodide used for medical reasons, in doses of 1000 times the normal nutritional need, may include: acne, loss of appetite, or upset stomach (especially during the first several days, as the body adjusts to the medication). More severe side effects that require notification of a physician are: fever, weakness, unusual tiredness, swelling in the neck or throat, mouth sores, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, irregular heartbeat, numbness or tingling of the hands or feet, or a metallic taste in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=March 23, 2011 |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/potassium_iodide-oral/article.htm |title=POTASSIUM IODIDE - ORAL (SSKI) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions |publisher=Medicinenet.com |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324221248/http://www.medicinenet.com/potassium_iodide-oral/article.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of a particular 'Iodine tablet' used in [[portable water purification]] has also been determined as somewhat effective at reducing radioiodine uptake. In a small study on human subjects, who for each of their 90-day trial, ingested four 20 milligram tetraglycine hydroperiodide(TGHP) water tablets, with each tablet releasing 8 milligrams (ppm) of free titratable iodine;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmacalway.com/FAQ.html |title=Potable Aqua Questions and Answers |accessdate=2013-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114070346/http://www.pharmacalway.com/FAQ.html |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that the biological uptake of radioactive iodine in these human subjects dropped to, and remained at, a value of less than 2% the radioiodine uptake rate of that observed in control subjects who went fully exposed to radioiodine without treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LeMar |first1=H. J. |title=Thyroid adaptation to chronic tetraglycine hydroperiodide water purification tablet use |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |date=1 January 1995 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=220–223 |doi=10.1210/jc.80.1.220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a radioiodine release the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defence in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in the event of a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against [[carcinogenic]] radioiodine bioaccumulation.

The ingestion of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also not without its dangers, such as [[hypothyroidism]]. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine [[bioaccumulation]] in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.

Potassium iodide in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid. Potassium iodide is a possible [[Teratology|teratogen]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Industrial uses==
KI is used with silver nitrate to make [[silver iodide]] (AgI), an important chemical in film photography. KI is a component in some disinfectants and hair treatment chemicals. KI is also used as a [[fluorescence quenching]] agent in biomedical research, an application that takes advantage of collisional quenching of fluorescent substances by the iodide ion. However, for several fluorophores addition of KI in µM-mM concentrations results in increase of fluorescence intensity, and iodide acts as fluorescence enhancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andriy |last1=Chmyrov |first2=Tor |last2=Sandén |first3=Jerker |last3=Widengren |year=2010 |title=Iodide as a Fluorescence Quencher and Promoter—Mechanisms and Possible Implications |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B |volume=114 |issue=34 |pages=11282–91 |pmid=20695476 |doi=10.1021/jp103837f|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-26847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potassium iodide is a component in the electrolyte of [[Dye-sensitized_solar_cell|dye sensitised solar cell]]s (DSSC) along with iodine.

Potassium iodide finds its most important applications in organic synthesis mainly in the preparation of aryl iodides in the [[Sandmeyer reaction]], starting from aryl amines. Aryl iodides are in turn used to attach aryl groups to other organics by nucleophilic substitution, with iodide ion as the leaving group.

==Chemistry==
Potassium iodide is an [[ionic compound]] which is made of the following [[ion]]s: K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. It crystallises in the [[sodium chloride]] structure. It is produced industrially by treating KOH with iodine.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

It is a white [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]], which is the most commercially significant iodide compound, with approximately 37,000 tons produced in 1985. It absorbs water less readily than [[sodium iodide]], making it easier to work with.

Aged and impure samples are yellow because of the slow [[oxidation]] of the salt to [[potassium carbonate]] and elemental [[iodine]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann's | author = Phyllis A. Lyday | title = Iodine and Iodine Compounds | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a14_381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|4 KI + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

===Inorganic chemistry===
Since the [[iodide]] ion is a mild [[Redox|reducing agent]], {{math|I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} is easily oxidised to {{math|[[iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]}} by powerful [[redox|oxidising agents]] such as [[chlorine]]:
:{{math|2 KI([[aqueous|aq]])  +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)  →  2 [[Potassium chloride|KCl]](aq)  +  I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)}}
This reaction is employed in the isolation of iodine from natural sources. Air will oxidize iodide, as evidenced by the observation of a purple extract when aged samples of KI are rinsed with [[dichloromethane]]. As formed under acidic conditions, [[hydriodic acid]] (HI) is a stronger reducing agent.&lt;ref&gt;N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, ''Chemistry of the Elements'', Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK, 1984{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 71st edition, CRC Press, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Merck Index'', 7th edition, Merck &amp; Co., Rahway, New Jersey, 1960{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other iodide salts, {{math|KI}} forms {{math|[[triiodide|I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]}} when combined with elemental [[iodine]].
:{{math|KI(aq)  +  [[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[solid|s]])  →  KI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(aq)}}
Unlike {{math|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} salts can be highly water-soluble. Through this reaction, [[iodine]] is used in [[redox]] [[titration]]s. Aqueous {{math|KI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, "[[Lugol's solution]]", is used as a disinfectant and as an etchant for gold surfaces.

Potassium iodide and [[silver nitrate]] are used to make [[silver(I) iodide]], which is used for high speed [[photographic film]] and for cloud-seeding:
:{{math|KI(aq)  +  [[Silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]](aq)  →  AgI(s)  +  [[Potassium nitrate|KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]](aq)}}

===Organic chemistry===
KI serves as a source of iodide in [[organic synthesis]]. A useful application is in the preparation of aryl iodides from [[arenediazonium salts]].&lt;ref&gt;L. G. Wade, ''Organic Chemistry'', 5th ed., pp. 871-2, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle RIver, New Jersey, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. March, ''Advanced Organic Chemistry'', 4th ed., pp. 670-1, Wiley, New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

[[Image:Sandmeyer reaction.svg|400px]]

KI, acting as a source of iodide, may also act as a [[nucleophilic catalyst]] for the alkylation of alkyl [[chloride]]s, [[bromide]]s, or [[mesylate]]s.

==History==
Potassium iodide has been used medically since at least 1820.&lt;ref name=Or2012/&gt; Some of the earliest uses included for [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=Or2012/&gt;

===Chernobyl===
Potassium iodide's (KI) value as a radiation protective (thyroid blocking) agent was demonstrated following the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster]] in April, 1986, a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) was administered to 10.5 million children and 7 million adults in [[Poland]]&lt;ref name="HHS_Guidelines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJM93"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(93)90089-8 |title=Iodide prophylaxis in Poland after the chernobyl reactor accident: Benefits and risks |year=1993 |last1=Nauman |first1=Janusz |last2=Wolff |first2=Jan |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=524–32 |pmid=8498398|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1253782 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a preventative measure against accumulation of radioactive {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}} in the [[thyroid]] gland.

Reports differ concerning whether people in the areas immediately surrounding Chernobyl itself were given the supplement.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/Causes.ChernobyJF.doc|format=doc|last=Frot|first=Jacques|title=The Causes of the Chernobyl Event|publisher=Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy|others=Berol Robinson (trans.)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408134449/http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/Causes.ChernobyJF.doc|archivedate=2012-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NUREG1250" /&gt; however the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reported, "thousands of measurements of I-131 (radioactive iodine) activity...suggest that the observed levels were lower than would have been expected had this prophylactic measure not been taken. The use of KI...was credited with permissible iodine content in 97% of the evacuees tested."&lt;ref name="NUREG1250" /&gt;

With the passage of time, people living in irradiated areas where KI was not available have developed thyroid cancer at epidemic levels, which is why the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported "The data clearly demonstrate the risks of thyroid radiation... KI can be used [to] provide safe and effective protection against thyroid cancer caused by irradiation."&lt;ref name="FDA Talk Paper"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration, FDA Talk Paper: Guidance on Protection Against Thyroid Cancer in Case of a Nuclear Accident&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernobyl also demonstrated that the need to protect the thyroid from radiation was greater than expected. Within ten years of the accident, it became clear that thyroid damage caused by released radioactive iodine was virtually the only adverse health effect that could be measured. As reported by the NRC, studies after the accident showed that "As of 1996, except for thyroid cancer, there has been no confirmed increase in the rates of other cancers, including leukemia, among the... public, that have been attributed to releases from the accident."&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Assessment of the Use of Potassium Iodide (KI) As a Public Protective Action During Severe Reactor Accidents Quoting Thyroid Cancer in Children of Belarus Following the Chernobyl Accident, NUREG-1633 {{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2002/secy2002-0089/attachment1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514120412/http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2002/secy2002-0089/attachment1.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-14 |df= }} {{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But equally important to the question of KI is the fact that radioactivity releases are not "local" events. Researchers at the World Health Organization accurately located and counted the cancer victims from Chernobyl and were startled to find that "the increase in incidence [of thyroid cancer] has been documented up to 500 km from the accident site... significant doses from radioactive iodine can occur hundreds of kilometers from the site, beyond emergency planning zones."&lt;ref name="WHO_Guidelines" /&gt;  Consequently, far more people than anticipated were affected by the radiation, which caused the United Nations to report in 2002 that "The number of people with thyroid cancer... has exceeded expectations. Over 11,000 cases have already been reported."&lt;ref name="OCHA"&gt;United Nations: Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Chernobyl, a Continuing Catastrophe, New York and Geneva, 2000{{page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nagasaki===
These findings were consistent with studies of the effects of previous radioactivity releases. In 1945, millions of Japanese were exposed to radiation from nuclear weapons, and the effects can still be measured. Today, nearly half (44.8%) the survivors of Nagasaki studied have identifiable thyroid disease, with the American Medical Association (AMA) reporting "it is remarkable that a biological effect from a single brief environmental exposure nearly 60 years in the past is still present and can be detected."&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.295.9.1060 |title=Thyroid Disease 60 Years After Hiroshima and 20 Years After Chernobyl |year=2006 |last1=Boice |first1=J. D. |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=9 |pmid=16507808 |pages=1060–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear weapons testing===
The development of thyroid cancer among residents in the [[North Pacific]] from radioactive fallout following the [[Pacific Proving Grounds|United States' nuclear weapons testing]] in the 1950s (on islands nearly 200 miles downwind of the tests) were instrumental in the 1978 decision by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to issue a request for the availability of KI for thyroid protection in the event of a release from a commercial nuclear power plant or weapons-related nuclear incident. Noting that KI's effectiveness was "virtually complete" and finding that iodine in the form of KI was substantially superior to other forms including [[Potassium iodate|iodate (KIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]] in terms of safety, effectiveness, lack of side effects, and speed of onset, the FDA invited manufacturers to submit applications to produce and market KI.&lt;ref name="US Fed. Reg."&gt;{{cite journal|journal=US Federal Register|title=Federal Register|volume=43|issue=242|date=December 15, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fukushima===
It was reported on March 16, 2011, that potassium iodide tablets were given preventatively to U.S. Naval air crew members flying within 70 nautical miles of the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] damaged in the earthquake (8.9/9.0 magnitude) and ensuing tsunami on March 11, 2011. The measures were seen as precautions, and the Pentagon said no U.S. forces have shown signs of radiation poisoning. By March 20, the US Navy instructed personnel coming within 100 miles of the reactor to take the pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/22/japan.nuclear.reactors/index.html|title=Vegetables near stricken plant test high for radiation|date=2011-03-22|publisher=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109153351/http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/22/japan.nuclear.reactors/index.html|archivedate=2012-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the central storage of iodine-pills is located in [[Zoetermeer]], near [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;De Limburger (11-March-2016) [https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20160311_00011860/zes-vragen-over-half-miljoen-jodiumpillen six questions about a half of million iodine pills]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Government [https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/straling/jodiumtabletten radiation iodine tablets]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, iodine pills were distributed in the Netherlands by the Dutch Government to certain groups of people living in an area within 100&amp;nbsp;km from a nuclear power plant. Persons up to 40 years of age, within a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;km, and children up to 18 years in an area of 20–100&amp;nbsp;km of the nuclear powerplant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/jodiumtabletten Iodine tablets at  rijksoverheid.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/brochures/2017/09/29/factsheet-verspreiding-jodiumtabletten/Context+Verspreiding+Jodiumtabletten.pdf Factsheet distribution iodine tablets at rijksoverheid.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hundreds of families in [[Peel en Maas]], [[Maasgouw]], [[Beesel]] and [[Leudal]] did not get any pills at all. After a request [[Veiligheidsregio Limburg-Noord|Safety region Limburg-Noord]] the ministry sent 150 boxes extra. Only 50 of these boxes were available in the southern region of Limburg. Tablets were only provided to parents who had reported their municipality. Due to unfamiliarity with this subject matter, many parents were not notified. Otherwise the stock would be used too quickly.

The reason for that all was kept quiet, and also turned not from the e-mails. On questions of the newspaper [[the Limburger]], the security region answered, "that they were "only a intermediate between the municipalities and Ministry. The Ministry would have indicated that there is no additional calls are allowed." The Ministry denied all involvement in this region: the safety region was responsible for the distribution. "You could use the communication that you wanted."&lt;ref&gt;De Limburger (23-04-2018) [https://www.limburger.nl/cnt/dmf20180522_00062365/fouten-bij-verzenden-jodiumpillen-voor-kernramp-bewust-stilgehoudenerrors when sending iodine pills for nuclear disaster deliberately kept quiet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulations==
Three companies (Anbex, Inc., Fleming Co, and [[Recipharm]] of Sweden) have met the strict FDA requirements for manufacturing and testing of KI, and they offer products (IOSAT, ThyroShield, and ThyroSafe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Toxico-terrorism: emergency response and clinical approach to chemical, biological, and radiological agents, Volume 755 |last=B.

In 2012, Fleming Co. sold all its product rights and manufacturing facility to other companies and no longer exists. ThyroShield is currently not in production. The Swedish manufacturing facility for Thyrosafe, a half-strength potassium iodide tablet for thyroid protection from radiation, was mentioned on the secret US 2008 [[Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative]] leaked by Wikileaks in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09STATE15113_a.html|title=REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:CRITICAL FOREIGN DEPENDENCIES|date=February 2009|publisher=Wikileaks|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105094350/https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09STATE15113_a.html|archivedate=2016-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tablets of potassium iodide are supplied for emergency purposes related to blockade of radioiodine uptake, a common form of [[radiation poisoning]] due to environmental contamination by the short-lived fission product {{SimpleNuclide2|iodine|131}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://preparedness.com/potioddosgui.html |title=Potassium Iodide Dosage Guidelines &amp; Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Preparedness.com |date=2001-12-10 |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317001850/http://preparedness.com/potioddosgui.html |archivedate=2011-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potassium iodide may also be administered pharmaceutically for [[thyroid storm]].

For reasons noted above, therapeutic drops of SSKI, or 130&amp;nbsp;mg tablets of KI as used for nuclear fission accidents, are not used as nutritional supplements, since an SSKI drop or nuclear-emergency tablet provides 300 to 700 times more iodine than the daily adult nutritional requirement. Dedicated nutritional iodide tablets containing 0.15&amp;nbsp;mg (150 micrograms (µg)) of iodide, from KI or from various other sources (such as kelp extract) are marketed as supplements, but they are not to be confused with the much higher pharmaceutical dose preparations.

Potassium iodide can be conveniently prepared as a saturated solution, abbreviated SSKI. This method of delivering potassium iodide does not require a method to weigh out the potassium iodide so it can be used in an emergency situation. KI crystals are simply added to water until no more KI will dissolve and instead sits at the bottom of the container. With pure water, the concentration of KI in the solution depends only on the temperature. Potassium iodide is highly soluble in water so SSKI is a concentrated source of KI. At 20 degrees Celsius the solubility of KI is 140-148&amp;nbsp;grams per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5906.htm |title=Solubility of KI in water |publisher=Hazard.com |date=1998-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423195709/http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/p5906.htm |archivedate=2012-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the volumes of KI and water are approximately additive, the resulting SSKI solution will contain about 1.00&amp;nbsp;gram (1000&amp;nbsp;mg) KI per milliliter (mL) of solution. This is 100% weight/volume (note units of [[mass concentration (chemistry)|mass concentration]]) of KI (one gram KI per mL solution), which is possible because SSKI is significantly more dense than pure water—about 1.67 g/mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01916122.1993.9989424 |jstor=3687792 |title=Pollen purification and fractionation by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation |year=1993 |last1=Forster |first1=Mark |last2=Flenley |first2=John R. |journal=Palynology |volume=17 |pages=137–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because KI is about 76.4% iodide by weight, SSKI contains about 764&amp;nbsp;mg iodide per mL. This [[mass concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] of iodide allows the calculation of the iodide dose per drop, if one knows the number of drops per milliliter. For SSKI, a solution more viscous than water, there are assumed to be 15 drops per mL; the iodide dose is therefore approximately 51&amp;nbsp;mg per drop. It is conventionally rounded to 50&amp;nbsp;mg per drop.

The term SSKI is also used, especially by pharmacists, to refer to a U.S.P. pre-prepared solution formula, made by adding KI to water to prepare a solution containing 1000&amp;nbsp;mg KI per mL solution (100% wt/volume KI solution), to closely approximate the concentration of SSKI made by saturation. This is essentially interchangeable with SSKI made by saturation, and also contains about 50&amp;nbsp;mg iodide per drop.

*Saturated solutions of potassium iodide can be an emergency treatment for [[hyperthyroidism]] (so-called [[thyroid storm]]), as high amounts of iodide temporarily suppress secretion of [[thyroxine]] from the thyroid gland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-iodine.html "Iodine."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804040405/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-iodine.html |date=2010-08-04 }}  ''MedlinePlus''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dose typically begins with a loading dose, then {{Frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;mL SSKI (5 drops or 250&amp;nbsp;mg iodine as iodide), three times per day.
*Iodide solutions made from a few drops of SSKI added to drinks have also been used as [[expectorant]]s to increase the water content of respiratory secretions and encourage effective coughing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/d/in-service/c/28732/ |title=Potassium Iodide: An Antidote for Radiation Exposure |last1=Saljoughian |first1=Manouchehr |date=June 20, 2011 |website=U.S. Pharmacist |access-date=January 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205094735/http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/d/in-service/c/28732/ |archivedate=February 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Due to its high potassium content, SSKI is extremely bitter, and if possible it is administered in a sugar cube or small ball of bread. It may also be mixed into much larger volumes of juices.
*Neither SSKI or KI tablets are used as nutritional supplements, since the nutritional requirement for iodine is only 150 micrograms (0.15&amp;nbsp;mg) of iodide per day. Thus, a drop of SSKI provides 50/0.15 = 333 times the daily iodine requirement, and a standard KI tablet provides twice this much.

[[File:Heat exchanger.svg|thumb|400px|Types of recuperator, or cross plate [[heat exchanger]]]]
A '''recuperator''' is a special purpose [[countercurrent exchange|counter-flow]] [[energy recovery]] [[heat exchanger]] positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system, or in the [[exhaust gas]]es of an industrial process, in order to recover the [[waste heat]]. Generally, they are used to extract heat from the exhaust and use it to preheat air entering the combustion system. In this way they use waste energy to heat the air, offsetting some of the fuel, and thereby improves the [[energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]] of the system as a whole.

==Description==
In many types of processes, [[combustion]] is used to generate heat, and the recuperator serves to recuperate, or reclaim this heat, in order to reuse or recycle it. The term recuperator refers as well to liquid-liquid counterflow heat exchangers used for heat recovery in the chemical and refinery industries and in closed processes such as ammonia-water or LiBr-water absorption refrigeration cycle.

Recuperators are often used in association with the burner portion of a [[heat engine]], to increase the overall efficiency. For example, in a [[gas turbine]] engine, air is compressed, mixed with fuel, which is then burned and used to drive a turbine. The recuperator transfers some of the waste heat in the exhaust to the compressed air, thus preheating it before entering the fuel burner stage. Since the gases have been pre-heated, less fuel is needed to heat the gases up to the turbine inlet temperature. By recovering some of the energy usually lost as waste heat, the recuperator can make a heat engine or gas turbine significantly more efficient.

==Energy transfer process==
Normally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as "[[sensible heat]]", which is the exchange of energy, or [[enthalpy]], resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content. However, if moisture or relative [[humidity]] levels in the return air stream are high enough to allow condensation to take place in the device, then this will cause "[[latent heat]]" to be released and the heat transfer material will be covered with a film of water. Despite a corresponding absorption of latent heat, as some of the water film is evaporated in the opposite airstream, the water will reduce the [[thermal resistance]] of the [[boundary layer]] of the heat exchanger material and thus improve the [[heat transfer coefficient]] of the device, and hence increase efficiency. The energy exchange of such devices now comprises both sensible and latent heat transfer; in addition to a change in temperature, there is also a change in moisture content of the exhaust air stream.

However, the film of condensation will also slightly increase pressure drop through the device, and depending upon the spacing of the matrix material, this can increase resistance by up to 30%. If the unit is not laid to falls, and the condensate not allowed to drain properly, this will increase fan energy consumption and reduce the seasonal efficiency of the device.

==Use in ventilation systems==
In heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, [[HVAC]], recuperators are commonly used to re-use waste heat from exhaust air normally expelled to [[atmosphere]]. Devices typically comprises a series of parallel plates of [[aluminium]], [[plastic]], [[stainless steel]], or [[synthetic fiber]], alternate pairs of which are enclosed on two sides to form twin sets of ducts at right angles to each other, and which contain the supply and extract air streams. In this manner heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the separating plates, and into the supply air stream. Manufacturers claim gross efficiencies of up to 80% depending upon the specification of the unit.

The characteristics of this device are attributable to the relationship between the physical size of the unit, in particular the air path distance, and the spacing of the plates. For an equal air pressure drop through the device, a small unit will have a narrower plate spacing and a lower air velocity than a larger unit, but both units may be just as efficient. Because of the cross-flow design of the unit, its physical size will dictate the air path length, and as this increases, heat transfer will increase but pressure drop will also increase, and so plate spacing is increased to reduce pressure drop, but this in turn will reduce heat transfer.

As a general rule a recuperator selected for a pressure drop of between {{convert|150|-|250|Pa}} will have a good efficiency, while having a small effect on fan power consumption, but will have in turn a higher seasonal efficiency than that for physically smaller, but higher pressure drop recuperator.

When heat recovery is not required, it is typical for the device to be bypassed by use of dampers arranged within the ventilation distribution system. Assuming the fans are fitted with inverter speed controls, set to maintain a constant pressure in the ventilation system, then the reduced pressure drop leads to a slowing of the fan motor and thus reducing power consumption, and in turn improves the seasonal efficiency of the system.

==Use in metallurgical furnaces==
Recuperators have also been used to recover heat from waste gasses to preheat combustion air and fuel for many years by metallic recuperators to reduce energy costs and carbon footprint of operation. Compared to alternatives such as regenerative furnaces, initial costs are lesser, there are no valves to be switching back and forth, there are no induced-draft fans and it does not require a web of gas ducts spread up all over the furnace.

Historically the recovery ratios of recuperators compared to [[regenerative burner]]s were low. However, recent improvements to technology have allowed recuperators to recover 70-80% of the waste heat and pre-heated air up to {{convert|850|-|900|°C}} is now possible.

==Gas turbines==
[[Image:GasTurbine.svg|thumb|Cutaway of a recuperated microturbine]]

Recuperators can be used to increase the efficiency of [[gas turbines]] for power generation, provided the exhaust gas is hotter than the compressor outlet temperature. The exhaust heat from the turbine is used to pre-heat the air from the compressor before further heating in the combustor, reducing the fuel input required. The larger the temperature difference between turbine out and compressor out, the greater the benefit from the recuperator. &lt;ref&gt;Çengel, Yunus A.; Boles, Michael (1994). Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[microturbine]]s (&lt;1MW), which typically have low pressure ratios, have the most to gain from the use of a recuperator. In practice, a doubling of efficiency is possible through the use of a recuperator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hiflux.co.uk/applications/microturbine-recuperators/ |title= Microturbine Recuperators |publisher= Hiflux Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; The major practical challenge for a recuperator in microturbine applications is coping with the exhaust gas temperature, which can exceed {{convert|750|°C}}.

[[File:RemoteDispensing Unit.jpg|thumb|top|right|200px|An example of a remote-dispensing unit used in long-term care facilities and correctional institutions]]
[[File:Touchpoint Pharmacy.jpg|thumb|An example of a remote dispensing pharmacy used at healthcare facilities, University campuses, and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal communities in Canada.]]]]
'''Remote dispensing''' is used in [[health care]] environments to describe the use of automated systems to dispense (package and label) [[Prescription drug|prescription medication]]s without an on-site [[pharmacist]].  This practice is most common in [[long-term care]] facilities and [[prison|correctional institutions]] that do not find it practical to operate a full-service in-house [[pharmacy]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Remote dispensing can also be used to describe the pharmacist controlled remote prescription dispensing units which connect [[patients]] to a remotely located pharmacist over [[video]] interface to receive counseling and medication dispensing. Because these units are pharmacist controlled, the units can be located outside of typical healthcare settings such as employer sites, [[universities]] and remote locations, thus offering pharmacy services where they have previously never existed before.

==A typical remote-dispensing system==
A typical remote-dispensing system is monitored remotely by a central [[pharmacy]] and includes secure, automated medication dispensing hardware that is capable of producing patient-specific packages of medications on demand. The secure medication dispensing unit is placed on-site at the care facility or non-healthcare locations (such as Universities, workplaces and retail locations) and filled with pharmacist-checked medication canisters. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

When patient medications are needed, the [[Medical prescription|orders]] are submitted to a pharmacist at the central pharmacy, the pharmacist reviews the orders and, when approved, the medications are subsequently dispensed from the on-site dispensing unit at the remote care facility. Medications come out of the dispensing machine printed with the patient’s name, medication name, and other relevant information.

If the medication stock in a canister is low, the central pharmacy is alerted to fill a canister from their bulk stock. New canisters are filled, checked by the pharmacist, security sealed, and delivered to the remote care facility.

==Perceived advantages==
In theory, access to dispensing services 24 hours a day in locations previously unable to support full pharmacy operations. Advocates for remote dispensing additionally claim that the service provides focused, uninterrupted and personalized time with a pharmacist as the system manages the physical dispensing process while the pharmacist simply oversees it. Certain prescription dispensing units can carry over 2000 different medications {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} tailored to the prescribing habits of local healthcare providers. Furthermore, remote dispensing terminal manufacturers state that this technology can facilitate patient [[continuity of care]] between prescriber and pharmacist. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Disadvantages==
While some may purport that travel time to pharmacies is reduced, this point has been negated by an Ontarian study published in the journal ''Healthcare Policy'' as over 90% of [[Ontarian]]s live within a 5 [[km]] radius of a pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Law |first1=Michael R. |last2=Dijkstra |first2=Anna |last3=Douillard |first3=Jay A. |last4=Morgan |first4=Steven G. |date=March 2011 |title=Geographic Accessibility of Community Pharmacies in Ontario |url=http://www.longwoods.com/content/22097|journal=Healthcare Policy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=36–45 |doi=10.12927/hcpol.2011.22097 |doi-access=free |pmc=3082386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote dispensing also places a physical barrier between the patient and pharmacist, limiting the pharmacist's ability to detect a patient's nonverbal cues. A patient with [[Ethanol|alcohol]] on his or her breath would go undetected via remote dispensing, increasing the risk for dangerous interactions with drugs such as [[tranquilizers]], [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]], [[narcotics]], and [[warfarin]] to name a few. This problem may be amplified through telecommunication service disruptions, which were reported in previous studies examining the utility of remote dispensing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nissen |first1=Lisa |last2=Tett |first2=Susan |date=2003 |title=Can telepharmacy provide pharmacy services in the bush? |journal=Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare |volume=9 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S39-41 |publisher=Royal Society of Medicine Press Limited |pmid=14728757 |doi=10.1258/135763303322596228 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote dispensing has the potential to undermine the services offered by physically present pharmacists. Hands-on patient training on [[inhaler]]s and [[Glucometer|glucose meters]] is not feasible with remote dispensing, and administration of injections is impossible without a physically present pharmacist. Other cognitive services such as in-depth medication consultations are also impractical to conduct over such audiovisual technology, which do not provide acoustic privacy for the patient, nor do they meet mandatory criteria for conducting such services that require an “in-person discussion” to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MedsCheck Program Standardization and System Requirements|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/drugs/medscheck/standards.aspx|work=MedsCheck|publisher=Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Furthermore, the variety of drugs offered by remote dispensing is limited in comparison to traditional pharmacies, which in the province of [[Ontario]] are required to maintain a dispensary of at least 9.3  [[Square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] in area, far greater than that of any remote dispensing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations Under Drug And Pharmacies Regulation Act|url=http://www.ocpinfo.com/Client/ocp/OCPHome.nsf/web/DPRA+-+Regulations|work=Drug And Pharmacies Regulation Act|publisher=Ontario College of Pharmacists|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variations in the perception and display of sexual suggestiveness, including but not limited to gender, culture and generation. Different cultures and different generations have varying views on what is considered to be sexually suggestive. For example, in British culture, it is normal for a woman to wear shorts and bare her legs on a hot, sunny day, but a woman with naked flesh on show would be considered [[promiscuous]] in certain cultures around the world. For the majority of the 20th century in western culture, it was considered vulgar for women to have their sexual ornaments ([[breasts]]) fully on show; in more modern times, this may not be a deviation from the norm. In [[evolution]]ary terms, sexual suggestiveness is a mode from which sexual mates are gained. Therefore, the ability to use sexual suggestiveness effectively is a trait that is part of [[sexual selection]].

In some cases, displays of sexual suggestiveness may be misinterpreted which may lead to dangerous or harmful situations.

==Evolutionary perspective==

From an evolutionary point of view, sexual suggestiveness evolved in order to aid in securing a [[sexual partner]] or mate. Once the individual has decided on a mate to pursue, sexual suggestiveness helps in attracting the mate - this is a skill which has been sexually selected ([[sexual selection]]) for during evolution. Sexually suggestive behaviors include things such as "showing more skin" and [[flirting]]. Both of these examples are behaviors which the individual would intentionally display. There is also research to suggest that sexually suggestive behaviors may not always be deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Haselton, M. G., Mortezaie, M., Pillsworth, E. G., Bleske-Rechek, A., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2007). Ovulatory shifts in human female ornamentation: Near ovulation, women dress to impress. Hormones and Behavior, 51, 40 – 45&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to the individual, factors such as the [[menstrual cycle]], voice pitch and rate of money spending can all have an effect on sexual success and sexually suggestive behavior. For example, when females were in the work place and [[ovulation|ovulating]] they were more likely to engage in sexually suggestive behaviors e.g. showing more skin; further, females who work as lap dancers earn more money when they are in the ovulating stage. This may be because the female unwittingly behaves in a more sexual way and therefore puts out more sexually suggestive cues.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"&gt;Gallup Jr, G. G., &amp; Frederick, D. A. (2010). The science of sex appeal: An evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 14(3), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; There is not, however, any evidence to show that these females are aware that their actions or earnings are intrinsically linked to their [[menstrual cycle]].

== 21st century==

The rise of the media, advertising and film industries as well as the growth of the fashion industry are all contributing factors to increase sexually suggestive content in an every-day setting. There are far more displays of sexually suggestive  behavior in modern-day life than there ever has been before and not just within advertising. The idea that [[sex sells]] is evident in many aspects of daily modern life particularly within social media and film where [[female sexual ornaments]] are a focal point. For example, many films include additional sex scenes and sexually suggestive female characters regardless of the film’s narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Benshoff, H. M., &amp; Griffin, S. (2011). America on film: Representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, D. H. (1986). Causes of sexual dysfunction: The role of anxiety and cognitive interference. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 54(2), 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression of the Internet and social media means that sexual content is far more available and accessible in the 21st century than ever before. This has a knock on effect on people’s [[sexualization]] and [[sexual behavior]]. Children’s sexuality develops at an earlier age if they have been exposed to more sexual content when young. For example, young adolescents engage in more sexual behaviors if they have been exposed to more sexual content in the media or on television.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A. (2009). Teens and Sexting: How and why minor teens are sending sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images via text messaging.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strasburger, V. C. (1995). Adolescents and the media: medical and psychological impact. Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, females become [[puberty|pubescent]] earlier in their development if they have been exposed to sexual content or sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M., &amp; Rivadeneyra, R. (1999). Contributions of entertainment television to adolescents’ sexual attitudes and expectations: The role of viewing amount versus viewer involvement. Journal of Sex Research, 36(3), 237-249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D. (2002). Mass media influences on sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 39(1), 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Most psychologists agree that this physical display of sexuality is due to evolutionary reasons and that girls develop their sexuality (e.g. behaving sexually suggestively) at an earlier age in order to [[sexual competition|sexually compete]] with other women and in order [[reproductive success|successfully reproduce]].&lt;ref&gt;Malamuth, N. M. (1996). Sexually explicit media, gender differences, and evolutionary theory. Journal of Communication, 46(3), 8-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. J., &amp; Scott, C. L. (Eds.) (2002). Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misinterpretation==

The increase in sexual content in modern society often results in a more nonchalant approach to sexually suggestive behavior.  People, predominantly women, often act in a way that they themselves do not consider to be sexually suggestive but which can be misinterpreted by others.&lt;ref&gt;Stockdale, M. S. (1993). The Role of Sexual Misperceptions of Women′ s Friendliness in an Emerging Theory of Sexual Harassment. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 42(1), 84-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synovitz, L. B., &amp; Byrne, T. J. (1998). Antecedents of sexual victimization: Factors discriminating victims from non-victims. Journal of American College Health, 46(4), 151-158.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, wearing clothes or skirts/shorts that show skin is not something that most Western women would consider to be overtly provocative but it is still regarded as sexually suggestive by others. Misconstruing people’s behaviour can have disastrous consequences, contributing to [[harassment]] and [[rape culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Thornhill, N. W. (1983). Human rape: An evolutionary analysis. Ethology and Sociobiology, 4(3), 137-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koukounas, E., &amp; Letch, N. M. (2001). Psychological correlates of perception of sexual intent in women. The Journal of social psychology, 141(4), 443-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] explains that this misinterpretation is the result of [[sexual selection]]. Men have adapted through sexual selection to have the maximum number of offspring possible, and therefore exhibit certain behaviors that facilitate maximum reproduction. Men perceive sexually suggestive behavior and other sexual cues, including [[biological ornament]]s, as signs of reproductive ability and willingness.&lt;ref&gt;Clutton-Brock, T. (2007). Sexual selection in males and females. Science, 318(5858), 1882-1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hypothesis]] of [[rape]] as an [[adaption]] states that the rape of reproductive-age females was favoured by [[directional selection|direct selection]] in order to increase the chance of [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2001). A Natural History of Rape. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, C. T. (1991). Human rape: Adaptation or by‐product?. Journal of Sex Research, 28(3), 365-386.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexually suggestive behavior and biological ornamentation are signs of [[sexual maturity]] and thus females who display more of these behaviors, or who have more obvious ornamentation, are more likely to be at a higher risk of harassment, or even rape.&lt;ref&gt;McKibbin, W. F., Shackelford, T. K., Goetz, A. T., &amp; Starratt, V. G. (2008). Why do men rape? An evolutionary psychological perspective. Review of General Psychology, 12(1), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolutionary explanation also extends to women. At their most fertile stage in their [[menstrual cycle]], during [[estrus]], women are far less likely to engage in rape-risky behaviors such as walking alone late at night, than women who are in the least fertile stage of their menstrual cycle, the [[menstrual cycle|luteal phase]] or women using [[hormonal contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;Chavanne, T. J., &amp; Gallup, G. G. (1998). Variation in risk taking behavior among female college students as a function of the menstrual cycle. Evolution and Human Behavior, 19(1), 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because women who are in the luteal phase or women using a hormonal contraceptive are much less likely to become pregnant after sexual intercourse than estrus women are.&lt;ref&gt;Gangestad, S. W., &amp; Thornhill, R. (2008). Human oestrus. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences, 275(1638), 991-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

These evolutionary explanations serve only to increase the psychological understanding of sexual behaviors. Sexual suggestiveness, rape, and all other sexual behaviors, are proven to be products of past evolution. In the case of rape, however, just because it is natural does not make it acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). A Natural History of Rape. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R. (1998). Biology of Human Rape, The. Jurimetrics, 39, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2002). Rape and evolution: a reply to our critics. Psychology, Evolution &amp; Gender, 4(3), 283-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flirting ==
[[Flirting]] can be sexually suggestive, which can intentionally elicit a [[sexual arousal|sexual response]] from another person.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; Research has identified different motivations for engaging in flirting behaviors. There is flirting with a sexual motivation, which is done with a view to engaging in [[sexual behavior|Human sexual activity]] and there is also flirting with a fun motivation, in which the interaction itself is the pleasurable part.&lt;ref name=Henni2004 /&gt; An instrumental motivation of flirting behavior is flirting performed in order to accomplish an instrumental goal, such as getting someone to buy you a drink. However, flirting can sometimes lead to unintentional responses. If the motivation behind sexually suggestive behavior is misinterpreted or miscommunicated, then a sexual response could be elicited where it is not wanted. If escalated, this can lead to [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace or sexual coercion in a relationship.&lt;ref name=Rich1999 /&gt; In line with evolutionary explanations of sexually suggestive behavior, research has shown that females are more likely to consider the use of flirting as being for relational purposes, and males are more likely to interpret female flirting as having a sexual motivation.&lt;ref name=Henni2004&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with Meaning: An Examination of Miscommunication in Flirting Interactions, Sex Roles, 50, (7), pp 481-489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rich1999&gt;Richman, J. A., et al. (1999) Sexual Harassment and Generalized Workplace Abuse Among University Employees: Prevalence and Mental Health Correlates. ''Journal of American Health'', 89, (3), pp358-363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences==

There are some reported gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is perceived. Males and females have different thresholds for the perception of sexual suggestiveness or intent. Males are, in general, more sexually occupied than females. To support this assumption research shows that males perceive people as more interested in a sexual encounter than females do.&lt;ref&gt;Shotland, R. L., &amp; Craig, J. M. (1988). Can men and women differentiate between friendly and sexually interested behavior?. Social Psychology Quarterly, 66-73.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that males find it difficult to differentiate between [[Like#As a verb|liking]], [[love]] and sexual intent, and in this case sexual suggestiveness. Unfortunately, this difficulty in separation between the two from the male’s point of view may lead to rape or other [[sexual assault]]. During the evolution of [[human sexuality]], the fact that females are the choosy gender meant that males who were able to quickly detect a female's willingness were the males who passed along their [[genes]] effectively. In light of this, males, therefore, tend to read sexual acceptance signals in friendly actions even when this may not be the females intention.&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2000). Why men rape. The Sciences, 40(1), 30-36. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; Females are however better at reading platonic signals from the opposite sex and at differentiating between liking, loving and sexual suggestiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Abbey, A. (1982). "Sex Differences in Attributions for Friendly Behavior: Do Males Misperceive Females' Friendliness?" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 42:830-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is displayed via flirting. Recent research has shown that females are more likely than males to flirt with the intention of developing a new relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Messman, S. J., Canary, D. J., &amp; Hause, R. S. (2000). Motives to remain platonic, equity and the use of maintenance strategies in opposite sex friendships. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 17, 67-94.&lt;/ref&gt; or with the intention of intensifying an existing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, J. L., Damhave, K. W. (1991) The effect of place, type of comment and effort expended on the perception of flirtation. Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 6, 35-43&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that females use flirting as a way of assessing the interest of a potential mate; as the end result is sexual activity, it can be inferred that this is a sexually suggestive act.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. M., &amp; Butler, D. I. (1989). Predictive aspects of non-verbal courtship behavior in women. Semiotica, 76, 205-215&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a variety of different researchers have found that males are significantly more sexually motivated in their displays of sexual suggestiveness (such as flirting) than females.&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, D. D. (2004). Flirting with meaning: An examination of miscommunication in flirting interactions. Sex Roles, 50(7-8), 481-489&lt;/ref&gt; The research done by Clark and Hatfield (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. D., &amp; Hatfield, E. (1989). Gender differences in awareness of courtship initiation tactics. Sex Roles, 32, 717-734.&lt;/ref&gt; supports these assumptions by clearly suggesting that female courtship is motivated by relationship development and that male courtship is motivated by sexual desire. It is these gender differences that can explain the potential miscommunication of social actions.

==Cultural differences==

Since the 1990s there has a been a dramatic increase in the understanding of human sexuality from an [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2015). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary theory proposes that humans all behave in the same way, in order to maximise survival and [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; However, as with much of human behavior, there are substantial differences in the sexual suggestiveness of people from different cultures. What may be a culturally appropriate display of 'sexiness' in one culture may be considered inappropriate in another, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Frederick, D. A. 2010"/&gt; For example, in many Westernized cultures women displaying their bare legs in public is considered to be a relatively unassuming display of suggestiveness, while in many African societies, for example, the same behavior would be considered immodest. It can be argued that religion is a significant factor in the cultural differences of sexual suggestiveness, especially with regards to what displays of suggestiveness are considered appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Melman, B. (2016). Women’s Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718–1918: Sexuality, Religion and Work. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] communities are more strict on what levels of suggestiveness are appropriate for unmarried young women.

==In the media ==

===General===
A considerable amount of research has concluded that sexually suggestive content is pervasive in the media. The most common type of sexually suggestive content in adolescent programming is in the form of a sexual [[innuendo]]. Sexual [[innuendo]]es give a suggestive alternative meaning to an otherwise neutral phrase. For example, the use of the phrase "bend over backwards" when describing a colleague, in the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', is used by the main character Barney to imply something in both a figurative sense (i.e. that she is willing to work hard) and a suggestive sense (alluding to her flexibility in sexual positions). Content analyses of sexual behavior in the media found that sexual content on television has risen from 45% in 1975 to 81% now.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999&gt;Kunkel, D., Cope, K., Farinola, W., Biely, E., Rollin, E., &amp; Donnerstein, E. (1999). Sex on TE.' A biennial report to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001. Menlo Park, CA: The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; 83% of all programs on television contain sexual content.&lt;ref name=pardun2005&gt;Pardun, C.J., L’Engle, K.L., &amp; Brown, J.D. (2005). Linking exposure to outcomes: Early adolescents’ consumption of sexual content in six media. Mass Communication &amp; Society, 8(2), 75-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collins2004&gt;Collins, R.L., Elliott, M. N., Berry, S. H. et al. (2004). Watching sex on television predicts adolescent initiation of sexual Behavior. Pediatrics. 114(3). Available at: www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/114/3/e280&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of programs contain sexually suggestive references, and 49% of shows contain sexual behavior which include flirting.&lt;ref name=kunkel1999 /&gt; Sexual [[innuendo]]es occur as much as twice per program in popular American sitcoms, whilst flirting occurred at least once per programme.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt; The use of sexual [[innuendo]]es in the media is also done through newspapers, magazines and music, and accounts for roughly 12% of the entire sexual content shown in the media overall.&lt;ref name=pardun2005 /&gt;  Analysis of sexually suggestive behavior in sports media showed that there was considerable gender differences in how sports stars are portrayed visually.&lt;ref name=clavio2011&gt;Clavio, G., Eagleman, A. N. (2011). Gender and Sexually Suggestive Images in Sports Blogs. Journal of Sport Management, 7, 295-304&lt;/ref&gt; For example, females are photographed nude more frequently than men, and were photographed in a ''hetero-sexy'' manner which was done to attract the [[male gaze]], such as with sports equipment covering their genitalia due to its suggestive nature.&lt;ref name=clavio2011 /&gt; Overall, females are portrayed in a manner that alludes to their status as a [[sex symbol]].

Sexual content in the form of [[innuendo]], suggestive imagery and [[double entendre]] is used as a tool in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, A., Whipple, T. (1983). Sex Stereotyping in Advertising (Lexington, MA: Heath)&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestive advertising is used to draw in attention,&lt;ref name=reichert2004&gt;Reichert, T. Carpenter, C. (2004). An update on sex in magazine advertising: 1983 to 2003. Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly, 81(4), 823-837&lt;/ref&gt; by monopolizing attentional resources, and as a means of distinguishing their products from similar products which are usually advertised in the same medium (such as in the same magazine).&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; Furthermore, advertisers use sexually suggestive material to imply an association between their product and benefits which are in some way related to sex (such as mate attraction).&lt;ref name=reichert2000&gt;Reichert, T. Ramirez, A. (2000) "Defining Sexually Oriented Appeals in Advertising: a Grounded Theory Investigation". Association for Consumer Research, 27, 267-273.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant increase in the amount of advertisements from 1983 to 2003 which used sexually suggestive images of models,&lt;ref name=reichert2004 /&gt; suggesting that advertisers are finding it beneficial. While the physical properties of the model are the most sexually suggestive, a number of non-verbal communicative features have also been identified as being provocative, such as the models pose (plumped lips, cocked head to show the neck) as well as verbal communicative features such as suggestive comments.&lt;ref name=reichert2000 /&gt;

=== Effects ===
A number of studies have looked at the effects of sexual content in the media on [[preadolescent]] and [[adolescent]] sexual development. It has been put forth that watching a high level of television, in which there is a lot of sexually suggestive behavior, can lead to the initiation of sexual intercourse at a younger age than those who watch the least amount of sexually suggestive programming.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; In addition to this, adolescents who had been exposed to a high level of sexual content, would engage in a level of sexual activity expected by those up to three years older who watched less sexual content.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt; It has been suggested that according to [[social learning theory]], television is a method by which children can acquire behaviors, through observational learning,&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A., Ross, D., Ross, S.A. (1963). Imitation of film-mediated aggressive models. J Abnorm Soc Psychol, 66, 3–11&lt;/ref&gt; and that this is a potential method through which children are becoming increasingly sexualized.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J. L., Sorsoli, C. L., Collins, K., Zylbergold, B. A., Schooler, D., &amp; Tolman, D. L. (2007). From sex to sexuality: Exposing the heterosexual script on primetime network television. Journal of Sex Research, 44, 145 – 157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and [[pregnancy]] in the U.S are more common among adolescents who begin sexual activity earlier, demonstrating that earlier sexualization, for which sexually suggestive content in the media has been implicated, has far reaching effects.&lt;ref name=collins2004 /&gt;

Sexually suggestive content can also affect adolescents' views and attitudes towards sex, and their sexual socialization as whole. Research conducted with the [[cultivation theory]] in mind, has found that there is an association between people with a high regular exposure to sexually oriented genres (such as [[soap operas]] and [[hip-hop music]]) and more liberal attitudes towards sexual behavior like the acceptance of pre-marital sex, as well as non-relational sex and sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2002). Does television exposure affect emerging adults’ attitudes and assumptions about sexual relationships? Correlational and experimental confirmation. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 31, 1–15&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as sexual competence is portrayed as a positive attribute on television, particularly for males, regular exposure to sexual content can cause adolescents to form unrealistic expectations, and view their own sexual experiences  (or lack thereof) as negative.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, L. M. (2003). Understanding the role of entertainment media in the sexual socialization of American youth: A review of empirical research. Developmental Review, 23, 347-388&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the vast majority of this sexual content alludes to the positive nature of sex only, suggesting that sexually suggestive behavior in the media is serving to perpetuate a view that there are little negative consequences of engaging in sexual activity. Research has shown that the effects of sexually suggestive references in the media are also moderated by the developmental stage of the viewer. For example, 12 year olds have more difficulty correctly interpreting [[innuendos]] than 14 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman-Watkins, L. T.,  Sprafkin, J. N. (1983). Adolescents’ comprehension of televised sexual innuendos. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 4, 359–369&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, pre-pubescent adolescents often view sexual references on television with disgust and embarrassment, whereas pubescent adolescents viewed it with interest.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., White, A. B., Nikipoulou, L. (1993). Disinterest, intrigue and resistance: Early adolescent girls’ use of sexual media content. In B. Greenberg, J. D. Brown, &amp; N.

'''Sociology of terrorism''' is an emerging field in [[sociology]] seeking to understand [[terrorism]] as a [[social phenomenon]] and how individuals as well as [[State (polity)|states]] respond to such events. It is not to be confused with [[critical terrorism studies]] which sometimes overlaps with the [[psychology of terrorism]].

==History==

===Pre-September 11 attacks===
After the [[September 11 attacks]], there has been a spike of interest in various sociological traditions related to terrorism, such as [[moral panic]], organizational response and media coverage, and [[counter-terrorism]].

The most comprehensive study into the definition of terrorism comes from a study by Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler (2004) who examined 73 definitions of terrorism from 55 articles and concluded that terrorism is: "a politically motivated tactic involving the threat or use of force or violence in which the pursuit of publicity plays a significant role."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Pedahzur and Hirsch-Hoefler 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, Weinberg ''et al.'' point out that definitions of terrorism often ignore [[Symbolism of terrorism|symbolic aspects of terrorism]].  Due to its focus on symbolism, sociology has a unique vantage point from which to assess [[Fear|terror]].

===Post-September 11 attacks===
Since the September 11 attacks, Mathieu Deflem ([[University of South Carolina]]), S.E. Costanza ([[Central Connecticut State University]]) and John C. Kilburn Jr. ([[Texas A&amp;M International University]]) are among the sociologists to call for the development of a sub-field in sociology related to terrorism. Common topics that are part of the discourse in the sociology of terrorism include: [[military spending]], counter-terrorism, [[immigration]], privacy issues, and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], where within these contexts questions of power, the definition of terrorism, propaganda, nationality, the media, etc. are being deliberated upon.

Early peer-reviewed literature after the September 11 attacks examined policing and citizen responses to terror during the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It also examined interactions between [[first responder]]s (police, rescue teams, etc.) and communities. Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan (2003) rightly predicted that police organizations would change fundamental styles of [[Racial profiling|profiling]] people&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Hoopes and Quinlan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and police agencies would alter their [[mission statement]]s after the September 11 attacks. There is strong reason to believe that even the smallest of local police agencies are apt to feel some kind of pressure to deal with the issue of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;DeLone 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent work in the sociology of terrorism field is philosophical and reflective and has focused on issues such as moral panic and over-spending after the September 11 attacks. Costanza and Kilburn (2005), in an article entitled ''Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism'' argued that the issue of symbolism is of much importance to understanding the war on terror.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza and Kilburn 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Using a classic [[symbolic interactionist]] perspective, they argue that strong public sentiment about the [[homeland security]] issue has driven policy more to superficial threats than real and concrete threats. Others argue that symbolism has led to agency a policy of “[[hypervigilance]]” in agency decision-making that is costly and [[Falsifiability|untestable]].

Some sociologists and legal scholars have contemplated the potential consequences of aggressive (or [[militaristic]]) policing of terror threats that may have negative implications for human rights which are of great interest to sociologists as a matter of [[social justice]].  For instance, in a peer-reviewed article ''Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror'', Helms, Costanza and Johnson (2011) ask if it is possible that media hype at the national level could prompt an unnecessary and systemic over-pursuit of [[cyberterrorism]]. They warn that such overreaction might lead to a "[[killswitch]]" policy which could give the federal government ultimate power over the internet.

Despite the [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] lean of modern sociology; Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik (2011) point out that there are several methodological barbs to effectively and scientifically assessing the effect of homeland security measures.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional [[criminology]], the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e., [[Neighborhood Watch|neighborhood watch]], [[gun control]], foot patrols, etc.) is to assess total financial costs against [[clearance rates]] or [[arrest rates]]. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests would be a naive way to test policy effectiveness.

Another methodological problem in the development of sociology of terrorism as a sub-field is one of finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg et al 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for social scientists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly conceptualize these ideas.

==Three sociological perspectives==

===Structural functionalism===
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
Functionalism is “the theory that various social institutions and processes in society exists to serve some important (or necessary) function to keep society running.” This sociological perspective draws on the work of sociologists like [[Émile Durkheim]], and gets its name from the idea that the best way to study society is to identify the [[Role|roles]] that different aspects of society play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=29|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deviance (sociology)|Social deviance]], loosely understood, can be taken to mean any "transgression of socially established [[Social norm|norms]]." This can range from the minor–slamming a door in someone's face–to the major–a terrorist act. Thus terrorism is a deviant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=189|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Functionalism sees terrorism–which is a form of [[crime]]–as a temporary deviation from the normal goings on of society, and is in a way functional to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sociologist that utilizes structural functionalism would explain the existence of any social phenomena by the function they perform. Therefore, terrorism is functional because it joins individuals together in opposition, and brings a sense of belonging to the group opposing it. This feeling of [[group solidarity]] would help prevent [[Anomie|''anomie'']], which is the stage where people do not need to follow any norms of society in order to survive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists, like other criminals, become what is known as a reference point; individuals use a reference point as a standard for evaluation. The norms and rules of society become clearer, and are seen as necessary, in comparison to terrorism. In order to protect the [[Status quo|''status quo'']], society uses terrorism as a way to reassert the importance of social norms in the lives of individuals. Thus individuals see terrorism as a threat to the [[social equilibrium]] and their life in a functioning society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalists believe that social change is required to keep a healthy society. Slow, well-planned, and evolutionary method-types change a healthy society socially. These social changes often come about from a drastic need for change and are preceded by a social shock.  Terrorism brings about a social shock that moves society towards a change in direction that enables it to find new ways in which to protect itself. Functionalists view these new changes as providing society with a healthy and slow-paced [[social change]] that was needed. Terrorism thus becomes an expected and needed shock, and therefore can be seen in a sense to encourage society to change for the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
Conflict theory is “the idea that conflict between competing interests is the basic, animating force of social change and society in general." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=30|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conflict theorist generally sees that the control of conflict equals the ability of one group to suppress the group that they are opposing, and that [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] is a technique of defining and maintaining a social order that benefits some at the expense of others.

Conflict theorists view terrorism as a reaction to [[injustice]], which is probably created in the minds of terrorists due to misguidance, illiteracy, or unrealistic goals, and that violent behaviors expressed by terrorist organizations are the result of individual frustration, aggression or showing a readiness to fight. [[Political conflict]] makes people look for ways to explain and solve the problems they are facing. If the conflict is deeply rooted, and the current ideology proves unable to deal with the problems, people begin to turn to other ideologies that can often carry a religious theme to them. This is not to say that all forms of terrorist acts are committed by people that are religious. In 83% of the [[Suicide attack|suicide attackers]] worldwide, between 1980 and 2003, only 43% were identifiably religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorists use violence because they believe that if they did not use violence they would lose a power struggle, which lead many conflict theorists to view it as a weapon of the weak. In [[Iraq]], between March 2003 and February 2006, 443 suicide missions took place with 71% belonging to [[al-Qaeda]]. They justified their actions in religious terms; viewing the [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'a control of Iraq]] as abandoning religious principles. Suicide attacks against the Iraqi regime and its American and British supporters were seen as the means in which to accomplish this. Yet it was only under certain political conditions that suicide bombings spiked. The first condition being that it was in relation with the [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] of the American and British militaries. The second being a strategic response to the [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] control becoming more stabilized in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorists do not have the money or the political power that is needed to wage war, so they use terrorism as a means, not a goal, to agitate the government in order to achieve their political objectives.  Before committing an act of terror, a terrorist does not always weigh the cost and benefits of their actions, but rather is reacting from the humiliation and frustration they feel they are being subjected too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Douglas|last2=Uggen|first2=Christopher|title=The Contexts Reader|date=2012|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, New York|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brym|first1=Robert|title=Six Lessons of Suicide Bombers|date=2007|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Symbolic interactionism is “a [[Microsociology|micro-level theory]] in which shared meanings, originations, and assumptions form the basic motivations behind peoples’ actions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=31|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symbolic interactionism, [[face-to-face interaction]] creates the social world. Individuals act on perceived meanings that appear to be self-constituting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=32|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group membership is one of the major determinations if individual interpretations of reality, which enables symbolic interactionism to explain crime, and thus terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviance, which terrorism falls under, can be explained by [[labeling theory]]. Labeling theory is “the belief that individuals subconsciously notice how others see or label them, and their reactions to those labels, over time, form the basis of their [[Self-concept|self-identity]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=206|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social groups]] create rules about what is acceptable behavior for people in society. When a rule is broken, society determines if the act was deviant. A person can only become deviant after a social reaction to an act committed is labeled deviant, and that original act is referred to as the [[primary deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=209|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being labeled deviant causes a person to see themselves as deviants, which leads to said person performing more deviant acts, with each act being referred to as [[secondary deviance]]. Secondary deviance can quickly turn into a [[Social stigma|stigma]], which is a label that changes the way people see someone, and how individuals view themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conley|first1=Dalton|title=You May Ask Yourself: An Introduction to Thinking Like a Sociologist|date=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|page=2011|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to symbolic interactionism, terrorism is treated as learned behaviors. Each person learns how to commit terrorism through interactions with terrorists. Involvement in the group is important in the learning process, and members, upon joining, are resocialized to the group’s version of [[Social reality|reality]]. The best way to accomplish this is to involve new members in terrorist acts, which leads the terrorist organization to become the only reference point for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cinoglu|first1=H.|last2=Ozeren|first2=S|title=Classical Schools of Sociology and  Terrorism|url=http://sbd.ogu.edu.tr/makaleler/1488711_2_Makale_3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social learning theory plays a part in the [[socialization]] of terroristic behaviors. Learning theory states that a person becomes deviant because of an abundance of definitions that favor deviant behavior versus definitions that are unfavorable to such behaviors. This theory is broken down into four learning mechanisms: differential association, definitions, differential reinforcement, and imitation.

The first learning mechanism is [[differential association]], which refers to "direct association and interaction with others who engage in certain kinds of behaviors or express norms, values, and attitudes supportive of such behavior, as well as indirect association and identification with more distant reference groups." The groups that an individual are differentially associated with provides the context in which the social learning is operated. The greater the priority, intensity, duration, and frequency of the differential association the greater the effect on behavior. Hence, the theory in relation to terrorism is that the stronger someone's connection is towards a terrorist organization the better chance that person has of also exhibiting terroristic behaviors.

The second learning mechanism is definitions. Definitions refer to an "individual's own value and belief system about what is and is not acceptable behavior." These values are learned and reinforced through differential association. There are two types of definitions, general definition and specific definition. General definitions include broad beliefs about conformity that are influenced through conventional means and are often influenced by religious or moral values. Specific definitions are seen as those that align an individual with particular acts of crime. The greater the number of definitions the more likely a person will engage in criminal behavior. So the more definitions an individual has that favor terroristic behavior the greater chance that person has of committing a terroristic acts.

The third learning mechanism is [[differential reinforcement]]. Differential reinforcement "refers to the balance of anticipated or actual rewards and punishments that follow behavior." An individual refraining from committing a crime depends on a balance of past, present, and anticipated future rewards or punishments for their actions. In regards to terrorism, the more direct or indirect social interaction a person has towards terrorism the more likely they are to commit a terroristic act.

The fourth and final learning mechanism is [[imitation]]. "Imitation is the notion that individuals engage in behaviors that they have previously witnessed others doing." The characters being observed, the behaviors that are being witnessed, and the consequences for those behaviors determine how much an individual imitates a behavior. All of these things need to fall into place in order for an individual to imitate a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pauwels|first1=Lieven|last2=Schils|first2=Nele|title=Differential Online Exposure to Extremist Content and Political Violence: Testing the Relative Strength of Social Learning and Competing Perspectives|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=28|pages=1|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|doi=10.1080/09546553.2013.876414|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|fr|Société des designers graphiques du Québec}} (SDGQ)''' is the provincial [[graphic design]] association in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=Brooker2013/&gt;{{rp|57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cicic.ca/en/professions.aspx?sortcode=2.19.21&amp;prof=5241 |title=Information for foreign-trained graphic designers |website=[[Council of Ministers of Education, Canada|Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials]] |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Regarding GDC and RGD’s relationship, Brooker (2013) noted that “In 2003, the GDC cut the cord.

==History==
The history of the SDGQ can be traced back to 1972 when Quebec graphic designers, Georges Beaupré and Roger Lafortune,&lt;ref name=SDGQ-historique/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapointe2014&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Continuité |issue=141 |year=2014 |pages=50–52 |title=Identité graphique |first=Louis |last=Lapointe |language=fr |publisher=Éditions Continuité |url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/72096ac}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} formed a committee to found the {{lang|fr|Société des graphistes du Québec}} (SGQ).&lt;ref name=DG-historique/&gt; However, SGQ was not officially founded until 1974&lt;ref name=Brooker2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooker |first=Kevin |title=Professional Differences |journal=Applied Arts Magazine |volume=28 |issue=5 |date=November 2013 |pages=56–65 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asu&amp;AN=91936178&amp;site=ehost-live |issn=1196-1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DG-historique&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdgq.ca/historique.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225015014/http://www.sdgq.ca/historique.php |archivedate=December 25, 2009 |title=Historique |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=History |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MNBAQ2007&gt;{{cite book |title=Québec in design |author=[[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-920496-04-0 |others=Translated by Käthe Roth |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the new association was incorporated.&lt;ref name=NEQ/&gt; In 1995 the SGQ replaced the word “{{lang|fr|graphistes}}” (graphic designers or graphic artists) in its name with “{{lang|fr|designers graphiques}}” (graphic designers), changing its name to {{lang|fr|Société des designers graphiques du Québec}} (SDGQ).&lt;ref name=NEQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDGQ-historique/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapointe2014/&gt;{{rp|51}}

On June 14, 2011, during its annual general meeting, the SDGQ officially launched its certification program for graphic designers in Quebec.&lt;ref name=DG-dga&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdgq.ca/DGA/QA_DGA.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622075321/http://www.sdgq.ca/DGA/QA_DGA.html |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |title=Designer graphique agréé |first=Philippe |last=Lamarre |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the SDGQ adopted a new visual identity, replacing its existing “dg” [[wordmark]] with a new “SDGQ” wordmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/decouvrir/sdgq-nouveau-site-nouvelle-identite/ |title=SDGQ : Nouveau site, nouvelle identité |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=SGDQ: New site, new identity |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
SDGQ members working in the field of graphic design who have accumulated a minimum of 7 years of combined professional experience and education in graphic design can apply to be certified.&lt;ref name=SDGQ-dga-qui&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/dga/qui/ |title=Qui peut devenir DGA |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=Who can become a DGA |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates are required to submit their portfolios to a panel of three DGA-certified judges for an anonymous review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/dga/postuler/ |title=Postuler au titre du DGA |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=Apply for the DGA title |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the review, the candidate’s work is evaluated according to three criteria, namely, pertinence, responsibility, and creativity.&lt;ref name=SDGQ-dga-qui/&gt; Certified members are accredited with a {{lang|fr|Designer graphique agréé}}, DGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/decouvrir/dga-un-sceau-de-qualite/ |title=DGA : Un sceau de qualité |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=DGA: A seal of quality |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2011/09/28/sdgq-introduces-certification-program-for-quebec-designers |title=

DGAs are required to follow SDGQ’s code of ethics. There is a procedure in place to investigate DGAs who are accused of violating the code of ethics; violators can receive penalties up to and including having their DGA titles revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/dga/responsabilites/ |title=Responsabilités du DGA |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=Responsibilities of the DGA |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan to align the DGA and [[Association of Registered Graphic Designers|RGD]] certifications was announced in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/934569/canadian-graphic-design-industry-takes-giant-step-forward |title=Canadian graphic design industry takes giant step forward |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |publisher=[[CNW Group]] |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RGD-partners/&gt; and the written examination portion of the process was set to harmonize within 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/database/files/library/RGDandSDGQBipartiteAgreement_FR_1.pdf |title=La RGD et la SDGQ concluent un accord bipartite |first=Lionel |last=Gadoury |language=fr  |trans-title=RGD and SDGQ reach bipartite agreement |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DGA title is considered by the Association of Registered Graphic Designers to be the French equivalent of its RGD title.&lt;ref name=RGD-partners&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/industry-partners.php |title=Partner Organizations |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10743">The term '''standard social science model''' ('''SSSM''') was first introduced by [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] in the 1992 edited volume ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Jerome; Cosmides, Leda &amp; Tooby, John (1992). ''The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture''. Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  They used SSSM as a reference to [[social science]] philosophies related to the [[blank slate]], [[relativism]], [[social constructionism]], and [[cultural determinism]]. They argue that those philosophies, capsulized within SSSM, formed the dominant theoretical [[paradigm]] in the development of the [[social science]]s during the 20th century. According to their proposed SSSM paradigm, the mind is a general-purpose cognitive device shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref&gt;"instinct." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Feb. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289249/instinct].&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing SSSM, Tooby and Cosmides make a case for replacing SSSM with the integrated model (IM), also known as the integrated causal model (ICM), which melds cultural and biological theories for the development of the mind. Supporters of SSSM include those who feel the term was conceived as a point of argument in support of ICM specifically and [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP) in general.

== Alleged proponents ==
[[Steven Pinker]] names several prominent scientists as proponents of the standard social science model, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[John Money]], and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative theoretical paradigm: the integrated model ==
The authors of ''The Adapted Mind'' have argued&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992). The adapted mind.{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the SSSM is now out of date and that a progressive model for the social sciences requires evolutionarily-informed models of nature-nurture interactionism, grounded in the [[computational theory of mind]].  Tooby and Cosmides refer to this new model as the integrated model (IM).

Tooby and Cosmides&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992){{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide several comparisons between the SSSM and the IM, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Standard Social Science Model !! Integrated Model
|-
| Humans born a blank slate || Humans are born with a bundle of emotional, motivational and cognitive adaptations
|-
| Brain is a "general-purpose" computer  || Brain is a collection of modular, domain-specific processors
|-
| Culture/socialization programs behavior || Behavior is the result of interactions between evolved psychological mechanisms and cultural and environmental influences
|-
| Cultures free to vary any direction on any trait || Culture itself is based on a universal human nature and is constrained by it
|-
| Biology is relatively unimportant in understanding behavior || An analysis of interactions between nature and nurture is important in understanding behavior
|}

== Criticisms ==

{{POV|date=June 2014}}

Richardson (2007) argues that, as proponents of evolutionary psychology (EP), evolutionary psychologists developed the SSSM as a [[Rhetoric device|rhetorical technique]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The basic move is evident in Cosmides and Tooby's most aggressive brief for evolutionary psychology.

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] argues that the SSSM is based on a [[straw man]]. He views Pinker's claim that the SSSM has been the dominant theoretical paradigm in the social sciences since the 1920s as "completely untenable". In his argument, Sampson cites British education policies in the 20th century that were guided by social scientists and which were based on the belief that children had in-built talents and needs. Thus, he challenges Pinker's assertion that the view of the mind among all social scientists is a [[tabula rasa]]. Moreover, Sampson only conditionally agrees that the scientists Pinker associates with the SSSM, such as Skinner, Watson,{{who|reason=who is this particular watson?|date=November 2018}} and Mead, were influential, stating, "to identify them as responsible for the general tone of intellectual life for eighty years seems comical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Sampson |first1= Geoffrey |authorlink1= Geoffrey Sampson |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= The "Language Instinct" Debate: Revised Edition |url= |edition= |year= 2009 |publisher= Continuum |location= London |isbn= 978-0-8264-7384-4 |page= |pages= 134–5 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Neil Levy appears to concur with Sampson's straw man thesis regarding the conception of the SSSM, against which evolutionary psychologists direct much of their criticism. Levy writes: "No-one—not even Skinner and his followers—has ever believed in the blank slate of Pinker's title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Levy |first1= Neil |last2= |first2= |year= 2004 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Human Universals, and the Standard Social Science Model |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 19 |issue= 3 |pages= 459–72|publisher= [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |doi= 10.1023/B:BIPH.0000036111.64561.63 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.90.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] has criticized Tooby and Cosmides' arbitrary exclusion of [[economics]] and [[political science]] from their SSSM model, which Rose argues is "rather like excluding physiology and biochemistry from an account of the life sciences". She also states that Tooby and Cosmides have publicly indicted [[Sociology|sociologists]] and [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]] of inappropriate separatist behavior towards other academic disciplines while ignoring their newer efforts that demonstrate the complete opposite. Rose notes how sociologists and anthropologists have many new developments that involve study of the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and technology. Furthermore, Rose suggests that Tooby and Cosmides' characterization of scientists like Gould, Lewontin, [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] as SSSM adherents is based on an inaccurate reading of works like ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' and ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'', two books that have explored the interplay between biology and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rose |first= Hilary |authorlink= Hilary Rose (sociologist) |title= Alas Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology |editor1-last= Rose |editor1-first= Steven |editor2-last= Rose |editor2-first= Hilary |chapter= Colonising the Social Sciences? |chapterurl= https://books.google.fr/books?id=HQthCC191y8C&amp;pg=PT203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= London |publisher= [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |isbn= 978-0-09-928319-5 |year= 2001 |pages= 203–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Hampton (2004) contends that evolutionary psychologists' account of the SSSM misses the debate on the existence of psychological [[instinct]]s in the early part of the 20th century. He argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;psychological and behavioural thinkers have for long periods been immersed in the implications of Darwinism. It is plainly and factually incorrect for evolutionary psychology to deny this. And it is disingenuous to down-play it. Evolutionary psychologists who use the term "Standard Social Science Model" and rhetorical equivalents such as "the neo-behaviourist tradition" ... and "the tabula rasa view" ... undermine their own much-vaunted rigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Hampton |first= Simon Jonathan | date = 2004 |title= The instinct debate and the standard social science model |journal= Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender |volume= 6 |issue= 1|pages= 15–44 | publisher= Routledge |doi= 10.1080/14616660412331279657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Stress v strain A36 2.svg |290px |caption=[[Stress–strain curve]] for low-[[carbon steel]]. Hooke's law (see above) is only valid for the portion of the curve between the origin and the [[yield point]] (2).}}

Structural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads.

Common structural materials are:

==Iron==

===Wrought iron===
{{main|Wrought iron}}

Wrought iron is the simplest form of iron, and is almost pure iron (typically less than 0.15% carbon). It usually contains some [[slag]]. Its uses are almost entirely obsolete, and it is no longer commercially produced.

Wrought iron is very poor in fires. It is ductile, malleable and tough. It does not [[corrosion|corrode]] as easily as steel.

===Cast iron===
{{main|Cast iron}}

Cast iron is a brittle form of iron which is weaker in tension than in compression. It has a relatively low melting point, good fluidity, castability, excellent machinability and wear resistance. Though almost entirely replaced by steel in building structures, cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications, including pipes, machine and car parts.

Cast iron retains high strength in fires, despite its low melting point. It is usually around 95% iron, with between 2.1% and 4% carbon and between 1% and 3% silicon. It does not corrode as easily as steel.

===Steel===
[[File:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|right|The 630-foot (192 m) high, stainless-clad (type 304) [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial#The Gateway Arch|Gateway Arch]] in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]]]
{{main|Steel|Structural steel}}
{{see also|Steel frame}}

Steel is an iron alloy with controlled level of carbon (between 0.0 and 1.7% carbon).

Steel is used extremely widely in all types of structures, due to its relatively low cost, high strength-to-weight ratio and speed of construction.

Steel is a ductile material, which will behave elastically until it reaches yield (point 2 on the stress–strain curve), when it becomes plastic and will fail in a ductile manner (large strains, or extensions, before fracture at point 3 on the curve). Steel is equally strong in tension and compression.

Steel is weak in fires, and must be protected in most buildings. Despite its high strength to weight ratio, steel buildings have as much thermal mass as similar concrete buildings.

The [[elastic modulus]] of steel is approximately 205 [[GPa]].

Steel is very prone to corrosion ([[rust]]).

===Stainless steel===
{{main|Stainless steel}}

Stainless steel is an iron-carbon alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content. There are different types of stainless steel, containing different proportions of iron, carbon, [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]]. It has similar structural properties to steel, although its strength varies significantly.

It is rarely used for primary structure, and more for architectural finishes and building cladding.

It is highly resistant to corrosion and staining.

==Concrete==

[[File:Barcelona sagrada familia interno.jpg|thumb|The interior of the [[Sagrada Familia]], constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] to a design by [[Antoni Gaudí]]]]
[[File:trebar.jpg|thumb|right|A "cage" of [[rebar|reinforcing steel]]]]
{{main|Concrete}}

Concrete is used extremely widely in building and civil engineering structures, due to its low cost, flexibility, durability, and high strength. It also has high resistance to fire.

Concrete is a non-linear, non-elastic and brittle material. It is strong in compression and very weak in tension. It behaves non-linearly at all times. Because it has essentially zero strength in tension, it is almost always used as [[reinforced concrete]], a composite material. It is a mixture of [[sand]], aggregate, cement and water. It is placed in a mould, or form, as a liquid, and then it sets (goes off), due to a chemical reaction between the water and cement. The hardening of the concrete is called hydration. The reaction is exothermic (gives off heat).

Concrete increases in strength continually from the day it is cast. Assuming it is not cast under water or in constantly 100% relative humidity, it shrinks over time as it dries out, and it deforms over time due to a phenomenon called [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. Its strength depends highly on how it is mixed, poured, cast, compacted, cured (kept wet while setting), and whether or not any admixtures were used in the mix. It can be cast into any shape that a form can be made for. Its colour, quality, and finish depend upon the complexity of the structure, the material used for the form, and the skill of the worker.

The [[elastic modulus]] of concrete can vary widely and depends on the concrete mix, age, and quality, as well as on the type and duration of loading applied to it. It is usually taken as approximately 25 [[GPa]] for long-term loads once it has attained its full strength (usually considered to be at 28 days after casting). It is taken as approximately 38 [[GPa]] for very short-term loading, such as footfalls.

Concrete has very favourable properties in fire – it is not adversely affected by fire until it reaches very high temperatures. It also has very high mass, so it is good for providing sound insulation and heat retention (leading to lower energy requirements for the heating of concrete buildings). This is offset by the fact that producing and transporting concrete is very energy intensive. To study the material behavior plenty of numerical models were developed, e.g. the [[microplane model for constitutive laws of materials]].

=== Reinforced concrete ===
{{main|Reinforced concrete}}

Reinforced concrete is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ("rebars"), plates or fibers have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be brittle. In industrialised countries, nearly all concrete used in construction is reinforced concrete. Due to its weakness in tension capacity, concrete will fail suddenly and in brittle manner under flexural (bending) or tensile force unless adequately reinforced with steel.

=== Prestressed concrete ===
{{main|Prestressed concrete}}

'''Prestressed concrete''' is a method for overcoming the concrete's natural weakness in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]].&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|date=1989|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|date=1987|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to produce [[beam (structure)|beam]]s, floors or bridges with a longer [[Span (architecture)|span]] than is practical with ordinary [[reinforced concrete]]. Prestressing tendons (generally of high [[tension (mechanics)|tensile]] steel [[wire rope|cable]] or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would otherwise experience due to a bending load.

==Aluminium==
[[File:Stress v strain Aluminum 2.png|thumb|right|Stress vs. strain curve typical of aluminium&lt;br&gt;
1. Ultimate strength&lt;br&gt;
2. [[Yield strength]]&lt;br&gt;
3. Proportional Limit Stress&lt;br&gt;
4. Rupture&lt;br&gt;
5. Offset strain (typically 0.002).]]
{{main|Aluminium|Aluminium alloy}}

Aluminium is a soft, lightweight, malleable metal. The yield strength of pure aluminium is 7–11 MPa, while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa. Aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel. It is ductile, and easily machined, cast, and extruded.

Corrosion resistance is excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further oxidation. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper.

Aluminium is used in some building structures (mainly in facades) and very widely in aircraft engineering because of its good strength to weight ratio. It is a relatively expensive material.

In aircraft it is gradually being replaced by carbon composite materials.

==Composites==
[[File:rutan.variEze.g-veze.arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[VariEze|Light composite aircraft]]]]
{{main|Composite material}}

Composite materials are used increasingly in vehicles and aircraft structures, and to some extent in other structures. They are increasingly used in bridges, especially for conservation of old structures such as [[Coalport]] cast iron bridge built in 1818. Composites are often anisotropic (they have different material properties in different directions) as they can be laminar materials. They most often behave non-linearly and will fail in a brittle manner when overloaded.

They provide extremely good strength to weight ratios, but are also very expensive. The manufacturing processes, which are often extrusion, do not currently provide the economical flexibility that concrete or steel provide. The most commonly used in structural applications are [[glass-reinforced plastic]]s.

==Masonry==
[[File:Flemish Bond.jpg|thumb|A brick wall built using [[Brickwork#Flemish bond|Flemish bond]]]]
{{main|Masonry}}

Masonry has been used in structures for thousands of years, and can take the form of stone, brick or blockwork. Masonry is very strong in compression but cannot carry tension (because the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between bricks or blocks is unable to carry tension). Because it cannot carry structural tension, it also cannot carry bending, so masonry walls become unstable at relatively small heights. High masonry structures require stabilisation against lateral loads from [[buttress]]es (as with the [[flying buttress]]es seen in many European medieval churches) or from [[windpost]]s.

Historically masonry was constructed with no mortar or with lime mortar. In modern times cement based mortars are used. The mortar glues the blocks together, and also smooths out the interface between the blocks, avoiding localised point loads that might have led to cracking.

Since the widespread use of concrete, stone is rarely used as a primary structural material, often only appearing as a cladding, because of its cost and the high skills needed to produce it. Brick and concrete blockwork have taken its place.

Masonry, like concrete, has good sound insulation properties and high thermal mass, but is generally less energy intensive to produce. It is just as energy intensive as concrete to transport.

==Timber==
[[File:London, UK (August 2014) - 156.JPG|thumb|The reconstructed [[Globe Theatre]], London, by [[Buro Happold]]]]
{{main|Timber}}

Timber is the oldest of structural materials, and though mainly supplanted by steel, masonry and concrete, it is still used in a significant number of buildings. The properties of timber are non-linear and very variable, depending on the quality, treatment of wood, and type of wood supplied. The design of wooden structures is based strongly on empirical evidence.

Wood is strong in tension and compression, but can be weak in bending due to its fibrous structure. Wood is relatively good in fire as it chars, which provides the wood in the centre of the element with some protection and allows the structure to retain some strength for a reasonable length of time.

==History==

===Inception===
In 2004, [[Leiden University]] professor [[George K. Miley]] first began exploring the idea of setting up an astronomy programme to educate and inspire young children, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds. He had been awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and decided to use part of the associated funding to explore the feasibility of setting up such a programme. With considerable support and encouragement from [[Claus Madsen]] at ESO, a successful workshop was held in Germany and it was agreed that the programme was worth pursuing. Universe Awareness (UNAWE) was born.

Shortly afterwards, Carolina Ödman was appointed as the first UNAWE International Project Manager. In 2006, thanks to a grant provided by the Netherlands Minister of Education Culture and Science, Ms. van der Hoeven, the UNAWE International Office was founded at Leiden Observatory, the Netherlands. With the help of Sarah Levin as Media Coordinator, Ödman built UNAWE into a thriving global project, with a network of about 400 experts from 40 countries.

===Reach===
UNAWE became a Cornerstone project of the successful UN-ratified IAU/UNESCO International Year of Astronomy in 2009 (IYA2009). During IYA2009, thousands of UNAWE activities were organised in more than 45 countries. For example, in Venezuela, 43 teacher training sessions reached more than 1500 teachers and well over 60 000 children.

2010 saw many changes for UNAWE. Firstly, Ödman left her coordinating role with UNAWE to join the [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] Next Einstein Initiative, handing over the reins to the former Global Coordinator for IYA2009, Pedro Russo. Later that year, the European Union awarded a grant of 1.9 million euros to fund a 3-year project called European Universe Awareness (EU-UNAWE), which builds on the work of Universe Awareness (UNAWE). With this grant, EU-UNAWE is now being further developed in six selected countries: the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and South Africa.

EU-UNAWE is endorsed by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) and it is now an integral part of the IAU Strategic Plan 2010–2020, which is called Astronomy for the Developing World. This is an ambitious blueprint that aims to use astronomy to foster education and provide skills and competencies in science and technology throughout the world, particularly in developing countries..

[[Image:Waveguide collection.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Collection of standard waveguide components.]]
{{Electromagnetism|Network}}

In [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetics]] and [[communications system engineering|communications engineering]], the term '''waveguide''' may refer to any linear structure that conveys electromagnetic waves between its endpoints. However, the original&lt;ref name="IEEEdict1997"&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “The IEEE standard dictionary of electrical and electronics terms”; 6th ed. New York, N.Y., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, c1997. IEEE Std 100-1996. {{ISBN|1-55937-833-6}} [ed. Standards Coordinating Committee 10, Terms and Definitions; Jane Radatz, (chair)]&lt;/ref&gt; and most common&lt;ref name="IEEEdict1997"/&gt; meaning is a hollow metal pipe used to carry [[radio wave]]s.  This type of waveguide is used as a [[transmission line]] mostly at [[microwave]] frequencies, for such purposes as connecting microwave [[transmitter]]s and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] to their [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, in equipment such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[radar]] sets, [[satellite communications]], and microwave radio links.

A '''dielectric waveguide''' employs a solid [[dielectric]] rod rather than a hollow pipe. An [[optical fibre]] is a dielectric guide designed to work at optical frequencies. [[Transmission lines]] such as [[microstrip]], [[coplanar waveguide]], [[stripline]] or [[coaxial cable]] may also be considered to be waveguides.

The electromagnetic waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may be imagined as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite walls of the guide. For the particular case of '''rectangular waveguide''', it is possible to base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a dielectric waveguide may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the dielectric by [[total internal reflection]] at its surface. Some structures, such as [[non-radiative dielectric waveguide]]s and the [[Goubau line]], use both metal walls and dielectric surfaces to confine the wave.

==History==

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He showed that the waves could travel without attenuation only in specific [[normal mode]]s  with either the [[electric field]] ([[TE mode]]s)  or [[magnetic field]] ([[TM mode]]s), or both, perpendicular to the direction of propagation.  He also showed each mode had a [[cutoff frequency]] below which waves would not propagate.  Since the cutoff wavelength for a given tube was of the same order as its width, it was clear that a hollow conducting tube could not carry radio wavelengths much larger than its diameter. In 1902 R. H. Weber observed that electromagnetic waves travel at a slower speed in tubes than in free space, and deduced the reason; that the waves travel in a "zigzag" path as they reflect from the walls.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kizer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal | last1  = Weber | first1 = R.

Prior to the 1920s, practical work on radio waves concentrated on the low frequency end of the radio spectrum, as these frequencies were better for long-range communication.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  These were far below the frequencies that could propagate in even large waveguides, so there was little experimental work on waveguides during this period, although a few experiments were done.   In a June 1, 1894 lecture, "The work of Hertz", before the [[Royal Society]], [[Oliver Lodge]] demonstrated the transmission of 3 inch radio waves from a [[spark gap]] through a short cylindrical copper duct.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge"&gt;{{cite journal

Barrow had become interested in high frequencies in 1930 studying under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  At MIT beginning in 1932 he worked on high frequency antennas to generate narrow beams of radio waves to locate aircraft in fog.  He invented a [[horn antenna]] and hit on the idea of using a hollow pipe as a feedline to feed radio waves to the antenna.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  By March 1936 he had derived the propagation modes and cutoff frequency in a rectangular waveguide.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  The source he was using had a large wavelength of 40&amp;nbsp;cm, so for his first successful waveguide experiments he used a 16-foot section of air duct, 18 inches in diameter.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;

Barrow and Southworth became aware of each other's work a few weeks before both were scheduled to present papers on waveguides to a combined meeting of the [[American Physical Society]] and the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] in May 1936.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  They amicably worked out credit sharing and patent division arrangements.

The development of centimeter [[radar]] during World War 2 and the first high power microwave tubes, the [[klystron]] (1938) and [[cavity magnetron]] (1940), resulted in the first widespread use of waveguide.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;       Standard waveguide "plumbing" components were manufactured, with flanges on the end which could be bolted together.  After the war in the 1950s and 60s waveguides became common in commercial microwave systems, such as airport radar and [[microwave relay]] networks which were built to transmit telephone calls and television programs between cities.

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:Diplexer1.jpg|thumb|Example of waveguides and a [[diplexer]] in an air traffic control radar]]

Depending on the frequency, waveguides can be constructed from either conductive or [[dielectric]] materials. Generally, the lower the frequency to be passed the larger the waveguide is. For example, the natural waveguide the earth forms given by the dimensions between the conductive ionosphere and the ground as well as the circumference at the median altitude of the Earth is resonant at 7.83&amp;nbsp;Hz. This is known as [[Schumann resonance]]. On the other hand, waveguides used in [[extremely high frequency]] (EHF) communications can be less than a millimeter in width.

==Analysis==

Electromagnetic waveguides are analyzed by solving [[Maxwell's equations]], or their reduced form, the [[electromagnetic wave equation]], with [[boundary conditions]] determined by the properties of the materials and their interfaces. These equations have multiple solutions, or modes, which are [[eigenfunction]]s of the equation system. Each mode is characterized by a [[cutoff frequency]] below which the mode cannot exist in the guide.  Waveguide propagation modes depend on the operating [[wavelength]] and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and the shape and size of the guide. The [[longitudinal mode]] of a waveguide is a particular [[standing wave]] pattern formed by waves confined in the cavity. The [[transverse mode]]s are classified into different types:
* TE modes (transverse electric) have no electric field in the direction of propagation.
* TM modes (transverse magnetic) have no magnetic field in the direction of propagation.
* TEM modes (transverse electromagnetic) have no electric nor magnetic field in the direction of propagation.
* Hybrid modes have both electric and magnetic field components in the direction of propagation.
In hollow waveguides (single conductor), TEM waves are not possible, since [[Maxwell's Equations]] will give that the electric field must then have zero divergence and zero curl and be equal to zero at boundaries, resulting in a zero field (or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 \Phi=0&lt;/math&gt; with boundary conditions guaranteeing only the trivial solution).  This contrasts with two-conductor [[transmission line]]s used at lower frequencies; [[coaxial cable]], [[twin lead|parallel wire line]] and [[stripline]], in which TEM mode is possible.   Additionally, the propagating modes (i.e. TE and TM) inside the waveguide can be mathematically expressed as the superposition of TEM waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chakravorty | first1 = Pragnan | year = 2015| title = Analysis of Rectangular Waveguides – An Intuitive Approach | url = | journal = IETE Journal of Education | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 76–80 | doi = 10.1080/09747338.2014.1002819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency is termed the '''dominant mode''' of the guide. It is common to choose the size of the guide such that only this one mode can exist in the frequency band of operation. In rectangular and circular (hollow pipe) waveguides, the dominant modes are designated the TE&lt;sub&gt;1,0&lt;/sub&gt; mode and TE&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; modes respectively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Y.

In the [[microwave]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], a waveguide normally consists of a hollow metallic conductor.  These waveguides can take the form of single conductors with or without a dielectric coating, e.g. the [[Goubau line]] and helical waveguides.  Hollow waveguides must be one-half wavelength or more in diameter in order to support one or more transverse wave modes.

Waveguides may be filled with pressurized gas to inhibit arcing and prevent [[multipaction]], allowing higher power transmission. Conversely, waveguides may be required to be evacuated as part of evacuated systems (e.g. electron beam systems).

A [[slotted waveguide]] is generally used for [[radar]] and other similar applications. The waveguide serves as a feed path, and each slot is a separate radiator, thus forming an antenna.  This structure has the capability of generating a radiation pattern to launch an [[electromagnetic wave]] in a specific relatively narrow and controllable direction.

A '''closed waveguide''' is an electromagnetic waveguide (a) that is tubular, usually with a circular or rectangular cross section, (b) that has electrically conducting walls, (c) that may be hollow or filled with a [[dielectric]] material, (d) that can support a large number of discrete propagating modes, though only a few may be practical, (e) in which each discrete mode defines the [[propagation constant]] for that mode, (f) in which the [[field (physics)|field]] at any point is describable in terms of the supported modes, (g) in which there is no [[radiation]] field, and (h) in which discontinuities and bends may cause mode conversion but not radiation.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The dimensions of a hollow metallic waveguide determine which wavelengths it can support, and in which modes. Typically the waveguide is operated so that only a single mode is present.  The lowest order mode possible is generally selected. Frequencies below the guide's cutoff frequency will not propagate. It is possible to operate waveguides at higher order modes, or with multiple modes present, but this is usually impractical.

Waveguides are almost exclusively made of metal and mostly rigid structures. There are certain types of "corrugated" waveguides that have the ability to flex and bend but only used where essential since they degrade propagation properties. Due to propagation of energy in mostly air or space within the waveguide, it is one of the lowest loss transmission line types and highly preferred for high frequency applications where most other types of transmission structures introduce large losses. Due to the [[skin effect]] at high frequencies, electric current along the walls penetrates typically only a few [[micrometre|micrometers]] into the metal of the inner surface. Since this is where most of the resistive loss occurs, it is important that the conductivity of interior surface be kept as high as possible. For this reason, most waveguide interior surfaces are plated with [[copper]], [[silver]], or [[gold]].
  
Voltage standing wave ratio ([[VSWR]]) measurements may be taken to ensure that a waveguide is contiguous and has no leaks or sharp bends. If such bends or holes in the waveguide surface are present, this may diminish the performance of both transmitter and receiver equipment connected at either end. Poor transmission through the waveguide may also occur as a result of moisture build up which corrodes and degrades conductivity of the inner surfaces, which is crucial for low loss propagation. For this reason, waveguides are nominally fitted with [[microwave windows]] at the outer end that will not interfere with propagation but keep the elements out. Moisture can also cause [[fungus]] build up or arcing in high power systems such as radio or radar transmitters. Moisture in waveguides can typically be prevented with [[silica gel]], a [[desiccant]], or slight pressurization of the waveguide cavities with dry [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]. Desiccant silica gel canisters may be attached with screw-on nibs and higher power systems will have pressurized tanks for maintaining pressure including leakage monitors. Arcing may also occur if there is a hole, tear or bump in the conducting walls, if transmitting at high power (usually 200 watts or more)&lt;!-- (Need reference for the power statement) --&gt;.

Voltage standing waves occur when impedance mismatches in the waveguide cause energy to reflect back in the opposite direction of propagation. In addition to limiting the effective transfer of energy, these reflections can cause higher voltages in the waveguide and damage equipment.

===Waveguide in practice===
In practice, waveguides act as the equivalent of cables for [[super high frequency]] (SHF) systems. For such applications, it is desired to operate waveguides with only one mode propagating through the waveguide. With rectangular waveguides, it is possible to design the waveguide such that the frequency band over which only one mode propagates is as high as 2:1 (i.e. the ratio of the upper band edge to lower band edge is two).  The relation between the waveguide dimensions and the lowest frequency is simple: if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle W&lt;/math&gt; is the greater of its two dimensions, then the longest wavelength that will propagate is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \lambda\;=\;2W&lt;/math&gt; and the lowest frequency is thus &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f\;=\; c/\lambda\;=\;c/2W&lt;/math&gt;

With circular waveguides, the highest possible bandwidth allowing only a single mode to propagate is only 1.3601:1.&lt;ref&gt;For bandwidths lower than 2:1 it is more common to express them as a percentage of the center frequency, which in the case of 1.360:1 is 26.55&amp;nbsp;%. For reference, a 2:1 bandwidth corresponds to a 66.67&amp;nbsp;% bandwidth. The reason for expressing bandwidths as a ratio of upper to lower band edges for bandwidths greater than 66.67&amp;nbsp;% is that in the limiting case that the lower edge goes to zero (or the upper edge goes to infinity), the bandwidth approaches 200&amp;nbsp;%, which means that the entire range of 3:1 to infinity:1 map into the range 100&amp;nbsp;% to 200&amp;nbsp;%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because rectangular waveguides have a much larger bandwidth over which only a single mode can propagate, standards exist for rectangular waveguides, but not for circular waveguides. In general (but not always), standard waveguides are designed such that
* one band starts where another band ends, with another band that overlaps the two bands&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;
* the lower edge of the band is approximately 30% higher than the waveguide's [[cutoff frequency]]
* the upper edge of the band is approximately 5% lower than the cutoff frequency of the next higher order mode
* the waveguide height is half the waveguide width

The first condition is to allow for applications near band edges. The second condition limits [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], a phenomenon in which the velocity of propagation is a function of frequency. It also limits the loss per unit length. The third condition is to avoid [[Evanescent wave#Evanescent-wave coupling|evanescent-wave coupling]] via higher order modes. The fourth condition is that which allows a 2:1 operation bandwidth. Although it is possible to have a 2:1 operating bandwidth when the height is less than half the width, having the height exactly half the width maximizes the power that can propagate inside the waveguide before [[dielectric breakdown]] occurs.

Below is a table of standard waveguides. The waveguide name ''WR'' stands for ''waveguide rectangular'', and the number is the inner dimension width of the waveguide in hundredths of an [[inch]] (0.01&amp;nbsp;inch = 0.254&amp;nbsp;mm) rounded to the nearest hundredth of an inch.

:&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; For historical reasons the outside rather than the inside dimensions of these waveguides are 2:1 (with wall thickness WG6–WG10: 0.08" (2.0 mm), WG11A–WG15: 0.064" (1.6 mm), WG16–WG17: 0.05" (1.3 mm), WG18–WG28: 0.04" (1.0 mm))&lt;ref name="Baden-Fuller"/&gt;
 
For the frequencies in the table above, the main advantage of waveguides over [[coax cable|coaxial cable]]s is that waveguides support propagation with lower loss. For lower frequencies, the waveguide dimensions become impractically large, and for higher frequencies the dimensions become impractically small (the manufacturing tolerance becomes a significant portion of the waveguide size).

At these wavelengths dielectric waveguides can have lower losses than metal waveguides.   [[Optical fiber]] is a form of dielectric waveguide used at optical wavelengths.

One difference between dielectric and metal waveguides is that at a metal surface the electromagnetic waves are tightly confined; at high frequencies the electric and magnetic fields penetrate a very short distance into the metal.  In contrast, the surface of the dielectric waveguide is an interface between two dielectrics, so the fields of the wave penetrate outside the dielectric in the form of an [[evanescent wave|evanescent]] (non-propagating) wave.&lt;ref name="Rana" /&gt;

'''Zoomusicology''' is a field of [[musicology]] and [[zoology]] or more specifically, [[Animal communication|zoosemiotics]]. Zoomusicology is the study of the [[music]] of [[animal]]s, or rather the [[musical aspect]]s of [[sound]] or [[communication]] produced and received by animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=Emily|last2=Gingras|first2=Bruno|date=October 2015|title=Zoomusicology|journal=Current Biology|volume=25|issue=19|pages=R819–R820|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.039|pmid=26439331|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoomusicology is a separate field from [[ethnomusicology]], the study of human music.

Snowden and Teie created species-specific music and tested it on cotton-top tamarins, ''[[Cotton-top tamarin|Saguinus oedipus]]'' at the University of Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="Biol.

Lett." /&gt; There have also been cases where composers have performed with animals for example, David Rothenberg, is a musician who has created music with humpback whales, ''[[Humpback whale|Megaptera novaeangliae]].''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sibetrans.com/trans/articulo/97/to-wail-with-a-whale-anatomy-of-an-interspecies-duet|title=TRANS - Revista Transcultural de Música - Transcultural Music Review|website=www.sibetrans.com|language=es|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples are discussed in greater detail below.

Composers have evoked or imitated animal sounds in compositions including [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''The Hen'' (1728), [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s ''Carnival of the Animals'' (1886), [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s ''Catalogue of the Birds'' (1956–58) and [[Pauline Oliveros]]'s ''El Relicario de los Animales'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Von Gunden, Heidi|year=1983|title=The Music of Pauline Oliveros|isbn=978-0-8108-1600-8|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[Alan Hovhaness]]'s ''And God Created Great Whales'' (1970), [[George Crumb]]'s ''Vox Balaenae'' (Voice of the Whale) (1971) and [[Gabriel Pareyon]]'s ''Invention over the song of the [[Vireo atricapilla|Vireo atriccapillus]]'' (1999) and ''Kha Pijpichtli Kuikatl'' (2003). The Indian zoomusicologist, A. J. Mithra has composed music using bird, animal and [[frog sound]]s since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.indiasendangered.com/interview-a-j-mithra-making-music-with-animal-calls Interview: a j mithra, Making Music with Animal Calls]", ''IndiasEndangered.com''. "The only known zoo musicologist in India and the second in the world after [[Jim Fassett]] who was known to create similar music from animal sounds way back in 1955."&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowden and Teie performed an experiment on [[Cotton-top tamarin|Cotton-top tamarins, ''Saguinus oedipus'']], to determine if music would lead to behavioural changes, and whether music made by other species would elicit similar behavioural responses as the music of one’s own species. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Teie|first2=David|date=2010-02-23|title=Affective responses in tamarins elicited by species-specific music|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/30|journal=Biology Letters|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=30–32|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0593|issn=1744-9561|pmc=2817256|pmid=19726444}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment involved two separate categories of music - one was affiliation-based, the other was fear/threat-based music. Within the two categories, the experimenter varied whether the music was produced by [[Human|humans]] or tamarins.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During the experiment, a baseline behaviour measurement was established, proceeded by the experimental condition, which was a piece of music that was played for 30 seconds. Following this, behaviour was analyzed for a total of 5 minutes. This analysis was made by an observer who was unaware of the true hypothesis of the experiment, and simply noted different behaviours which they had witnessed.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The experimenters found that the Tamarins altered their behaviour specifically when listening to Tamarin music. For example, when music from the affiliation condition was played, the behavioural response of the tamarins involved a decrease in overall movement and an increase in both social and foraging behaviour.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This contrasted the behaviour observed when the fear/threat based music was played. During this condition, the Tamarins were more likely to move around and show anxiety-based behaviour, as well as, an increase in social behaviour similar to that seen in the affiliation condition. It should also be noted that while the Tamarins did not show behavioural changes to human music as clearly as they did to their species-specific music, there was some behavioural change.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The Tamarins showed decreased movement when listening to human fear/threat based music and a decrease in anxious behaviour when listening to human affiliation music. This experiment, demonstrates that music is capable of eliciting changes in the behaviour of animals, most especially when the music is species-specific.

[[Humpback whale|Humpback whales, ''Megaptera novaeangliae'']], are capable of the production of complex songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sibetrans.com/trans/articulo/97/to-wail-with-a-whale-anatomy-of-an-interspecies-duet|title=TRANS - Revista Transcultural de Música - Transcultural Music Review|website=www.sibetrans.com|language=es|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These songs are amongst some of the longest measured in animals.  Only male humpback whales perform these vocalizations; it was initially hypothesized that these songs may be a part of the [[sexual selection]] process. This point however, is unclear. It has been found that males only began their song after joining a group where pairs of mother and calf were present.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Joshua N.|last2=Goldizen|first2=Anne W.|last3=Dunlop|first3=Rebecca A.|last4=Noad|first4=Michael J.|date=2008-08|title=Songs of male humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, are involved in intersexual interactions|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=76|issue=2|pages=467–477|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.02.013|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the reason behind this behaviour is uncertain, some have hypothesized that the songs produced by male humpback whales may be a part of escorting, or accompanying females. It should also be noted that singing can be a costly behaviour, because it can lead to more attention being drawn. In the humpback whales’ situation, their singing can attract other competing males.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Yet, the singing behaviour continues and therefore, it is assumed that the songs are critical to the [[Courtship behavior|courtship behaviour]] of the humpback whales.

=== Birds ===
[[File:Song_Sparrow.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Song_Sparrow.jpg|thumb|Song Sparrow]]
Perhaps the most well-known form of music found in non-human animals is [[birdsong]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothenberg|first=David|last2=Roeske|first2=Tina C.|last3=Voss|first3=Henning U.|last4=Naguib|first4=Marc|last5=Tchernichovski|first5=Ofer|date=2014-02|title=Investigation of musicality in birdsong|journal=Hearing Research|volume=308|pages=71–83|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2013.08.016|issn=0378-5955|pmc=3947120|pmid=24036130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birdsong is different from normal calls. For example, a call will usually simply function to communicate a direct message.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; For instance, a bird call could be used to direct attention that a predator is near. Meanwhile a song contains more repetition and usually will have distinct structure to it, with a specific beginning, middle, and end.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In many species of [[Songbird|songbirds]], songs seem to be used both as a way to attract potential mates, as well as to mark and defend one's territory. It has been observed that young songbirds acquire their ability to produce song from imitation of adult birds.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Interestingly enough, there seems to be a critical period for song learning. In one experiment, they compared birds raised in isolation, (this involved isolation from other birds as well as the vocalizations of other birds), with those raised in a colony, without these forms of isolation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Using an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] scan and the [[Blood-oxygen-level dependent imaging|blood oxygen level dependent]] (BOLD) as a measurement of brain activity, it was found that birds raised in the isolation condition did not appear to show a preference between their own songs and a repetitive song. Meanwhile colony-raised birds showed a stronger reaction to their own song being played back.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

[[File:Imago_O_furnacalis.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Imago_O_furnacalis.jpg|thumb|Imago O furnacalis]]
One potential barrier in the study of zoomusicology is that there are some forms of music produced by various animals which humans are incapable of hearing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balenger|first=Susan L.|date=2015-07|title=Stridulated soft song by singing insects|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347215001244|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=105|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.03.024|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; This music is very low in amplitude and is known as quiet song, whisper communication, or soft song.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This low amplitude music has been shown in birds, as well as insects and is linked to behaviour. Moth species have been shown to have developed the ability to communicate using ultrasonic sounds, and this ability has transferred over to their production of soft songs. In the [[Ostrinia furnacalis|Asian corn borer moth, ''Ostrinia furnacalis'']], males produce an ultrasonic soft song to initiate courtship behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The song that the male produces is so quiet that the female must be within a range of three centimeters in order to hear the song. In hearing the song, the female stays in one place and is completely still, this allows the male to initiate mating behaviour.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reason that the female remains still, is because this song sounds very similar to sounds that a bat would produce. The female therefore remains still in order to avoid potential [[predation]]. There is of course another added benefit to this soft song produced by the male Asian corn borer moth, and that is that the song is so quiet that it decreases the males’ predation risk.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although these soft songs are far less well-known to the general public, they are an important aspect of zoomusicology and the further understanding of [[animal behaviour]].    

== Auditory enrichment and therapeutic effects of music on animals ==

=== Cows ===
In a study at the [[University of Leicester]], Liam MacKenzie and Adrian North found that playing music for [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] had an effect on the amount of milk that they produced.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.le.ac.uk/press/press/moosicstudy.html|title=Administration: 'Moosic Study' Reveals Way of Increasing Milk Yields  [Psychology; Agriculture; Industry]|website=www.le.ac.uk|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a nine-week period, dairy cows were exposed to fast (&gt; 120 BPM), slow (&lt; 100 BPM), and no music. Music was played for the cows 12 hours a day from 5 AM to 5 PM.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study found that cows exposed to slow music, like [[R.E.M.|REM]]'s '[[Everybody Hurts]]' or [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s '[[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]],' produced 3% more milk than cows that were exposed to fast music, like [[Pumping on Your Stereo|Pumping on your Stereo]] by [[Supergrass]] and 'Size of a Cow' by [[The Wonder Stuff|Wonderstuff]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bovine milk production has long been thought to be affected by exposure to music. Some farmers already expose their cows to music to aid in milk production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themilkingparlourblog.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/do-cows-like-music/|title=Do cows like music?|date=2015-05-26|work=the  milking  parlour  blog|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Dogs ===
Decreased stress levels have been observed in kennelled dogs that were exposed to Classical music, but rapid [[habituation]] was also observed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=A.|last2=Dowell|first2=F.J.|last3=Evans|first3=N.P.|date=2017-03|title=‘The effect of different genres of music on the stress levels of kennelled dogs’|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.01.024|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=171|pages=207–215|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.01.024|issn=0031-9384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 follow up study, kennelled dogs were exposed to five different genres of music including [[Soft rock|Soft Rock]], [[Motown]], [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Reggae]], and [[Classical music|Classical]] in order to determine whether or not increased variety of music could reduce habituation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The study found the Heart Rate Variability, which indicates a decreased stress level, was significantly higher when the dogs were played Reggae and Soft Rock, but the other three genres had a similar but less pronounced effect. In addition, the dogs were much more likely to lie down rather than stand while the music was being played.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The study suggested that the increased variety of music decreased habituation that was present when playing exclusively classical music, though the dogs responded best when exposed to Reggae and Soft Rock.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Zoomusicologists==
Researchers in a wide range of fields including [[music]], [[semiotics]], [[philosophy]] and [[biology]] conduct zoomusicology research. This is due to the fact that the field of zoomusicology is so broad and reaches many disciplines. Musician and zoomusicologist Hollis Taylor has conducted an extensive study of the Pied Butcherbird, [[Pied butcherbird|Cracticus nigrogularis]] over the past 15 years, including interdisciplinary research with philosophers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TAYLOR|first=HOLLIS|date=March 2014|title=Whose Bird Is It? Messiaen's Transcriptions of Australian Songbirds|journal=Twentieth-Century Music|volume=11|issue=1|pages=63–100|doi=10.1017/s1478572213000194|issn=1478-5722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarinetist, and philosopher [[David Rothenberg]] plays music with animals, and has written books on the relationship between bird, insect, and whale song and human music.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Composer [[Emily Doolittle]] has written numerous pieces based on animal songs, and has published interdisciplinary music-science research on the hermit thrush&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doolittle|first1=Emily|last2=Gingras|first2=Bruno|last3=Endres|first3=Dominik|last4=Fitch|first4=Tecumseh|title=Overtone-based pitch selection in hermit thrush song: Unexpected convergence with scale construction in human music|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=46|pages=16616–16621|doi=10.1073/pnas.1406023111|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/46/16616.short|pmid=25368163|pmc=4246323|date=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the musician wren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doolittle|first1=Emily|author2=Henrik Brumm|title=O Canto do Uirapuru|url=http://www.musicstudies.org/JIMSvol6issue1PRINT/Doolittle_JIMS_12060103.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Belanger has also contributed to the field of zoomusicology, with her work on soft song in the asian corn borer moth, ''[[Ostrinia furnacalis]]'' and its relationship to the initiation of mating behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balenger|first=Susan L.|date=2015-07|title=Stridulated soft song by singing insects|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347215001244|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=105|pages=275–280|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.03.024|issn=0003-3472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Patricia Gray has examined the music that can be seen in whales and songbirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Patricia M.|last2=Krause|first2=Bernie|last3=Atema|first3=Jelle|last4=Payne|first4=Roger|last5=Krumhansl|first5=Carol|last6=Baptista|first6=Luis|date=2001|title=The Music of Nature and the Nature of Music|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5501|pages=52–54|jstor=3082167}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is by no means all encompassing, but simply lists some notable members of the zoomusicology research community.
