Over the last two centuries many environmental '''chemical observations''' have been made from a variety of ground-based, [[aircraft|airborne]], and [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] platforms and deposited in [[databases]].  Many of these [[databases]] are publicly available. All of the instruments mentioned in this article give online public access to their data. These observations are critical in developing our understanding of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and issues such as [[climate change]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[air quality]]. Some of the external links provide repositories of many of these datasets in one place. For example, the Cambridge Atmospheric Chemical Database, is a large [[database]] in a uniform [[ASCII]] format. Each observation is augmented with the meteorological conditions such as the [[temperature]], [[potential temperature]], [[geopotential height]], and equivalent [[Potential vorticity|PV]] latitude.

==Ground-based and balloon observations==
* '''NDSC observations'''. The [http://www.ndsc.ncep.noaa.gov/ Network for the Detection for Stratospheric Change] (NDSC) is a set of high-quality remote-sounding research stations for observing and understanding the physical and chemical state of the stratosphere. Ozone and key ozone-related chemical compounds and parameters are targeted for measurement. The NDSC is a major component of the international upper atmosphere research effort and has been endorsed by national and international scientific agencies, including the International Ozone Commission, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The primary instruments and measurements are: Ozone lidar (vertical profiles of ozone from the tropopause to at least 40&amp;nbsp;km altitude; in some cases tropospheric ozone will also be measured). Temperature lidar (vertical profiles of temperature from about 30 to 80&amp;nbsp;km). Aerosol lidar (vertical profiles of aerosol optical depth in the lower stratosphere). Water vapor  lidar (vertical profiles of water vapor in the lower stratosphere). Ozone microwave (vertical profiles of stratospheric ozone from 20 to 70&amp;nbsp;km). H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O microwave (vertical profiles water vapor from about 20 to 80&amp;nbsp;km). ClO microwave (vertical profiles of ClO from about 25 to 45&amp;nbsp;km, depending on latitude). Ultraviolet/Visible spectrograph (column abundance of ozone, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and, at some latitudes, OClO and BrO). Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (column abundances of a broad range of species including ozone, HCl, NO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ClONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
* '''MkIV observations'''. The [http://mark4sun.jpl.nasa.gov/ MkIV] Interferometer is a Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectrometer, designed and built at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in 1984, to remotely sense the composition of the Earth's atmosphere by the technique of solar absorption spectrometry. This was born out of concern that man-made pollutants (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, aircraft exhaust) might perturb the ozone layer. Since 1984, the MkIV Interferometer has participated in 3 NASA DC-8 polar aircraft campaigns, and has successfully completed 15 balloon flights. In addition, the MkIV Interferometer made over 900 days of ground-based observations from many different locations, including [[McMurdo Station|McMurdo]], [[Antarctica]] in 1986.
* '''Sonde observations'''. The [http://www.woudc.org/index_e.html World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre] (WOUDC) is one of five World Data Centres which are part of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). The WOUDC is operated by the Experimental Studies Division of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) — formerly Atmospheric Environment Service (AES), Environment Canada and is located in Toronto. The WOUDC began as the World Ozone Data Centre (WODC) in 1960 and produced its first data publication of Ozone Data for the World in 1964. In June 1992, the AES agreed to a request from the WMO to add ultraviolet radiation data to the WODC. The Data Centre has since been renamed to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) with the two component parts: the WODC and the World Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WUDC).

==Airborne observations==
* '''Aircraft observations'''. Many aircraft campaigns have been conducted as part of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070214031222/http://suborbital.nasa.gov/ Suborbital Science Program] and by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060930215700/http://www.espo.nasa.gov/project/mission2.html Earth Science Project Office] an overview of these campaigns is available. The data can be accessed from the Earth Science Project Office [http://espoarchive.nasa.gov/archive/arcs/ archives].
* '''MOZAIC observations'''. The [http://mozaic.aero.obs-mip.fr/web/ MOZAIC] program (Measurement of OZone and water vapour by AIrbus in-service airCraft) was initiated in 1993 by European scientists, aircraft manufacturers and airlines to collect experimental data. Its goal is to help understand the atmosphere and how it is changing under the influence of human activity, with particular interest in the effects of aircraft. MOZAIC consists of automatic and regular measurements of ozone and water vapour by five long range passenger airliners flying all over the world. The aim is to build a large database of measurements to allow studies of chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, and hence to validate global chemistry transport models. MOZAIC data provide, in particular, detailed ozone and water vapour climatologies at 9–12&amp;nbsp;km where subsonic aircraft emit most of their exhaust and which is a very critical domain (e.g. radiatively and S/T exchanges) still imperfectly described in existing models. This will be valuable to improve knowledge about the processes occurring in the upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere (UT/LS), and the model treatment of near tropopause chemistry and transport. The MOZAIC data is restricted access, to obtain access the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070108203102/http://mozaic.aero.obs-mip.fr/web/features/database/access.html forms] need to be filled out.
* '''CARIBIC observations'''. The [http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com CARIBIC] (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) project is an innovative scientific project to study and monitor important chemical and physical processes in the Earth's atmosphere. Detailed and extensive measurements are made during long distance flights on board the [[Airbus]] [[A340-600]] "Leverkusen" (http://www.flightradar24.com/data/airplanes/D-AIHE/). We deploy an airfreight container with automated scientific apparatuses, which are connected to an air and particle (aerosol) inlet underneath the aircraft. In contrast to MOZAIC, CARIBIC is only installed on one aircraft, but it measures a much wider spectrum of atmospheric constituents ([http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com/ CARIBIC -&gt; instrumentation]). Both, CARIBIC and MOZAIC are integrated in [http://www.iagos.org IAGOS]. Data exist from 1998-2002 and from 2004-today. It can be requested via [http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com/ CARIBIC -&gt; data access].

==Space shuttle observations==
* '''ATMOS observations'''. The [http://remus.jpl.nasa.gov/atmos/atmos.html Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy] experiment (ATMOS) is an infrared spectrometer (a Fourier transform interferometer) that is designed to study the chemical composition of the atmosphere. In this section you will be able to read both general and detailed information as to why and how the instrument works. The ATMOS instrument has flown four times on the Space Shuttle since 1985. The predecessor to ATMOS, flown on aircraft and high-altitude balloon platforms, was born in the early 1970s out of concern for the effects of Super Sonic Transport exhaust products on the ozone layer. The experiment was redesigned for the Space Shuttle when the potential for ozone destruction by man-made chlorofluorocarbons was discovered and the need for global measurements became crucial.
* '''CRISTA observations'''. [https://archive.is/20011201094454/http://www.crista.uni-wuppertal.de/introduction.shtml CRISTA] is short for CRyogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere. It is a limb-scanning satellite experiment, designed and developed by the University of Wuppertal to measure infrared emissions of the Earth's atmosphere. Equipped with three telescopes and four spectrometers and cooled with liquid helium, CRISTA acquires global maps of temperature and atmospheric trace gases with very high horizontal and vertical resolution. The design enables the observation of small scale dynamical structures in the 15–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude region.

==Satellite observations==
* '''ACE observations'''. The [http://www.ace.uwaterloo.ca/ Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment] (ACE) satellite, also known as [[SCISAT-1]], is a Canadian satellite that makes measurements of the Earth's atmosphere and follows in heritage of ATMOS.
* '''[[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] observations'''. [http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/ Aura] flies in formation with the [[NASA]] [[Earth Observing System|EOS]] "A Train," a collection of several other satellites (Aqua, CALIPSO, CloudSat and the French PARASOL). Aura carries four instruments for studies of atmospheric chemistry: [[Microwave Limb Sounder|MLS]], HIRDLS, TES and OMI.
* '''ILAS observations'''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205195349/http://www-ilas.nies.go.jp/index.html ILAS] (Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer) developed by MOE (the Ministry of the Environment) (formerly EA - Environment Agency of Japan) is boarded on ADEOS (Advanced Earth Observing Satellite). On August 17, 1996, ADEOS was launched by the H-II rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center of Japan (ADEOS was renamed as "MIDORI") and stopped its operation on June 30, 1997. Data obtained by ILAS are processed, archived, and distributed by NIES (National Institute for Environmental Studies).
* '''POAM observations'''. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301180400/http://wvms.nrl.navy.mil/POAM/poam.html Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement] II (POAM II) instrument was developed by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) to measure the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, aerosol extinction, and temperature. POAM II measures solar extinction in nine narrow band channels, covering the spectral range from approximately 350 to 1060&amp;nbsp;nm.
* '''Sulfate aerosol observations from SAGE and HALOE'''. The SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II) sensor was launched into a 57 degree inclination orbit aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) in October 1984. During each sunrise and sunset encountered by the orbiting spacecraft, the instrument uses the solar occultation technique to measure attenuated solar radiation through the Earth's limb in seven channels centered at wavelengths ranging from 0.385 to 1.02 micrometers. The retrieval of stratospheric aerosol size distributions based on HALOE multi-wavelength particle extinction measurements was described by Hervig et al. [1998].  That approach yields unimodal lognormal size distributions,  which describe the aerosol concentration versus radius using three parameters:  total aerosol concentration,  median radius,  and distribution width. This [https://web.archive.org/web/20061208105210/http://haloedata.larc.nasa.gov/home/index.php?p=noframe_home.html site] offers results based on the Hervig et al. [1998] technique,  with one exception.  The retrieval results reported here are based on sulfate refractive indices for 215 K,  where Hervig et al.  [1998] used room temperature indices adjusted to stratospheric temperatures using the Lorentz-Lorenz rule.  Size distributions were only retrieved at altitudes above tropospheric cloud tops. Clouds were identified using techniques described by Hervig and McHugh [1999].  The HALOE size distributions are offered in NetCDF files containing data for a single year.  The results are reported on a uniform altitude grid ranging from 6 to 33&amp;nbsp;km at 0.3&amp;nbsp;km spacing.  The native HALOE altitude spacing is 0.3&amp;nbsp;km,  so this interpolation has little or no effect on the data.  The files report profile data including: altitude, pressure, temperature, aerosol concentration, median radius, distribution width, aerosol composition. Aerosol surface area and volume densities can be easily calculated from the size distribution parameters using the relationships given [http://gwest.gats-inc.com/haloe_aerosols/HALOE_size_distribution_data.html here].
* '''[[Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite]]''' (UARS) observations. Data from the UARS is available from the [http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/ GES Distributed Active Archive Center] (DAAC). The UARS satellite was launched in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery. It is {{convert|35|ft|m}} long, {{convert|15|ft|m}} in diameter, weighs 13,000 pounds, and carries 10 instruments. UARS orbits at an altitude of {{convert|375|mi|km}} with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees. UARS measured ozone and chemical compounds found in the ozone layer which affect ozone chemistry and processes. UARS also measured winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the energy input from the Sun. Together, these helped define the role of the upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability.

[[File:Edward III counting the dead on the battlefield of Crécy.jpg|thumbnail|Edward III counting the dead after the [[battle of Crécy]]]]

A '''body count''' is the total number of people killed in a particular event. In combat, a body count is often based on the number of confirmed kills, but occasionally only an estimate. Often used in reference to military combat, the term can also refer to any situation involving multiple killings, such as the actions of [[death squads]] or [[serial killer]]s.

The military gathers such figures for a variety of reasons, such as determining the need for continuing operations, estimating efficiency of new and old weapons systems, and planning follow-up operations.

==Military use==
{{Globalize|section|date=June 2010}}
Body count figures have a long history in military planning and [[propaganda]].

===Sassanian Empire===
According to [[Procopius]], when the [[Sassanian Empire|Persians]] are about to march to a war, the king sits on the throne and many baskets are set before him. The men of the army pass along the baskets one by one, each throwing one arrow in the baskets, which are then sealed with the king's seal. When the army returns to Persia, each man takes an arrow, and the number of casualties will be determined by the number of remaining arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Procopius|Prokopios]], ''The Wars of Justinian'', translated by H. B. Dewing, Hackett Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|9781624661723}}, page &lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holocaust===
{{see also|the Holocaust|Bandenbekämpfung}}
During the [[Holocaust]] in [[The Holocaust in Russia|Russia]], [[the Holocaust in Belarus|Belarus]], [[the Holocaust in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and other eastern areas, killing was done by [[Nazi Germany]]'s military police forces, including ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], and Wehrmacht police battalions, in massacres by shooting the victims.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=6, 126}} Such units measured their progress by counting the number of people killed.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=69}} These murder operations took place under the guise of [[bandit fighting|anti-partisan warfare]], but in reality few of those killed were actually partisans.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=7}}

===Vietnam War===
{{main |Vietnam War body count controversy}} 
Since the goal of the United States in the [[Vietnam War]] was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically "held" already. Instead, the U.S. Army used body counts to show that the U.S. was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army would lose after the [[attrition warfare]].

According to historian [[Christian Appy]], "[[search and destroy]] was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress" in [[William Westmoreland|General Westmoreland’s]] war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the Viet Cong out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation.[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-31/news/mn-442_1_body-count] This method was controversial, due to two issues. The first is regarding the counting of unarmed civilians killed in actions as enemy combatants in [[free-fire zone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewy|first=Guenter|title=America in Vietnam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1978|isbn=9780199874231|pages=450–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN battle operations were miscounted as "enemy KIA".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=spc4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;|title=East Asia's Other Miracle: Explaining the Decline of Mass Atrocities|last=Bellamy|first=Alex J.|date=2017-09-29|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780191083785|location=|pages=33–34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is inflation&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-31/news/mn-442_1_body-count&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorley&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorley|first=Lewis|title=A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America's Last Years in Vietnam|publisher=Harvest|year=2007|isbn=9780156013093|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;and  fabrication of body count in after-action reports, which is reported to have given false and inaccurate casualty figures for enemy dead. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_an_American_Army.html?id=nm-ov7lIe_AC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Rise and Fall of an American Army|last=Stanton|first=Shelby L.|date=2003|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780891418276|location=|pages=xvi-xvii|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-on-going-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-army|title=The On-Going Battle for the Soul of the Army {{!}} Small Wars Journal|website=smallwarsjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War===

{{Main|Casualties of the Iraq War}}

In the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the US military adopted an official policy of not counting deaths. General [[Tommy Franks]]' statement that "we don't do body counts" was widely reported. Critics claimed that Franks was only attempting to evade bad publicity, while supporters pointed to the failure of body counts to give an accurate impression of the state of the war in Vietnam. At the end of October 2005, it became public that the US military had been counting Iraqi fatalities since January 2004 but only those killed by insurgents and not those killed by the US forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/international/middleeast/30civilians.html "U.S. Quietly Issues Estimate of Iraqi Civilian Casualties"], The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemical waste''' is a [[Waste types|waste]] that is made from harmful chemicals (mostly [[industrial waste|produced by large factories]]). Chemical waste may fall under regulations such as [[COSHH]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or the [[Clean Water Act]] and [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] in the [[United States]]. In the U.S., the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]], as well as state and local regulations also regulate chemical use and disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollutionequipment-digital.com/pollutionequipment/20100405/?pg=17#pg13|title=Techniques for Efficient Hazardous Chemicals Handling and Disposal|date=April–May 2010|page=13.|access-date=10 March 2016|author=Hallam, Bill|work=Pollution Equipment News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical waste may or may not be classed as [[hazardous waste]]. A '''chemical hazardous waste''' is a solid, [[liquid]], or [[gas]]eous material that displays either a “Hazardous Characteristic” or is specifically “listed” by name as a hazardous waste. There are four characteristics chemical wastes may have to be considered as hazardous. These are Ignitability, [[Corrosive|Corrosivity]], Reactivity, and Toxicity. This type of hazardous waste must be categorized as to its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/media_files/docs/pdf/wastesectionupdatefinal.pdf|title=LABORATORY CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Environmental Health and Radiation Safety University of Pennsylvania|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical waste is a broad term and encompasses many types of materials. Consult the [[Safety data sheet|Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)]], Product Data Sheet or Label for a list of constituents. These sources should state whether this chemical waste is a waste that needs special disposal.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Waste - Disposal of Laboratory Wastes (GUIDANCE) {{!}} Current Staff {{!}} University of St Andrews|url = https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/policy/healthandsafety/publications/waste/waste-disposaloflaboratorywastesguidance/|website = www.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guidance for Disposal of Laboratory Chemical Wastes ==
In the laboratory, chemical wastes are usually segregated on-site into appropriate waste [[carboy]]s, and disposed by a specialist contractor in order to meet safety, health, and legislative requirements.
[[File:Chemical Waste Disposal Guideline.jpg|thumb|267x267px|Chemical waste category that should be followed for proper packaging, labelling, and disposal of chemical waste.]]
Innocuous aqueous waste (such as solutions of [[sodium chloride]]) may be poured down the sink. Some chemicals are washed down with excess water.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This includes: concentrated and dilute [[acid]]s and [[alkali]]s, harmless soluble inorganic salts (all drying agents), [[alcohol]]s containing salts, hypochlorite solutions, fine (tlc grade) [[Silicate|silica]] and [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. [[Aqueous solution|Aqueous]] waste containing toxic compounds are collected separately.

Waste [[mercury (element)|elemental mercury]], spent [[acid]]s and [[Alkali|bases]] may be collected separately for [[recycling]].

Waste [[organic solvents]] are separated into [[Organochloride|chlorinated]] and non-chlorinated solvent waste. Chlorinated solvent waste is usually incinerated at high temperature to minimize the formation of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shibamoto|first=T|year=2007|title=Dioxin formation from waste incineration.|journal=Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology|volume=190|pages=1–41|pmid=17432330|author2=Yasuhara, A|author3=Katami, T}}&lt;!--|access-date=10 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/environment/waste_management/l28072_en.htm|title=Waste incineration|last=Europa|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-chlorinated solvent waste can be burned for [[energy recovery]].

In contrast to this, chemical materials on the "Red List" should never be washed down a drain. This list includes:&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; compounds with transitional metals, [[biocide]]s, [[cyanide]]s, [[mineral oil]]s and [[hydrocarbon]]s, poisonous [[organosilicon]] compounds, metal phosphides, [[phosphorus]] element, and [[fluoride]]s and [[nitrite]]s.

Moreover, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) prohibits disposing certain materials down any UVM drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chemical Waste Management  {{!}} Environmental Health and Safety at UVM|url = http://www.uvm.edu/safety/lab/chemicalwaste#Selecting%2520the%2520Correct%2520Container|website = www.uvm.edu|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including [[flammable liquid]]s, liquids capable of causing damage to wastewater facilities (this can be determined by the [[pH]]), highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] materials capable of causing an obstruction in the [[wastewater]] system, [[Radioactive waste|radioactive]] materials, materials that have or create a strong odor, wastewater capable of significantly raising the temperature of the system, and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] or [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] disruptors.

Broken [[laboratory glassware|glassware]] are usually collected in plastic-lined cardboard boxes for landfilling. Due to contamination, they are usually not suitable for recycling. Similarly, used [[hypodermic needle]]s are collected as [[sharps waste|sharps]] and are incinerated as [[medical waste]].

== Chemical Compatibility Guideline ==
Many chemicals may react adversely when combined. It is recommended that incompatible chemicals be stored in separate areas of the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chemical Compatibility and Segregation Guides|url = http://orf.od.nih.gov/EnvironmentalProtection/WasteDisposal/Pages/chem_compat.aspx|website = orf.od.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acids]] should be separated from [[alkalis]], [[metals]], [[cyanides]], [[sulfides]], [[azides]], [[phosphides]], and [[Oxidise|oxidizers]]. The reason being, when combined acids with these type of compounds, violent [[exothermic reaction]] can occur possibly causing [[Flammability|flammable gas]], and in some cases [[Explosion|explosions.]]

[[Oxidizing agent|Oxidizers]] should be separated from [[acid]]s, [[Organic matter|organic materials]], [[metal]]s, [[reducing agent]]s, and [[ammonia]]. This is because when combined [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizers]] with these type of compounds, inflammable, and sometimes [[toxic]] compounds can occur.

=== Container compatibility ===
When disposing hazardous laboratory chemical waste, chemical compatibility must be considered. For safe disposal, the container must be chemically compatible with the material it will hold. Chemicals must not react with, weaken, or dissolve the container or lid. [[Acids]] or [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] should not be stored in [[metal]]. [[Hydrofluoric acid]] should not store in [[glass]]. [[Gasoline]] ([[solvents]]) should not store or transport in lightweight [[polyethylene]] containers such as milk jugs. Moreover, the Chemical Compatibility Guidelines should be considered for more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Store and Dispose of Hazardous Chemical Waste|url = http://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/research-lab/hazardous-waste/chemical.html#Select-compatible-containers|website = blink.ucsd.edu|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laboratory waste containers ==
Packaging, labelling, storage are the three requirements for disposing chemical waste.

=== Packaging&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Requirements|url = http://www.ehs.utoronto.ca/resources/wmindex/wm4.htm|website = www.ehs.utoronto.ca|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
[[File:Chemical Waste Area.jpg|thumb|How to properly label, package, and store chemical waste safely.]]
For packaging, chemical liquid waste containers should only be filled up to 75% capacity to allow for [[Vapor|vapour expansion]] and to reduce potential spills which could occur from moving overfilled containers. Container material must be compatible with the stored [[hazardous waste]]. Finally, wastes must not be packaged in containers that improperly identify other nonexisting hazards.

In addition to the general packaging requirements mentioned above, incompatible materials should never be mixed together in a single container. Wastes must be stored in containers compatible with the chemicals stored as mentioned in the container compatibility section. [[Solvent]] safety cans should be used to collect and temporarily store large volumes (10–20 litres) of [[Flammability|flammable]] organic waste [[solvent]]s, precipitates, [[solid]]s or other non-fluid wastes should not be mixed into safety cans.

=== Labelling ===
Label all containers with the group name from the chemical waste category and an itemized list of the contents. All chemicals or anything contaminated with chemicals posing a significant hazard. All waste must be appropriately packaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laboratory|first=National Research Council (US) Committee on Prudent Practices in the|date=2011-01-01|title=Management of Waste|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK55885/|language=en|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage ===
When storing chemical wastes, the containers must be in good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added. [[Hazardous waste]] must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory and should not be allowed to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chem.wisc.edu/deptfiles/docs/lab-waste-disposal-portrait.pdf|title=Laboratory Waste Disposal|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. [[Snap cap]]s, mis-sized caps, [[parafilm]] and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible [[hazardous wastes]], such as [[acids]] and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/sgs/current/chem_waste.pdf|title=PROCEDURES FOR LABORATORY CHEMICAL WASTE DISPOSAL|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Memorial University|access-date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mapping of chemical waste in the United States==
[[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov |title=SIS Specialized Information System |author= |work= |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA)  [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government.  TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov |title=Toxnet |author= |work= |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other 
authoritative sources.

==Chemical waste in Canadian aquaculture ==
Chemical waste in our oceans is becoming a major issue for marine life. There have been many studies conducted to try and prove the effects of chemicals in our oceans. In Canada, many of the studies concentrated on the Atlantic provinces, where fishing and aquaculture are an important part of the economy. 
In New Brunswick, a study was done on the [[sea urchin]] in an attempt to identify the effects of toxic and chemical waste on life beneath the ocean, specifically the waste from salmon farms. Sea urchins were used to check the levels of metals in the environment. It is advantageous to use green sea urchins, [[Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis]], because they are widely distributed, abundant in many locations, and easily accessible. By investigating the concentrations of metals in the green sea urchins, the impacts of chemicals from [[Aquaculture of salmonids|salmon aquaculture]] activity could be assessed and detected. Samples were taken at 25-metre intervals along a transect in the direction of the main tidal flow. The study found that there was impacts to at least 75&amp;nbsp;m based on the intestine metal concentrations. So based on this study it is clear that the metals are contaminating the ocean and negatively affecting aquatic life.

==Uranium in Ground and Surface Water in Canada==
Another issue regarding chemical waste is the potential risk of surface and groundwater contamination by the heavy metals and [[radionuclides]] leached from uranium waste-rock piles (UWRP) A Radionuclide is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. Uranium waste-rock piles refers to [[Uranium mining]], which is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. An example of such threats is in Saskatchewan, Uranium mining and ore processing (milling) can pose a threat to the environment. In open pit mining, large amounts of materials are excavated and disposed off in waste-rock piles. Waste-rock piles from the [[Uranium mining]] industry can contain several heavy metals and contaminants that may become mobile under certain conditions. Environmental contaminants may include [[acid mine drainage]], higher concentrations of radionuclides, and non-radioactive metals/metalloids (i.e. As, Mo, Ni, Cu, Zn).

The leachability of heavy metals and radionuclide from UWRP plays a significant role in determining their potential environmental risks to surrounding surface and groundwater. Substantial differences in the solid-phase partitioning and chemical leachability of Ni and U were observed in the investigated UWRP lithological materials and background organic-rich lake sediment. For Instance, in the uranium-mining district of Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, the sequential extraction results showed that a significant amount of Ni ([[Nickel]]) was present in the non-labile residual fraction, while Uranium was mostly distributed in the moderately labile fractions. Although Nickel was much less labile than Uranium, the observed Nickel exceeded Uranium concentrations in [[Leaching model (soil)|leaching]]]]. The observed Nickel and Uranium concentrations were relatively high in the underlying organic-rich lake sediment. Expressed as the percentage of total metal content, potential leachability decreased in the order U &gt; Ni. Data suggest that these elements could potentially migrate to the water table below the UWRP. Detailed information regarding the solid-phase distribution of [[contaminant]]s in the UWRP is critical to understand the potential for their environmental transport and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/waterres/cycle/groundwater/well/uranium.html|title=Uranium in Well Water - Water Resources Management|first=Department of Municipal Affairs and|last=Environment|date=|website=www.env.gov.nl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code stylometry''' (also known as '''program authorship attribution''' or '''source code authorship analysis''') is the application of [[stylometry]] to computer code to attribute authorship to anonymous [[Binary code|binary]] or [[source code]]. It often involves breaking down and examining the distinctive patterns and characteristics of the programming code and then comparing them to computer code whose authorship is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/16/identifying_anonymous_programmers/|title=FYI: AI tools can unmask anonymous coders from their binary executables|last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=March 16, 2018|work=The Register|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[software forensics]], code stylometry attributes authorship for purposes other than [[intellectual property infringement]], including [[plagiarism detection]], copyright investigation, and authorship verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usenix.org/node/190845|title=De-anonymizing Programmers via Code Stylometry|last=|first=|date=August 12, 2015|website=USENIX|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1989, researchers Paul Oman and Curtis Cook identified the authorship of 18 different [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] programs written by six authors by using “markers” based on [[Typography|typographic]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frantzeskou|first=Georgia|last2=Stamatatos|first2=Efstathios|last3=Gritzalis|first3=Stefanos|date=October 2005|title=Supporting the Cybercrime Investigation Process: Effective Discrimination of Source Code Authors Based on Byte-Level Information|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220917906_Supporting_the_Cybercrime_Investigation_Process_Effective_Discrimination_of_Source_Code_Authors_Based_on_Byte-Level_Information|journal=E-business and Telecommunication Networks|volume=|pages=283-290|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75993-5_14|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, researchers Stephen MacDonell, Andrew Gray, and Philip Sallis developed a dictionary-based author attribution system called IDENTIFIED (Integrated Dictionary-based Extraction of Non-language-dependent Token Information for Forensic Identification, Examination, and Discrimination) that determined the authorship of source code in computer programs written in [[C++]]. The researchers noted that authorship can be identified using degrees if flexibility in the writing style of the source code, such as:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Andrew|last2=MacDonnell|first2=Stephen|last3=Sallis|first3=Philip|date=January 1998|title=IDENTIFIED (Integrated Dictionary-based Extraction of Non-language-dependent Token Information for Forensic Identification, Examination, and Discrimination): a dictionary-based system for extracting source code metrics for software forensics|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215632771_IDENTIFIED_Integrated_Dictionary-based_Extraction_of_Non-language-dependent_Token_Information_for_Forensic_Identification_Examination_and_Discrimination_a_dictionary-based_system_for_extracting_source|journal=Proceedings of Software Engineering: Education &amp; Practice|volume=|pages=252-259|doi=10.1109/SEEP.1998.707658|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The way the algorithm in the source code solves the given problem
* The way the source code is laid out (spacing, indentation, bordering characteristics, standard headings, etc.)
* The way the algorithm is implemented in the source code

The IDENTIFIED system attributed authorship by first merging all the relevant files to produce a single source code file and then subjecting it to a metrics analysis by counting the number of occurrences for each metric. In addition, the system was language-independent due to its ability to create new dictionary files and meta-dictionaries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1999, a team of researchers led by Stephen MacDonell tested the performance of three different program authorship discrimination techniques on 351 programs written in C++ by 7 different authors. The researchers compared the effectiveness of using a [[Feedforward neural network|feed-forward neural network (FFNN)]] that was trained on a [[Backpropagation|back-propagation]] algorithm, [[Multiple discriminant analysis|multiple discriminant analysis (MDA)]], and [[Case-based reasoning|case-based reasoning (CBR)]]. At the end of the experiment, both the neural network and the MDA had an accuracy rate of 81.1%, while the CBR reached an accuracy performance of 88.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonell|first=Stephen|last2=Gray|first2=Andrew|last3=MacLennan|first3=Grant|last4=Sallis|first4=Philip|date=February 1999|title=Software forensics for discriminating between program authors using case-based reasoning, feedforward neural networks and multiple discriminant analysis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3848588_Software_forensics_for_discriminating_between_program_authors_using_case-based_reasoning_feedforward_neural_networks_and_multiple_discriminant_analysis|journal=Neural Information Processing|volume=1|pages=|issn=1177-455X|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, researchers from the Laboratory of Information and Communication Systems Security at [[Aegean University]] introduced a language-independent method of program authorship attribution where they used [[byte]]-level [[N-gram|n-grams]] to classify a program to an author. This technique scanned the files and then created a table of different n-grams found in the source code and the number of times they appear. In addition, the system could operate with limited numbers of training examples from each author. However, the more source code programs that were present for each author, the more reliable the author attribution. In an experiment testing their approach, the researchers found that classification using n-grams reached an accuracy rate of up to 100%, although the rate declined drastically if the profile size exceeded 500 and the n-gram size was 3 or less.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, researchers from the University of Wisconsin created a program authorship attribution system that identified a programmer based on the binary code of a program instead of the source code. The researchers utilized [[machine learning]] and training code to determine which characteristics of the code would be helpful in describing the programming style. In an experiment testing the approach on a set of programs written by 10 different authors, the system achieved an accuracy rate of 81%. When tested using a set of programs written by almost 200 different authors, the system performed with an accuracy rate of 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblum|first=Nathan|last2=Zhu|first2=Xiaojin|last3=Miller|first3=Barton|date=September 2011|title=Who wrote this code?

In 2015, a team of postdoctoral researchers from [[Princeton University]], [[Drexel University]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and the [[University of Göttingen|University of Goettingen]] as well as researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] developed a program authorship attribution system that could determine the author of a program from a sample pool with programs written by 1,600 coders with a 94 percent accuracy. The methodology consisted of four steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/160976/Malicious_coders_will_lose_anonymity_as_identity_finding_research_matures/|title=Malicious coders will lose anonymity as identity-finding research matures|last=Brayboy|first=Joyce|date=January 15, 2016|work=U.S. Army|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Disassembly''' - The program is disassembled to obtain information on its characteristics.
# '''Decompilation''' - The program is converted into a variant of C-like [[pseudocode]] through [[decompilation]] to obtain [[abstract syntax tree]]s.
# '''Dimensionality reduction''' - The most relevant and useful features for author identification are selected.
# '''Classification''' - A random-forest classifier attributes the authorship of the program.

This approach analyzed various characteristics of the code, such as blank space, the use of tabs and spaces, and the names of variables, and then used a method of evaluation called a syntax tree analysis that translated the sample code into tree-like diagrams that displayed the structural decisions involved in writing the code. The design of these diagrams prioritized the order of the commands and the depths of the functions that were nestled in the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/news/2015/02/dusting-cyber-fingerprints-coding-style-identifies-anonymous-programmers|title=Dusting for Cyber Fingerprints: Coding Style Identifies Anonymous Programmers|last=Greenstadt|first=Rachel|date=February 27, 2015|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 2014 Sony Hacking Attack ==
U.S. intelligence officials were able to determine that the [[Sony Pictures hack|2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures]] was sponsored by North Korea after evaluating the software, techniques, and network sources. The attribution was made after cybersecurity experts noticed similarities between the code used in the attack and a malicious software known as [[Shamoon]], which was used in the [[2013 South Korea cyberattack|2013 attacks]] against South Korean banks and broadcasting companies by North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sony-cybersecurity-northkorea-idUSKBN0JW24Z20141219|title=U.S. considers 'proportional' response to Sony hacking attack|last=Brunnstrom|first=David|date=December 18, 2014|work=Reuters|access-date=August 2, 2018|last2=Finkle|first2=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6244">'''Cybertext''' is the organization of text in order to analyze the influence of the [[Artistic medium|medium]] as an integral part of the [[literary]] dynamic, as defined by [[Espen Aarseth]] in 1997. Aarseth defined it as a type of [[ergodic literature]].

==Definition==
The term cybertext was coined by [[speculative fiction]] poetry author [[Bruce Boston]].  It is derived from the word [[cybernetics]], which was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Norbert Wiener]] in his book ''Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'' (1948), which in turn comes from the Greek word ''kybernetes'' – [[helmsman]].&lt;ref name=espen1997&gt;{{cite book|author=Aarseth, Espen|year=1997|title=Ergodic Literature|publisher=Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-5579-9 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=qx_-zj0-TwoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0801855799&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;!-- previous url http://www.hf.uib.no/cybertext/Ergodic.html dead--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cybertexts are pieces of literature where the medium matters. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a [[linear]] piece of literature, such as a [[novel]], and a [[game]]. In a novel, the reader has no choice, the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and the characters are all chosen by the author, there is no 'user', just a 'reader', this is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what to do, what punches to punch, or when to jump. The difference between a game and a cybertext is that cybertexts usually have more depth, there is a method to the madness, the piece usually has a point, or message that is translated to the reader as they work their way through the piece.

==Overview==
Cybertext is based on the idea that getting to the message is just as important as the message itself. In order to obtain the message work on the part of the user is required. This may also be referred to as nontrivial work on the part of the user.&lt;ref name=espen1997/&gt;

The fundamental idea in the development of the theory of cybernetics is the concept of [[feedback]]: a portion of [[information]] produced by the system that is taken, total or partially, as input. Cybernetics is the science that studies control and regulation in systems in which there exists flow and feedback of information. Though first used by [[science fiction]] poet [[Bruce Boston]], the term cybertext was brought to the [[Literature|literary]] world's attention by [[Espen Aarseth]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Eskelinen, Markuu and Koskimaa, Raine,(January, 2010) Retrieved from Cybertext Yearbook Database website: http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/search.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarseth's concept of cybertext focuses on the organization of the text in order to analyze the influence of the [[Artistic medium|medium]] as an integral part of the literary dynamic. According to Aarseth, cybertext is not a [[genre]] in itself; in order to classify traditions, [[literary genres]] and [[aesthetic value]], we should inspect [[Plain text|texts]] at a much more local level.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter,Jay David, Degrees of Freedom, retrieved from http://www.uv.es/~fores/programa/bolter_freedom.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
The concept of cybertext offers a way to expand the reach of [[Literary criticism|literary studies]] to include phenomena that are perceived today as foreign or marginal.&lt;ref name=espen1997/&gt; In Aarseth's work, cybertext denotes the general set of text machines which, operated by readers, yield different texts for reading.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburg, Jim. Article on: Navigating Nowhere / Hypertext Infrawhere retrieved from:  http://www.well.com/user/jer/NNHI.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, with a book like  [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]]'', each reader will encounter not just [[Poetry|poems]] arranged in a different order, but ''different poems'' depending on the precise way in which they turn the sections of page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queneau's Poems|url=http://www.bevrowe.info/Queneau/QueneauHome_v2.html|accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
An example of a cybertext is ''12 Blue'' by [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]. Depending on what link you choose or what portion of the [[diagram]] on the side you pick you will be transferred to a different portion of the text. So in the end, you do not really finish reading the entire story or 'novel' you go through random pages and try piecing the story together yourself. You may never really 'finish' the story. But, because it is a cybertext the 'finishing' of the story is not as important as its impact on the reader, or on the conveyance.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce,Michael. ''12 Blue'' Retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/joyce__twelve_blue.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stir Fry Texts'', by Jim Andrews, is a cybertext where there are many layers of text, and as you move your mouse over the words, the layers beneath them are 'dug' through.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews,Jim. Article on Stir Fry Texts retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/andrews__stir_fry_texts/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
''The House'' is another example of a cybertext where one might assume a description of the piece as follows:
It is an unruly text, the words don't listen, you are not supreme. You are guided through the piece. This is a cybertext with minimal control. You watch as something unfolds before you, "a crumbling mania", you must be able to go with the flow, to read texts upside down, to piece together a reflection of words, to be okay with texts half read disappearing or moving so far away so continuously that you can not make out those very important words.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Mary. The House, retrieved from: http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/flanagan__thehouse/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dance science''' is the scientific study of [[dance]] and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of [[performance]], the reduction of [[injury]], and the improvement of [[well-being]] and [[health]].

[[Dance and health|Dance medicine and science]] as a field of study developed in the 1970s and 80s out of the field of [[sports medicine]]. In the early 1980s, the American Dance Festival (ADF) started including dance medicine courses in their course work for dancers. When ADF moved to Duke University, physicians from Duke University Hospital became interested in dancers. Then, in 1990, the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]])  was formed by an international group of dance medicine practitioners, dance educators, dance scientists, and dancers. Membership of IADMS began with 48 members in 1991, and has grown to over 900 members in 35 countries as of 2016.&lt;ref name=IADMSabout&gt;{{cite web|author=International Association for Dance Medicine &amp; Science |url=http://www.iadms.org/?page=A8 |title=About IADMS |publisher=iadms.org |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance science as an academic discipline has been evolving over the past 20 years.{{when|date=November 2018}} In the United Kingdom, three degrees (at master's level) now exist: one at the University of Bedfordshire,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beds.ac.uk/howtoapply/courses/postgraduate/next-year/dance-science University of Bedfordshire]&lt;/ref&gt; one at the [[University of Wolverhampton]], and one at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. With regards to dance science research, another UK institution which has staff and students active in the area is [[the University of Birmingham]].   Some undergraduate degrees in dance, or other dance courses, also include one or several modules in dance science, with the aim of promoting healthy dance practices. These include the [[University of Wolverhampton]], the [[Royal Academy of Dance]], and [[Bird College]].

Several universities in the United States also offer dance science courses as part of their dance curriculum, accommodating both undergraduate and graduate level students. These include, but are not limited to: Cornish College of the Arts, Columbia College of Chicago, California State - Long Beach, Elon University, Florida State University, [[Goucher College]], Long Island University - Brooklyn Campus, Ohio State University, Ohio University, UCLA - Irvine, University of Colorado, University of Illinois - Urbana Champagne, and the University of Oregon.

Typically, the subject areas within dance science are similar to those studied in "[[sports science]]", though naturally with a focus on dance and the special considerations that this involves. They include: [[physiology]], [[anatomy]], [[kinesiology]], [[psychology]], [[biomechanics]], [[nutrition]], and similar. However, unlike sports science, dance science sometimes also studies related topics such as [[creativity]] and somatic techniques, including the practices of [[Pilates]], [[yoga]], [[Alexander technique]], [[Feldenkrais method]], etc.

Some dance companies employ dance scientists to provide support services, such as physiological testing, psychological support, conditioning and nutritional counseling. Such professionals include physical therapists, nutritionists, pilates instructors, massage therapists, and dance medicine physicians. Dancers that are not employed by a dance company that offers rehabilitation benefits on-site can sometimes have access to such facilities within their city of residence. Dancers in New York City have access to The Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, located at the NYU-Hospital for Joint Diseases, NYU Langone Medical Center, which offers many subsidized and free services for the dance community. These services include "clinics staffed by orthopedists and dance physical therapists; state-of-the art research and rehabilitation technology and free injury prevention screenings and lectures."  Westside Physical Therapy, directed and founded by Marika Molnar - the first physical therapist hired by the New York City Ballet - is another example of a physical therapy clinic in New York City that offers specialized care to dancers (as well as to non-dancers).

The largest organization promoting dance science internationally is the International Association for Dance Medicine and Science ([[IADMS]]). As well as producing a scientific peer-reviewed journal, ''Journal of Dance Medicine and Science'', it also holds an annual conference. The Performing Arts Medicine Association (PAMA), which holds its annual symposium in Aspen-Snowmass, Colorado, is a unique organization that concerns itself with the injuries and health issues of musicians as well as dancers. In the UK, DanceUK is perhaps the foremost proponent of dance science and healthy dance practice more generally. A conference entitled "From Cognition to Conditioning" was held at [[Middlesex University]] in February 2007.

'''Eco-Schools''' is an international programme of the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE)  that aims to empower students to be the change our sustainable world needs by engaging them in fun, action-orientated and socially responsible learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoschools.global/ |title=Eco Schools |website=Ecoschools.global |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.global/ |title=Foundation for Environmental EducationFoundation for Environmental Education |website=Fee.global |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each school follows a seven step change process and empowers their young people to lead processes and actions wherever they can.

Over time and through commitment to the Eco-Schools Seven Step process, improvements will be seen in both the learning outcomes, attitude and behaviour of students and the local community, and ultimately the local environment. Evidence of success in these areas will eventually lead to a school being awarded with the International Green Flag.

Eco-Schools is one of the programmes recognised by the [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]] (2005 – 2104), awarding certificates to thousands of schools around the world.&lt;ref name=decade&gt;[https://www.bibb.de/dokumente/pdf/a33_un_decade_final_report_2014_230171e.pdf ‘Shaping the Future We Want’ – UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014) Final Report], p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Eco-Schools programme extends from kindergartens to universities and is implemented in 67 countries, involving 51,000 schools and institutions, and over 19,000,000 students.  It is the largest international network of teachers and students in the world.&lt;ref name=decade /&gt; FEE EcoCampus is the name of the programme at university level.    
[[File:The Green Flag.gif|thumb|The Eco-Schools Green Flag]]

== History ==

The programme was developed in 1992 in response to the need to involve young people in environmental projects at the local level as identified at the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] of 1992.

Eco-Schools was launched in 1994 in Denmark, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom with the support of the European Commission. When the Foundation for Environmental Education became global in 2001, countries outside of Europe began joining the Eco-Schools programme, as well.  South Africa was the first country to do so.

In 2003 Eco-Schools was identified by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) as a model initiative for [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spirala.sk/wp-content/uploads/100201-memorandum-o-porozumeni-fee-unep.pdf FEE – UNEP Memorandum of Understanding] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
[[File:Eco-Schools in South Africa.jpg|thumb|Eco-Schools in South Africa]]
The International Eco-Schools Programme takes a holistic, participatory approach to learning for sustainability. The aim of the programme is to engage students through classroom study, school and community action to raise awareness of sustainable development issues.&lt;ref&gt;‘Greenrock expands Eco-School Programme’, Bermuda Sun, 20 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Clés De Demain, ‘L'Eco-Ecole fête ses 20 ans’, LeMonde.fr, 28 Aug. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages students and teachers to conduct research on the amount of waste, energy or water use at their school and work towards making it a more sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;Arandjelovic, Nadia “Eco-Schools programme helps students ‘change their place of learning’”, The Royal Gazette, 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Schools provide an integrated system for the environmental management of schools and involve all stakeholders in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, LG (2008) [http://www.developmenteducationreview.com/issue6-perspectives2 'The whole-school approach to education for sustainable development: From pilot projects to systemic change'], Policy &amp; Practice: A Development Education Review, Vol. 6, Spring, pp. 69-74&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The whole schools approach embedded in the Eco-Schools programme emphasises the importance of an ongoing focus on the issues linked to environmental, climate and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, V.V., Doyle, D., Klein, J., &amp; Didham, R.J. (2015) ''‘Responsible Living: Concepts, Education and Future Perspectives’'', Springer, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme’s methodology consists of Seven Steps&lt;ref&gt;Andreou, Nicole (2017). Schools Turning Communities Green in International School Magazine, p.39-40 https://cloud.3dissue.com/2389/3124/7031/is19-3/offline/download.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/seven-steps/ ''’Seven Steps Towards an Eco-School’'']&lt;/ref&gt; that the school needs to adopt.

'''Step 1'''  Establishment of the Eco-Schools Committee &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 2'''  Environmental review &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 3'''  Action Plan &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 4'''  Monitoring and Evaluation &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 5'''  Curriculum Linking &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 6'''  Informing and involving the wider community &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 7'''  Eco Code

Schools are encouraged to work on eleven Themes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/themes/ ''’Eco-Schools Themes’'']&lt;/ref&gt; which are as follows: Biodiversity &amp; Nature, Climate Change, Energy, Global Citizenship, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Litter, Marine and Coast, School Grounds, Transport, Waste, Water.

== Participation and awards ==

Any school may participate in the scheme by registering with the FEE member organisation in their country. Once registered, each school must review and improve their impact on the environment and in recognition of their commitment and progress they can then apply for an award.

Successful Eco-Schools are awarded the International Green Flag, an internationally acknowledged symbol for environmental excellence. In some countries, this recognition happens through a three level system, where schools are awarded either bronze and silver awards before receiving the  International Green Flag.

There is flexibility to the ceremony and awarding process but the criteria for assessing schools for the award must follow the guidelines of FEE's International Eco-Schools programme.

== Process ==

To qualify for an award the school must follow the following programme:

* Register – usually done by an adult (teacher or parent).
* Eco-Schools Committee – a group of pupils and adults – some elected by their peers are assembled to manage the process.
* Environmental Review – the Eco-Schools Committee must organise the school to carry out a review of the school's energy and water usage, waste production and state of the school grounds with respect to litter.
* Action Plan – formed from issues identified by the review
* Eco Code – the Eco-Schools Committee, with the participation of the whole school must develop a mission statement to be prominently advertised inside and outside the school.
* Link to Curriculum and Take Action – demonstrable progress must be made in three areas of the curriculum and involve as much of the school as possible.
* Monitor and Review – the Eco-Schools Committee must record and analyse the progress made

After these processes are complete the school can apply for one of the awards mentioned above dependent on the level of environmental progress made.

== FEE EcoCampus ==
[[File:EcoCampus UCC.jpg|thumb|University College Cork was awarded the Green Flag in 2010]] 
The FEE EcoCampus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/ecocampus/ FEE EcoCampus]&lt;/ref&gt; programme is an evolution of the Eco-Schools programme. It targets students in third level education in various countries and is implemented in the same way as Eco-Schools. The only real difference is that students devise an Eco Charter instead of an Eco Code. &lt;br&gt;
This Charter is a document which is a guide to environmental management on site.

EcoCampus began in Russia in 2003 and the first whole institution Green Flags were awarded in Ireland in 2010, to [[University College Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;Green-Campus Ireland [http://www.greencampusireland.org/news/19th-february-2010-ucc-raising-the-green-flag- ''‘19th February 2010: UCC Raising the Green Flag!’''] 30 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Forest Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaf.global/the-global-forest-fund/ Global Forest Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; ==

Eco-Schools compensates for their CO2 emissions from their flight travels when they go to, for example, conferences and National Operator Meetings through the Global Forest Fund. FEE has established the Global Forest Fund to help minimise the effects of CO2 emissions from the increased travel activity worldwide. The Fund supports schools and organisations by funding CO2 compensation efforts such as planting trees and environmental education activities.

The '''economics of open data''' refers to the production, or loss, of wealth related to the use of [[open data]]. The cost of open data is a primary concern that can deter governments any companies from the opening up of data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The data revolution: big data, open data, data infrastructures &amp; their consequences|last=Kitchen|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=57|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While open data may theoretically have a low production cost, the cost of creating the original data set as well as maintaining that data once it is produced can be expensive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though the creation of data may be expensive governments around the world such as France, the United States, and Japan, are anticipating substantial economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takagi|first=Soichiro|date=2014-12-11|title=Research Note: An Introduction to the Economic Analysis of Open Data|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12626-014-0048-6|journal=The Review of Socionetwork Strategies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–128|doi=10.1007/s12626-014-0048-6|issn=1867-3236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Data vs. Paid Data ==
Open data has the capability to increase economic benefit through both individuals' and companies' use of the information. As of March 2016, it was estimated that open data was generating 0.5% more [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] compared to paid data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theodi.org/research-economic-value-open-paid-data|title=Research: The economic value of open versus paid data|last=The Open Data Institute|first=|date=|website=theodi.org|publisher=|access-date=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of open data relies on either funding from government to create and maintain the data or funding in the form of grants and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Data made open by governments largely relies on the publication of [[public service]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/Open-Data-for-Economic-Growth.pdf|title=OPEN DATA FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH|last=|first=|date=June 25, 2014|website=worldbank.org|publisher=Transport &amp; ICT Global Practice|access-date=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the data has already been created for a purpose, there is no creation cost for it to be made available to the public.

The opening of data requires current and advance technologies as well as the employment of users who are skilled enough to complete such work. When data is collected it cannot be presented to the public in its [[Raw data|raw]] form and may be inaccessible due to the program is uses or how the data is presented may be unusable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Time and funding is required to be reallocated by those who create the original dataset in order to make the data more accessible and usable for citizens to understand and engage with.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When government is the main source of funding for the production of data it does not necessarily mean that they are the singular entity creating or managing the data. Governments sometimes contract out the creation or management of data to a third party. In some cases the third party may provide access to the data in exchange for a nominal fee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Citizen led initiatives face similar issues, such as the requirement of time and funding. For these types of initiatives it can be especially difficult because they do not have access to a guaranteed steady income such as taxpayer money; these organizations largely depend on donations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paying for the use of public data would cover some of the costs associated with creating, maintaining and formatting data, although it would reduced the economic value of what once was opened by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/309810679/Permission-granted-The-economic-value-of-data-assets-under-alternative-policy-regimes|title=The economic value of data assets under alternative policy regime: A Lateral Economics report for the Open Data Institute.|last=Open Data Institute|first=|date=March 2016|website=scribd.com|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paying for the data that is now available for free would result in a lack of innovation, decreasing the GDP, as well as an increase in the cost of services created from use of purchased data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The opening of data reduces costs associated with licensing that is usually associated with paid data, as it costs more money to license a dataset than to have no license at all,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are open datasets that use licensing as well. The opening of data itself does not simply create economic prosperity; systematic reforms would take place in order for open data innovations to find a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-3/generating-economic-value-through-open-data/|title=Generating Economic Value through Open Data|website=beyondtransparency.org|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Data and Economic Opportunity ==
Open data gains additional economic value when governments support open data initiatives, although increased uptake and citizen engagement is vital to the economic success of open data. Greater economic impact depends on revenue growth, [[cost reduction]], and job creation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capgemini-consulting.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/opendata_pov_6feb.pdf|title=The Open Data Economy Unlocking Economic Value by Opening Government and Public Data|last=Cappgiemini Consulting|first=|date=2013|website=capgemini-consulting.com/|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue can be increased through the use of open data with the creation of new businesses, new good or services, or improved goods and services. When businesses profit from the creation of goods or services that rely upon open data not only does their company reap the financial benefits but the government does as well, through the increase of tax revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cost reduction helps to increase revenue for private sector businesses but is also an asset to government. Cost reduction in government, whether through reduction of services required or labor requirements, reduces government spending in some areas allowing for investment in others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Open data can also increase economic benefit through the creation of jobs. Jobs can be created through innovative entrepreneurship or through the requirement of skilled labourers to use and understand data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples of Open Data Financial Models ==
There are numerous ways in which businesses currently support the generation, creation and upkeep of their data. In most cases businesses, or [[Information broker|data brokers]], will sell this information to third parties for a profit. As charging a fee for data would defeat the purpose of open data, governments and businesses must rely on different financial models. Normally a government or business would finance a public sector body to generate the data and profit or cost recovery would be achieved through users paying a licensing fee back to the public sector body. In turn, the profit made by the users could then be taxed and return finances to the government.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donker|first=Frederika Welle|last2=Loenen|first2=Bastiaan van|date=2016-07-28|title=Sustainable Business Models for Public Sector Open Data Providers|url=http://www.jedem.org/index.php/jedem/article/view/390|journal=JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=28–61|issn=2075-9517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budget Financing Model ===
Budget financing a specific amount of funds is allocated toward the open data project from general revenue.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this case the funding invested in to the project is only expected to cover the minimal costs. Businesses and Governments often expect to see a return from the opening up of data such as increased efficiency within their work environment or more positive citizen perceptions of the company or government.

=== Community Model ===
This model relies on individual citizens to invest their time and skills into generating and maintaining open data.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A very successful example of this would be [[OpenStreetMap]], which is continually updated and expanded by everyday users. The community model can also easily incorporate interactive benefits such as user feedback and the improvement of data quality. In this case there is a lot of room for innovation and conversation though the strong dependence on citizen engagement means individuals must actively be engaged with the data on a regular basis or risk the decrease in data quantity and quality.

=== Advertising Model ===
The advertising model is a popular method that can be seen across many online publications. In order to cover operating costs an open data publisher relies on revenue from advertisers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In these cases citizens are exposed to add banners and pop ups displayed on the same site as the data they are attempting to access. While this may prove sustainable for individual company websites some governments have policies against displaying advertisements on government webpages, which could prevent them from adapting such a model.

===Renewable energy===
[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|A view across a [[reverse osmosis]] [[desalination]] plant in [[Nepal]].]]
[[Renewable energy]] is the [[energy]] that can be replenished easily. For years we have been using sources such as [[wood]], [[sun]], [[water]], etc. for means for producing energy. Energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood, sun, wind, etc. is considered to be renewable.

===Water purification===
[[Water purification]]: The whole idea/concept of having dirt/germ/pollution free water flowing throughout the environment. Many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water. Water pollution is the main enemy of this concept, and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water.&lt;ref&gt;Recycling”.

===Air purification===
[[Air purifier|Air purification]]:  Basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and convert it into [[oxygen]]. The best examples are: ''[[Dypsis lutescens]]'', ''[[Sansevieria trifasciata]]'', and ''[[Epipremnum aureum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/kamal_meattle_on_how_to_grow_your_own_fresh_air.html Kamal Meattle on how to grow fresh air] [[TED (conference)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that besides using the plants themselves, some species of bacteria can also be added to the leaves of these plants to help remove toxic gases, such as toluene&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, February 2017; Azalea's with extra bacteria can help to degrade toluene&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent_Stevens Diesel fuel degrading bacteria]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhasselt.be/UH/Nieuws/2016/Vincent-Stevens-wint-EOS-prijs-2016.html Bacteria on Hedera helix able to help degrade exhaust gases from Diesel engines running on Diesel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sewage treatment===
[[Sewage treatment]] is conceptually similar to water purification. Sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution. The most polluted water is not used for anything, and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently. It may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection, sustainability etc.&lt;ref&gt;“Sewage Treatment”.

===eGain forecasting===
Egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future [[weather]]'s impact on a building.&lt;ref&gt;Taesler, R. (1990/91) Climate and Building Energy Management. Energy and Buildings, Vol. 15-16, pp 599 - 608.&lt;/ref&gt; By adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast, the system eliminates redundant use of heat, thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ip.com/patent/US6098893 United States Patent 6098893] Comfort control system incorporating weather forecast data and a method for operating such a system (Inventor Stefan Berglund)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy conservation===
[[Energy conservation]] is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity. Reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity.

==Alternative and clean power==
[[File:Roadster 2.5 charging.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]] was the first all-electric sports car for sale and in serial production. It can completely recharge from the electrical grid in 4 to 48 hours depending on the outlet used.]]
Principles:
*[[Green syndicalism]]
*[[Sustainability]]
*[[Sustainable design]]
*[[Sustainable engineering]]

Concerns over pollution and greenhouse gases have spurred the search for sustainable alternatives to our current fuel use. For example, biogas from anaerobic digestion of plant waste can be stored to produce heat or electricity. The global reduction of greenhouse gases requires the adoption of energy conservation as well as sustainable generation. That environmental harm reduction involves global changes such as:

* reducing air pollution and methane from biomass 
* virtually eliminating fossil fuels for vehicles, heat and electricity, left in the ground. 
* wide spread use of public transport, battery and fuel cell vehicles 
* more wind/solar/water generated electricity 
* reducing peak demands with carbon taxes and time of use pricing.

Since fuel used by industry and transportation account for the majority of world demand, by investing in conservation and efficiency (using less fuel), pollution and greenhouse gases from these two sectors can be reduced around the globe. Advanced energy efficient [[electric motor]] (and [[electric generator]]) technology that are cost effective to encourage their application, such as [[brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine|variable speed generators]] and [[efficient energy use]], can reduce the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere, if electricity were generated using fossil fuels.

==Education==
Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes:
*''[[Environmental Engineering|Environmental Engineering or Environmental Systems]]'' courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment;
*''[[Environmental chemistry]]'', ''sustainable chemistry'' or ''environmental chemical engineering'' courses oriented towards understanding the effects (good and bad) of chemicals in the environment.  Such awards can focus on mining processes, pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes;
*''Environmental technology'' courses oriented towards producing electronic, electrical or electrotechnology graduates capable of developing devices and artefacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources, and developing novel energy generation technologies.

'''Ernst Karl Abbe''' [[FRMS|HonFRMS]] (23 January 1840 – 14 January 1905) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]], [[optical engineering|optical scientist]], [[entrepreneur]], and social reformer. Together with [[Otto Schott]] and [[Carl Zeiss]], he laid the foundation of modern [[optics]]. Abbe developed numerous optical instruments. He was a co-owner of [[Carl Zeiss AG]], a German manufacturer of research microscopes, astronomical telescopes, planetariums and other optical systems.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Else Abbe.png|thumb|left|Else Snell]]
Abbe was born 23 January 1840 in [[Eisenach]], [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]],&lt;ref name="NDB"&gt;{{harvnb|Blasius|1953|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Georg Adam Abbe and Elisabeth Christina Barchfeldt.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a humble home — his father was a foreman in a spinnery. Supported by his father's employer, Abbe was able to attend secondary school and to obtain the general qualification for university entrance with fairly good grades, at the Eisenach Gymnasium, which he graduated from in 1857.&lt;ref name =gu/&gt; By the time he left school, his scientific talent and his strong will had already become obvious. Thus, in spite of the family's strained financial situation, his father decided to support Abbe's studies at the Universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]] (1857–1859) and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1859–1861).&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; During his time as a student, Abbe gave private lessons to improve his income. His father's employer continued to fund him. Abbe was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Göttingen on 23 March 1861.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at school, he was influenced by [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]], who also happened to be one of the [[Göttingen Seven]].&lt;ref name=gu2&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by two short assignments at the Göttingen [[observatory]] and at Physikalischer Verein in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] (an association of citizens interested in physics and chemistry that was founded by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1824 and still exists today).&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; On 8 August 1863 he qualified as a university lecturer at the University of Jena. In 1870, he accepted a contract as an associate [[professor]] of experimental [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[mathematics]] in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, he married Else Snell, daughter of the mathematician and physicist Karl Snell, one of Abbe's teachers,{{refn|group=nb|Some sources give his wife's name as Elisabeth.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} with whom he had two daughters.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He attained full professor status by 1879.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He became director of the [[Jena Observatory|Jena astronomical and meteorological observatory]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The dates of his job appointments at the University of Jena, including his appointment as director of the Jena Observatory has some uncertainty, as sources give different dates, as following. 1870: assistant lecturer on mechanics and experimental physics; 1873: associate professor; 1877: director of the Jena Observatory meteorological and astronomy departments.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} In 1889, he became a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. He also was a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences. He was relieved of his teaching duties at the University of Jena in 1891. Abbe died 14 January 1905 in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCabe (1945). A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Freethinkers. Haldeman-Julius Publications. Retrieved 7 April 2013. He was not only a distinguished German physicist and one of the most famous inventors on the staff at the Zeiss optical works at Jena but a notable social reformer, By a generous scheme of profit-sharing he virtually handed over the great Zeiss enterprise to the workers. Abbe was an intimate friend of Haeckel and shared his atheism (or Monism). Leonard Abbot says in his life of Ferrer that Abbe had "just the same ideas and aims as Ferrer."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbe-Grab kl.jpg|thumb|upright|Ernst Abbe, relief at his grave]]In 1866, he became a research director at the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss Optical Works]], and in 1886 he invented the [[Apochromat|apochromatic lens]], a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; By 1870, Abbe invented the [[Abbe condenser]], used for microscope illumination.&lt;ref name =EB/&gt; In 1871, he designed the first [[refractometer]], which he described in a booklet published in 1874.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous immersion objective, and in 1886 his apochromatic objective microscopes were being sold.&lt;ref name=pf&gt;{{harvnb|Pfeiffer|1991|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the [[Abbe number]], a measure of any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material's variation of [[refractive index]] with [[wavelength]] and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists in a set of observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see [[angular resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joint Committee of Civil Engineers, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, and American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already a professor in [[Jena]], he was hired by [[Carl Zeiss]] to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.

Abbe was the first to define the term [[numerical aperture]],&lt;ref name="NA Est"&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the sine of the half angle multiplied by the refractive index of the medium filling the space between the cover glass and front lens.

Abbe is credited by many for discovering the resolution limit of the microscope, and the formula (published in 1873)

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{\lambda}{2 NA}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq. 1}}}}

although in a publication in 1874 by [[Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helmholtz|Fripp|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; (another early appearance of this formula), [[Helmholtz]] states this formula was first derived by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who had died 61 years prior. Helmholtz was so impressed as to offer a professorship at the [[University of Berlin]], which he refused due to his ties to Zeiss.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Abbe was in the camp of the wide aperturists, arguing that microscopic resolution is ultimately limited by the aperture of the optics, but also argued that depending on application there are other parameters that should be weighted over the aperture in the design of objectives. In Abbe's 1874 paper, titled "A Contribution to the Theory of the Microscope and the nature of Microscopic Vision",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbe states that the resolution of a microscope is inversely dependent on its aperture, but without proposing a formula for the resolution limit of a microscope.

In 1876, Abbe was offered a partnership by Zeiss and began to share in the considerable profits.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Although the first theoretical derivations of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} were published by others, it is fair to say that Abbe was the first to reach this conclusion experimentally. In 1878, he built the first homogenous immersion system for the microscope.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The objectives that the Abbe Zeiss collaboration were producing were of ideal ray geometry, allowing Abbe to find that the aperture sets the upper limit of microscopic resolution, not the curvature and placement of the lenses. Abbe's first publication of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} occurred in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication, Abbe states that both his theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. Abbe's contemporary Henry Edward Fripp, English translator of Abbe's and Helmholtz's papers, puts their contributions on equal footing. He also perfected the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference method]] by [[Fizeau]], in 1884.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Abbe, Zeiss, Zeiss' son, [[Roderich Zeiss]], and [[Otto Schott]] formed, in 1884, [[Schott AG|Jenaer Glaswerk Schott &amp; Genossen]]. This company, which in time would in essence merge with Zeiss Optical Works, was responsible for research and production of 44 initial types of optical glass.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; Working with [[telescope]]s, he built image reversal system in 1895.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;

In                                     order to produce high quality objectives, Abbe made significant contributions to the diagnosis and correction of [[optical aberration]]s, both [[spherical aberration]] and [[coma aberration]], which is required for an objective to reach the resolution limit of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. In addition to spherical aberration, Abbe discovered that the rays in optical systems must have constant angular magnification over their angular distribution to produce a diffraction limited spot, a principle known as the [[Abbe sine condition]].&lt;ref name="NA Est"/&gt; So monumental and advanced were Abbe's calculations and achievements that [[Frits Zernike]] based his [[Phase contrast microscopy|phase contrast]] work on them, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1953, and [[Hans Busch (physicist)|Hans Busch]] used them to work on the development of the [[electron microscope]].&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt;

During his association with [[Carl Zeiss]]' [[microscope]] works, not only was he at the forefront of the field of optics but also labor reform as he also, in 1900, introduced the [[Eight hour day|eight-hour workday]], in remembrance of the 14-hour workday of his own father.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In addition, he created a pension fund and a discharge compensation fund.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; In 1889, Ernst Abbe set up and endowed the [[Carl Zeiss Foundation]] for research in science.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The aim of the foundation was "to secure the economic, scientific, and technological future and in this way to improve the job security of their employees."&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; He made it a point that the success of an employee was based solely on their ability and performance, not on their origin, religion, or political views.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In 1896, he reorganized the Zeiss optical works into a cooperative with profit-sharing.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; His social views were so respected as to be used by the [[Prussia]]n state as a model and idealized by [[Alfred Weber]] in the 1947 book ''Schriften der Heidelberger Aktionsgruppe zur Demokratie und Zum Freien Sozialismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Abbe (crater)|Abbe]] on the [[Moon]] was named in his honour.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The '''Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford''', co-ordinates the teaching of [[theology]] at the [[University of Oxford]], England. It is part of Oxford's [[Humanities Division, University of Oxford|Humanities Division]].

The Theology Faculty Centre was at 34 [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']] in central [[Oxford]]. It is now on the second floor of the Gibson Building in the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] on [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]].

== History ==
One of the first series of lectures delivered at [[Oxford University]] was on theology.  As early as 1193, [[Alexander Neckam]] from [[St Albans]] gave biblical and moral lectures on the [[Psalms of David]] and the [[Wisdom of Solomon]]. One of the first university buildings was the [[Divinity School, Oxford|Divinity School]], begun in 1423 specifically for theology lectures.

The modern theological faculty emerges during the reform of the University of Oxford in the nineteenth century. The Final Honour School of Theology -  as a route to the Bachelor of Arts degree - was introduced in 1869. Up until then, theological study was the reserve of graduates and those seeking ordination in the [[Church of England]], who would attend a short series of lectures by the Regius Professors on basic divinity; its focus was on the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], [[Joseph Butler]]'s ''Analogy of Religion'' and a knowledge of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. Although an honour school in theology was recommended from as early as 1853, it was not until the late 1860s, amidst concerns about the declining influence of the Established Church in the university, that [[Edward Pusey]] and [[Henry Parry Liddon]] began to advocate the introduction of a separate School of Theology responsible for the training of Anglican ordinands. Its curriculum was biblical and historical in its focus, with its first examinations requiring knowledge of scripture, ecclesiastical history and patristics, dogmatic and symbolic theology, apologetics, liturgy and sacred criticism.

The faculty remained as a stronghold of the Church of England well into the 20th century, with denominatinal restrictions on the higher theological degrees (the Bachelor of Divinity and the Doctor of Divinity) and examiners in the Final Honour School of Theology only being abolished in 1920 and 1922 respectively. Still, three of the regius professorships are tied to canonries at [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]], requiring their holders to be in ordained in the Church of England or in a church in communion with the Church of England. A  significant proportion of the faculty's students are preparing for ordination, either as candidates for the B.A. or the B.Th.

Despite the faculty's historic obligations to the Church of England, the foundation of Nonconformist and Roman Catholic institutions in Oxford from the late 19th century onwards, alongside changing academic and ecclesiastical attitudes towards theological study, resulted in the gradual transformation of theology from a purely professional discipline into an aspect of humanistic study.

During the 20th century, Oxford established itself as an internationally significant centre of theological study with important contributions from [[S. R. Driver]], [[William Sanday (theologian)|William Sanday]], [[C. H. Turner]], [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter]], [[Norman Powell Williams|N.&amp;nbsp;P. Williams]], [[R. H. Lightfoot]], [[G. R. Driver]], [[Austin Farrer]], [[Maurice Wiles]], [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] and [[Arthur Peacocke]]. Although the department has, more recently, introduced examination papers in modern systematic theology, world religions and even separate postgraduate master's degrees in the study of religion, the Final Honour School of Theology remains primarily focused on biblical and historical study. Each undergraduate devotes at least half of his or her degree to the study of the Old Testament, New Testament, the development of Christian doctrine to AD 451 and modern Christian doctrine. Candidates can then choose four further papers from a wide selection of topics in biblical studies, history, doctrine and world religions.

'''Guerrilla crosswalks''' are created by modifying existing [[pedestrian crossing]] or painting new crosswalk lines. This is done without jurisdictional approval and with the intent of improving pedestrian and other non-automobile safety. These interventions are a common strategy within [[tactical urbanism]], a term used to describe any low-cost, often temporary change to the built environment intended to improve local livability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfeifer|first=Laura|date=October 23, 2014|title=The Planner's Guide to Tactical Urbanism|url=https://reginaurbanecology.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tuguide1.pdf|journal=Regina Urban Ecology|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}{{sps|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerilla crosswalks have been noted in news articles since at least 2009 and have become more well known as an urban strategy in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bikeportland.org/2009/12/28/guerrila-crosswalk-installed-on-east-burnside-27521|title=Guerilla Crosswalk painted on East Burnside|last=Maus|first=Jonathan|date=December 28, 2009|website=|publisher=BikePortland.org|access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Walkability]] and [[quality of life]] indicators are common topics in urban planners' and urban advocates' vocabulary in recent years. With the increasing body of research focused on measuring, and in some cases, marketing the walkability and quality of life in cities, citizens and decision-makers alike are focused on improving intersections, sidewalks, and streetscapes. Tactical urbanism is focused generally on small-scale, quick, and low-cost changes to a place. While some might consider it illegal, it is utilized by both activists and city planners alike when pilot programs and improvements are required immediately and when budget is a significant constraint. 

Many guerrilla tactics react to the delays and inefficiencies in attempting to follow proper or legal channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagano|first=Celeste|date=2013|title=DIY Urbanism: Property and Process in grassroots city building|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5192&amp;context=mulr|journal=Marquette Law Review|volume=97|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 2, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when local residents appeal to a public works department for an additional crosswalk near a school, impatience will inevitably set in after a time of unresponsiveness. Sometimes an act such as painting an unsanctioned [[Crosswalks|crosswalk]] is the only response that will move some jurisdictions to action. Many activists are frustrated with their local street system. Whether they are pedestrians or cyclists, in many cases, they are concerned about traffic speeds and safety around the ever increasing number of cars on the roads. Others simply want safer intersections near their children's schools. Whatever the motivation, guerrilla crosswalks are a strategic response by those unsatisfied with existing conditions.

Although this tactic appears to respond to unsafe conditions at the interface of pedestrian and automobile circulation, it is not without its opponents. One Public Works official commented in this way, "These changes to City streets are illegal, potentially unsafe and adding to the City's costs of maintenance and repair…. There is potential liability and risk management claims to both the City and the individuals involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Painting your own crosswalk: crime or civic opportunity?|last=Goodyear|first=Sarah|date=June 5, 2013|url=http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/06/painting-your-own-crosswalk-crime-or-civic-opportunity/5791/ |publisher=Atlantic: Citylab|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosswalks are a signal to drivers that pedestrians may be present. They are intended to group pedestrians for crossing at a safe time. The introduction of new crosswalks can be confusing to drivers and potentially give pedestrians a false sense of security. 

==Etymology==
The Oxford English Dictionary's definition of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] includes: "referring to actions or activities performed in an impromptu way, often without authorization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tactical Urbanism|last=Lydon|first=Mike|last2=Garcia|first2=Anthony|publisher=Island Press|year=2015|isbn=9781610915670|location=|pages=13|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkW9BgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tactical+Urbanism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipuqP8--TPAhVcGGMKHTK1AAgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Guerilla%20crosswalks&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Case studies and examples==

In the Baltimore neighborhood known as Hampden, a 2011 repaving project endured longer than planned. After paving was complete, new crosswalks should have been painted, but the task was left undone with the contractor's justification that the cold weather prevented any street striping. This busy intersection was determined unsafe by many of the locals. Eventually one resident took it upon himself to take action. As he painted the crosswalk lines late into the night, he noticed that cops passed by but no citation was ever given. The local city council woman rather than pursue some level of prosecution actually offered a hearty "thank you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampden's DIY Crosswalks|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=North Baltimore Patch|last1=Bednar|first1=Adam|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honolulu]], Hawaii has some of the highest pedestrian fatality rates in the United States. (Wong 2012)  Many of their busiest intersections reflect city standards from years past without modification as the quantity of vehicular traffic and associated speeds have changed dramatically. Some residents chose to take a stand in 2014. Within the crosswalk of one of these busy intersections, residents altered the crosswalk lines so that they spelled out "Aloha," the traditional Hawaiian salutation. While the perpetrators sought to introduce a level of humanity to the dangerous location, city officials stated that the change was a "deviation from the standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 2014|publisher=StrongTowns blog|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Chicago]] has seen a different level of activism to protect pedestrians within an existing crosswalk. In Spring of 2016, the city of Chicago posted signage to a unique intersection: no left turn. To call attention to this new condition, an unknown person installed two small planter boxes within the crosswalk with flowering plants. Many responded positively while local businesses expressed concern for the traffic pattern change and its effect on their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eyes on the Street: Tactical Urbanism Blooms on Broadway|date=April 21, 2016|publisher=StreetsBlog Chicago|last1=Greenfield|first1=John|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''institutional review board''' ('''IRB'''), also known as an '''independent ethics committee''' ('''IEC'''), '''ethical review board''' ('''ERB'''), or '''research ethics board''' ('''REB'''), is a type of [[committee]] that applies [[research#Research ethics|research ethics]] by reviewing the [[methodology|methods]] proposed for [[research]] to ensure that they are [[ethics|ethical]]. Such boards are formally designated to approve (or reject), monitor, and review [[biomedical]] and [[behavioral]] research involving [[human]]s. They often conduct some form of [[risk-benefit analysis]] in an attempt to determine whether or not research should be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;The Office of Human Research Protection. Institutional Review Board Guidebook. "Chapter 3, Section A: Risk/Benefit Analysis.” pp. 1-10 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PSYCH202A-3.1.4-Institutional-Review-Board.pdf] Retrieved May 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the IRB is to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and [[quality of life|welfare]] of humans participating as subjects in a research study. Along with developed countries, many developing countries have established national, regional or local Institutional Review Boards in order to safeguard ethical conduct of research concerning both national and international norms, regulations or codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Asghari|first2=Fariba|last3=Rashidian|first3=Arash|date=2014|title=Continuing review of ethics in clinical trials: a surveillance study in Iran|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=7|pages=22|pmc=4648212|pmid=26587202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A key goal of IRBs is to protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm, which they attempt to do by reviewing research protocols and related materials. The protocol review assesses the ethics of the research and its methods, promotes fully informed and voluntary participation by prospective subjects capable of making such choices (or, if that is not possible, informed permission given by a suitable proxy), and seeks to maximize the safety of subjects.

In the [[United States]], the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (specifically [[Office for Human Research Protections]]) regulations (see [[Human subject research legislation in the United States]]) have empowered IRBs to approve, require modifications in planned research prior to approval, or disapprove research. IRBs are responsible for critical oversight functions for research conducted on human subjects that are "scientific", "ethical", and "regulatory". The equivalent body responsible for overseeing U.S. federally funded research using animals is the [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] (IACUC).

IRBs are most commonly used for studies in the fields of [[health]] and the social sciences, including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]]. Such studies may be [[clinical trials]] of new drugs or devices, studies of personal or social behavior, opinions or attitudes, or studies of how health care is delivered and might be improved.

==United States mandate for IRBs==
{{see also|Human subject research legislation in the United States}}

Formal review procedures for institutional human subject studies were originally developed in direct response to research abuses in the 20th century. Among the most notorious of these abuses were the [[Nazi human experimentation|experiments of Nazi physicians]], which became a focus of the post-World War II [[Doctors' Trial]], the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]], a long-term project conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the [[U.S. Public Health Service]], and numerous [[human radiation experiments]] conducted during the [[Cold War]].  Other controversial U.S. projects undertaken during this era include the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram obedience experiment]], the [[Stanford prison experiment]], and [[Project MKULTRA]], a series of classified [[mind control]] studies organized by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

The result of these abuses was the [[National Research Act|National Research Act of 1974]] and the development of the [[Belmont Report]], which outlined the primary ethical principles in human subjects review; these include "respect for persons", "beneficence", and "justice". An IRB may only approve research for which the risks to subjects are balanced by potential benefits to society, and for which the selection of subjects presents a fair or just distribution of risks and benefits to eligible participants. A ''[[bona fide]]'' process for obtaining [[informed consent]] from participants is also generally needed. However, this requirement may be waived in certain circumstances – for example, when the risk of harm to participants is clearly minimal.

In the United States, IRBs are governed by Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=HHS.gov |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations define the rules and responsibilities for institutional review, which is required for all research that receives support, directly or indirectly, from the United States federal government. IRBs are themselves regulated by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Additional requirements apply to IRBs that oversee clinical trials of drugs involved in [[new drug application]]s, or to studies that are supported by the [[United States Department of Defense]].

In addition to registering its IRB with the OHRP, an institution is also required to obtain and maintain a ''Federalwide Assurance'' or FWA, before undertaking federally funded human research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html|title=IRBs and Assurances|author=|date=22 December 2010|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an agreement in which the institution commits to abiding by the regulations governing human research. A secondary supplement to the FWA is required when institutions are undertaking research supported by the U.S. Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/HRPP_laws_regulations_policies.sflb.ashx Human Research Protection Program (HRPP).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916055955/http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/HRPP_laws_regulations_policies.sflb.ashx |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''DoD Addendum'' includes further compliance requirements for studies using military personnel, or when the human research involves populations in conflict zones, foreign prisoners, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/P_R_DoD_Addendum_to_DHHS_FWA_20110107_1.sflb.ashx HRPP Information Sheet for DoD Addendum.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916055816/http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/P_R_DoD_Addendum_to_DHHS_FWA_20110107_1.sflb.ashx |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
U.S. regulations identify several research categories that are considered exempt from IRB oversight. These categories include: 
*Research in conventional educational settings, such as those involving the study of instructional strategies or effectiveness of various techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods. In the case of studies involving the use of educational tests, there are specific provisions in the exemption to ensure that subjects cannot be identified or exposed to risks or liabilities.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.101 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research involving the analysis of existing data and other materials if they are already publicly available, or where the data can be collected such that individual subjects cannot be identified in any way.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101" /&gt;
*Studies intended to assess the performance or effectiveness of public benefit or service programs, or to evaluate food taste, quality, or consumer acceptance.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101" /&gt;

Generally, human research ethics guidelines require that decisions about exemption are made by an IRB representative, not by the investigators themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, F. et al, ''Running Behavioral Studies with Human Participants'', Sage Publications Inc. 2013., {{ISBN|9781452217420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International ethics review committees==
Numerous other countries have equivalent regulations or guidelines governing human subject studies and the [[ethics committee]]s that oversee them. However, the organizational responsibilities and the scope of the oversight purview can differ substantially from one nation to another, especially in the domain of non-medical research. The [[United States]] [[Department of Health and Human Services]] maintains a comprehensive compilation of regulations and guidelines in other countries, as well as related standards from a number of international and regional organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/index.html International Compilation of Human Research Protections], Office for Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming and composition ==
Although "IRB" is a generic term used in the United States by the FDA and HHS, each institution that establishes such a board may use whatever name it chooses. Many simply capitalize the term "Institutional Review Board" as the [[proper noun|proper name]] of their instance. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the FDA's IRB regulations when studies of FDA-regulated products are reviewed and approved. At one time such a committee was named the "Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects". Originally, IRBs were simply committees at academic institutions and medical facilities to monitor research studies involving human participants, primarily to minimize or avoid [[ethics|ethical]] problems. Today, some of these reviews are conducted by for-profit organizations known as 'independent' or 'commercial' IRBs. The responsibilities of these IRBs are identical to those based at academic or medical institutions, and they are governed by the same U.S. federal regulations.

The regulations set out the board's membership and composition requirements, with provisions for diversity in experience, expertise, and institutional affiliation. For example, the minimum number of members is five, at least one scientist, and at least one non-scientist. The guidance strongly suggests that the IRB contain both men and women, but there is no regulatory requirement for gender balance in the IRB's membership.  The full requirements are set out in 21 CFR 56.107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PART 56 - INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS | url=http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/56-107-irb-membership-19703309 | publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]] | date=28 June 1991 | accessdate=2009-05-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813094327/http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/56-107-irb-membership-19703309 | archivedate=13 August 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convened and expedited reviews==
Unless a research proposal is determined to be exempt (see below), the IRB undertakes its work either in a convened meeting (a "full" review) or by using an expedited review procedure.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.108 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a full review is required, a majority of the IRB members must be present at the meeting, at least one of whom has primary concern for the nonscientific aspects of the research.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"/&gt; The research can be approved if a majority of those present are in favor.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"/&gt;

An expedited review may be carried out if the research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects, or where minor changes are being made to previously approved research.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.110 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations provide a list of research categories that may be reviewed in this manner.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"/&gt; An expedited review is carried out by the IRB chair, or by their designee(s) from the board membership. Research activity cannot be disapproved by expedited review.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"/&gt;

==Pharmaceutical trials and good clinical practice==
The [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Conference on Harmonisation]] sets out guidelines for registration of pharmaceuticals in multiple countries. It defines [[Good Clinical Practice]] (GCP), which is an agreed quality standard that governments can transpose into regulations for [[clinical trials]] involving human subjects.&lt;ref name=ICH-GCP&gt;{{cite web|last=International Conference on Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use|title=Good Clinical Practice|url=http://ichgcp.net/|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a summary of several key regulatory guidelines for oversight of clinical trials:

*Safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of all trial subjects. Special attention should be paid to trials that may include vulnerable subjects, such as pregnant women, children, prisoners, the elderly, or persons with diminished comprehension.
*Obtain trial protocol(s)/amendment(s), written [[Informed consent|Informed Consent Form(s)]] (ICFs) and consent form updates the investigator proposes for use in the trial, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be provided to subjects, investigator's brochure, available safety information, information about payments and compensation available to subjects, the investigator's current ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' and/or other documentation evidencing qualifications, and any other documents the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities.
*Review both the amount and method of payment to subjects to assure neither presents problems of coercion or undue influence on the trial subjects. Payments to a subject should be prorated and not wholly contingent on completion of the trial by the subject. Information regarding payment to subjects, including the methods, amounts, and schedule of payment to trial subjects, should be set forth in the written informed consent form and any other written information to be provided to subjects. The way payment will be prorated should be specified.
*Ensure that the proposed trial is reviewed within a reasonable time and document opinions and decisions in writing, clearly identifying the trial, the documents reviewed and recorded dates for approvals, required modifications prior to approval, disapproval of a proposed trial, or termination/suspension of any prior approval. Continuing review of ongoing trials is required at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk to human subjects, but at least once per year.

The reviewers may also request that more information be given to subjects when, in their judgment, the additional information would add meaningfully to the protection of the rights, safety and/or well-being of the subjects. When a non-therapeutic trial is to be carried out with the consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative, reviewers should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately address relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials. Where the protocol indicates prior consent of the trial subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative is not possible, the review should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately addresses relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials (i.e., in emergency situations).

== Adapting IRB review to social science ==
While the Belmont principles and U.S. federal regulations were formulated with biomedical and social-behavioral research in mind, the enforcement of the regulations, the examples used in typical presentations regarding the history of the regulatory requirements, and the extensiveness of written guidance have been predominantly focused on biomedical research.

Numerous complaints by investigators about the fit between the federal regulations and its IRB review requirements as they relate to social science research have been received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunsalus|first=C.K.|last2=Bruner|first2=Edward M.|last3=Burbules|first3=Nicholas C.|last4=Dash|first4=Leon|last5=Finkin|first5=Matthew|last6=Goldberg|first6=Joseph P.|last7=Greenough|first7=William T.|last8=Miller|first8=Gregory A.|last9=Pratt|first9=Michael G.|date=2016-06-29|title=The Illinois White Paper|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077800407300785|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=13|issue=5|pages=617–649|doi=10.1177/1077800407300785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broad complaints range from the legitimacy of IRB review, the applicability of the concepts of risk as it pertains to social science (e.g., possibly unneeded, over-burdensome requirements), and the requirements for the documentation of participants' informed consent (i.e., consent forms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perrault|first1=E. K.|last2=Nazione|first2=S. A.|title=Informed Consent—Uninformed Participants: Shortcomings of Online Social Science Consent Forms and Recommendations for Improvement|journal=Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=274–280|doi=10.1177/1556264616654610|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1556264616654610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have tried to determine under what instances participants are more likely to read informed consent forms, and ways to improve their efficacy in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Keating|first2=David M.|date=2017-11-08|title=Seeking Ways to Inform the Uninformed: Improving the Informed Consent Process in Online Social Science Research|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1556264617738846|journal=Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics|language=en|doi=10.1177/1556264617738846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have criticized biomedical IRBs for failing to adequately understand their research methods (such as ethnography). In 2003, the [[Office for Human Research Protections]] (OHRP), in conjunction with the [[Oral History Association]] and [[American Historical Association]], issued a formal statement that taking [[oral history|oral histories]], unstructured interviews (as if for a piece of journalism), collecting anecdotes, and similar [[free speech]] activities often do not constitute "human subject research" as defined in the regulations and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules.&lt;ref name=OralHistory&gt;{{Cite journal

Other federal agencies supporting social science have attempted to provide guidance in this area, especially the National Science Foundation. In general, the NSF guidelines assure IRBs that the regulations have some flexibility and rely on the common sense of the IRB to focus on limiting harm, maximizing informed consent, and limiting bureaucratic limitations of valid research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/hsfaqs.jsp|title=FAQs and Vignettes - NSF - National Science Foundation|author=|date=|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adapting IRB review to big data research ==
Aspects of big data research pose formidable challenges for research ethics and thus show potential for wider applicability of formal review processes.&lt;ref name="Chen_2017-09-18"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chen |first=Sophia |date=2017-09-18 |title=AI research is in desperate need of an ethical watchdog |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-research-is-in-desperate-need-of-an-ethical-watchdog/ |access-date=2017-09-18 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zhang |first=Sarah |date=2016-05-20 |title=Scientists are just as confused about the ethics of big-data research as you |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/scientists-just-confused-ethics-big-data-research/ |access-date=2017-09-18 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature_550016a"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gibney |first=Elizabeth |date=2017-10-03 |title=Ethics of Internet research trigger scrutiny: Concern over the use of public data spurs guideline update |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/550016a |url=http://www.nature.com/news/ethics-of-internet-research-trigger-scrutiny-1.22746 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theme is [[data breach]]es, but another with high difficulty is potentially dangerous [[predictive analytics]] with [[unintended consequences]], via [[type I and type II errors|false-positives]] or new ways to invade [[privacy]]. A 2016 article on the hope to expand ethics reviews of such research included an example of a data breach in which a big data researcher leaked 70,000 [[OkCupid]] profiles with usernames and sexual orientation data.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"/&gt; It also gave an example of potential privacy invasion and government repression in which [[machine learning]] was used to build automated [[gaydar]], labeling strangers as "probably gay" based on their facial photographs.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"/&gt; Analogies with [[phrenology]]&lt;ref name="Chen_2017-09-18"/&gt; and [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933–45)|Nazis identifying people as "probably part-Jewish"]] based on facial features have been made to show what can go wrong with research whose authors may have failed to adequately think through the risks of harm. Such challenges broach familiar themes, such as [[mistaken identity]], [[precrime]], and [[persecution]], in new applications.

== Managing conflicts of interest ==
While the IRB approval and oversight process is designed to protect the rights and welfare of the [[research subject]]s, it has been the subject of criticism, by bioethicists and others, for [[conflicts of interest]] resulting in lax oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030309 |title=Should Society Allow Research Ethics Boards to Be Run As For-Profit Enterprises? |publisher=PLOS Medicine |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Caroline McNeil |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/7/502.full |title=Debate Over Institutional Review Boards Continues as Alternative Options Emerge |publisher=Jnci.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the for-profit [[Western Institutional Review Board]] claimed to conduct the majority of reviews for new drug submissions to the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott |first=Carl |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2005/12/ethics_for_sale.html |title=Ethics for sale |publisher=Slate.com |date=2005-12-13 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2006 study of 575 IRB members at university medical centers, over one-third reported industry financial ties and over one-third admitted they "rarely or never" disclosed conflicts of interest to other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrp.org/cms/content/view/402/100/|title=Hospital IRBs are "On the Take"-Tainted by Conflicts ofInterest_NEJM - AHRP|author=|date=29 November 2006|website=ahrp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) set up a series of undercover tests to determine whether the IRB system was vulnerable to unethical manipulation.  In one test, a fake product "Adhesiabloc" was submitted to a number of IRBs for approval for human tests.  The product, company, and CVs of the supposed researchers were all fictitious and documents were forged by the GAO.  The product was deliberately formulated to match some "significant risk" criteria of the FDA and was described by GAO as a "gel that would be poured into a patient’s stomach after surgery to collect the bits and pieces left over from an operation."  Despite this, one IRB approved the device for human testing.  Other IRBs to whom the device was submitted rejected the application, one of them saying it was "the riskiest thing I’ve ever seen on this board".  However, none of the IRBs approached detected that the company and product were fake.  The GAO also set up a fake IRB and obtained requests for approval from companies.  They succeeded in getting assurance approval from the HHS for their fake IRB.  HHS has only three staff to deal with 300 IRB registrations and 300 assurance applications per month.  HHS stated that it would not be worthwhile to carry out additional evaluation even if they had the staff to do it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09448t.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;mdash;By Carl Elliott |url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/institutional-review-boards |title=Poor Reviews |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124042341694744375 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Alicia | last=Mundy | title=Coast IRB, Caught in Sting, to Close | date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=hearing/institutional-review-boards-that-oversee-experimental-human-testing-for-profit ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602161247/http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=hearing%2Finstitutional-review-boards-that-oversee-experimental-human-testing-for-profit |date=June 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodfreedom.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/fda-approves-nonexistent-product-from-nonexistent-company-for-human-testing/ |title=FDA Approves Nonexistent Product from Nonexistent Company for Human Testing &amp;#124; Food Freedom |publisher=Foodfreedom.wordpress.com |date=2011-01-17 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interim Alternative Educational Setting''' ('''IAES''') is a term for an educational setting and program other than the student's current placement that enables the student to continue to receive educational services according to his or her [[Individualized Education Program]].  The Individualized Education Program or [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] is a plan determined by a team who develops a set of modifications for the educational program of a [[special education]] student.  The setting is designed to allow the student to continue progress in the regular [[curriculum]] to meet the goals set out by the IEP and to allow students to receive services and modifications designed to help students address problem behavior.

'''Introspection''' is the examination of one's own [[conscious]] [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book | first=D. P. | last=Schultz |author2=Schultz, S. E. | title= A history of modern psychology (10th ed.) | year=2012| publisher= Wadsworth, Cengage Learning | isbn=978-1-133-31624-4 | url= | location= Belmont, CA | pages= 67–77, 88–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the process of introspection relies exclusively on observation of one's [[Mental representation|mental state]], while in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] context it may refer to the examination of one's [[soul]]. Introspection is closely related to [[human self-reflection]] and is contrasted with [[observation|external observation]].

Introspection generally provides a privileged access to one's own mental states,&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness' ']&lt;/ref&gt; not mediated by other sources of knowledge, so that individual experience of the mind is unique. Introspection can determine any number of mental states including: sensory, bodily, cognitive, emotional and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Introspection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of years. The philosopher [[Plato]] asked, "…why should we not calmly and patiently review our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are?"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Perner et al (2007). "''Introspection &amp; remembering''". Synthese. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; While introspection is applicable to many facets of philosophical thought it is perhaps best known for its role in [[epistemology]], in this context introspection is often compared with [[perception]], [[reason]], [[memory]], and [[testimony]] as a source of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Epistemology. (2005). In ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/#SOU&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==

===Wundt===
It has often been claimed that [[Wilhelm Wundt]], the father of modern psychology, was the first to adopt introspection to [[experimental psychology]]&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; though the methodological idea had been presented long before, as by 18th century German philosopher-psychologists such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] or [[Johann Nicolaus Tetens]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Wundt's views on introspection must be approached with great care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danziger | first1 = Kurt | year = 1980 | title = The History of Introspection Reconsidered | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 241–262 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198007)16:3&lt;241::aid-jhbs2300160306&gt;3.0.co;2-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt was influenced by notable [[physiology|physiologists]], such as [[Gustav Fechner]], who used a kind of controlled introspection as a means to study human [[sense|sensory]] organs. Building upon the pre-existing use of introspection in physiology, Wundt believed the method of introspection was the ability to observe an experience, not just the logical reflection or speculations which some others interpreted his meaning to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt imposed exacting control over the use of introspection in his experimental laboratory at the [[University of Leipzig]],&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; making it possible for other scientists to [[reproducibility|replicate]] his experiments elsewhere, a development that proved essential to the development of psychology as a modern, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] scientific discipline. Such exact purism was typical of Wundt and he instructed all introspection observations be performed under these same instructions "1) the Observer must, if possible, be in a position to determine beforehand the entrance of the process to be observed. 2) the introspectionist must, as far as possible, grasp the phenomenon in a state of strained attention and follow its course. 3) Every observation must, in order to make certain, be capable of being repeated several times under the same conditions and 4) the conditions under which the phenomenon appears must be found out by the variation of the attendant circumstances and when this was done the various coherent experiments must be varied according to a plan partly by eliminating certain stimuli and partly by grading their strength and quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titchener===
[[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]] was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to [[Cornell University]] where he established his own laboratory and research.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt's ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

===Historical misconceptions===
American [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634–654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article "[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"/&gt; It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.

===Recent developments===
{{See also|Introspection illusion}}
Partly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism's objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and [[objectivity (science)|subjectivity]] which conflicted with behaviorism's focus on measurable behavior.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences |editor-first=Robert Andrew |editor-last=Wilson |editor2=Keil, Frank C. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262731447 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recently established [[cognitive psychology]] movement has to some extent accepted introspection's usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the "[[think aloud protocol]]", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S. C. | year = 1986 | title = The case of the silent dog—Verbal reports and the analysis of rules: A review of Ericsson and Simon's Protocol Analysis: Verbal Reports as Data1 | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 351–363 | doi = 10.1901/jeab.1986.45-351 | pmc = 1348244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 18th century authors had criticized the use of introspection, both for knowing one's own mind and as a method for psychology. [[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Schütz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere "inner sensation", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. 
Recent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment. In some situations, these reports are clearly [[confabulation|confabulated]].&lt;ref name="telling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|author2=Timothy D. Wilson|year=1977|title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes|journal=Psychological Review|volume=84|issue=3|pages=231–259|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231 }}, reprinted in {{cite book|title=Social cognition: key readings|editor=David Lewis Hamilton|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-86377-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people justify choices they have not in fact made.&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Petter|last=Johansson|author2=Lars Hall |author3=Sverker Sikström |author4=Betty Tärning |author5=Andreas Lind |title=How something can be said about telling more than we can know: On choice blindness and introspection |year=2006 |journal= Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=673–692 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.004|pmid=17049881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such results undermine the idea that those verbal reports are based on direct introspective access to mental content. Instead, judgements about one's own mind seem to be [[inference]]s from overt behavior, similar to judgements made about another person.&lt;ref name="telling" /&gt; However, it is hard to assess whether these results only apply to unusual experimental situations, or if they reveal something about everyday introspection.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White |first=Peter A.|year=1988 |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=79| title=Knowing more about what we can tell: 'Introspective access' and causal report accuracy 10 years later|issue=1|pages=13–45|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1988.tb02271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the [[adaptive unconscious]] suggests that a very large proportion of mental processes, even "high-level" processes like goal-setting and decision-making, are inaccessible to introspection.&lt;ref name="annreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Elizabeth W. Dunn|year=2004|title=Self-Knowledge: Its Limits, Value, and Potential for Improvement|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=55|pages=493–518|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141954|pmid=14744224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, it is questionable how confident researchers can be in their own introspections.

One of the central implications of dissociations between consciousness and meta-consciousness is that individuals, presumably including researchers, can misrepresent their experiences to themselves. Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.

Another question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.
That is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371–372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being "unaware of their unawareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046–1047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–43|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}&lt;/ref&gt; and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

For example, people generally see themselves as less [[conformity|conformist]] than others, and this seems to be because they do not introspect any urge to conform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Jonah Berger |author3=Sarah Molouki |year=2007|title=Alone in a Crowd of Sheep: Asymmetric Perceptions of Conformity and Their Roots in an Introspection Illusion|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=4|pages=585–595|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.4.585|pmid=17469946 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1400&amp;context=marketing_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reliable finding is that people generally see themselves as [[bias blind spot|less biased than everyone else]], because they are not likely to introspect any biased thought processes.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Matthew B. Kugler|date=July 2007|title=Valuing thoughts, ignoring behavior: The introspection illusion as a source of the bias blind spot|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=565–578|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These introspections are misleading, however, because biases work [[unconscious mind|sub-consciously]].

One experiment tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. They made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they answered a question about their own bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt; Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt;

==In religion==

===Christianity===
In [[Eastern Christianity]] some concepts addressing human needs, such as sober introspection ''([[nepsis]]''), require watchfulness of the human heart and the conflicts of the human ''[[nous]]'', heart or mind. [[Noesis|Noetic]] understanding can not be achieved by rational or discursive thought (i.e. systemization).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Jainism===
[[Jainism|Jains]] practise ''[[pratikraman]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] "introspection"), a process of repentance of wrongdoings during their daily life, and remind themselves to refrain from doing so again. Devout Jains often do Pratikraman at least twice a day.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Hinduism ===
Introspection is encouraged in schools such as [[Advaita Vedanta]]; in order for one to know their own true nature, they need to reflect and introspect on their true nature -- which is what [[meditation]] is. Especially, [[Swami Chinmayananda]] emphasised the role of introspection in five stages, outlined in his book "Self Unfoldment."

==In fiction==
Introspection (also referred to as Rufus dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing [[mode (literature)|mode]] used to convey a character's thoughts. As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Renni | last=Browne |author2=King, David | title= Self-Editing for Fiction Writers: How to Edit Yourself into Print | year=2004| publisher= HarperCollins Publishers Inc. | isbn=978-0-06-054569-7 | url= | location= New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nancy Kress, a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kress|first=Nancy|year=2003|title=Make "Em Think|journal=Writer's Digest|volume=|issue=August|page=38|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[Scene (drama)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jack M. | last=Bickham | title=Scene &amp; Structure | year=1993 | publisher=Writer's Digest Books | isbn=978-0-89879-551-6 | url= | location= Cincinnati, OH |pages= 12–22, 50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basmalah-1wm.svg|right|thumb|The phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in an 18th-century Islamic calligraphy from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] region and called Thuluth.]]

'''Islamic calligraphy''' is the artistic practice of [[penmanship|handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]],&lt;!-- and by extension, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]],--&gt; based upon the [[Arabic alphabet|alphabet]] in the lands sharing a common Islamic cultural heritage. It includes [[Arabic calligraphy|Arabic Calligraphy]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Persian calligraphy]].&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;{{cite book |last=Blair |first=Sheila S. |title=The art and architecture of Islam : 1250–1800 |year=1995 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-06465-9 |edition=Reprinted with corrections |author2=Bloom, Jonathan M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|218}}--&gt;&lt;ref name=ens&gt;Chapman, Caroline (2012). ''Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture'', {{ISBN|978-979-099-631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''khatt Islami'' (خط اسلامي), meaning Islamic line, design, or construction.&lt;ref name=typography&gt;{{cite web| title=Arabic calligraphy as a typographic exercise| url=http://ilovetypography.com/2008/07/10/arabic-calligraphy-as-a-typographic-exercise/ |author=Julia Kaestle |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Islamic calligraphy is strongly tied to the [[Qur'an]]; chapters and excerpts from the Qur'an are a common and almost universal text upon which Islamic calligraphy is based. Deep religious association with the [[Qur'an]], as well as suspicion of figurative art as [[Taghut|idolatrous]], has led calligraphy to become one of the major forms of artistic expression in Islamic cultures.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|222}}--&gt; It has also been argued that Islamic calligraphy was motivated less by iconophobia (since, in fact, images were by no means absent in Islamic art) than by the centrality of the notion of writing and written text in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, “The Content of Form: Islamic Calligraphy Between Text and Representation,” in ''Sign and Design'', ed. B. Bedos-Rezak and J. Hamburger (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 2016), 169–190.&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy, for instance, that the Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: "The first thing God created was the pen."&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud, Sunnah 4699.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Islamic calligraphy is highly venerated, most works follow examples set by well-established calligraphers, with the exception of secular or contemporary works. In antiquity, a pupil would copy a master's work repeatedly until their handwriting was similar. The most common style is divided into angular and cursive, each further divided into several sub-styles.&lt;ref name=ens/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;!--[[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] calligraphy is associated with abstract [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] motifs on the walls and ceilings of [[mosque]]s as well as on the page. Contemporary [[artists]] in the [[Islamic world]] draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.
 They used it to represent God because they denied representing God with images.&lt;ref name="Bernard Lewis"&gt;Bernard Lewis and Butnzie Ellis Churchill, ''Islam : the Religion and the People'', {{ISBN|978-0-13-223085-8}}&lt;/rf&gt;--&gt;

==Instruments and media==
The traditional instrument of the Islamic calligrapher is the [[kalam]], a [[pen]] normally made of dried [[Phragmites|reed]] or [[bamboo]]; the [[ink]] is often in [[colour|color]], and chosen such that its intensity can vary greatly so that the greater strokes of the compositions can be very dynamic in their effect. Some styles are often written using a metallic-tip pen.
[[File:Niebuhr Beschreibung von Arabien Tab XIII.png|thumbnail|Five principal Arabic calligraphic cursive styles:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Naskh (نسخ nasḫ)&lt;br /&gt;
2. Nasta‘liq (نستعلیق nastaʿlīq)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Diwani (ديواني dīwānī)&lt;br /&gt;
4. Thuluth (ثلث ṯuluṯ)&lt;br /&gt;
5. Ruq‘ah (رقعة ruqʿah)]]
Islamic calligraphy is applied to a wide range of decorative mediums other than paper, such as tiles, vessels, carpets, and inscriptions.&lt;ref name=ens/&gt; Before the advent of paper, papyrus and parchment were used for writing. The advent of paper revolutionized calligraphy. While monasteries in Europe treasured a few dozen volumes, libraries in the [[Muslim world]] regularly contained hundreds and even thousands of books.&lt;ref name=Bloom /&gt;{{rp|218}}

Coins were another support for calligraphy. Beginning in 692, the Islamic caliphate reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing visual depiction with words. This was especially true for dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally, the coins were inscribed with quotes from the Qur'an.

By the tenth century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were calligraphic inscribed textiles that Crusaders brought them to Europe as prized possessions. A notable example is the [[Suaire de Saint-Josse]], used to wrap the bones of St. Josse in the Abbey of St. Josse-sur-Mer, near Caen in northwestern France.&lt;ref name=Bloom /&gt;{{rp|223–5}}

'''[[Kufic]]''' is the oldest form of the Arabic script. The style emphasizes rigid and angular strokes, which appears as a modified form of the old [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963439648|title=A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture|last=Flood, Necipoğlu|first=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=|year=2017|isbn=9781119068570|volume=Volume I|location=Hoboken|pages=109-110|oclc=963439648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archaic Kufi consisted of about 17 letters without diacritic dots or accents. Afterward, dots and accents were added to help readers with pronunciation, and the set of Arabic letters rose to 28.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie (1984). ''[http://universityoftexasbrownsville.worldcat.org/title/calligraphy-and-islamic-culture/oclc/20420019&amp;referer=brief_results Calligraphy and Islamic Culture]''. New York: New York University Press. p. 4. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special%3ABookSources/0814778305|0814778305]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is developed around the end of the 7th century in the areas of [[Kufa]], Iraq, from which it takes its name.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; The style later developed into several varieties, including floral, foliated, plaited or interlaced, bordered, and squared kufi. It was the main script used to copy Qur'ans from the 8th to 10th century and went out of general use in the 12th century when the flowing naskh style become more practical, although it continued to be used as a decorative element to contrast superseding styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kūfic script|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324418/Kufic-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no set rules of using the Kufic script; the only common feature is the angular, linear shapes of the characters. Due to the lack of methods, the scripts in different regions and countries and even down to the individuals themselves have different ways to write in the script creatively, ranging from very square and rigid forms to flowery and decorative.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt;

Common varieties include&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; square Kufic, a technique known as ''[[banna'i]]''.&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jonathan M. Bloom |author2=Sheila Blair |title=The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA212 |accessdate=4 January 2012 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-530991-1 |pages=101, 131, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary calligraphy using this style is also popular in modern decorations.

Decorative Kufic inscriptions are often imitated into [[pseudo-kufic]]s in [[Middle Ages|Middle age]] and [[Renaissance]] Europe. Pseudo-kufics is especially common in [[Renaissance]] depictions of people from the [[Holy Land]]. The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13–14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found natural to represent [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] in association with them.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Rosamond E.

===[[Naskh (script)|Naskh]]===
[[File:Folio from a Qur'an (Mamluk dynasty).jpg|thumb|right|[[Muhaqqaq]] script in a 14th-century Qur'an from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]].]]

The use of cursive scripts coexisted with Kufic, but because in the early stages of their development they lacked discipline and elegance, cursive was usually used for informal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Arabic Calligraphy, a brief history |url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |author=Mamoun Sakkal |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of Islam, a new script was needed to fit the pace of conversions, and a well-defined cursive called '''[[naskh (script)|naskh]]''' first appeared in the 10th century. The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in Qur'ans, official decrees, and private correspondence.&lt;ref name="LOCFragments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.loc.gov/intldl/apochtml/apocfragments.html |title=Library of Congress, Selections of Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Calligraphy: Qur'anic Fragments |publisher=International.loc.gov |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the basis of modern Arabic print.

Standardization of the style was pioneered by [[Ibn Muqla]] (886&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;940 A.D.) and later expanded by [[Abu Hayan at-Tawhidi]] (died 1009 A.D.) and [[Muhammad Ibn Abd ar-Rahman]] (1492&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;1545 A.D.). Ibn Muqla is highly regarded in Muslim sources on calligraphy as the inventor of the naskh style, although this seems to be erroneous. However, Ibn Muqla did establish systematic rules and proportions for shaping the letters, which use 'alif as the [[x-height]].&lt;ref&gt;Kampman, Frerik (2011). ''[http://www.islamicmanuscripts.info/reference/books/Kampman-2011-Typography-Bachelor-Thesis-Arabic-Frerik-Kampman-20120823-download.pdf Arabic Typography; its past and its future]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation of the naskh includes:
#'''[[Thuluth]]''' is developed as a display script to decorate particular scriptural ice. Letters have long vertical lines with broad spacing. The name, meaning "third", is in reference to the x-height, which is one-third of the 'alif.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/thuluth-naskh.html|title=Thuluth and Naskh|last=Kvernen|first=Elisabeth|date=2009|website=CalligraphyQalam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Riq'ah]]''' is a handwriting style derived from naskh and thuluth, first appeared in the 9th century. The shape is simple with short strokes and little flourishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/tawqi-riqa.html|title=Tawqi' and Riqa'|last=Kvernen|first=Elizabeth|date=2009|website=CalligraphyQalam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Muhaqqaq]]''' is a majestic style used by accomplished calligraphers. It was considered one of the most beautiful scripts, as well as one of the most difficult to execute. Muhaqqaq was commonly used during the Mameluke era, but the use becomes largely restricted to short phrases, such as the [[basmallah]], from the 18th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, Nassar (2011). ''Sacred Script: Muhaqqaq in Islamic Calligraphy''. New York: I.B.Tauris &amp; Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-84885-439-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional styles===
[[File:Miremad-1.jpg|thumb|right|Nasta'liq calligraphy by [[Mir Emad Hassani]], perhaps the most celebrated Persian calligrapher.]]
With the [[spread of Islam]], the [[Arabic script]] was established in a vast geographic area with many regions developing their own unique style. From the 14th century onward, other cursive styles began to develop in Turkey, Persia, and China.&lt;ref name="LOCFragments" /&gt;

# '''[[Nasta'liq]]''' is a [[cursive]] style originally devised to write the [[Persian language]] for literary and non-Qur'anic works.&lt;ref name=qalam&gt;{{cite web| title= An Introduction of Arabic, Ottoman, and Persian Calligraphy: Style|author=Kvernen, Elizabeth |year=2009|publisher=Calligraphy Qalam |url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nasta'liq is thought to be a later development of the naskh and the earlier ta'liq script used in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ta'liq Script |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581497/taliq-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''ta'liq'' means "hanging", and refers to the slightly steeped lines of which words run in, giving the script a hanging appearance. Letters have short vertical strokes with broad and sweeping horizontal strokes. The shapes are deep, hook-like, and have high contrast.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; A variant called ''[[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq|Shikasteh]]'' is used in more informal contexts.
# '''[[Diwani]]''' is a cursive style of Arabic calligraphy developed during the reign of the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by [[Housam Roumi]], and reached its height of popularity under [[Süleyman I the Magnificent]] (1520–1566).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diwani script|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166798/diwani-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spaces between letters are often narrow, and lines ascend upwards from right to left. Larger variations called ''djali'' are filled with dense decorations of dots and diacritical marks in the space between, giving it a compact appearance. Diwani is difficult to read and write due to its heavy stylization and became the ideal script for writing court documents as it ensured confidentiality and prevented forgery.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt;
# '''[[Sini (script)|Sini]]''' is a style developed in China. The shape is greatly influenced by [[Chinese calligraphy]], using a horsehair brush instead of the standard reed pen. A famous modern calligrapher in this tradition is [[Hajji]] [[Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hajinoordeen.com/gallery.html "Gallery"], ''Haji Noor Deen''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--==Calligrams==

[[File:The Bismillah India.jpg|thumb|Bismillah calligraphy from the [[Mughal Empire]].]]

[[Calligraphy]], the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, also has its figurative sides. By interweaving written words, made from an "Allah", a "Muhammad", a "[[Basmala|Bismillah]]", etc., or using [[micrography]],&lt;ref name = "bnf"&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran]. In French.&lt;/ref&gt; calligraphers produced anthropomorphic figures ([['Ali]], the Ideal Human of [[Sufi|mystics]], a praying man,&lt;ref name=Praying&gt;{{cite web|title=Praying Man|url=http://www.ethiopianmuslims.net/Images/calligraphy2.jpg|publisher=Ethiopian Muslims Network|accessdate=29 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217032258/http://www.ethiopianmuslims.net/Images/calligraphy2.jpg|archivedate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a face), zoomorphisms (symbolic creatures, most from the Shi'a iconography, like the lion (Ali "the Lion of God")&lt;ref name = "Cartage"&gt;[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/GeogHist/histories/Oldcivilization/Egyptology/Calligraphy/art5.jpg Lion of 'Ali].&lt;/ref&gt; horse ([['Ali]]'s [[Duldul (mule)|Duldul]]),&lt;ref name = "Levha"&gt;[http://www.levha.net/calligraphy/calligraphy_index.html Horse of 'Ali].&lt;/ref&gt; fish,&lt;ref name = "bnf" /&gt; stork or other bird (the qur'anic [[Hudhud]])&lt;ref name = "IslArch"&gt;[http://www.islamicarchitecture.org/art/images/calligraphy/islamic.calligraphy.birdtext.101.gif HudHud].{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "UCSC"&gt;[http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/art/islamic_bird.jpg Islamic Bird], ''UC Santa Cruz Currents Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and inanimate representations (a sword ([[Zulfiqar|Dhu al-Fiqar]]), a mosque, a ship (made from the letter ''[[Waw (letter)|waw]]'', a symbol of mystical union, literally meaning "and," in Arabic)). Calligrams are related to Muslim mysticism and popular with many leading calligraphers in [[Turkey]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[India]] from the 17th century onward.

Although striking in appearance, calligrams have never been regarded as appropriate or a decent expression of the art by the master calligraphers. Many calligrams therefore were produced by either folk calligraphers or for the interest of uncultivated people. These calligrams were not exhibited in mosques or Sufi convents in the Ottoman state, for example.

An element in this perspective is the rejection of the interpretation by the heretic Hurufiyyah Sufi order which sees letters as true manifestations of the fate, events and creation in themselves.

In the teachings of calligraphy, figurative imagery is used to help visualize the shape of letters to trace, for example, the letter ''ha' '' looks in ''nasta'liq'' similar to two eyes, as its Persian name implies: "he' two eyes" ''he' do cheshm''). In literature and poetry seeing in letters a reflection of the natural world goes back to the [[Abbasid]] times.

One of the contemporary masters of the calligram genre is [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [[Wissam Shawkat]].

Good commercial examples are the logos of [[Al Jazeera]], an international news station based at [[Qatar]], and the [[Edinburgh Middle East Report]], a Scottish academic journal on the [[Middle East]], and also the work of the calligrapher and designer Wissam Shawkat.--&gt;

===Modern===
In the post-colonial era, artists working in North Africa and the Middle East transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement, known as the ''[[Hurufiyya movement]]''. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Flood, Necipoğlu (2017). [https://www.worldcat.org/title/a-companion-to-islamic-art-and-architecture-2-from-the-mongols-to-modernism/oclc/1006377297&amp;referer=brief_results A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture]. Volume II. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 1294. {{ISBN|1119068665}}. OCLC 1006377297.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists working in this field use calligraphy as a graphic from within a contemporary artwork. &lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' for letter. Traditionally, the term was charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is an explicit reference to a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism.  In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos. &lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyyah artists  struggled to find their own individual  dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa around 1955, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the use of calligraphy in modern artworks appears to have emerged independently in various Islamic states. Few of the artists working in this field, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyyah to emerge in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, Necipoğlu (2017). [https://www.worldcat.org/title/a-companion-to-islamic-art-and-architecture-2-from-the-mongols-to-modernism/oclc/1006377297&amp;referer=brief_results A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture].

[[File:Roof of Frere Hall.JPG|thumb|The Roof of [[Frere Hall]], Karachi, Pakistan, c. 1986. Mural by artist, [[Sadequain|Sadequain Naqqash]] integrates calligraphy elements into a modern artwork]]

Leading exponents of hurufiyyah art can be found in Jordan. &lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

The hurufiyyah art movement was not confined to painters, but also included artists working in a variety of media, such as the Jordanian ceramicist, [[Mahmoud Taha]], who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship &lt;ref&gt;Asfour. M., "A Window on Contemporary Arab Art," NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor was the movement confined to Jordan. In Iraq, the movement was known as ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])",&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html;  Flood, Necipoğlu (2017).

Volume II. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 1294. {{ISBN|1119068665}}. OCLC 1006377297. &lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran, it was known as the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Western art has influenced Arabic calligraphy in other ways, with forms such as [[calligraffiti]]; the use of calligraphy in public art to make politico-social messages or to vandalise public buildings and spaces. &lt;ref&gt;Grebenstein, M., ''Calligraphy Bible: A Complete Guide to More Than 100 Essential Projects and Techniques,'' 2012, p. 5 &lt;/ref&gt; Notable Islamic calligraffiti artists include: [[Yazan Halwani]] active in Lebanon, &lt;ref&gt;Alabaster, Olivia.

'''Ivanovka''' ({{lang-ru|Ивановка}}) is an estate near [[Tambov]], [[Russia]], which used to be the summer residence of the Russian composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in the period between 1890 and 1917 (until his emigration). It was the family home of his aristocratic relatives, the Satins. Many of Rachmaninoff's earlier masterpieces [[List of compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff|were created]] in its bucolic atmosphere. A museum commemorating the life and works of the composer was opened there in 1982.

{{TambovOblast-geo-stub}}
The estate of Rachmaninoff is actually located due east of the Russian town called Mozdek, and can be found at latitude 51°57'14.24"N and longitude 42° 0'7.85"E.1  This estate is now a museum dedicated to the beloved Russian composer, whose professional life was marked with dismissive criticism,2 although his music continues to fill concert halls around the world.  Although located in the Tambov Oblast, the house of his inheritance is some 12 miles due west from Uvaravo,3 and this was likely his community. A trip to Moscow would be some 300 miles and was likely taken by Train from Tambov.4

The '''Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics''' ({{lang-ru|Институт прикладной математики им. М.В.Келдыша}})  is a research institute specializing in [[computation]]al [[mathematics]]. It was established to solve computational tasks related to government programs of [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] and [[Fusion power|fusion]] energy, [[space research]] and [[missile]] technology. The Institute is a part of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. The main direction of activity of the institute is the use of [[computer technology]] to solve complex scientific and technical issues of practical importance. Since 2016, development of mathematical and computational methods for [[biological research]], as well as a direct solution to the problems of [[computational biology]] with the use of such methods, has also been included in the circle of scientific activities of the institute.

==Scientific activity==

===[[Nuclear physics]]===
Prominent theoretical physicist [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] headed one of the departments placed in charge of the theoretical aspects of the work on the creation of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Young [[:ru:Самарский, Александр Андреевич|A. A. Samarskii]] performed the first realistic calculations of macrokinetics of [[chain reaction]] of a [[nuclear explosion]], which led to the practical importance estimated power of nuclear weapons. In relation to nuclear energy, the institute was  also involved in modelling of processes of [[neutron transport]] and [[nuclear reaction]]s. In particular, E. Kuznetsov is known for his work on the theory of [[nuclear reactor]]s.

Currently, such work in '''KIAM''' is continuing in the field of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] and controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]], which began under the leadership of [[Sergei P. Kurdyumov|S. P. Kurdyumova]], {{nobr|A. A. Samarskii}}, {{nobr|Yu. P. Popov}}.

===[[Cosmonautics]]===
[[Dmitry Okhotsimsky|D. E. Okhotsimsky]] directed the works in the  department created for researches of dynamics of [[spaceflight|space flight]]. In 1966, the department was reorganized into the Ballistic Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.kiam1.rssi.ru/ Ballistic centre of KIAM]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ballistic Centre was involved in the calculations of optimal orbit trajectory and actual corrections for all space flights, from unmanned interplanetary and lunar vehicles to the manned "[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]" and orbital station "[[Salyut programme|Salyut]]" and "[[Mir]]". The department also investigated the docking task, controlled landing and stabilizing the spacecraft.

The institute took an active part in the creation of the Soviet space shuttle "[[Buran programme|Buran]]".

'''KIAM''' continues to engage in performance of current Russian space projects. The current researches are connected with:
* development of systems for management and navigation of space vehicles in real time with the use of [[Satellite navigation|global satellite navigation systems]] [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]];
* studies of the atmosphere of the planets of the solar system;
* exploration of prospects for further interplanetary missions using electric rocket engines; 
* participation in such projects as "[[Spektr-R|RadioAstron]]" and [[Fobos-Grunt]].

===[[Mathematics]] and [[Mathematical modelling|Mathematical Modelling]]===
One of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century [[Israel Gelfand|I. M. Gelfand]] was at the head of the Department of heat transmission before his departure for the United States in 1989. He was carrying out the fundamental works on [[functional analysis]], [[algebra]] and [[topology]]. [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov|A. N. Tikhonov]] worked initially also in these areas of mathematics. However, Tikhonov is better known with his works of more applied orientation, such as methods for solving [[Well-posed problem|ill-posed problems]] ([[Tikhonov regularization]]). Tikhonov also created the theory of [[differential equation]]s with a [[:ru:Уравнение с малым параметром|small parameter]] at the highest derivative. The general theory of stability of [[Finite difference method|difference schemes]] was developed by {{nobr|A. A. Samarskii}}. Samarskii considered mathematical modelling as an independent scientific discipline. [[Sergei P. Kurdyumov|S. P. Kurdyumov]] created a whole scientific school in [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]] in Russia.

Currently, the existing arsenal of numerical methods is updated and improved in response to the growing complexity of the models and the possibilities of modern [[supercomputer]]s. Scientists of KIAM elaborate [[Grid computing|grid methods]] for solving computational problems, which has led, in particular, to the creation of a declarative language "Norma".&lt;ref name="proj_Norma"&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.parallel.ru/russia/map/data/project18.html Programming languages and systems "Norma"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Computer]]s and [[Computer programming|Programming]]===
The institute is always supplied with the most modern computer technology, which  the domestic industry could put. The first studies were carried out still on [[mechanical calculator]]s "Mercedes" by a large staff of estimators. In 1955, the first domestically produced [[computer]] "Strela" appeared, and, in particular, the orbit of the first satellite was calculated with use of it.

Currently, work is underway to create a distributed computing systems based on combining several [[supercomputer]]s, which are used for grid - technology and developed a specialized [[operating system]] (DVM).

===[[Robotics]]===
Currently, work on the robotics  are carried out in:
* the Group of {{nobr|V. E. Pavlovsky}} of the Sector under guidance of {{nobr|A. K. Platonov}} (virtual football&lt;ref name="proj_football"&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.keldysh.ru/pages/robosoccer/ The project "Virtual football" of KIAM RAS]&lt;/ref&gt;),
* the Group of {{nobr|S. M. Sokolov}} ([[Computer vision|vision systems]]),
* the Group of {{nobr|V. E. Pryanishnikova}}  (autonomous tracked vehicles).
Work is also continuing on the establishment of six-legged walking machine.

===[[Computational biology]]===
Since 2016, the sphere of interests of KIAM includes also computational biology problems, which are solved in [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology|IMPB RAS — Branch of KIAM RAS]] in [[Pushchino]].

===Specialized research projects===
* The project "[[Spektr-R|RadioAstron]]"
* The project "Norma"&lt;ref name="proj_Norma" /&gt;
* The project "DVM"
* The project "GNS"
* The project "grid" (multiprocessor computations)
* The project "Virtual football"&lt;ref name="proj_football" /&gt; 
* [[International Scientific Optical Network]] (ISON)

===Teaching and social activities===
Most of the leading employees of '''KIAM''' worked part-time as professors of the [[Moscow State University]] and [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. {{nobr|A. N. Tikhonov}} was the organizer and first Dean of the [[MSU Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics|Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics]].

{{nobr|I. M. Gelfand}} was engaged in mathematical education of secondary school pupils.

==History==

===Milestones===
The institute is located in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. In 1978, it is named after [[Mstislav Keldysh]]. The institute was created in 1966 when it split from [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]]. Already as the Department of Applied Mathematics of Steklov Institute it had conducted some outstanding research in the field of space exploration: in 1953 it developed the method of ballistic [[spacecraft]] descent, that was used on April 12, 1961 for [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s return to the Earth, and in 1957 [[Sputnik 1]] orbit was calculated there using the [[computer]] processing of [[observation|optical observation]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.applmat.ru/pages/anniver/achievment/3_appl_mech.htm 50th anniversary of the Institute — Applied celestial mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the reorganization in [[Russian Academy of Sciences|RAS]] of 2015—2016 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.keldysh.ru/fano.pdf The order on accession IMPB to the KIAM]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institute of Mathematical Problems of Biology]] became a branch of '''KIAM'''.

'''La Casa de la Ciencia''' (''the House of Science'') in the city of [[Seville]], Spain is a centre for popularizing science.

Along with a museum, the building houses the Andalusian headquarters of the Spanish National Research Council ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]). CSIC is the largest public institution devoted to research in Spain, and the third largest in Europe. The building was opened to the public in 2008, with the goal of sharing knowledge acquired through scientific research. La Casa de la Ciencia aims to be a bridge between the scientific research community and the public, sharing contemporary scientific research and information on environmental issues.
The museum achieves these goals by putting on various types of events, including exhibitions, conferences, seminars and workshops.
The museum contains three permanent exhibits, one temporary exhibit and a planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

The museum is housed in the Peruvian pavilion (''Pabellón de Perú''), a building of great beauty that was built in the [[Maria Luisa Park]] for the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929]]. In addition to being home to the offices of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas en Sevilla ([[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]), the building also house the Peruvian Consulate.&lt;ref name="consuladoperusevilla.es"&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Consulado General del Perú en Sevilla
 |title=Consulado General del Perú en Sevilla
 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For twenty years the building was the headquarters of the Biological Station of Doñana and in April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Ciencia.  In April 2008 the city council of Seville provided a grant to renovate the building to create La Casa de la Cienca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Building==

[[File:Pabellón Perú.jpg|thumb|right| Museum interior]]

The building was designed by the renowned architect Manuel Piqueras Cotolí (1885 – 1937). Cotoli was born in Lucena, Córdoba but moved to Peru to study and became known for his buildings which blended indigenous and colonial architecture. These buildings include the [[Escuela Nacional Superior Autónoma de Bellas Artes]], Pizarro´s Tomb in the [[Cathedral of Lima]], and the Archbishop's Palace. The blending of architectural styles is easily visible from the outside of La Casa de la Ciencia, and many parts of the building share similarities with Cotoli’s Peruvian works.

A part of the building holds the Consulate General of Peru in Seville.&lt;ref name="consuladoperusevilla.es"/&gt;
In July 2008 the Peruvian ambassador to Spain signed a 75-year renewal of the assignment by the City of Seville of the Pavilion of Peru to the Republic of Peru and to the CSIC. The CSIC had undertaken to provide a {{convert|3000|m2|sqft}} exhibition space open to the public dedicated to the extension of science in [[Andalusia]].

==Exterior==

The building lies on the Avenida Maria Luisa, noted for the [[Queen's sewing box]] (''Costurero de la Reina''), a unique building that takes the form of a small hexagonal castle with turrets at the corners, and the oldest building in Seville in the ''neomudéjar'' style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Charles-Édouard Jeanneret''' (6 October 1887 – 27 August 1965), known as '''Le Corbusier''' ({{IPA-fr|lə kɔʁbyˈzje|lang}}), was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]]-[[French people|French]] architect, designer, painter, [[urban planner]], writer, and one of the pioneers of what is now called [[modern architecture]]. He was born in [[Switzerland]] and became a [[France|French citizen]] in 1930. His career spanned five decades, and he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, and North and South America.

Dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of [[Chandigarh]] in [[India]], and contributed specific designs for several buildings there.

On 17 July 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites as [[The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier|The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1528/|title=The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life (1887–1904)==
[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret), 1920, Still Life, oil on canvas, 80.9 x 99.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret), 1920, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, {{convert|80.9|x|99.7|cm|1|abbr=on}}, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]

Charles-Édouard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], a small city in the French-speaking [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel canton]] in north-western Switzerland, in the [[Jura mountains]], just {{convert|5|km|mi}} across the border from France. It was an industrial town, devoted to the manufacture of watches. (He adopted the pseudonym of ''Le Corbusier'' in 1920.) His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, while his mother gave piano lessons. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  He attended a kindergarten that used [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbelian]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier et l'urbain – la rectification du damier froebelien, pp. 93–117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Actes du colloque La ville et l'urbanisme après Le Corbusier, éditions d'en Haut 1993 – {{ISBN|2-88251-033-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Solitaire, Le Corbusier entre Raphael et Fröbel, pp. 9–27, Journal d'histoire de l'architecture N°1, Presses universitaires de Grenoble 1988 – {{ISBN|2-7061-0325-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his contemporaries [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Mies van der Rohe]], Le Corbusier did not have formal academic training as an architect.  He was attracted to the visual arts and at the age of fifteen he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking.  Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter [[Charles L'Eplattenier]], who had studied in [[Budapest]] and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L'Eplattenier had made him "a man of the woods" and taught him painting from nature.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=32}}  His father took him frequently into the mountains around the town.  He wrote later, "we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''L'Art décoratif d'aujourdhui'' (1925), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; His architecture teacher in the Art School was the architect René Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier's earliest house designs.  However, he reported later that it was the art teacher L'Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. "I had a horror of architecture and architects," he wrote. "...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed.  I moved into architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Jean Petit, ''Le Corbusier lui-meme'',  Rousseau, Geneva 1970, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel and first houses (1905–1914)==

Le Corbusier began teaching himself by going to the library to read about architecture and philosophy, by visiting museums, by sketching buildings, and by constructing them.  In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, René Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the Villa Fallet, for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L'Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-fonds. It was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully-crafted colored geometric patterns on the façade.  The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=49}}

In September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter traveling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met [[Gustav Klimt]] and tried, without success, to meet [[Josef Hoffmann]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=48}}  In Florence, he visited the [[Florence Charterhouse]] in [[Galluzzo]], which made a lifelong impression on him. "I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,"  he wrote later. "It was the solution for a unique kind of worker's housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Eplattenier in Dumont, ''Le Corbusier, ''Lettres a ses maitres'', vol. 2, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  He traveled to Paris, and during fourteen months between 1908 until 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect [[Auguste Perret]], the pioneer of the use of reinforced [[concrete]] in residential construction and the architect of the [[Art Deco]] landmark [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]].  Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911, he traveled to Germany and worked four months in the office [[Peter Behrens]], where [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]] were also working and learning.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32–33}}

In 1911, he traveled again for five months; this time he journeyed to the [[Balkans]] and visited [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], as well as [[Pompeii]] and [[Rome]], filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he saw—including many sketches of the [[Parthenon]], whose forms he would later praise in his work ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'' (1923).  He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, ''Le Voyage d'Orient''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=32–33}}

In 1912, he began his most ambitious project; a new house for his parents. also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds.  The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the center, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings.  The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years, and relocate in a more modest house.  However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of [[Le Locle]]  for a wealthy watch manufacturer. Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, significant departure from the traditional house.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=48–9}}

==Dom-ino House and Schwob House (1914–1918)==
[[File:Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), 1914-15, Maison Dom-Ino.jpg|thumb|left|Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, 1914–15, ''[[Dom-ino House|Maison Dom-Ino (Dom-ino House)'']] ]]

During [[World War I]], Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds, He concentrated on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques.&lt;ref name="Choay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Choay|first=Françoise|title=Le Corbusier|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8322926W/Le_Corbusier|year=1960|pages=10–11|publisher=George Braziller, Inc.|isbn=0-8076-0104-7|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1914, along with the engineer Max Dubois, he began a serious study of the use of reinforced concrete as a building material.  He had first discovered concrete working with Auguste Perret in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.

"Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources," he wrote later, "and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquility.".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Auguste Perret (1915), cited in ''Lettres a ces Maitres'', vol. 1, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led him to his plan for the [[Dom-ino House|Dom-Ino House]] (1914–15). This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin [[reinforced concrete column]]s, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan.&lt;ref name="Tim Benton"&gt;Tim Benton, ''Les Villas de Le Corbusier 1920–1929'', Philippe Sers éd. Paris, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was originally designed to provide large numbers of temporary residences after World War I, producing only slabs, columns and stairways, and residents could build exterior wallls with the materials around the site. He described it in his patent application as "a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans.  This would permit, he wrote, "the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the façade or the interior."

[[File:CF05.jpg|thumb|The Anatole Schwob House in La-Chaux-de-Fonds (1916–1918)]]

Under this system, the structure of the house did not have to appear on the outside, but could be hidden behind a glass wall, and the interior could be arranged in any way the architect liked.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Turner, Paul, "La Formation de Le Corbusier", Paris, Macula, 1987, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; After it was patented, Le Corbusier designed a number of houses according to the system, which were all white concrete boxes. Although some of these were never built, they illustrated his basic architectural ideas which will dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the ''Five Points of a New Architecture''. This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and façades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50–51}}

In August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodeling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house, but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture.  Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick.The center of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the center of the building.  "You can see," he wrote to Auguste Perret in July 1916, "that Auguste Perret left more in me than Peter Behrens."&lt;ref&gt;cited in ''Lettres a css maitres'', vol. 1, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier's grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client, and led to bitter conflicts.  Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, "Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house." Le Corbusier took great pride in the house, and reproduced pictures in several of his books.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=50}}

==Painting, Cubism, Purism and ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' (1918–1922)==

Le Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his own architectural practice with his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (1896–1967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the [[World War II]] years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Le_Corbusier/129220|title=Encyclopédie Larousse en ligne – Charles Édouard Jeanneret dit Le Corbusier|first=Éditions|last=Larousse|date=|work=larousse.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Le Corbusier met the [[Cubism|Cubist]] painter [[Amédée Ozenfant]], in whom he recognised a kindred spirit. Ozenfant encouraged him to paint, and the two began a period of collaboration. Rejecting Cubism as irrational and "romantic", the pair jointly published their manifesto, ''Après le cubisme'' and established a new artistic movement, [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal,  ''{{Ill|L'Esprit nouveau (revue)|fr}}'', and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.

In the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted '''Le Corbusier''' (an altered form of his maternal grandfather's name, Lecorbésier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOKNzunERUwC&amp;pg=PA161|title=Le Corbusier: choix de lettres|first1=Le|last1=Corbusier|first2=Jean|last2=Jenger|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr/repbio_us.htm Repères biographiques, Fondation Le Corbusier]. Fondationlecorbusier.asso.fr. Retrieved on 27 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting a single name to identify oneself was in vogue by artists in many fields during that era, especially in Paris.

Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier did not build anything, concentrating his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, he and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres.&lt;ref name="Choay"/&gt;
His theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these was the Maison "Citrohan", a pun on the name of the French [[Citroën]] automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials Le Corbusier advocated using for the house. Here, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the façades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.

==''Toward an Architecture'' (1920–1923)==
In 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in ''L'Esprit Nouveau''. At the Paris Salon d'Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the [[Ville Contemporaine]], a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' published his first and most influential book, "Towards an Architecture". He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations. commencing with "A grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. "Styles" are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately don't know how to see it yet," and his most famous maxim, "A house is a machine to live in."  Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture;   the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, airplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of [[zeppelin]] hangars.{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1923|pages=1–150}}

==L'Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925)==
[[File:L'Esprit Nouveau pavilion at the 1925 Paris International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts.jpg|thumb|The Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau (1925)]]
[[File:Plan Voisin model.jpg|thumb|The model of the Plan Voisin for the reconstruction of Paris displayed at the Pavilion of the Esprit Nouveau]]

An important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]], the event which later gave [[Art Deco]] its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with [[Cubism]] and formed the [[Purism]] movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' in 1920.  In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts:  "Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing."  To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, "is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house...Decorative art is antistandarizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass produced, objects truly of the style of today...my pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}

Le Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the [[Grand Palais]] in the center of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the center, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and with a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive, one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions.  The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious, and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=46}}

Besides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his "Plan Voisin"  his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favorable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighborhoods of Paris, and it later saw partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.

The Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote:  "Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the 'new'."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=49}}

==''The Decorative Art of Today'' (1925)==
In 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from "L'Esprit Nouveau" into a book, ''L'art décoratif d'aujourd'hui'' (''The Decorative Art of Today'').&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''L'Art décoratif d’aujourd'hui'', Paris, G. Crès, « L’Esprit nouveau », 1925. Réédition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.openedition.org/pupo/2422?lang=en Yannis Tsiomis, ''Le Corbusier, L’Art décoratif d’aujourd’hui et « la loi du ripolin »''], Presses universitaires de Paris Nanterre, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a spirited attack on the very idea of decorative art.  His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: "Modern decorative art has no decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''L'art décoratif d'aujourd'hui'', (originally 1925, Flammarion edition of 1996, ISBN+978-2-0812-2062-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts:  "The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion....The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony...The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable."{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|page=98}} He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] "Ornament and crime", and quoted Loos's dictum, "The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears."   He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called "Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne";  he condemned the "symphony of color" at the Exposition, and called it "the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine."   He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia.  "It takes energy today to affirm our western styles." He criticized the "precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves" in the new style. He attacked the "rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orient…Let's be done with it!"{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70–81}}

"Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?" Le Corbusier asked. "They are useful tools….Decor is not necessary. Art is necessary." He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only "objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution, and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style."  He described the future of decoration in these terms:  "The ideal is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign." He concluded by repeating "Modern decoration has no decoration".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier|1925|page=70–81}}

The book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts;  In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly colored wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style.  Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style.  The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, ''1925 Expo: Arts Deco'' was adapted in 1966 by the art historian [[Bevis Hillier]] for a catalog of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''. And thereafter the term "Art Deco" was commonly used as the name of the style.&lt;ref&gt;''Benton, Charlotte, Benton, Tim, Wood, Ghislaine, ''Art Déco dans le monde- 1910–39'', 2010, Renaissance du Livre, {{ISBN|9782507003906}}, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and in the Paris region in his "purist style." These included the [[Maison La Roche|Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret]] (1923–1925), which now houses the [[Fondation Le Corbusier]]; the [[Maison Guiette]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium (1926); a residence for [[Jacques Lipchitz]]; the [[Maison Cook]], and the [[Maison Planeix]].  In 1927, he was invited by the German [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near [[Stuttgart]], based on the Citrohan House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail one of his best-known essays, the ''Five Points of Architecture''.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=37}}

The following year he began the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928–1931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier's works, and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in [[Poissy]], in a landscape surrounded by trees and large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room)  are located under the house.  Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself.  The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden;  the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.

Villa Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' and the book ''[[Toward an Architecture|Vers une architecture]]'', which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by ''[[piloti]]s'', reinforced concrete stilts. These ''pilotis'', in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free façade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an [[free plan|open floor plan]], meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, and which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the [[roof garden]] to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for an architectural promenade through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial "ocean-liner" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.

Le Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in ''Précisions'' in 1930: "the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy.  It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique."{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}  The house had its problems;  the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults;  but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}

==League of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926–1930)==
[[File:Pessac Quartiers Modernes Frugès 004.jpg|thumb|Low-cost housing units built by Le Corbusier in the [[Quartiers Modernes Frugès]] in [[Pessac]] (1927)]]
Thanks to his passionate articles in L'Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were three-hundred thirty seven projects in competition.  It appeared that the Corbusier's project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the scenes maneuvering the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his own plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=116}}

In 1927, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry Frugès a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the [[Quartiers Modernes Frugès]], at [[Pessac]], near Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as "A little like a Balzac novel", a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for a residential housing;  a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace.  The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added color; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger Cité Radieuse projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/15/arts/architecture-view-le-corbusier-s-housing-project-flexible-enough-endure-ada.html|title=Architecture View; Le Corbusier's Housing Project-Flexible Enough to Endure; by Ada Louise Huxtable|author=|date=15 March 1981|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter==
In 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]]. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses;  Le Corbusier and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a château on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland 26–28 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Mies Van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Lluís Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic "Rational methods for groups of habitations".  A third meeting, on "The functional city", was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84–85}}

==Moscow Projects (1928–1934)==
{{Main article|Le Corbusier in the USSR}}
[[File:Centrosoyuz Moscow - Ak Sakharova view.jpg|thumb|Building of the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], headquarters of Soviet trade unions, Moscow (1928–34)]]

Le Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov's constructvist USSR pavilion, the only other truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov's invitation he traveled to Moscow, where found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews, and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the [[Tsentrosoyuz building|Tsentrosoyuz]], the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.

In 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new [[Palace of Soviets]] in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the Russian Orthodox cathedral of Moscow, demolished by Stalin's orders.  Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier's distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favor of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin.  The Palace was never built;  construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place;  and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=128}}

==Cité Universitaire, Immeuble Clarté and Cité de Refuge (1928–1933)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Between 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier's reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in [[Le Pradet]] (1929–1931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the [[Champs-Élysées]] 1929–1932, (later demolished). In 1929–1930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the [[Pont d'Austerlitz]]. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the [[Cité de Refuge]], on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.  He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the [[Cité Universitaire]] in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929–33).  He designed furniture to go with the building;  the main salon was decorated with a montage of black and white photographs of nature.  In 1948, he replaced this with a colorful mural he painted himself. In Geneva he built a glass-walled apartment building with forty-five units, the [[Immeuble Clarté]]. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 4 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the [[Bois de Boulogne]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=210}}  His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier, and can be visited.

==Ville Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and Cité Radieuse (1922–1939)==
{{See also|Unité d'habitation|Ville Radieuse}}
As the global [[Great Depression]] enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d'Automne in Paris.  His plan featured tall office towers with surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that "analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it."{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=98}} The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and to replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do.  The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: "The center of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is in reality a diamond mine...To abandon the center of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy." {{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=100}}

As no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he traveled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his own vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through [[Rio Janeiro]].

In 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city [[Algiers]], then part of France.  This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city.  This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion, but never came close to realization.

In 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them "much too small".&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, article on Man of the Year, 5 May 1961&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, ''Quand les Cathédrales etait blanc-  voyages au pays des timides'' (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=218}}

He wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s.  The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: ''Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!'' (1938) and ''The lyricism of modern times and urbanism'' (1939).

In 1928, the French Minister of Labour, [[Louis Loucheur]], won the passage of a French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project.  These units were {{convert|45|m2|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors.  The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the ''Ville Radieuse'' or "radiant city", in a new book which published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principle functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be clearly separated into their own neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.

==World War II and Reconstruction; [[Unité d'Habitation]] in Marseille (1939–1952)==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the War and the German occupation of France, Le Corbusier did his best to promote his architectural projects.  He moved to [[Vichy]] for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal [[Philippe Petain]] was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing ''Sur les Quatres routes'' (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942, Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|pages=244–246}}  He became for a time a technical adviser at [[Alexis Carrel]]'s eugenic foundation, he resigned from this position on 20 April 1944.&lt;ref name=Libe&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/2015/03/18/le-corbusier-plus-facho-que-fada_1223411|title=Le Corbusier plus facho que fada|work=Liberation|date= 18 March 2015|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=215}}

When the war ended, Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old, and he had not had a single project realized in ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of [[Saint-Dié]] and for [[La Rochelle]] were rejected. Still, he persisted; Le Corbusier finally found a willing partner in [[Raoul Dautry]], the new Minister of Reconstruction and Urbanism. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a "[[Unité d'habitation|Unité d'habitation de grandeur conforme]]", or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in [[Marseille]], which had been heavily damaged during the war.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=143}}

This was his first public commission, and was a major breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the ''Cité Radieuse'', and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, he proposed a giant reinforced concrete framework, into which modular apartments would be fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three stories high, and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other, and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.

The building was designed not just to be a residence, but to offer all the services needed for living. Every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building from one end of the building to the other. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theater performances was located in the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.

Le Corbusier wrote later that the Unité d'Habitation concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the [[Florence Charterhouse]] at [[Galluzzo]] in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place "for meditation and contemplation."  He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that "standardization led to perfection," and that "all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family."{{sfn|Journel|2015|page=139}}

The Unité d'Habitation marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|Légion d'Honneur]] in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=152–158}}

==Postwar Projects, United Nations Headquarters (1947–1952)==
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] designed by Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Wallace K. Harrison]] (1947–52)]]
Le Corbusier made another almost identical Unité d'Habitation in Rezé-les-Nantes in the [[Loire-Atlantique]] Department between 1948 and 1952, and three more over the following years, in [[Unité d'Habitation of Berlin|Berlin]], Briey-en-Forêt and [[Firminy]]; and he designed a factory for the company of Claude and Duval, in Saint-Dié in the [[Vosges]].

In early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]], which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, [[Oscar Niemeyer]] of Brazil, [[Howard Robertson (architect)|Howard Robertson]] from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], who was also architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.

Le Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier's plan, where offices, council chambers and General Assembly hall were in teethe a single block in the center of the site.  He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him on his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his own design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer's plan, but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the center of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer's plan to have a large plaza in the center. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier's suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archives.un.org/content/oscar-niemeyer-and-united-nations-headquarters-1947-1949 |title=Oscar Niemeyer and the United Nations Headquarters (1947–1949) |work=[[United Nations]] |date=December 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Le Corbusier was an avowed atheist. but he also had a strong belief in the ability of architecture in to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years he designed two important religious buildings; the [[Notre Dame du Haut|Chapelle of Notre-Dame-du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]] (1950–1955); and the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] (1953–1960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, Père Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.

Le Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: "In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort.  Some things are sacred, others aren't, whether they're religious or not."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Ronchamp", Hatje, Stuttgart, (1925), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in [[L'Arbresle]] in the Rhone Department (1953–1960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12th–13th century [[Le Thoronet Abbey]] in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns.  For the living space he used the same [[Modulor]] concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unité d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of {{convert|2.26|m|abbr=off}}; and width {{convert|1.83|m|abbr=off}}.{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|pages=154–55}}

Le Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill.  The three blocks of dormitories U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the center. The Convent has a flat roof, and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside.  The centerpiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his "Box of miracles."  Unlike the highly finished façade of the Unité d'Habitation, the façade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to [[Albert Camus]] in 1957: "I'm taken with the idea of a "box of miracles"....as the name indicates, it is a rectangual box made of concrete. It doesn't have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Albert Camus, 13 February 1957, FLC (Fondation Le Corbusier), E1-12-154)&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small band on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channeled from above.  The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through colored prisms and projected it onto the walls of sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the ""machine guns" of the sacristy and the "light cannons" of the crypt.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=184–185}}

In 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a Unité d'Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior. similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at [[Chandigarh]]. Windows high in the tower illuminate the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].{{Sfn|Jounret|2015|page=165}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Le Corbusier's largest and most ambitious project was the design of [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and invited to propose a project. An American architect, [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]], had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. (The city today has a population of more than a million.) Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]], and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.

Le Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; "It will be a city of trees," he wrote, "of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his wife Yvonne, 27 February 1951, FLC-R1-12-87. Cited by Journel, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and a transportation infrastructure.  In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}  From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, "Like a forced laborer." He dismissed the earlier American plan as "Faux-Moderne" and overly filled with parking spaces roads. His intent was to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}} His design made use of many of his favorite ideas; an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the [[Modulor]] to give a correct human scale to each element; and his favourite symbol, the open hand; ("the hand is open to give and to receive'.")  He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}

Le Corbusier's design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice.  Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, "It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that."&lt;ref&gt;letter to his mother, 19 November 1954, FLC-R2-103. Cited by Journlet, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol.  Along the walls were high concrete grills {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=off}} thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate.  The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colors, which better resisted the weather.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}

The Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958.  It is an enormous block {{convert|250|m|abbr=off}} long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level The ramp partly sculptural and partly practical; since there were no modern building cranes, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the Unité d'Habitation in Marseille; Concrete grill sunscreens over the windows, and a roof terrace.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=182}}

The most important building of the capitol complex was the [[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)|Palace of Assembly]] (1952–61), which faced the High Court at the other end of a five hundred meter esplanade, and faces a large reflecting pool. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly.  On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of color and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and large gateway decorated with enamel.  He wrote of this building, "A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete. It is magnificent and terrible; terrible meaning that there is nothing cold about it to the eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his brother Albert, 26 March 1961, FLC-R1-10-586, cited by Journel, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The 1950s and 1960s, were a difficult period for Le Corbusier's personal life;  his wife Yvonne died in 1957, and his mother, to whom he was closely attached, died in 1960. He remained active in a wide variety of fields; in 1955 he published ''Poéme de l'angle droits'', a portfolio of lithographs, published in the same collection as the book ''Jazz'' by [[Henri Matisse]]. In 1958 he collaborated with the composer [[Edgar Varèse]] on a work called ''Le [[Poème électronique]]'', a show of sound and light, for the Philips Pavilion at the International Exposition in Brussels. In 1960 he published a new book, ''L'Atelier de la recherché patiente'' ''The workshop of patient research''), simultaneously published in four languages.  He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture;  in 1959, a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared an historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect received this distinction.  In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de Sèvres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Légion d'honneur by Culture Minister [[André Malraux]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}

His later architectural work was extremely varied, and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952–1958, he designed a series of tiny vacation cabins, {{convert|2.26|x|2.26|x|2.6|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]. He built a similar cabin for himself, but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. In 1953–1957, he designed a residential building for Brazilian students for the Cité de la Université in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959, he built the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of [[Firminy]], where he had built his first housing project (1955–1958); and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction).  He also constructed three new ''Unités d'Habitation'', apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956–1958), the second in Briey-en-Forêt in the [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] Department; and the third (1959–1967) in Firminy.  In 1960–1963, he built his only building in the United States; the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=216}}

At the time of his death in 1965, several projects were on the drawing boards; the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006; a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962–65), and a hospital in Venice, (1961–1965) which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in Zürich for gallery owner [[Heidi Weber]] in 1962–1967. Now called the [[Centre Le Corbusier]], it is one of his last finished works.{{Sfn|Journel|2015|page=212}}

==Death==
[[File:Cabanon Le Corbusier.jpg|thumb|The holiday cabin where he spent his last days in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]]]]
Against his doctor's orders, on 27 August 1965, Le Corbusier went for a swim in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], France. His body was found by bathers and he was pronounced dead at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. It was assumed that he may have suffered a heart attack. His funeral took place in the courtyard of the [[Louvre]] Palace on 1 September 1965, under the direction of writer and thinker [[André Malraux]], who was at the time France's [[Minister of Culture]]. He was buried alongside his wife in the grave he had designated at [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].

Le Corbusier's death had a strong impact on the cultural and political world. Tributes came from around the world, even from some of Le Corbusier's strongest artistic critics. Painter [[Salvador Dalí]] recognised his importance and sent a floral tribute. United States President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] said, "His influence was universal and his works are invested with a permanent quality possessed by those of very few artists in our history." The [[Soviet Union]] added, "Modern architecture has lost its greatest master". While his funeral occurred in Paris, Japanese TV channels broadcast [[The National Museum of Western Art|his Museum]] in Tokyo in what was at the time a unique media homage.

His grave is in the cemetery above Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, between Menton and Monaco in southern France.

The Fondation Le Corbusier (FLC) functions as his official estate.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation: History|url=http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=19&amp;IrisObjectId=7778&amp;sysLanguage=en-en&amp;itemPos=1&amp;sysParentId=19&amp;clearQuery=1|publisher=Fondation Le Corbusier |accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US copyright representative for the Fondation Le Corbusier is the [[Artists Rights Society]].&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arsny.com/requested.html |title=Our Most Frequently Requested Prominent Artists |publisher=Artists Rights Society |year=2003 |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131000000/http://arsny.com/requested.html |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
===''The Five Points of a Modern Architecture''===
{{Main article|Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture}}
Le Corbusier defined the principles of his new architecture in ''Les cinq points de l'architecture moderne'', published in 1927, and co-authored by his cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]].  They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed of the late 1920s, most dramatically in the [[Villa Savoye]] (1928–1931)

The five points are:

* the '''Pilotis''', or pylon. The building is raised up on reinforced concrete pylons, which allows for free circulation on the ground level, and eliminates dark and damp parts of the house.
* The '''Roof Terrace'''. The sloping roof is replaced by a flat roof; the roof can be used as a garden, for promenades, sports or a swimming pool.
* The '''Free Plan'''. Load-bearing walls are replaced by a steel or reinforced concrete columns, so the interior can be freely designed, and interior walls can put anywhere, or left out entirely. The structure of the building is not visible from the outside.
* The '''Ribbon Window'''. Since the walls do not support the house, the windows can run the entire length of the house, so all rooms can get equal light.
* The '''Free Façade'''. Since the building is supported by columns in the interior, the façade can be much lighter and more open, or made entirely of glass. There is no need for lintels or other structure around the windows.

==="Architectural Promenade"===
The "Architectural Promenade" was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the [[Villa Savoye]]. In 1928, in ''Une Maison, un Palais'', he described it: "Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house ([[Villa Savoye]]) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing." The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Une maison – un palais'', G. Crès &amp; Cie (1928), pp. 70–78&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ville Radieuse'' and Urbanism===
In the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in ''[[Ville Radieuse|La Ville radieuse]]'' (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.&lt;ref name=fishman&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Fishman|title=Urban Utopias in the Twentieth Century: Ebenezer Howard, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Le Corbusier|isbn=0262560232 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=1982|page=231|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have read dark overtones into ''The Radiant City'': from the "astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings" that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only "frightening chaos and saddening monotony." He dreamed of "cleaning and purging" the city, bringing "a calm and powerful architecture"—referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier's designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly "destroyed" the city with them.&lt;ref name=dalrymple&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalrymple|first=Theodore|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian: Le Corbusier's baleful influence|work=City Journal|date=Autumn 2009 |volume=19 |issue=4|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient [[Scientific management|Taylorist]] and [[Fordism|Fordist]] strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, "the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient."&lt;ref name=evenson&gt;{{cite book|last=Evenson|first=Norma|title=Le Corbusier: The Machine and the Grand Design|publisher=George Braziller|location=New York|year=1969|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier "His ideas—his urban planning and his architecture—are viewed separately," Perelman noted, "whereas they are one and the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-books-claim-le-corbusier-fascist-289334|title=New Books Claim Le Corbusier Was a Fascist|last=Munro|first=Cait|date=17 April 2005|website=Artnet news|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''La Ville radieuse'', he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.{{sfn|Fishman|1982|page=228}}

Le Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unité and Fourier's [[phalanstery]].&lt;ref name=serenyi&gt;{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Serenyi|title=Le Corbusier, Fourier, and the Monastery of Ema|work=The Art Bulletin|volume=49|number=4|date=December 1967|page=282|doi=10.2307/3048487|jstor=3048487}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.

===Modulor===
{{Main article|Modulor}}

The [[Modulor]] was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and British or American system, since the Modulor was not attached to either one.

Le Corbusier explicitly used the [[golden ratio]] in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s "[[Vitruvian Man]]", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the [[golden ratio]], Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: "It's exactly the opposite (...) It's the mathematicization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/arts/design/le-corbusiers-architecture-and-his-politics-are-revisited.html|title=New York Times|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=12 July 2015|website=nytimes.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.

Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.&lt;ref name=padovan&gt;{{cite book|last=Padovan|first=Richard|title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture|date=2 November 1999|page=320|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-419-22780-6|quote=from Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.35: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned."{{sfn|padovan|1999|page=316}}

===Open Hand===
[[File:Open Hand Monument in Chandigarh.jpg|thumb|''[[Open Hand Monument]]'' in Chandigarh, India]]

The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of "peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive." The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a 26 meter high version in Chandigarh, India known as ''[[Open Hand Monument]]''.

==Furniture==
{{Main article|Le Corbusier's Furniture}}

Le Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans.  In his 1925 book ''L'Art Décoratif d'aujourd'hui'', he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: ''type-needs'', ''type-furniture'', and ''human-limb objects''. He defined human-limb objects as: "Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony".  He further declared, "Chairs are architecture, sofas are [[bourgeois]]",
[[File:LC4 Chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand 1927-28.jpg|thumb|Frame of an LC4 chair by Le Corbusier and Perriand (1927–28) at Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris]]
Le Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition.  In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design.  In 1928, he inviting the architect [[Charlotte Perriand]], to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, [[Pierre Jeanneret]], also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm [[Gebrüder Thonet]] had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of [[Marcel Breuer]] and the [[Bauhaus]], who in 1925, had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. [[Mies van der Rohe]] had begun making his own version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=382}}

The first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames; The [[Chaise Longue (Le Corbusier)|LC4]], Chaise Longue, (1927–28), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the ''Fauteuil Grand Confort'' (LC3) (1928–29), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the ''Fauteuil à dossier basculant'' (LC4) (1928–29), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with a cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the ''Maison la Roche'' in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier's 1929 ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' installation, 'Equipment for the Home'. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous. {{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=383}}

==Politics==
The political views of Le Corbusier were rather vague and variable over time. In the 1920s, he briefly wrote articles about urbanism for the [[syndicalist]] journals ''Plans'', ''Prélude'' and ''L'homme reel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brott|first=Simone|date=2013|title=In the Shadow of the Enlightenment Le Corbusier, Le Faisceau and Georges Valois|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand|volume=2|issue=30|pages=777–789|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/63644/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to [[Le Faisceau]], a short-lived French fascist party led by [[Georges Valois]]. Valois later became an anti-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;After becoming a wartime [[french resistance|resistance]] fighter, Georges Valois was arrested and died in a Nazi concentration camp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Le Corbusier knew another former member of Faisceau, [[Hubert Lagardelle]], a former labor leader and [[syndicalist]] who had become disaffected with the political left. In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism.

Le Corbusier has been accused of anti-semitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, prior to a referendum held by the Vichy government: "The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country". He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: "the civilized live like rats in holes", while "the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being."&lt;ref name=celik&gt;{{cite book|last=Celik|first=Zeynep|title=Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|date=28 July 1997|page=4|isbn=978-0520204577|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Antliff|first=Mark |title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France, 1909–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADTdniFtnuwC|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-9047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Few other 20th-century architects were praised, or criticized, as much as Le Corbusier. In his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister [[André Malraux]] declared, "Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long."&lt;ref&gt;André Malraux, funeral oration for Le Corbusier, 1 September 1965, cited in Journal (2015), p. 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Later criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas of urban planning.  In 1998 the architectural historian Witold Rybczynski wrote in ''Time'' magazine: &lt;blockquote&gt; "He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City.  Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic.  Wherever it was tried- in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers- it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan, socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighborhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy."&lt;ref&gt;Rybcznski, Witold, ''Time'' magazine, 8 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[:Category:Historians of technology|Technological historian]] and architecture critic [[Lewis Mumford]] wrote in ''Yesterday's City of Tomorrow'' that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier's skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By "mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had, in fact, produced a sterile hybrid."

The public housing projects influenced by his ideas have  been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community's development. One of his most influential detractors has been [[Jane Jacobs]], who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier's urban design theories in her seminal work ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.

For some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier's was the model for a fascist state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Le Corbusier was concerned by problems he saw in industrial cities at the turn of the 20th century. He thought that industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better living conditions and a better society through housing. [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s ''Garden Cities of Tomorrow'' heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Le Corbusier revolutionized [[urban planning]], and was a founding member of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM).  One of the first to realize how the [[automobile]] would change human society, Le Corbusier conceived the city of the future with large apartment buildings isolated in a park-like setting on [[piloti]]s. Le Corbusier's plans were adopted by builders of public housing in Europe and the United States. In Great Britain urban planners turned to Le Corbusier's "Cities in the Sky" as a cheaper method of building public housing from the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pash-living.co.uk/blog/contemporary-designers/le-corbusier-enfant-terrible-of-modernist-architecture.html|title=Le Corbusier – enfant terrible of Modernist Architecture? / Pash Living Blog|author=|date=|work=pash-living.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation of the buildings. The large spartan structures in cities, but not 'of' cities, have been criticized for being boring and unfriendly to pedestrians.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Several of the many architects who worked for Le Corbusier in his studio became prominent, including painter-architect [[Nadir Afonso]], who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory. [[Lúcio Costa]]'s [[urban planning|city plan]] of [[Brasília]] and the industrial city of [[Zlín]] planned by [[František Lydie Gahura]] in the Czech Republic are based on his ideas.  Le Corbusier's thinking had profound effects on city planning and architecture in the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivist]] era.

Le Corbusier harmonized and lent credence to the idea of space as a set of destinations between which mankind moved continuously.  He gave credibility to the automobile as transporter, and to freeways in urban spaces. His philosophies were useful to urban real estate developers in the American post-World War II period because they justified and lent intellectual support to the desire to raze traditional urban space for high density, high profit urban concentration. The freeways connected this new urbanism to low density, low cost, highly profitable suburban locales available to be developed for middle class single-family housing.

Missing from this scheme of movement was connectivity between isolated urban villages created for lower-middle and working classes, and the destination points in Le Corbusier's plan: suburban and rural areas, and urban commercial centers. The freeways as designed traveled over, at, or beneath grade levels of the living spaces of the urban poor, for example the [[Cabrini–Green]] housing project in Chicago. Such projects with no freeway exit ramps, cut off by freeway rights-of-way, became isolated from jobs and services concentrated at Le Corbusier's nodal transportation end points. As jobs migrated to the suburbs, urban village dwellers found themselves without freeway access points in their communities or public mass transit that could economically reach suburban job centers. Late in the post-War period, suburban job centers found labor shortages to be such a critical problem that they sponsored urban-to-suburban shuttle bus services to fill vacant working class and lower-middle class jobs, which did not typically pay enough to afford car ownership.
&lt;!--NOTE: highly editorialized presentation ("prophet who could do no wrong", "incompetence", "Machiavellian", "absurd") -- use neutral tone and include citations or quotes if appropriate.. Le Corbusier deliberately created a myth about himself and was revered in his lifetime, and after death, by a generation of followers who believed Le Corbusier was a prophet who could do no wrong. But in the 1950s the first doubts began to appear, notably in some essays by his greatest admirers such as [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and [[Colin Rowe]], who denounced as catastrophic his ideas on the city. Later critics revealed his technical incompetence as an architect. In his book ''Armée du Salut'', Brian Brace Taylor went into great detail about Le Corbusier's Machiavellian activities to create this commission for himself, his many ill-judged design decisions about building technologies, and the sometimes absurd solutions he then proposed. --&gt;
&lt;!--NOTE: We cannot say "more recently" -- that's [[WP:DATED]]. We cannot says "there has been much discussion" -- we have to say WHO discussed this and GIVE A CITATION.   More recently still there has been much discussion about Le Corbusier's right-wing politics, and his open flirtation with Fascism in the 1930s, when he tried to persuade Benito Mussolini to commission him to design a new capital city for Ethiopia after Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935 using nerve-gas, in breach of League of Nations rules.--&gt;

Le Corbusier influenced architects and urbanists worldwide. In the United States, [[Shadrach Woods]]; in Spain, [[Francisco Javier Sáenz de Oiza]]; in Brazil, [[Oscar Niemeyer]]; In [[Mexico]], [[Mario Pani Darqui]]; in [[Chile]], [[Roberto Matta]]; in [[Argentina]], [[Antoni Bonet i Castellana]] (a Catalan exile), Juan Kurchan, Jorge Ferrari Hardoy, [[Amancio Williams]], and [[Clorindo Testa]] in his first era; in [[Uruguay]], the professors Justino Serralta and Carlos Gómez Gavazzo; in [[Colombia]], Germán Samper Gnecco, [[Rogelio Salmona]], and Dicken Castro; in [[Peru]], Abel Hurtado and José Carlos Ortecho.

Le Corbusier's design was cited as an inspiration for [[Kanye West|Kanye West's]] album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Capps, Kriston (12 June 2013) [https://web.archive.org/web/20150323091338/http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/kanye-west-cites-le-corbusier-lamp-as-inspiration_o Kanye West Cites Le Corbusier Lamp as Inspiration]. architectmagazine.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fondation Le Corbusier==
[[File:Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret), reproduced in Život 2 (1922).jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier, work reproduced in Život 2 (1922)]]
The [[Fondation Le Corbusier]] is a private foundation and archive honoring the work of Le Corbusier. It operates Maison La Roche, a museum located in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]] at 8–10, square du Dr Blanche, Paris, France, which is open daily except Sunday.

The foundation was established in 1968. It now owns Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (which form the foundation's headquarters), as well as the apartment occupied by Le Corbusier from 1933 to 1965 at rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris 16e, and the "Small House" he built for his parents in [[Corseaux]] on the shores of [[Lac Leman]] (1924).

Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (1923–24), also known as the La Roche-Jeanneret house, is a pair of semi-detached houses that was Le Corbusier's third commission in Paris. They are laid out at right angles to each other, with iron, concrete, and blank, white façades setting off a curved two-story gallery space. Maison La Roche is now a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with [[Pierre Jeanneret]] from 1922 to 1940), as well as about 450 of his paintings, about 30 enamels, about 200 other works on paper, and a sizable collection of written and photographic archives. It describes itself as the world's largest collection of Le Corbusier drawings, studies, and plans.&lt;ref name=foundation/&gt;&lt;ref name=parisinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Musée: Fondation Le Corbusier – Maison La Roche|url=http://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71409/Fondation-Le-Corbusier-Maison-La-Roche|publisher=Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''McDaniel College Budapest''' is the European Campus of [[McDaniel College]], an accredited, private selective College of the [[Liberal Arts]] and Sciences, located in [[Westminster, Maryland]], United States.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/education/bal-hl-mcdaniel-story.html Baltimore Sun School Profile: McDaniel]&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a standard American four-year undergraduate program in [[Hungary]], leading to an American Bachelor of Arts degree. Students have the option to complete the upper two years of study at the main campus of the college in the United States. In addition, students enrolled in Budapest earn credits that are fully transferable to any other American college or university.&lt;ref name="american degree"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/the-college/american-degree/ McDaniel College Budapest/The College/American Degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Campus of McDaniel College in [[Budapest]] is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the accrediting agency for McDaniel College. McDaniel College Budapest is registered in Hungary as a foreign institution of higher education by the permission of the Hungarian Minister of Education.

== History ==
The Budapest campus of McDaniel College was established in 1993 and the first academic year started in September 1994. Originally it was placed in a modern educational centre on the Buda side and moved to its recent location in 2001, a restored late 19th century school building.&lt;ref name="history budapest"&gt;[http://www.mcdaniel.edu/information/about/partners/mcdaniel-europe McDaniel College/Information/About/History]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its founding, more than 300 students who began their studies in Budapest have graduated from McDaniel College. In addition, several hundred students from McDaniel College in Westminster as well as other colleges have studied abroad there. 

In 2017 the campus was at the center of a political controversy in Hungary that could have led to its closure. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-mcdaniel-hungary-20170629-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis was eventually resolved and the satellite campus was left open.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-maryland-hungry-agreement-20170714-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McDaniel College Building.jpg|(default)px|thumbnail|left|The building of the McDaniel College Budapest.]]

== The Budapest Campus ==
The [[Budapest]] campus is located in a restored school building adjacent to the Veterinary College of [[Szent István University]]. Facilities include a computer lab, classrooms, a board room, gymnasium and cafeteria. The average class size is eight students.&lt;ref name="mcdaniel"&gt;[http://www.mcdaniel.hu McDaniel College Budapest]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McDaniel Graduation.jpg|thumb|right|McDaniel Graduation]]

== Majors ==
McDaniel College Budapest offers a number of major programs, from art history, business, and communication, to political science and psychology. Students can enter the program as undecided, sample a number of different courses, and then choose their major. In addition, if students decide they would like to pursue a major different than the one they started, they are free to change majors—all of the credits earned remain on a student’s record, and no time is lost for graduation. Some of the majors can be pursued in combined dual major programs—art-communication, business-economics—that combine features of more than one major program in order to give students more options after graduation.&lt;ref name="majors"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/majors/overview/ McDaniel College Budapest/Majors]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study Abroad ==

The Budapest Campus also serves as a study abroad centre. Students from the home campus – usually accompanied by a professor teaching his/her courses – have been arriving for a semester abroad in Budapest since 1998.

'''Monrepos''' is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Research institute|research centre]] and a [[museum]] for the human [[Sociocultural evolution|behavioural evolution]] located at Schloss Monrepos in [[Neuwied]]. On the one hand, the development of our modern human [[Ethology|behaviour]] in the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] is studied at the research centre and on the other hand, the findings of these studies are conveyed to the public in the museum. Monrepos is one of the leading institutions for the research of early human history.

==Structure==
Monrepos is part of the [[Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz)]] a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]].
Another provider for Monrepos is the [[Prinz Maximilian zu Wied-Stiftung]], supported by the [[Förderkreis Altsteinzeit e.V.]], which assists with research, teaching and the conveying of research results.
Monrepos collaborates closely with the Institute for Prehistoric [[Archaeology]] of the Johannes Gutenberg [[University of Mainz]].

==Location==
Monrepos ([[French language|French:]] "my rest") is a historical [[recreation area]] located on the hills above the town of [[Neuwied]] in a transition zone between the [[Middle Rhine]] valley and the [[Westerwald]]. In the extensive forests of Monrepos several long-distance hiking trails cross such as the [[Rheinsteig]], the [[Rheinhöhenweg Trail]], and a trail along the remains of the [[Limes]]. The previous summer residence of the princes of [[Wied-Neuwied|Wied]] is today the centre of an ensemble of historic buildings from the 18th and 19th century.

==History==
[[File:Monrepos 2013.JPG|thumb|Monrepos after finished reconstruction works in 2013]]
Until 2012, Monrepos had been named "research unit Palaeolithic“ (Forschungsbereich Altsteinzeit) of the RGZM and "museum for Ice Age archaeology“ (Museum für die Archäologie des Eiszeitalters). The discovery and study of famous Palaeolithic sites in the Neuwied Basin such as [[Niederbieber (Palaeolithic site)|Niederbieber]], Gönnersdorf, and [[Bad Breisig (Final Palaeolithic site)|Bad Breisig]] led to the foundation of the research unit Palaeolithic of the RGZM in 1984. Along with the museum for Ice Age archaeology the research unit has been located on Schloss Monrepos since 1988. The house was built in 1909. It was originally named "Waldheim" (forest home) and served as home for the princely widows. In 1986, [[Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Wied|Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Wied]] brought the Schloss into the foundation [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied|Prince Maximilian of Wied]] &lt;ref&gt;Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser, Olaf Jöris (Hrsg.): 600.000 Jahre Menschheitsgeschichte in der Mitte Europas. Begleitbuch zur Ausstellung im Museum für die Archäologie des Eiszeitalters, Schloss Monrepos, Neuwied. Verlag des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums, Mainz 2006, {{ISBN|9783795419684}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides functioning as the head of the Forschungsbereich Altsteinzeit, Gerhard Bosinski, the founder of the institute, was also professor at the institute of prehistoric archaeology of the [[University of Cologne]]. Since 2003 Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser has been the head of Monrepos and she is also the professor at the institute of prehistory and early history of the [[University of Mainz]].

2005 the exhibition of the museum for Ice Age archaeology was modernised but in 2011 the museum had to be closed temporary due to extensive renovation and reconstruction works of Schloss Monrepos. The museum is re-organised currently and will be re-opened with a new concept, probably in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719075736/http://web.rgzm.de/index.php?id=242 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal and geographic frame of research==
The research at Monrepos encompasses the early human history of the Old World from its beginnings to the invention and spread of agriculture and stock farming. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the studies focused particularly on the rich archaeological sites from the Neuwied basin and its vicinity.:&lt;ref&gt;M. Baales 2005, Archäologie des Eiszeitalters. Archäologie an Mittelrhein und Mosel 16, Koblenz 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Lower Palaeolithic site at Miesenheim is approximately 600,000 years old and among the oldest settlement sites in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;E. Turner, Miesenheim I. Excavations at a Lower Palaeolithic Site in the Central Rhineland of Germany; with contributions by F. Bittmann, W. Boenigk, M. Frechen, D. Muller and U. Schweitzer (2000) {{ISBN|978-3-88467-049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sites in former volcano craters in the eastern [[Eifel]] such as the Schweinskopf, the "Wannen“ volcano group, the Tönchesberg, and the Plaidter Hummerich are worldwide the only settlement sites of this type inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s &lt;ref&gt;S. Gaudzinski-Windheuser, O. Jöris (Hrsg.), 600.000 Jahre Menschheitsgeschichte in der Mitte Europas. Verlag des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums Mainz, Mainz 2006, 18-26&lt;/ref&gt; Important sites of the [[Magdalenian]] were excavated and studied at [[Andernach]]-Martinsberg and Gönnersdorf. Many sites studied at Monrepos such as [[Niederbieber (Palaeolithic site)|Niederbieber]], [[Bad Breisig (Final Palaeolithic site)|Bad Breisig]], Kettig, Urbar, and the upper horizons of Andernach-Martinsberg were attributed to the so-called [[Federmesser culture|Federmesser groups]] which are a similar behavioural development as the French [[Azilian]] in the late Ice Age. Their remarkably good preservation due to the cover by tephras of the [[Laacher See]] volcanic eruption made exceptional insights into the land-use of this period possible &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baales | first1 = M. | last2 = Street | first2 = M. | year = 1996 | title = Hunter-gatherer behavior in a changing late glacial landscape: Allerød archaeology in the Central Rhineland, Germany | url = | journal = Journal of Anthropological Research | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 281–316 | doi=10.1086/jar.52.3.3630086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Street | first1 = M. | last2 = Gelhausen | first2 = F. | last3 = Grimm | first3 = S. | last4 = Moseler | first4 = F. | last5 = Niven | first5 = L. | last6 = Sensburg | first6 = M. | last7 = Turner | first7 = E. | last8 = Wenzel | first8 = St. | last9 = Jöris | first9 = O. | year = 2006 | title = L'occupation du bassin de Neuwied (Rhénanie centrale, Allemagne) par les Magdaléniens et les groupes à Federmesser (aziliens) | url = | journal = Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française | volume = 103 | issue = 4| pages = 753–780 | doi=10.3406/bspf.2006.13504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Gaudzinski-Windheuser, O. Jöris (Hrsg.), 600.000 Jahre Menschheitsgeschichte in der Mitte Europas. Verlag des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums Mainz, Mainz 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the late 1990s the geographic frame of research at Monrepos has been broadened. In international cooperation projects sites such as [[Ubeidiya]] and [[Bnot Ya'akov Bridge|Gesher Benot Ya'aqov]] in Israel have been examined.&lt;ref&gt;S. Gaudzinski-Windheuser, Subsistenzstrategien frühpleistozäner Hominiden in Eurasien.

Archäologische Funde und Befunde des Liegenden Fundkomplexes im Kontext der frühen Menschheitsentwicklung (2008); {{ISBN|978-3-88467-121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current excavation projects are conducted in Romania where the oldest sites in Eastern Europe are recovered and at the [[Taforalt (Grotte des Pigeons)|Taforalt]] in Morocco where the behaviour of early [[Anatomically modern humans|modern humans]] is studied and the oldest pieces of human adornment were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bouzouggar | first1 = A. | last2 = Barton | first2 = N. | last3 = Vanhaeren | first3 = M. | last4 = Collcutt | first4 = S. | last5 = Higham | first5 = T. | last6 = Hodge | first6 = E. | last7 = Parfitt | first7 = S. | last8 = Rhodes | first8 = E. | last9 = Schwenninger | first9 = J.-L. | last10 = Stringer | first10 = C. | last11 = Turner | first11 = E. | last12 = Ward | first12 = S. | last13 = Moutmir | first13 = A. | last14 = Stambouli | first14 = A. | year = 2007 | title = 82,000-year old shell beads from North Africa and implications for the origin of modern human behaviour | journal = PNAS | volume = 104 | issue = 24| pages = 9964–9969 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0703877104 | pmid=17548808 | pmc=1891266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holst,Hazelnut economy of early Holocene hunter gatherers: a case study from Mesolithic Duvensee, northern Germany" ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' 2010; 37, 2871-2880&lt;/ref&gt; or Bedburg-Königshoven &lt;ref&gt;M.

Roe (eds.), The Late Glacial in north-west Europe: Human adaptation and environmental change at the end of the Pleistocene (London 1991) 256-270.&lt;/ref&gt; are chronologically the youngest studies performed at Monrepos.

==Guiding principle of research==
The research and the conveying of its results aim at understanding the essential behavioural characteristics of modern humans and the development of these characteristics during the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods from 2.5 Million years to approximately 7,500 years ago.

Monrepos is among the few archaeological research institutions which are guided by an own principle of research. This principle defines the objectives of research and the strategy necessary to achieve these objectives. The principle of research is based on an integrative, holistic understanding of science. Thereby, it merges the traditional dichotomy of [[Social Science|Social]] and [[Natural Science]]s. Different sources of evidence and variable contexts are connected diachronically in the principle of research. They are pooled in three research units: "time slices“, "strategies”and “social organisation”. "Time slices“ relates to the group of questions of where, when, and in which frame of references human behaviour evolved. The research units "strategies“ and "social organisation“ try to identify survival strategies and behavioural patterns as well as their social embedding.
The research principle is oriented diachronically and perspectively. That means that the research is systematically looking at different time periods and levels of resolution. Large frames allow for an orientation, whereas more detailed frames allow for a punctually high resolution.
By the use of a synthetic comparison of the three research units and the comparative transfer between the different time periods and levels of resolution, it is possible to reconstruct the development of human behaviour in the Palaeolithic and Mesolihic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.rgzm.de/23.html?&amp;L=1 |title=RGZM: Museums |website=Web.rgzm.de |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research foci==
[[File:Sculpture of Gönnersdorf venus figurine.JPG|thumb|upright|Sculpture of a Gönnersdorf venus figurine]]
Particularly relevant research foci in the study of the behavioural development of early humans and hominids are the processes relating to subsistence patterns, mobility, settlement behaviour, and land-use patterns of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.rgzm.de/205.html?&amp;L=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921115739/http://web.rgzm.de/205.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calibration and Dating programmes===
Since the mid-1980s, Monrepos has been involved in the construction and improvement of an absolute chronology of the European Palaeolithic. In this process, comprehensive dating programs of the Upper Palaeolithic were initiated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jöris | first1 = O. | last2 = Street | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = At the End of the 14C-Scale: Scenarios at the Transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic | url = | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 5| pages = 782–802 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.04.002 | pmid=18930513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovative [[Calibrated years|methods of radiocarbon calibration]] were developed by Olaf Jöris (Monrepos) and Bernhard Weninger (University of Cologne). These methods became constantly better and made precise calibration of increasingly older radiocarbon dates possible by the connection with high-resolution climate data sets. The calibration program CalPal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calpal.de |title=Ausstattung - Archäologisches Forschungszentrum und Museum für menschliche Verhaltensevolution |website=Calpal.de |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on this approach and was first created by Olaf Jöris and Bernhard Weninger in the mid-1990s.

===Subsistence===
Hunting of big game is an important ability in the development of early hominid subsistence. Monrepos has set an international standard in the study of hominid hunting by the use of an elaborated set of archaeozoological methods and a diachronic perspective. For instance, big game hunting by early hominids and its evolutionary relevance was demonstrated for the first time in the archaeological record by a member of Monrepos &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaudzinski | first1 = S | year = 1995 | title = Wallertheim Revisited: a Re-analysis of the Fauna from the Middle Palaeolithic Site of Wallertheim (Rheinhessen/Germany) | doi = 10.1016/S0305-4403(95)80162-6 | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 51–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaudzinski | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Subsistence patterns of Early Pleistocene hominids in the Levant - Taphonomic evidence from the 'Ubeidiya Formation (Israel) | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 65–75 | doi = 10.1016/S0305-4403(03)00100-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Role of Early Humans in the Accumulation of European Lower and Middle Palaeolithic Bone Assemblages. Ergebnisse eines Kolloquiums (1999) {{ISBN|978-3-88467-044-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaudzinski-Windheuser | first1 = S. | last2 = Kindler | first2 = L. | year = 2012 | title = The evolution of hominin food resource exploitation in Pleistocene Europe: Recent studies in Zooarchaeology | url = | journal = Quaternary International | volume = 252 | issue = | pages = 1–202 | doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaudzinski-Windheuser | first1 = S. | last2 = Kindler | first2 = L. | year = 2012 | title = Research Perspectives for the study of Neandertal subsistence strategies based on the analysis of archaeozoological assemblages | url = | journal = Quaternary International | volume = 247 | issue = | pages = 59–68| doi = 10.1016/j.quaint.2010.11.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the research mainly focuses on [[Neanderthal]]s' hunting behaviour in the context of land use. This behaviour is examined particularly in cave sites such as the [[Balve cave]] or the Moravian [[Kůlna Cave]] and at the largest Middle Palaeolithic open air site in [[Geisel valley|Neumark-Nord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lda-lsa.de/en/state_museum_of_prehistory/permanent_exhibition/paleolithic_period/neumark_nord/ |title=Neumark-Nord - Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie Sachsen-Anhalt / Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte Halle |website=Lda-lsa.de |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further research projects relating to subsistence concentrate on the late [[Ice age]] and the early [[Holocene]]. Studies from concentrations at the Mesolithic site of [[Duvensee archaeological sites|Duvensee]] were the first to show the significance of vegetation resources (hazelnuts) in the early Holocene subsistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holst | first1 = D | year = 2010 | title = Hazelnut economy of early Holocene hunter-gatherers: a case study from Mesolithic Duvensee, northern Germany | url = | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 37 | issue = 11| pages = 2871–2880 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.06.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement behaviour===
The investigation and analysis of the evolution of settlement and land use behaviour represent another research focus at MONREPOS. Since its inception the systematic analysis of extensively-excavated open-air sites and settlement structures has always been a focus at MONREPOS. Current research involves the application of GIS supported geo-statistical approaches that allow for quantitative and verifiable analyses of settlement dynamics.

Current projects involve the sites of [[Geisel valley|Neumark-Nord]], [[Bilzingsleben (Paleolithic site)|Bilizingsleben]], [[Niederbieber (Palaeolithic site)|Niederbieber]], [[Breitenbach (archaeological site)|Breitenbach]], Magdalena-cave, Gönnersdorf, Andernach, Oelknitz and [[Duvensee archaeological sites|Duvensee]].&lt;ref&gt;Tagungsheft der 53.

Jahrestagung der Hugo Obermaier Gesellschaft in Leipzig 2010 http://www.obermaier-gesellschaft.de/2011_herne/Tagungsheft_11-04-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
The analytic-integrative approach to Palaeolithic art is another defining feature of work at Monrepos that was developed coinciding with the discovery and investigation of the famous engraved Magdalenian slate plaquettes from Gönnersdorf through Gerhard Bosinski. It was thus possible to conclusively demonstrate that art was a major component in the Palaeolithic of Central Europe and “type Gönnersdorf” figurines represent a major category in art studies.&lt;ref&gt;Die Kunst der Eiszeit in Deutschland und in der Schweiz. Habelt, Bonn 1982, {{ISBN|3-7749-1832-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The particular manner in which art is studied  at MONREPOS is characterised by a contextualised approach that aims to understand the principles and rules behind patterns in design and production. The plaquettes are currently part of a detailed 3-D analysis.&lt;ref&gt;A. Güth: ''New scientific findings confirming "The Oldest Representation of Childbirth".

===Experimental archaeology===
Since the 1980s controlled [[Experimental archaeology|experiments]] relating to hunting techniques, processing of carcasses, and taphonomy have been conducted in Monrepos under laboratory conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptb.de/de/aktuelles/archiv/presseinfos/pi2012/pitext/pi120709.html |title=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt |website=Ptb.de |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Education and promotion of young scientists==
Members of Monrepos regularly give lectures and seminars about the evolution of human behaviour in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic at the Institute of Prehistory and Early History at the university of Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vfg-mz.de/ |title=Institut für Vor- und Frühgeschichte |website=Vfg-mz.de |date=2011-12-14 |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological education is supplemented by internships, excursions, und field schools allowing for direct participation in science and conveying. Junior scientists are promoted individually by a mentoring programme and also financially by scholarships such as the [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied|Prince Maximilian of Wied]]-scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Ausbildung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses.

==Museum==
[[File:Mammoth Max.JPG|thumb|upright|The mammoth sculpture 'Max' outside Monrepos]]
The permanent exhibition presents the results of archaeological research into the origins and early evolution of human behaviour. Due to the renovations the museum was closed in 2010. It is expected to re-open with a new concept and exhibit at the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071102061940/http://web.rgzm.de/37.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conveying==
In addition to the Museum and its teaching involvement at the Institute for Pre- and Early History at Mainz University, Monrepos has also developed other formats of public outreach. The [[Rudolf Virchow lecture]] is one of the most longstanding public archaeological lectures in Germany. This annual event honours the accomplishments of an eminent researcher in the field of Palaeolithic archaeology, who presents the results of his or her research in a popular lecture held at Neuwied castle. The “SteinZeitReise” (“Trip to the Stone Age”) is an annual „hands on „event held on [[Pentecost]] Sunday at Monrepos. Members of staff demonstrate various aspects of Palaeolithic life and the public is invited to try out flint-knapping, atlatl-throwing and archaeological excavation.&lt;ref&gt;“Steinzeitreise: Pfingstsonntag in Schloss Monrepos“.

==Collections==
===Osteological collection===
The comparative collection is primarily made up of animal specimens, which are complemented by a small inventory of human remains. The faunal inventory consists primarily of European ice age faunas and/or their extant representatives. In addition to large mammals ([[mammoth]], [[rhino]], [[bison]] [[horse]]), the collection also includes remains of extant smaller mammals and [[birds]]. The [[Taphonomy|taphonomic collection]] includes modern and archaeological materials that exhibit various [[Pathology|pathologies]] and show signatures of specific taphonomic processes and agents, as well as experimentally modified bone.

===Lithic raw material collection===
The raw material collection includes samples of [[flint]], which served as raw material for the production of artefacts during the Middle- and Upper Palaeolithic. The collection currently houses approximately 230 samples from various locales, with the majority of samples coming from locales in the [[Rhineland]].

===Collection of archaeological artefacts===
The artefact collection is made up of approximately 4500 artefacts from the Middle- and Upper Palaeolithic. Specimens include both authentic pieces as well as copies made by restoration department at the RGZM. An important component of the artefact collection is the Venus statue archive. With over 50 specimens the venus collection is the biggest of its kind world-wide. It includes originals and copies of all female figurines known from the Mid-Upper Palaeolithic.&lt;ref&gt;S. Wolf 2009. Eine neue Venusstatuette vom jungpaläolithischen Fundplatz Dolní Vĕstonice (Mähren). Jahrbuch des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums 2008., Mainz 2011, 1-42&lt;/ref&gt; The artefact collection also houses engraved schist plaquettes from Gönnersdorf and figurines from the early and late Upper Palaeolithic.

==Library==
The library at Monrepos contains more than 70,000 titles on Palaeolithic and Mesolithic archaeology. It is complemented by a comprehensive collection of special editions and an electronic database of periodicals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">In 1938, [[Henry Murray]]  developed a system of [[needs]] as part of his theory of personality, which he called 'personology.' He argued that everyone had a set of universal basic needs, with individual differences on these needs leading to the uniqueness of personality through varying dispositional tendencies for each need; in other words, specific needs are more important to some than to others. In his theory, Murray argues that needs and presses (another component of the theory) acted together to create an internal state of disequilibrium; the individual is then driven to engage in some sort of behavior to reduce the tension. Murray believed that the study of personality should look at the entire person over the course of their lifespan – that people needed to be analysed in terms of complex interactions and whole systems rather than individual parts – and an individual's behaviors, needs and their levels, etc. are all part of that understanding. Murray also argued that there was a biological (specifically neurological) basis for personality and behavior&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Explorations in Personality|date=1938|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flett|first1=Gordon L|title=Personality theory and research: an international perspective|date=2014|publisher=Wiley Global Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Needs ==

Murray defines a need as a drive that has the potential to prompt a behavior from the person. For example, the need for affiliation may drive a person to join social organization. Needs are often influenced by environmental stimulus or 'presses,' another component of Murray's theory.

Individual differences in levels of needs lead to the uniqueness of a person's personality; in other words, specific needs may be more important to some than to others. According to Murray, human needs are psychogenic in origin, function on an unconscious level, and can play a major role in defining personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frustration of these psychogenic needs plays a central role in the origin of [[psychological pain]].&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Shneidman ES | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Suicidal Mind | edition = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | year = 1996 | pages =  | isbn = | chapter =  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4pf7-dca0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+suicidal+mind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIGjSw106n&amp;sig=A2b8DvJxC9gwoHPAJiiiEFaqdeU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N74RUMWMDKjmiwKX8oHIAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20suicidal%20mind&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that these needs could be measured by projective tests, specifically one he had developed, known as the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT). Unlike [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], Murray's needs are not based on a hierarchy; individuals may be high in one and low in the other, and multiple needs may be affected by a single action.

Murray differentiated each need as unique, but recognized commonalities among them, codified at least partially in his categorization system. Behaviors may meet more than one need:  for instance, performing a difficult task for your fraternity may meet the needs of both achievement and affiliation. While each need is important in and of itself, he also believed that needs can support or conflict with one another, and can be interrelated. He coined the term 'subsidation of needs' to describe when two or more needs are combined in order to satisfy a more powerful need, and the term 'fusion of needs' to describe when a single action satisfies more than one need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the need for dominance may conflict the need with affiliation when overly controlling behavior drives away family, romantic partners, and friends. A need may be a purely internal state, but more often it is evoked by a press.

== Presses ==

Murray argued environmental factors play a role in how psychogenic needs are displayed in behavior. He used the term 'presses' to describe external influences on motivation that may influence an individual's level of a need as well as their subsequent behavior. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 'press' of an object is what it can do for or to the subject.

Any stimulus with the potential to affect the individual in a positive or negative way is referred to as 'pressive,' and everything else is referred to as inert. 'Pressive Perception' is how the subject interprets a press as either a positive or negative stimulus. 'Pressive Apperception' refers to the subjects anticipation that the stimulus will be perceived as either positive or negative. Murray notes that both Pressive Perception and Apperception are largely unconscious. Presses may have positive or negative effects, may be mobile (affecting the subject if they do nothing) or immobile (affecting the subject if they take an action), and may be an alpha press (real effects) or a beta press (merely perceived).

== Needs by Category ==
Murray divides needs into several binary categories; Manifest (Overt) or Latent (Covert), Conscious or Unconscious, and Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Manifest (sometimes called overt) needs are those that are allowed to be directly expressed, while latent (sometimes called covert) needs are not outwardly acted on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Paul|last2=Culbertson|first2=Amy L.|last3=Magnusson|first3=Paul|title=Human Needs: A Literature Review and Cognitive Life Span Model|journal=Navy Personnel Research and Development Center|date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conscious needs as those that a subject can self-report, while Unconscious needs are all others. This is distinct from manifest vs latent in that a person may directly express a need they are unaware of, or not express a need they are aware of. The categorization most commonly referred to is the division between Primary (viscerogenic) and Secondary (psychogenic) needs.

=== Primary/Viscerogenic Needs ===
Primary (Viscerogenic) needs are defined by Murray&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as needs involving some biological process and arise in response to certain stimuli or events that drive the body towards a certain outcome ('positive' or 'negative').For example, dehydration would trigger a "need for water," which in turn drives a person to seek out and intake water. The first six primary needs; Air, Water, Food, Sentience, Sex, and Lactation, are considered 'positive' needs, as they drive a person towards a certain object or action. The remaining seven; Expiration, Urination, Defecation, and the four avoidance needs (see 'Retraction' below), are considered to be 'negative' needs as they drive a person away from an object (or in some cases towards the expulsion of an object).

=== Secondary/Psychogenic Needs ===
Secondary (Psychogenic) needs emerge from or are influenced by primary needs. Murray identified 17 secondary needs, each belonging to one of eight need domains: Ambition, Materialism, Status, Power, Sado-Masochism, Social-Conformance, Affection, and Information. Needs in each domain have similar themes underpinning them; for instance, the Ambition domain contains all those needs which relate to achievement and recognition.

==Applications==

===Personality testing===

Murray's system of needs has influenced the creation of personality testing, including both objective and subjective measures&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. A personality test is a questionnaire or other standardized instrument designed to reveal aspects of an individual's character or psychological makeup. Murray's system of needs directly influenced the development of a variety of personality measures, including the ''Personality Research Form'' and the ''Jackson Personality Inventory''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Henry A|title=Thematic apperception test.|date=1943|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Thematic apperception test===

Henry Murray, along with [[Christiana Morgan]], developed the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) as a tool to assess personality. The TAT is based on the assumption that human unconscious needs are directed towards an external stimulus. Murray and Morgan created the TAT to evaluate "press" and "need," which Murray emphasized in his theory of personality. The TAT is administered  by an  assessor, who chooses a subset of cards (generally concerning a particular theme, or those that they feel best suit the subject) out of the 32 available; Murray recommended selecting 20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cramer|first1=P|title=Storytelling, narrative, and the Thematic Apperception Test.|date=2004|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each card features various ambiguous scenes which relate to interpersonal situations. The test-taker is asked to give a detailed explanation of what they see. For example, an explanation may include a narrative of what is happening and what may unfold, and what the characters in the scene are feeling or thinking. From this narrative, the assessor uses Murray's theoretical themes to infer personality characteristics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Further research===

Murray's theory of personality was the basis for several areas of further psychological research. Three of the needs he identified–the [[need for power]], the [[need for affiliation]], and the [[need for achievement]]–were later the subject of substantial study and considered especially significant; used to develop theories such as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], [[David McClelland]]'s 'Achievement Motivation Theory', aspects of [[Richard Boyatzis]]' competency-based models of management effectiveness, and more.

Murray's concept of the 'press' and his emphasis on the importance of environmental events (and their subjective interpretation) were also highly significant to later psychological research. Behavioral psychology-pioneered by [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]-focused on environmental events, while cognitive psychology included a focus on subjective interpretation of events, based on another one of Murray's ideas (his categorization of presses as either Alpha or Beta).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Salem health: psychology &amp; mental health|last1=Piotrowski|first1=Nancy A|date=2010|publisher=Salem Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Although Murray's theory has had a substantial influence on personality testing and research, some critics say that his system of needs is too broad and rather subjective. One criticism of this hierarchy is that it lacks the objective criterion for needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Determinants, Dynamics, and Potentials|last=Cervone|first=Daniel|last2=Vittorio Caprara|first2=Gian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521587484|location=|pages=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that some of the needs can conflict with each other like achievement and nurturance, which deal with opposing ideas of having to obstacles with achievement being active and nurturance being passive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When evaluating the TAT, critics have claimed that the test has a low test-retest reliability and validity. This could possibly be due to contrasting instructions from the experimenters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Nadal formula''', also called '''Nadal's formula''', is an equation in [[railway]] design that relates the downward force exerted by a [[train]]'s wheels upon the rail, with the lateral force of the wheel's flange against the face of the rail. This relationship is significant in railway design, as a [[Derailment#Slow speed derailments|wheel-climb derailment]] may occur if the lateral and vertical forces are not properly considered.&lt;ref name=APTA&gt;[http://www.aptastandards.com/portals/0/press_pdfs/Mechanical/SS-M-015-06%20Wheel%20Flange%20Angle.pdf APTA SS-M-015-06 Standard for wheel flange angle for passenger equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nadal formula is represented by:
&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu}{1+\mu*\tan(\delta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, L and V refer to the lateral and vertical forces acting upon the rail and wheel, δ is the angle made when the wheel flange is in contact with the rail face, and μ is the coefficient of friction between the wheel and the rail.&lt;ref name=APTA /&gt;

Typically, the [[axle load]] for a railway vehicle should be such that the lateral forces of the wheel against the rail should not exceed 50% of the vertical down-force of the vehicle on the rail.&lt;ref name=DOT&gt;[http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/Counsel/nprm/tssnprm.pdf Federal Register, July 3, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, there should be twice as much downward force holding the wheel to the rail, as there is lateral force which will tend to cause the wheel to climb in turns. This ratio is accomplished by matching the [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] with the appropriate [[rail profile]] to achieve the L/V ratio desired. If the L/V ratio gets too high, the wheel flange will be pressing against the rail face, and during a turn this will cause the wheel to climb the face of the rail, potentially derailing the railcar.

==Wagner Formula==

The Nadal formula assumes the wheel remains perpendicular to the rail&amp;mdash;it does not take into account [[hunting oscillation]] of the wheelset, or the movement of the wheel flange contact point against the rail.&lt;ref name="Dukkipati"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dukkipati | first=Rao | title=Vehicle Dynamics | publisher=Narosa Publishing House | year=2000 | isbn=978-81-7319-265-4 | pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the Nadal formula, which does take these factors into consideration, is the Wagner formula. As the wheelset yaws relative to the rail, the vertical force V is no longer completely vertical, but is now acting at an angle to the vertical, β. When this angle is factored into the Nadal formula, the result is the Wagner formula:&lt;ref name="Dukkipati" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu*\cos\beta}{(1+\mu*\tan(\delta))*\cos\beta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

When the vertical force is truly vertical (that is, β=0 and therefore cos(β)=1), the Wagner formula equals the Nadal formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">'''New rhetorics''' is an [[interdisciplinary field]]&lt;ref name="Andreea"&gt;Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, ''Rhetorics: New Rhetorics'', in Wolfgang Donsbach (ed.), ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; approaching for the broadening of [[classical rhetorics|classical rhetorical canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Per example in ''Defining the New Rhetoric'' and ''Professing the New Rhetoric''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"&gt;New and Alternative Rhetorics - William DeGenaro, ''Who says?: working-class rhetoric, class consciousness, and community'', Univ of Pittsburgh Press, 2007, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The New Rhetoric is a result of various efforts of bringing back rhetorics from the marginal status&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; it attained by its image and 'negative connotations' of "political lies, corporate spin, long list of Greek and Roman terms for patterns of expression no one knowingly uses, purple prose, boiler-plate arrangement schemas, unimaginative reproductions of bullshit and so on"&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George Pullman, ''Rhetorically Speaking, What’s New?'', Georgia State University, What is the New Rhetoric? conference&lt;/ref&gt; if not to its previous place of a discipline "associated with social and intellectual prestige"&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; then at least to the level of the other contemporary fields in the social, cultural and linguistic studies. Notoriously the field emerged after the work of [[Chaïm Perelman]] and [[Lucille Olbrechts-Tyteca]] in their book ''The New Rhetoric'' (1969)&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas M. Carr, Jr. ''Some Consequences of The New Rhetoric: A Critical Study'', Argumentation 7: 475-479, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; but both the notion and the idea for the need of "new" rhetoric, different from the "old" one can be traced to the works of [[Kenneth Burke]] - ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' (1950) and ''Rhetoric - Old and New'' (1967),.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary M. White, [https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3113888/ Re-examining Kenneth Burke on "identification" in the "new" rhetoric],  dissertation @ Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt;

What helped the emergence of New rhetoric was the ideas of the [[epistemic]] status of rhetoric, the notion of a clearly definable rhetorical core and other.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt;

New rhetorics attempts to preserve the original field but it also has tense relationship with it.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; For example, New Rhetoric attempts to break up with the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalistic]] and [[logocentric]] (i.e. [[patriarchal]]) [[Neo-Aristotelian]] analysis in favour of interplay between [[Text (literary theory)|text]] and [[Context (language use)|context]], but according to DeGenaro it does not succeed to place itself outside the "Western-patriarchal" with being unable to departure from "elite backgrounds and scopes of study"&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"/&gt; to a diversity of voices, topics, etc. This probably makes New Rhetoric rather a ground for the '''postmodern rhetoric'''&lt;ref&gt;Not the rhetoric of [[postmodernism]] but postmodern theory and analysis in rhetorics.&lt;/ref&gt; which "puts into question the identities of the speaker, the audience, and the messages that pass between them"&lt;ref name="Gary1"&gt;Gary E. Aylesworth, ''Rhetoric, Postmodern'' ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; with evaluating the [[intersubjective]] philosophy&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry Brummett, ''Some Implications of "Process" or "Intersubjectivity": Postmodern Rhetoric'', Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, Penn State University Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; because of the inherently accepted in the [[postmodern philosophy|postmodernistic philosophy]] idea that "differences cannot be overcome, in Hegelian fashion, by cancelling them under a higher-order synthesis, but must be eroded or defaced in the course of traversing them."&lt;ref name="Gary2"&gt;Gary Aylesworth, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#8 Postmodernism]'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15996">'''Number sense in animals''' is the ability of creatures to represent and discriminate quantities of relative sizes by [[number sense]]. It has been observed in various species, from [[fish]] to [[primate]]s. Animals are believed to have an [[approximate number system]], the same system for number representation demonstrated by humans, which is more precise for smaller quantities and less so for larger values. An exact representation of numbers higher than 3 has not been attested in wild animals,&lt;ref name="Hauser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=Marc D.|author2=Carey, Susan|author3=Hauser, Lilan B.|title=Spontaneous number representation in semi–free–ranging rhesus monkeys.|year=2000|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can be demonstrated after a period of training in captive animals.

In order to distinguish number sense in animals from the symbolic and verbal number system in humans researchers use the term ''numerosity'',&lt;ref name="Dehaene"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehaene|first=Stanislas|title=The Number Sense: How the mind creates Mathematics|year=2011|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''number'', to refer to the concept that supports approximate estimation but does not support an exact representation of number quality.

Number sense in animals includes the recognition and comparison of number quantities. Some numerical operations, such as addition, have been demonstrated in many species, including rats and great apes. Representing fractions and fraction addition has been observed in chimpanzees. A wide range of species with an approximate number system suggests an early evolutionary origin of this mechanism or multiple [[convergent evolution]] events.

==Early studies==

[[File:Osten und Hans.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm von Osten and Clever Hans]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, Wilhelm von Osten famously, but prematurely, claimed human-like counting abilities in animals on the example of his horse named Hans.  His claim is widely rejected today, as it is attributed to a methodological fallacy, which received the name [[Clever Hans]] phenomenon after this case. Von Osten claimed that his horse could perform arithmetic operations presented to the horse in writing or verbally, upon which the horse would knock on the ground with its hoof the number of times that corresponded to the answer. This apparent ability was demonstrated numerous times in the presence of the horse's owner and a wider audience, and was also observed when the owner was absent.  However, upon a rigorous investigation by [[Oskar Pfungst]] in the first decade of 20th century, Hans' ability was shown to be not arithmetic in nature, but to be the ability to interpret minimal unconscious changes in body language of people when the correct answer was approaching. Today, the arithmetic abilities of Clever Hans are commonly rejected and the case serves as a reminder to the scientific community about the necessity of rigorous control for experimenter expectation in experiments.&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt;

There were, however, other early and more reliable studies on number sense in animals. A prominent example is the work of [[Otto Koehler]], who conducted a number of studies on number sense in animals between 1920s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Rilling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rilling|first=Mark|title=Invisible counting animals: A history of contributions from comparative psychology, ethology, and learning theory.|year=1993|journal=The development of numerical competence: Animal and human models|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his studies&lt;ref name="Koehler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Otto |title="Zähl"-Versuche an einem Kolkraben und Vergleichsversuche an Menschen.|journal= Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|year=1943|pages=575–712|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1943.tb00665.x|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he showed that a raven named Jacob could reliably distinguish the number 5 across different tasks. This study was remarkable in that Koehler provided a systematic control condition in his experiment, which allowed him to test the number ability of the raven separately from the ability of the raven to encode other features, such as size and location of the objects. However, Koehler's work was largely overlooked in the English-speaking world, due to the limited availability of his publications, which were in German and partially published during World War II.

The experimental setup for the study of numerical cognition in animals was further enriched by the work of [[Francis Mechner|Francis]]&lt;ref name="Mechner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mechner|first=Francis |title=Probability relations within response sequences under ratio reinforcement|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|year=1958|pages=109–121|doi= 10.1901/jeab.1958.1-109|volume=1|pmc=1403928}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Platt and Johnson.&lt;ref name="Platt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Platt|first=John R|author2=Johnson, David M. |title=Localization of position within a homogeneous behavior chain: Effects of error contingencies.|journal=Learning and Motivation|year=1958|pages=386–414}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiments, the researchers deprived rats of food and then taught them to press a lever a specific number of times to obtain food. The rats learned to press the lever approximately the number of times specified by the researchers. Additionally, the researchers showed that rats' behavior was dependent on the number of required presses, and not for example on the time of pressing, as they varied the experiment to include faster and slower behavior on the rat's part by controlling how hungry the animal was.

== Methodology ==
Examining the representation of numerosity in animals is a challenging task, since it is not possible to use language as a medium. Because of this, carefully designed experimental setups are required to differentiate between numerical abilities and other phenomena, such as the Clever Hans phenomenon, memorization of the single objects or perception of object size and time.Also these abilities are seen only from the past few decades and not form the time of evolution.

One of the ways that numerical ability is thought to be demonstrated is the transfer of the concept of numerosity across modalities. This was for example the case in the experiment of Church and Meck,&lt;ref name="Church"&gt;{{cite book|last=Church|first=Russell M.|author2=Meck, Warren H.|chapter=The numerical attribute of stimuli.|year=1984|title= Animal Cognition|pages=445–464|isbn= 0898593344|editors=H.L. Roitblat, T.G. Bever, &amp; H.S. Terrace}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which rats learned to "add" the number of light flashes to the number of tones to find out the number of expected lever presses, showing a concept of numerosity independent of visual and auditory modalities.

Modern studies in number sense in animals try to control for other possible explanations of animal behavior by establishing control conditions in which the other explanations are tested. For example, when the number sense is investigated on the example of apple pieces, an alternative explanation is tested that assumes that the animal represents the volume of apple rather than a number of apple pieces. To test this alternative, an additional condition is introduced in which the volume of the apple varies and is occasionally smaller in the condition with a greater number of pieces. If the animal prefers a bigger number of pieces also in this condition, the alternative explanation is rejected, and the claim of numerical ability supported.&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt;

== Approximate number and parallel individuation systems ==
Numerosity is believed&lt;ref name="Hyde"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=D.|title=Two systems of non-symbolic numerical cognition|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00150}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to be represented by two separate systems in animals, similarly to humans. The first system is the [[approximate number system]], an imprecise system used for estimations of quantities. This system is distinguished by distance and magnitude effects, which means that a comparison between numbers is easier and more precise when the distance between them is smaller and when the values of the numbers are smaller.  The second system for representation of numerosity is the [[parallel individuation system]] which supports the exact representation of numbers from 1 to 4. In addition, humans can represent numbers through symbolic systems, such as language.

The distinction between the approximate number system and the parallel individuation system is, however, still disputed, and some experiments&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Simon|author2=Low, Jason|author3=Burns, K.|title=Adaptive numerical competency in a food-hoarding songbird.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2008|volume=275|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0702|pages=2373–2379|pmc=2603231}}&lt;/ref&gt; record behavior that can be fully explained with the approximate number system, without the need to assume another separate system for smaller numbers. For example, New Zealand robins repeatedly selected larger quantities of cached food with a precision that correlated with the total number of cache pieces. However, there was no significant discontinuity in their performance between small (1 to 4) and larger (above 4) sets, which would be predicted by the parallel individuation system. On the other hand, other experiments only report knowledge of numbers up to 4, supporting the existence of the parallel individuation system and not the approximate number system.&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt;

== Number sense by species ==

=== Fish ===
An approximate number system has been found in a number of fish species, such as [[guppy|guppies]], [[green swordtail]]s and [[mosquitofish]]. For example, preference for a bigger social group in mosquitofish was exploited to test the ability of the fish to discriminate numerosity.&lt;ref name= "agrillo2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|author2=Dadda, M|author3=Serena, G|author4=Bisazza, A|title=Do fish count? Spontaneous discrimination of quantity in female mosquitofish.|journal=Animal Cognition|year=2008|volume=11|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0140-9|pages=495–503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fish successfully discriminated between different amounts up to three, after which they could discriminate groups if the difference between them also increased so that the ratio of the two groups was 1:2. Similarly, guppies discriminated between values up to 4, after which they only detected differences when the ratio between the two quantities was 1:2.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rats ===
Rats have demonstrated behavior consistent with an approximate number system&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt; in experiments where they had to learn to press a lever a specified number of times to obtain food. While they did learn to press the lever the amount specified by the researchers, between 4 and 16, their behavior was approximate, proportional to the number of lever presses expected from them. This means that for the target number of 4, the rats' responses varied from 3 to 7, and for the target number of 16 the responses varied from 12 to 24, showing a much greater interval.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt; This is compatible with the approximate number system and magnitude and distance effects.

=== Birds ===
Birds were one of the first animal species tested on their number sense. A raven named Jacob was able to distinguish the number 5 across different tasks in the experiments by Otto Koehler.&lt;ref name="Koehler"/&gt; Later experiments supported the claim of existence of a number sense in birds, with [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], a grey parrot, able to label and comprehend labels for sets with up to six elements.&lt;ref name="Pepperberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pepperberg|first=Irene M. |author2=Gordon, Jesse D|title=Number comprehension by a grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), including a zero-like concept.|journal= Journal of Comparative Psychology|year=2005|page=197|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest that pigeons can also represent numbers up to 6 after an extensive training.&lt;ref name="Xia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xia|first=Li |author2=Sieman, Martina|author3=Delius Juan D. |title=Matching of numerical symbols with number of responses by pigeons|journal= Animal Cognition|year=2000|pages=35–43|doi=10.1007/s100710050048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dogs ===
A sense of number has also been found in dogs. For example, dogs were able&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Rebecca |author2=Rebecca, E|author3=Young, Robert J. |title=Do domestic dogs show any evidence of being able to count?|journal= Animal Cognition|year=2002|volume=5|pages=183–186.|doi=10.1007/s10071-002-0140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform simple additions of two objects, as revealed by their surprise when the result was incorrect. It is however argued that wolves perform better on quantity discrimination tasks than dogs and that this could be a result of a less demanding natural selection for number sense in dogs.&lt;ref name="Range"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Range|first=Federike|author2=Jenikejew, J|author3=Schröder, I|author4=Virányi, Z|title=Difference in quantity discrimination in dogs and wolves.|journal= Front. Psychol. |volume=5 |pages=1299|year=2014|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monkeys ===
[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus monkeys]] seem to have an innate understanding of numbers up to 4. This is shown by the study on semi-free-ranging rhesus monkeys in their natural environment&lt;ref name="Hauser"/&gt; in which the monkeys spontaneously discriminated numbers from 1 to 3 but did not demonstrate a numerical ability beyond this number. In another study that included training, rhesus monkeys showed the ability to generalize this knowledge to numerosities up to nine.&lt;ref name="Brannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannon|first=Elisabeth M.|author2=Herbert, Terrace S.|title=Ordering of the Numerosities 1 to 9 by Monkeys.|year=1988|journal= Science, New Series|volume=282|number=5389|doi=10.1126/science.282.5389.746|pmid=9784133|pages=746–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chimpanzees ===
[[Chimpanzees]] are believed to have a sense of number, albeit an imprecise one. While they can correctly compare numbers such as 6 and 7 by choosing a tray with more pieces of reward, their performance is more error-free when the difference between the numbers is bigger and when the numbers are smaller; that is when the distance and magnitude effects take place. Chimpanzees also seem to have knowledge of proportions. In an experiment by Woodroof and Premack&lt;ref name="Woodruff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodruff|first=Guy|author2=David Premack|title=Primative &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; mathematical concepts in the chimpanzee: proportionality and numerosity |year=1981 |journal=Nature |volume=293 |issue=5833 |pages=568–570|doi=10.1038/293568a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; an adult chimpanzee correctly identified and performed operations on exemplars of numbers and proportions presented on a variety of objects, such as apples, wood disks and water containers. For example, when presented with {{fraction|1|4}} of an apple and {{fraction|1|2}} full water container, the chimpanzee chose {{fraction|3|4}} of a wooden disk, suggesting an addition-like ability. The ability to add fractions has only been demonstrated in primates so far.&lt;ref name=Dehaene /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17720">'''Product lifetime''' or '''product lifespan''' is the time interval from when a product is sold to when it is discarded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is slightly different from [[service life]] because the latter consider only the effective time the product is used.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Product lifetime represent an important area of enquiry with regards to [[product design]], the [[circular economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/579000/IPOL_STU(2016)579000_EN.pdf|title=A longer lifetime for products: benefits for consumers and companies|last=Montalvo, C.,  Peck, D. and Rietveld, E.|publisher=European Parliament's Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Cooper|first=T|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Cooper, T.|location=Farnham|pages=3–36|chapter=The significance of product longevity|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because products, with the materials involved in their design, production, distribution, use and disposal (across their [[Life Cycle Thinking|life cycle]]), embody carbon due to the energy involved in these processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ciemap.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CIEMAP-Report.pdf|title=A whole system analysis of how industrial energy and material demand reduction can contribute to a low carbon future for the UK.|last=Norman, J.B., Serrenho, A.C., Cooper, S.J.G., Owen, A., Sakai, M., Scott, K., Brockway, P.E., Cooper, S., Giesekam, J., Salvia, G., Cullen, J.M., Barrett, J.R., Cooper, T., Hammond, G.P. and Allwood, J.M.|publisher=CIE-MAP|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if product lifetimes can be extended, the [[Embodied energy|use of energy]], [[Embodied carbon emissions|embodied in carbon]], can be reduced and progress can be made towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions: Bocken et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bocken|first=Nancy M.

In recent years, there has been a growth in academic and policy discussions around product lifetimes. For example, discussion of product lifetimes are an integral part of the European Commission's action plan for the circular economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:8a8ef5e8-99a0-11e5-b3b7-01aa75ed71a1.0012.02/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF|title=Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy|last=European Commission|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' In academia, the PLATE (Product Lifetimes and the Environment) Consortium hosts regular conferences and seminars around the topic of product lifetimes and the environment (see: http://www.plateconference.org/).

This article examines how product lifetimes are defined in the academic literature and discusses how product lifetimes can be measured. A distinction is made between the definition and measurement of ''actual'' and ''expected'' product lifetimes.

== Defining product lifetimes ==

Definitions of product lifetimes vary depending on what aspects those conducting research are interested in. Generally, actual product lifetimes refer to the actual time that a product exists in a particular state.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In contrast, expected product lifetimes refer to users' expectations for the lifetime of a product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, actual and expected product lifetimes are influenced by durability and longevity; these concepts are briefly outlined below.

Durability is described by Cooper&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond recycling: the longer life option|last=Cooper, T.|publisher=New Economics Foundation|year=1994|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal use conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). In contrast, longevity encompasses more than just the material properties of the product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cooper&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; notes that user behaviour, and broader social and cultural trends play important roles in the product's longevity. The paragraphs below outline the definitions of actual and expected product lifetimes.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===

Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; identify the following overarching concepts in product lifetime definitions which are discussed below: Age, Residential time, Service life, Possession span and Duration of use.

==== Age ====
A product's age is the time from when the product was created to either the present or "the time of interest" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 600) for the researchers.

==== Residential time ====
Residential time is considered to be time in which a product, its constituent materials and parts, exists in society.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Residential time includes the time in which a product may be broken and/ or discarded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Service life ====
{{Main|Service life}}

According to Murkami et al.,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the service life of a product refers to the duration of time for which products continue to work and can be used.

==== Possession span ====
The possession span is the period of time that a user has possession of the product.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Duration of use ====
The duration of use indicates how long a user uses the product for.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; distinguish duration of use from [[Service life]] by noting that duration of use is measured for a specific user, whereas [[Service life]] describes the total in-service use of the product for all its users (accounting for transfers of ownership e.g. reuse). Additionally, possession span is distinguished from duration of use, as possession span includes "dead storage" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 601) time, where a product is owned by a user but not in use (i.e. in storage).

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
A conference paper by Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/28621/|title=Electronics Goes Green 2016+ Conference|last=Oguchi, M., Tasaki, T., Daigo, I., Cooper, T., Cole, C. and Gnanapragasam, A.|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=|chapter=Consumers' expectations for product lifetimes of consumer durables.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to identify and test differences in definitions of product lifetime expectations. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; illustrated that previous research into expected product lifetimes has been inconsistent in its use of the term expected product lifetimes. For example, Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|title=Inadequate Life?

Building on these previous studies (''described above''), Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; identified and tested three distinct definitions of expected product lifetimes, these are outlined below.

==== Intended lifetime ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; define the intended lifetime as the length of time for which a user intends to use the product in question.

==== Ideal lifetime ====
The ideal length of time for which a user expects their product to last. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; describe this as "the highest preference of consumers".

==== Predicted lifetime ====
The realist prediction by the user of how long a product will last. The user is thought to make this prediction based on their previous experiences and "other relevant factors" (Oguhci et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

== Measuring product lifetimes ==
Academic enquiry into the product lifetimes of electrical and electronic equipment was undertaken in 2000 by Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/6671/|title=Prospects for household appliances|author1=Cooper, T.  |author2=Mayers, K.|publisher=Sheffield Hallam University for E-SCOPE|year=2000|isbn=|location=Sheffield|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted household interviews and focus groups to establish the age at discard (actual product lifetime) and expected lifetimes for 17 products. Since this study, work has been undertaken by other academics into measuring actual and expected product lifetimes; the methods employed are outlined below.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===
Actual product lifetimes can be measured using a variety of methods which include: product testing, discard surveys, user interviews and modelling. These are discussed below.

==== Product testing ====
Products can be tested under laboratory conditions to assess their lifetime under different conditions of use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Discard surveys ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; identify that surveys of waste treatment and recycling facilities can provide information on the age of the appliance at break or discard. Identifying information such as the product serial and/ or batch number can be used to find out a date of manufacturer from which the age of the appliance at break or discard can be calculated.

==== User interviews ====
Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; conducted household [[interview]]s to establish the age of 17 electrical and electronic items at discard and break. However it has been noted that user interviews are subject to the accuracy of [[memory]], and that reviews of products which have failed in the past only provides information on "a historical situation" (:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;10), not taking into account the features and lifetime of extant products.

==== Modelling ====
Product lifetimes can be modelled using extant data from surveys with the application of [[probability]] and other [[Statistics|statistical concepts]] (e.g. [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www4.ntu.ac.uk/plate_conference/proceedings/index.html|title=Product Lifetimes and The Environment|last=Oguchi, M.|publisher=Nottingham Trent University|year=2015|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=388–393|chapter=Methodologies for estimating actual lifetime distribution of products|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to estimate product lifetimes was undertaken by Pennock and Jaeger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennock|first=Jean L.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Carol M.|date=1957-06-01|title=Estimating the Service Life of Household Goods by Actuarial Methods|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=52|issue=278|pages=175–185|doi=10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; who utilised actuarial methods to measure the [[Service life]] of household goods for one owner. In the 1990s, Bayus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayus|first=Barry L.|date=1991-01-01|title=The Consumer Durable Replacement Buyer|jstor=1252202|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–51|doi=10.2307/1252202}}&lt;/ref&gt; modelled car replacement rates and Bayus and Gupta&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayus|first=Barry L.|last2=Gupta|first2=Sachin|date=1992-08-01|title=An empirical analysis of consumer durable replacement intentions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016781169290021C|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|volume=9|issue=3|pages=257–267|doi=10.1016/0167-8116(92)90021-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated the user decision making process and factors around replacement car purchases.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 2010, Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; proposed modelling product lifetimes factoring the total number of products shipped and discarded in a year. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; outlined a series of equations which represent lifespan distributions for a given product at a particular point in time.

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
Expected product lifetimes are measured at the individual level using survey methods and collectively using focus groups. With the exception of Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Wieser et al.,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; many studies into expected product lifetimes have not distinguished between the different definitions (outlined above). The methods for measuring expected product lifetimes are outlined below.

==== Survey methods ====
Survey methods into expected product lifetimes encompass [[Online Questionnaires|online questionnaires]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; household&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and telephone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Echegaray|first=Fabián|date=2016-10-15|title=Consumers' reactions to product obsolescence in emerging markets: the case of Brazil|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615012202|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|series=Special Volume: Transitions to Sustainable Consumption and Production in Cities|volume=134, Part A|pages=191–203|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.08.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[interview]]s. These studies asked individual participants to report their expectations for product lifetimes in units of time. Survey methods (such as Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) can also use [[Likert scale|Likert items]] to evaluate if current products meet users expectations with regards to durability and longevity.

==== Focus groups ====
[[Focus group]]s can be convened where participants take part in discussions to reach a group consensus on product lifetime expectations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants, and thinking of the majority of the people; it is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem.

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.

==Etymology==
The term ''public opinion'' was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

==History==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was 'the queen of the world.'

[[John Locke]] in his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

[[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] in his essay of 1672, ''On the Original and Nature of Government'' gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority."

Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299|registration=y|doi=10.1086/220561|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Analisi/article/download/15081/189532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

===Coffee-houses===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|right|Coffeehouse in [[London]], 17th century]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]], in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire. To which is prefixed an introduction, exhibiting a view of the ancient and modern state of Europe ; of the importance of our colonies ; and of the commerce, shipping, manufactures, fisheries, &amp;c., of Great-Britain and Ireland ; and their influence on the landed interest. With an appendix, containing the modern politico-commercial geography of the several countries of Europe. Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses." According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government," were the "seats of English liberty."&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentleman clubs===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]], and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]]; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

==Concepts==

The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of "[[Public sphere]]" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:
# quantitative measurement of opinion distributions;
# investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue;
# description or analysis of the public role of public opinion;
# study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

==Formation==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

===Mass media effects===
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of influentials==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]," or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process.  In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced.  This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis."  The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials.  The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process.  The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories.  This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).

==Relationship with public policy==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mau|first1=Steffen|title=Welfare Regimes and the Norms of Social Exchange|journal=Current Sociology|date=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1177/0011392104039314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Oorschot|first1=Wim|title=Culture and Social Policy: A Developing Field of Study|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2006.00451.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Expenditures Database|url=https://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Andrea Louise|title=Policy Makes Mass Politics|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=333–351|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart|title=Relationships between Public Opinion and Policy|journal=Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior|date=2007|pages=799–817|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-043?mediaType=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breznau|first1=Nate|title=Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=14 July 2016|doi=10.1111/psj.12171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|title=The Public as Thermostat: Dynamics of Preferences for Spending|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1995|volume=39|issue=4|pages=981–1000|jstor=2111666|doi=10.2307/2111666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=2000|volume=94|issue=2|pages=251–267|jstor=2586011|doi=10.2307/2586011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with foreign policy==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with U.S. Presidency==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|pages=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

'''Reading comprehension''' is the ability to process text, [[understanding|understand]] its meaning, and to integrate with what the reader already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.k12reader.com/what-is-reading-comprehension/|title=What is Reading Comprehension?|date=2008-05-29|website=Reading Worksheets, Spelling, Grammar, Comprehension, Lesson Plans|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509110054/http://www.k12reader.com/what-is-reading-comprehension/|archivedate=2016-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Grabe|title=Reading in a Second Language: Moving from Theory to Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prvRHZ7DrIcC|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-72974-1|quote=Koda, 2005:4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504225903/https://books.google.com/books?id=prvRHZ7DrIcC|archivedate=2018-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental skills required in efficient reading comprehension are knowing meaning of words, ability to understand meaning of a word from discourse context, ability to follow organization of passage and to identify antecedents and references in it, ability to draw inferences from a passage about its contents, ability to identify the main thought of a passage, ability to answer questions answered in a passage, ability to recognize the [[List of narrative techniques|literary devices]] or propositional structures used in a passage and determine its [[Tone (literature)|tone]], to understand the situational mood (agents, objects, temporal and spatial reference points, casual and intentional inflections, etc.) conveyed for assertions, questioning, commanding, refraining etc. and finally ability to determine writer's purpose, intent and point of view, and draw inferences about the writer (discourse-semantics).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, F.B.

An individual's ability to comprehend text is influenced by their skills and their ability to process information. If word recognition is difficult, students use too much of their processing capacity to read individual [[word]]s, which interferes with their ability to comprehend what is read. There are a number of reading strategies to improve reading comprehension and inferences, including improving one's vocabulary, critical text analysis ([[intertextuality]], actual events vs. narration of events, etc.) and practicing deep reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maryanne Wolf|title=Tales of Literacy for the 21st Century: The Literary Agenda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HEq1DAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-103613-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially most comprehension teaching was based on imparting selected techniques for each genre that when taken together would allow students to be strategic readers. However, from 1930s testing various methods never seemed to win support in empirical research. One such strategy for improving reading comprehension is the technique called [[SQ3R]] introduced by Francis Pleasant Robinson in his 1946 book ''Effective Study''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|location = New York
|isbn = 978-0-06-045521-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1969 and 2000, a number of "strategies" were devised for teaching students to employ self-guided methods for improving reading comprehension. In 1969 Anthony V. Manzo designed and found empirical support for the Re Quest, or [[reciprocal teaching|Reciprocal Questioning Procedure]] in traditional teacher-centered approach due to its sharing of "cognitive secrets." It was the first method to convert fundamental theory such as [[Social learning theory|social learning]] into teaching methods through the use of [[cognitive modeling]] between teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/c9995ff1d0d7b3127d5e74b302d4f843/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=2030479|title=Reading and Questioning: The ReQuest Procedure - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the 20th century, comprehension lessons usually consist of students answering teacher's questions or writing responses to questions of their own, or from prompts of the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|first=P. David|title=The Roots of Reading Comprehension Instruction|url=http://www.postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl/dev/documentos/64,688,Handbook%20of%20Research%20on%20reading%20Comprehesion%201The%20roots%20of%20reading%20comprehension%20instruction.pdf|work=postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl|publisher=Universityof California, Berkeley|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218000018/http://www.postgradolinguistica.ucv.cl/dev/documentos/64,688,Handbook%20of%20Research%20on%20reading%20Comprehesion%201The%20roots%20of%20reading%20comprehension%20instruction.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This detached whole group version only helped students individually to respond to portions of the text (Content area reading), and improve their writing skills.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the last quarter of the 20th century, evidence accumulated that academic reading test methods were more successful in assessing rather than imparting comprehension or giving a realistic insight. Instead of using the prior response registering method, research studies have concluded that an effective way to teach comprehension is to teach novice readers a bank of "practical reading strategies" or tools to interpret and analyze various categories and styles of text.&lt;ref name="Pressley, 2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pressley, Michael |title=Reading instruction that works: the case for balanced teaching |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-59385-229-0 |oclc=61229782 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gl6TWPOE2o0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Reading+instruction+that+works:+The+case+for+balanced+teaching&amp;ots=WDL3X6Gy9_&amp;sig=kgIU6slAZInOJfGqTWuDqFeS2L0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504225903/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gl6TWPOE2o0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Reading+instruction+that+works:+The+case+for+balanced+teaching&amp;ots=WDL3X6Gy9_&amp;sig=kgIU6slAZInOJfGqTWuDqFeS2L0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2018-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
People learn comprehension skills through education or instruction and some learn by direct experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. pp. 5, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Proficient reading depends on the ability to recognize words quickly and effortlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn McCord |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=62108874 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Hk7-n8i1AC&amp;dq=Beginning+to+Read:+Thinking+and+Learning+about+Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also determined by an individual's cognitive development, which is "the construction of thought processes".

There are specific characteristics that determine how successfully an individual will comprehend text, including prior knowledge about the subject, well-developed language, and the ability to make inferences from methodical [[PQRST (study skill)|questioning]] &amp; monitoring comprehension like: "Why is this important?" and "Do I need to read the entire text?" are examples of passage questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. pp. 205, 208-209, 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruction for comprehension strategy often involves initially aiding the students by [[social cognitive theory|social and imitation learning]], wherein teachers explain genre styles and model both top-down and bottom-up strategies, and familiarize students with a required complexity of text comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ula C. Manzo|author2=Anthony V.

The final stage involves leading the students to a [[self-regulated learning]] state with more and more practice and assessment.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The teacher as reading instructor is a role model of a reader for students, demonstrating what it means to be an effective reader and the rewards of being one.&lt;ref name="DayBamford1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard R.

===Definition===
Reading comprehension is the level of understanding of a text/message. This understanding comes from the interaction between the words that are written, and how they trigger knowledge outside the text/message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keith Rayner |author2=Barbara Foorman |author3=Charles Perfetti |author4=David Pesetsky |author5=Mark Seidenberg  |last-author-amp=yes |title=How Psychological Science Informs the Teaching of Reading|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|date= November 2001|volume=2|issue=2|pages=31–74|doi=10.1111/1529-1006.00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. p 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Comprehension is a "creative, multifaceted process" dependent upon four [[Theoretical linguistics|language skills]]: [[phonology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. p 37&lt;/ref&gt;There are 6 essential skills for reading comprehension: Decoding, Fluency, Vocabulary, Sentence Construction and Cohesion, Reasoning and background knowledge Working memory and attention

===Reading comprehension levels===
Reading comprehension involves two [[levels of processing]], shallow (low-level) processing and deep (high-level) processing. Deep processing involves [[semantic]] processing, which happens when we encode the meaning of a word and relate it to similar words. Shallow processing involves structural and phonemic recognition, the processing of sentence and word structure, i.e. [[first-order logic]], and their associated sounds. This theory was first identified by [[Fergus I. M. Craik]] and Robert S. Lockhart.&lt;ref name="WagnerSchatschneider2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard K. Wagner|author2=Christopher Schatschneider|author3=Caroline Phythian-Sence|title=Beyond Decoding: The Behavioral and Biological Foundations of Reading Comprehension|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qWPZ63GezB4C&amp;pg=PA143|date=19 June 2009|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60623-356-6|pages=143–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehension levels are observed through [[neuroimaging]] techniques like [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). fMRI's are used to determine the specific neural pathways of activation across two conditions, narrative-level comprehension and sentence-level comprehension. Images showed that there was less brain region activation during sentence-level comprehension, suggesting a shared reliance with comprehension pathways. The scans also showed an enhanced temporal activation during narrative levels tests indicating this approach activates situation and spatial processing.&lt;ref name="Speer, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Speer |first1=Nicole |last2=Yarkoni |first2=Tal |last3=Zacks |first3=Jeffrey |year=2008 |title=Neural substrates of narrative comprehension and memory |journal=NeuroImage |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=1408–1425 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.062}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, neuroimaging studies have found that reading involves three overlapping neural systems: networks active in visual, orthography-phonology ([[Angular gyrus]]), and semantic functions (Anterior [[temporal lobe]] with [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area|Wernicke's]] area). However, these neural networks are not discrete, meaning these areas have several other functions as well. The Broca's area involved in executive functions helps the a reader to vary depth of reading comprehension and textual engagement in accordance with reading goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Usha Goswami|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Childhood Cognitive Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWE0nyO1b5wC&amp;pg=PA342|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5173-6|pages=342+|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504225903/https://books.google.com/books?id=iWE0nyO1b5wC&amp;pg=PA342|archivedate=2018-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David A.

===Vocabulary===
Reading comprehension and vocabulary are inextricably linked together. The ability to decode or identify and pronounce words is self-evidently important, but knowing what the words mean has a major and direct effect on knowing what any specific passage means while [[Skimming (reading)|skimming]] a reading material. It has been shown that students with a smaller vocabulary than other students comprehend less of what they read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Diane|title=Study shows greater focus on vocabulary can help make students better readers|url=http://archive.news.ku.edu/2013/january/9/reading.shtml|quote=if they don’t understand the meaning of the words, then their ability to understand the overall meaning of a story or other text will be compromised|work=news.ku.edu|publisher=The University of Kansas|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203182921/http://archive.news.ku.edu/2013/january/9/reading.shtml |archivedate=3 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that to improve comprehension, improving word groups, complex vocabularies such as [[homonym]]s or words that have multiple meanings, and those with figurative meanings like [[idiom]]s, [[simile]]s, [[collocations]] and [[metaphor]]s are a good practice.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. pp. 171, 181, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Biemiller argues that teachers should give out topic related words and [[phrases]] before reading a book to students, teaching includes topic related word groups, synonyms of words and their meaning with the context, and he further says to familiarize students with sentence structures in which these words commonly occur.&lt;ref&gt;Biemiller &amp; Boote, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Biemiller says this intensive approach gives students opportunities to explore the topic beyond its discourse - freedom of conceptual expansion. However, there is no evidence to suggest the primacy of this approach.&lt;ref name="Beck, 2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Linda Kucan |author2=Beck, Isabel L. |author3=McKeown, Margaret G. |title=Bringing words to life: robust vocabulary instruction |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=1-57230-753-6 |oclc=48450880 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidental [[morpheme|Morphemic]] analysis of words - prefixes, suffixes and roots - is also considered to improve understanding of the vocabulary, though they are proved to be an unreliable strategy for improving comprehension and is no longer used to teach students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Matthew M. Thomas |author2=Manzo, Anthony V. |author3=Manzo, Ula Casale |title=Content area literacy: strategic teaching for strategic learning |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2005 |pages=163–4 |isbn=0-471-15167-X |oclc=58833339 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading strategies==
There are a variety of strategies used to teach reading. Strategies vary according to the challenges like new concepts, unfamiliar vocabulary, long and complex sentences, etc. trying to deal with all of these challenges at the same time may be unrealistic. Then again strategies should fit to the ability, aptitude and age level of the learner. Some of the strategies teachers use are: reading aloud, group work, and more reading exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorrell|first=Michael Gorrell|date=2011|title=E-books on EBSCOhost: Combining NetLibrary E-books with the EBSCOhost Platform|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3789/isqv23n2.2011.07|journal=Information Standards Quarterly|volume=23|issue=2|pages=31|doi=10.3789/isqv23n2.2011.07|issn=1041-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:US Navy 021211-N-4528H-004 Partnership in Education Communitee Program.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine helps a student with reading comprehension as part of a Partnership in Education program sponsored by Park Street Elementary School and Navy/Marine Corps Reserve Center Atlanta. The program is a community out-reach program for sailors and Marines to visit the school and help students with class work.]]

===Reciprocal teaching===

In the 1980s Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown developed a technique called [[reciprocal teaching]] that taught students to predict, summarize, clarify, and ask questions for sections of a text. The use of strategies like summarizing after each paragraph have  come to be seen as effective strategies for building students' comprehension. The idea is that students will develop stronger reading comprehension skills on their own if the teacher gives them explicit mental tools for unpacking text.&lt;ref name="Pressley, 2006"/&gt;

===Instructional conversations===

"Instructional conversations", or comprehension through discussion, create higher-level thinking opportunities for students by promoting [[critical thinking|critical]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic thinking]] about the text. According to [[V.T. Thayer|Vivian Thayer]], class discussions help students to generate ideas and new questions. (Goldenberg, p.&amp;nbsp;317). Dr. Neil Postman has said, "All our knowledge results from questions, which is another way of saying that question-asking is our most important intellectual tool" {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} (Response to Intervention). There are several types of questions that a teacher should focus on: remembering; testing understanding; application or solving; invite synthesis or creating; and evaluation and judging.   Teachers should model these types of questions through "think-alouds" before, during, and after reading a text.
When a student can relate a passage to an experience, another book, or other facts about the world, they are "making a connection."  Making connections help students understand the author's purpose and fiction or non-fiction story.&lt;ref name="Dan Bell p.68"&gt;Dan Bell, The GRE Handbook - The How to on GRE, Complete Expert's Hints and Tips Guide by the Leading Experts, Everything You Need to Know about GRE, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text factors===

There are factors, that once discerned, make it easier for the reader to understand the written text. One is the [[genre]], like [[Fairy tale|folktales]], [[historical fiction]], [[biography|biographies]] or [[poetry]]. Each genre has its own characteristics for text structure, that once understood help the reader comprehend it. A story is composed of a plot, characters, setting, point of view, and theme. Informational books provide real world knowledge for students and have unique features such as: headings, maps, vocabulary, and an index. Poems are written in different forms and the most commonly used are: rhymed verse, haikus, free verse, and narratives. Poetry uses devices such as: alliteration, repetition, rhyme, metaphors, and similes. "When children are familiar with genres, organizational patterns, and text features in books they're reading, they're better able to create those text factors in their own writing." Another one is arranging the text per [[Eye–hand span|perceptual span]] and the text display favorable to the age level of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). ''Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers'' (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-Verbal Imagery'''

Media that utilizes schema to make connections either planned or not, more commonly used within context such as: a passage, an experience, or one's imagination. Some notable examples are emojis, emoticons, cropped and uncropped images, and recently Imojis which are humorous, cropped images that are used to elicit humor and comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Evan|date=Summer 2016|title=Ha-Ha, I’m Comprehending With Imojis|url=http://www.uh.edu/education/documents/reading-journal-summer2016.pdf|journal=Colorado Reading Journal|volume=27|pages=16–19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152219/http://www.uh.edu/education/documents/reading-journal-summer2016.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visualization===

Visualization is a "[[mental image]]" created in a person's mind while reading text, which "brings words to life" and helps improve reading comprehension. Asking sensory questions will help students become better visualizers.&lt;ref name="Dan Bell p.68"/&gt; Students can practice visualizing by imagining what they "see, hear, smell, taste, or feel" when they are reading a page of a picture book aloud, but not yet shown the picture. They can share their visualizations, then check their level of detail against the illustrations.

=== Partner reading ===

Partner reading is a strategy created for pairs. The teacher chooses two appropriate books for the students to read. First they must read their own book. Once they have completed this, they are given the opportunity to write down their own comprehensive questions for their partner. The students swap books, read them out loud to one another and ask one another questions about the book they read.

This strategy:

* Provides a model of fluent reading and helps students learn decoding skills by offering positive feedback.&lt;ref name="Partner Reading"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/strategies/partner_reading|title=Partner Reading|website=Reading Rockets|access-date=2016-05-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506215551/http://www.readingrockets.org/strategies/partner_reading|archivedate=2016-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provides direct opportunities for a teacher to circulate in the class, observe students, and offer individual remediation.&lt;ref name="Partner Reading"/&gt;

=== Multiple reading strategies ===

There are a wide range of reading strategies suggested by reading programs and educators. Effective reading strategies may differ for second language learners, as opposed to native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Tanyeli, N. (2008). ''The Efficiency of Online English Language Instruction on Students' Reading Skills''. Paper presented at the International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED), Valencia, Spain. http://www.eric.ed.gov/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED504676&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iwai, Y. (2008). The perceptions of Japanese students toward academic English reading: Implications for effective ESL reading strategies. ''Multicultural Education, 15''(4), 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deacon, S. H., Wade-Woolley, L., &amp; Kirby, J. R. (2009). Flexibility in young second-language learners: Examining the language specificity of orthographic processing. . ''Journal of Research in Reading, 32''(2), 215-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Reading Panel]] identified positive effects only for a subset, particularly summarizing, asking questions, answering questions, comprehension monitoring, graphic organizers, and cooperative learning. The Panel also emphasized that a combination of strategies, as used in Reciprocal Teaching, can be effective.&lt;ref name="Dan Bell p.68"/&gt; The use of effective comprehension strategies that provide specific instructions for developing and retaining comprehension skills, with intermittent feedback, has been found to improve reading comprehension across all ages, specifically those affected by mental disabilities.&lt;ref name="Berkeley, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherry Berkeley |year=2007 |title=Reading comprehension strategy instruction and attribution retraining for secondary students with disabilities  |journal=Dissertation Abstracts: Humanities and Social Sciences |volume=68 |issue=3-A |pages=949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading different types of texts requires the use of different reading strategies and approaches. Making reading an active, observable process can be very beneficial to struggling readers. A good reader interacts with the text in order to develop an understanding of the information before them. Some good reader strategies are predicting, connecting, inferring, summarizing, analyzing and critiquing. There are many resources and activities educators and instructors of reading can use to help with reading strategies in specific content areas and disciplines. Some examples are graphic organizers, talking to the text, anticipation guides, double entry journals, interactive reading and note taking guides, chunking, and summarizing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The use of effective comprehension strategies is highly important when learning to improve reading comprehension. These strategies provide specific instructions for developing and retaining comprehension skills across all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berkeley |first1=Sherry |year=2007 |title=Reading comprehension strategy instruction and attribution retraining for secondary students with disabilities  |journal=Dissertation Abstracts: Humanities and Social Sciences |volume=68 |issue=3-A |pages=949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying methods to attain an overt [[phonemic awareness]] with intermittent practice has been found to improve reading in early ages, specifically those affected by mental disabilities.

=== Comprehension Strategies ===

Research studies on reading and comprehension have shown that highly proficient readers utilize a number of different strategies to comprehend various types of texts, strategies that can also be used by less proficient readers in order to improve their comprehension.

# Making Inferences: In everyday terms we refer to this as “reading between the lines”. It involves connecting various parts of texts that aren’t directly linked in order to form a sensible conclusion. A form of assumption, the reader speculates what connections lie within the texts.
# Planning and Monitoring: This strategy centers around the reader’s mental awareness and their ability to control their comprehension by way of awareness. By previewing text (via outlines, table of contents, etc.) one can establish a goal for reading-“what do I need to get out of this”? Readers use context clues and other evaluation strategies to clarify texts and ideas, and thus monitoring their level of understanding.
# Asking Questions: To solidify one’s understanding of passages of texts readers inquire and develop their own opinion of the author’s writing, character motivations, relationships, etc. This strategy involves allowing oneself to be completely objective in order to find various meanings within the text.
# Determining Importance: Pinpointing the important ideas and messages within the text. Readers are taught to identify direct and indirect ideas and to summarize the relevance of each.
# Visualizing: With this sensory-driven strategy readers form mental and visual images of the contents of text. Being able to connect visually allows for a better understanding with the text through emotional responses.
# Synthesizing: This method involves marrying  multiple ideas from various texts in order to draw conclusions and make comparisons across different texts; with the reader’s goal being to understand how they all fit together.
# Making Connections: A cognitive approach also referred to as “reading beyond the lines”, which involves (A) finding a personal connection to reading, such as personal experience, previously read texts, etc. to help establish a deeper understanding of the context of the text, or (B) thinking about implications that have no immediate connection with the theme of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedreadinfo.com/speed-reading-tip-study-7-reading-strategies-read-proficiently/|title=Speed Reading Tip: A Study on 7 Reading Strategies To Read More Proficiently - Read Write Work|author=|date=15 August 2016|website=speedreadinfo.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428221522/http://www.speedreadinfo.com/speed-reading-tip-study-7-reading-strategies-read-proficiently/|archivedate=28 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
There are informal and formal assessments to monitor an individual's comprehension ability and use of comprehension strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins, G.E. (2011). Literacy in the early grades: A successful start for prek-4 readers (3rd edition), Boston, Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Informal assessments are generally through observation and the use of tools, like [[story board]]s, [[word sort]]s, and [[interactive writing]].  Many teachers use Formative assessments to determine if a student has mastered content of the lesson. Formative assessments can be verbal as in a Think-Pair-Share or Partner Share. Formative Assessments can also be Ticket out the door or digital summarizers.  Formal assessments are district or state assessments that evaluates all students on important skills and concepts. Summative assessments are typically assessments given at the end of a unit to measure a student's learning.

==== Running records ====

A popular assessment undertaken in numerous primary schools around the world are '''running records'''. Running records are a helpful tool in regard to reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How To Take Running Records|publisher=Scholastic Canada Ltd.|year=2002|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool assists teachers in analysing specific patterns in student behaviours and planning appropriate instruction. By conducting running records teachers are given an overview of students reading abilities and learning over a period of time.

In order for teachers to conduct a running record properly, they must sit beside a student and make sure that the environment is as relaxed as possible so the student does not feel pressured or intimidated. It is best if the running record assessment is conducted during reading, so there are not distractions.  Another alternative is asking an education assistant to conduct the running record for you in a separate room whilst you teach/supervise the class. Quietly observe the students reading and record during this time. There is a specific code for recording which most teachers understand. Once the student has finished reading ask them to retell the story as best they can. After the completion of this, ask them comprehensive questions listed to test them on their understanding of the book. At the end of the assessment add up their running record score and file the assessment sheet away. After the completion of the running record assessment, plan strategies that will improve the students' ability to read and understand the text.

==Difficult or complex content==

===Reading difficult texts===
Some texts, like in philosophy, literature or scientific research, may appear more difficult to read because of the prior knowledge they assume, the tradition from which they come, or the tone, such as criticizing or parodizing.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], explained his opinion about complicated text: "In order to unfold what is implicit in so many discourses, one would have each time to make a pedagogical outlay that is just not reasonable to expect from every book. Here the responsibility has to be shared out, mediated; the reading has to do its work and the work has to make its reader."&lt;ref name="Derrida87"&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (1987) ''Heidegger, the Philosopher's Hell'', interview by [[Didier Eribon]] for ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' issue of November 6–12, republished in ''Points: Interviews 1974-1994'' (1995) pp.187-8&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers, however, believe that if you have something to say, you should be able to make the message readable to a wide audience.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Hyperlinks===
Embedded [[hyperlinks]] in documents or Internet pages have been found to make different demands on the reader than traditional text. Authors, such as [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]], and psychologists, such as [[Maryanne Wolf]], contend that the internet may have a negative impact on attention and reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas G. Carr |title=The shallows: what the Internet is doing to our brains |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-393-07222-3 |oclc=449865498 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies report increased demands of reading hyperlinked text in terms of cognitive load, or the amount of information actively maintained in one’s mind (also see [[working memory]]).&lt;ref name="DeStefano, LeFevre, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeStefano|first1=Diana|last2=LeFevre|first2=Jo-Anne|title=Cognitive load in hypertext reading: A review|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=23|issue=3|year=2007|pages=1616–1641|issn=0747-5632|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2005.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that going from about 5 hyperlinks per page to about 11 per page reduced college students’ understanding (assessed by multiple choice tests) of articles about alternative energy.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, Erping. Hypermedia Interface Design: The Effects of Number of Links and Granularity of Nodes. Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, v8 n3 p331-58 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to the decision-making process (deciding whether to click on it) required by each hyperlink,&lt;ref name="DeStefano, LeFevre, 2007"/&gt; which may reduce comprehension of surrounding text.

On the other hand, other studies have shown that if a short summary of the link’s content is provided when the mouse pointer hovers over it, then comprehension of the text is improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antonenko | first1 =  | last2 = Niederhauser | first2 =  | year = 2010 | title = The Influence of Leads on Cognitive Load and Learning in a Hypertext Environment | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 140–150 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.10.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Navigation hints" about which links are most relevant improved comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Madrid, Oostendorp and Melguizo: Computers in Human Behavior 25 (2009) 66–75&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the background knowledge of the reader can partially determine the effect hyperlinks have on comprehension. In a study of reading comprehension with subjects who were familiar or unfamiliar with art history, texts which were hyperlinked to one another hierarchically were easier for novices to understand than texts which were hyperlinked semantically. In contrast, those already familiar with the topic understood the content equally well with both types of organization.&lt;ref name="DeStefano, LeFevre, 2007"/&gt;

In interpreting these results, it may be useful to note that the studies mentioned were all performed in closed content environments, not on the internet. That is, the texts used only linked to a predetermined set of other texts which was offline. Furthermore, the participants were explicitly instructed to read on a certain topic in a limited amount of time. Reading text on the internet may not have these constraints.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Professional development==
The National Reading Panel noted that comprehension strategy instruction is difficult for many teachers as well as for students, particularly because they were not taught this way and because it is a demanding task. They suggested that professional development can increase teachers/students willingness to use reading strategies but admitted that much remains to be done in this area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The [[directed listening and thinking activity]] is a technique available to teachers to aid students in [[literacy|learning how to un-read]] and reading comprehension. It is also difficult for students that are new. There is often some debate when considering the relationship between reading [[fluency]] and reading comprehension. There is evidence of a direct correlation that fluency and comprehension lead to better understanding of the written material, across all ages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] assessed U.S. student performance in reading at grade 12 from both public and private school population and found that only 37 percentage of students were having proficient skills. The majority, 72 percentage of the students were only at or above basic skills, and alarmingly a 28 percentage of the students were below basic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_cnb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831085622/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_cnb.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Viewing child pornography increases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse.  Reasons include that the pornography normalizes and/or legitimizes the sexual interest in children, as well as that pornography might eventually cease to satisfy the user&lt;!-- citation needed. --&gt;.
* Viewing child pornography decreases the likelihood of an individual committing child sexual abuse. Reasons are that the pornography acts as a substitute for actual offenses. [[Simulated child pornography]] is suggested as an alternative so that real children are not harmed&lt;!-- citation needed. --&gt;.  
* There is no correlation between viewing child pornography and acts of child sexual abuse, or that available evidence is insufficient to draw any conclusions at all.

==Views on increasing criminal sexual intent==

===General===
One perspective is that exposure to [[child pornography]] promotes criminal sexual intent that otherwise would not exist. The promotion may take place via material that legitimizes sexual interest in minors. Anonymity (or belief that anonymity exists) may further loosen the internal restraints, facilitated by still or moving images, which makes actual criminal sexual behavior with children more probable if the person was already sexually motivated toward children, or, by creating new sexual interests in children. A review article states that these are plausible hypotheses,&lt;ref name="Onlinepred"/&gt; but that there is a lack of clarity as to the general applicability of these mechanisms. The authors also note that, "among some groups of predisposed individuals, easy access to a wide variety of engrossing and high-quality child pornography could serve as a substitute for involvement with actual victims".&lt;ref name="Onlinepred"/&gt;

According to the National District Attorneys Association of America, "In light of the documented link between individuals who view child pornography and individuals who actually molest children, each child pornography case should be viewed as a red flag to the possibility of actual child molestation."&lt;ref name=NDAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |title=From Fantasy to Reality: The Link Between Viewing Child Pornography and Molesting Children |accessdate=2008-05-03 |work=Child Sexual Exploitation Update - Volume 1, Number 3, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111204617/http://www.ndaa.org/publications/newsletters/child_sexual_exploitation_update_volume_1_number_3_2004.html |archivedate = 2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Carr, founding member of the United Kingdom Home Secretary’s Internet Task Force on Child Protection, in a report published by the [[Action for Children|NCH]] stated, "Many pedophiles acknowledge that exposure to child abuse images fuels their sexual fantasies and plays an important part in leading them to commit hands-on sexual offenses against children."&lt;ref name="Carr 2004"/&gt;

===Research===
A 1987 report by the U.S.A. [[National Institute of Justice]] described "a disturbing correlation" between traders of child pornography and acts of [[Child sexual abuse|child molestation]].&lt;ref name=NCJRS&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Arnold I Burns Before the Florida Law Enforcement Committee on Obscenity, Organized Crime and Child Pornography |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=109133 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |work=NCJ 109133 |date=1987-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 [[longitudinal study]] of 341 convicted child molesters in America found that pornography's use correlated significantly with their rate of sexually re-offending. Frequency of pornography use was primarily a further risk factor for higher-risk offenders, when compared with lower-risk offenders, and use of highly deviant pornography correlated with increased [[recidivism]] risk for all groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kingston DA, etal |title=Pornography use and sexual aggression: the impact of frequency and type of pornography use on recidivism among sexual offenders.|journal= Aggress Behav|year=2008|issue=34|pmid=18307171|pages=1–11|doi=10.1002/ab.20250|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of men who have been charged with or convicted of child pornography offenses show pedophilic profiles on [[phallometric testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Seto, M. C., Cantor, J. M., &amp; Blanchard, R. (2006). Child pornography offenses are a valid diagnostic indicator of pedophilia. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 115,'' U.S.A. 610–615.&lt;/ref&gt; A study with a sample of 201 adult male child pornography offenders using police databases examined charges or convictions after the index child pornography offense(s). 56% of the sample had a prior criminal record, 24% had prior contact sexual offenses, and 15% had prior child pornography offenses. One-third were concurrently charged with other crimes at the time they were charged for child pornography offenses. 17% of the sample offended again in some way during this time, and 4% committed a new contact sexual offense. Child pornography offenders with prior criminal records were significantly more likely to offend again in any way during the follow-up period. Child pornography offenders who had committed a prior or concurrent contact sexual offense were the most likely to offend again, either generally or sexually.&lt;ref&gt;Seto, M. C., &amp; Eke, A. W. (2005). The criminal histories and later offending of child pornography offenders. ''Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 17,'' 201–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mayo Clinic]] of the U.S.A., studies and case reports indicate that 30% to 80% of individuals who viewed child pornography and 76% of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child; however, they state that it is difficult to know how many people progress from computerized child pornography to physical acts against children and how many would have progressed to physical acts without the computer being involved.&lt;ref name="mayoclinic04_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Profile of Pedophilia: Definition, Characteristics of Offenders, Recidivism, Treatment Outcomes, and Forensic Issues |author=RYAN C. W. HALL; RICHARD C. W. HALL |journal=Mayo Clin Proc |date=April 2007 |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=457–471 |accessdate=2008-05-09 |doi=10.4065/82.4.457 |pmid=17418075 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528040559/http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by psychologists at the American [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] has concluded that "many Internet child pornography offenders may be undetected child molesters", finding a slightly higher percentage of molesters among child pornography offenders than the Mayo Clinic study, though they also "cautioned that offenders who volunteer for treatment may differ in their behavior from those who do not seek treatment." The study was withdrawn by Bureau officials from a peer-reviewed journal which had accepted it for publication, due to concerns that the results might be misinterpreted. Some researchers argued that the findings "do not necessarily apply to the large and diverse group of adults who have at some point downloaded child pornography, and whose behavior is far too variable to be captured by a single survey".&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/us/19sex.html |title=Debate on Child Pornography's Link To Molesting |publisher=New York Times |author=Julian Sher and Benedict Carey| date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child protection advocates and psychologists like [[Fred Berlin]], who heads the National Institute for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma, expressed disapproval over the failure to publish the report.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Criticism===
[[Dennis Howitt]] (1995) disagrees with such research, arguing the weakness of correlational studies. He argues that "one cannot simply take evidence that offenders use and buy pornography as sufficient to implicate pornography causally in their offending. The most reasonable assessment based on the available research literature is that the relationship between pornography, fantasy and offending is unclear."&lt;ref&gt;Howitt, Dennis (1995). "Paedophiles and Sexual Offences against Children," chapter 6. Loughborough University, UK; John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swiss study reviewing the criminal record of 231 men who were charged with viewing child pornography found that those without a prior sexual conviction are unlikely to sexually assault a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Endrass |first=Jérôme |last2=Urbaniok |first2=Frank |date=14 July 2009 |title=The consumption of Internet child pornography and violent and sex offending |url=http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-9-43 |journal=BMC Psychiatry |publisher= |volume=9 |issue=43 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-9-43 |access-date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swiss_study&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/study-finds-no-link-between-child-porn-and-sex-abuse/story-fn3dxity-1225749645592 |title=Study finds no link between child porn and sex abuse |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that in the six years before the 2002 police operation, 1% were known to have committed a hands-on sexual offense and 1% committed a hands-on sex offense in the six years afterwards. The study reinforces previous research that consumers are well-educated and view other types of illegal pornography like acts involving animals and violence as well. Author Frank Urbaniok said it should not automatically be assumed that they were a risk for sexually assaulting a child and said: "Our results support the assumption that these consumers, in fact, form a distinct group of sex offenders. Probably, the motivation for consuming child pornography differs from the motivation to physically assault minors. Furthermore, the recidivism rates of 1% for hands-on and 4% for hands-off sex offences were quite low."&lt;ref name=Swiss_study /&gt; A 2005 paper by Canadian researchers [[Michael Seto]] and Angela Eke found that of 201 men charged with child pornography offenses, 24% had committed prior offenses of sexual contact and 4% went on to commit subsequent sexual offenses after being charged or prosecuted.&lt;ref name=Swiss_study /&gt;

==Views on reducing criminal sexual intent==
Milton Diamond, from the [[University of Hawaii]], presented evidence that "[l]egalizing child pornography is linked to lower rates of child sex abuse". Results from the Czech Republic indicated, as seen everywhere else studied (Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA), that rape and other sex crimes "decreased or essentially remained stable" following the legalization and wide availability of pornography. His research also indicated that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen considerably since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible – a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan. The findings support the theory that potential sexual offenders use child pornography as a substitute for sex crimes against children. While the authors do not approve of the use of real children in the production or distribution of child pornography, they say that artificially produced materials might serve a purpose.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

Diamond suggests to provide [[Simulated child pornography|artificially created child pornography]] that does not involve any real children. His article relayed, "If availability of pornography can reduce sex crimes, it is because the use of certain forms of pornography to certain potential offenders is functionally equivalent to the commission of certain types of sex offences: both satisfy the need for psychosexual stimulants leading to sexual enjoyment and orgasm through masturbation. If these potential offenders have the option, they prefer to use pornography because it is more convenient, unharmful and undangerous. (Kutchinsky, 1994, pp. 21)."&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = M. | last2 = Jozifkova | first2 = E. | last3 = Weiss | first3 = P. | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9696-y | title = Pornography and Sex Crimes in the Czech Republic | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1037–1043; discussion 1043–50 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21116701| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies''' ({{lang-nl|Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|lit = Royal Institute for the Linguistics, Geography and [[Ethnology]]}}, abbreviated: '''KITLV''') at [[Leiden]] was founded in 1851. Its objective is the advancement of the study of the [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[social sciences]], and [[history]] of [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Area]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Special emphasis is laid on the former Dutch colonies of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]), [[Suriname]], and the [[Dutch West Indies]] (the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]). Its unique collection of books, manuscripts, prints and photographs attracts visiting scholars from all over the world. On July 1, 2014, the management of the collection was taken over by [[Leiden University Libraries]].

== Jakarta ==

In 1969, a KITLV office was started by [[Hans Ras]] in [[Jakarta]] ("KITLV-Jakarta"), as a part of an agreement with the [[Indonesian Institute of Sciences]]. Here, publications from Indonesia, [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] are bought and given a place in the library of the institute, publications of the institute are sold, and original scientific works in the [[Dutch language]] are translated into [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. The Jakarta office is, since July 1, 2014, part of [[Leiden University Libraries]] and Representative Office of Leiden University doubles as the [[representative office]] of Leiden University.

== Publications ==
The KITLV Press published and distributed academic books on Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies. It also published three journals: 
* ''[[Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde]]'',  
* ''Journal of Indonesian Social Sciences and Humanities'', and  
* ''[[New West Indian Guide]] / Nieuwe West-Indische Gids''. 
[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] acquired KITLV Press in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brill.com/news/brill-completes-acquisition-kitlv-press Brill Completes Acquisition of KITLV Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of security sector reform (SSR) is to achieve good security sector governance (SSG)—where security actors are effective and accountable to their people. For example, SSR might guide decision-making on what form should the oversight of armed forces take or how transparent will intelligence agencies be according to legislation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2151(2014)|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2151 (S/RES/2151) on Security sector reform: challenges and opportunities|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121073122/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2FRES%2F2151%282014%29|archivedate=2017-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different nomenclature of the same overall framework include '''security system reform''' ('''SSR'''), '''security sector reconstruction''' ('''SSR''') and '''justice and security sector reform''' ('''JSSR''').&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|title=Security Sector Reform: Applying the principles of good governance to the security sector|last=|first=|publisher=DCAF|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183845/http://www.dcaf.ch/sites/default/files/publications/documents/DCAF_BG_2_Security%20Sector%20Reform.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) adopted a Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security stating that the democratic control of the security sector as essential to stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|title=Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security|last=|first=|publisher=OSCE|year=1994|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829145812/http://www.osce.org/fsc/41355?download=true|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A framework for security sector reform (SSR) emerged in 1999 after [[international development]] actors observed from examples in [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and countries in Eastern Europe that national security and its components were considered crucial in a state recovering from [[War|conflict]] or an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regime]]. Reportedly, the increasing number of [[Civil war|civil wars]] led development actors to look at the problem of insecurity from the perspective of good governance. The conclusion was that the security sector should adhere to the same rules of good governance as any other public service to curb conflict and violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|title=SSR: Securing its success, justifying its relevance|last=Price|first=Megan|date=2014-08-19|work=Clingendael|access-date=|last2=van Veen|first2=Erwin|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234737/https://www.clingendael.nl/publication/ssr-securing-its-success-justifying-its-relevance|archivedate=2017-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the objective of SSR is defined as the application of the same principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector as to any other public sector service delivery, such as [[public health]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|title=About SSG/R|last=|first=|date=|website=DCAF (Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces)|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012716/http://dcaf.ch/about-ssgr|archivedate=2017-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (]]OECD) has defined four standards that SSR should strive for:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Establishment of effective governance, oversight and accountability in the security system; 2) improved delivery of security and justice services; 3) development of local leadership and ownership of the reform process; and 4) sustainability of justice and security service delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The target of SSR are the components of the state that uphold [[national security]]. Although the security sector is therefore a wide term open to interpretation, it is generally used to describe the structures, institutions and personnel responsible for the management, provision and oversight of security in a certain country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|title=The United Nations SSR Perspective|last=|first=|publisher=UN SSR Unit|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519215426/http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/publications/ssr/ssr_perspective_2012.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the scope and target of SSR has usually been defined comprising the following four groups:
* Core security actors, such as armed forces, police, gendarmerie, border guards, customs and immigration, and intelligence and security services;
* security management and oversight bodies, such as ministries of defence and internal affairs, financial management bodies and public complaints commissions;
* justice and law enforcement institutions, such as the judiciary, prisons, prosecution services, traditional justice systems; and
* non-statutory security forces, such as private security companies, guerrilla armies and private militia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|title=The OECD DAC Handbook on Security System Reform (SSR) - Supporting Security and Justice|last=|first=|publisher=OECD DAC|year=2007|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821172956/https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/deza/en/documents/themen/fragile-kontexte/224402-oecd-handbook-security-system-reform_EN.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|title=Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform - Report of the Secretary-General (A/62/659)|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905032133/http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/904B9EE812B7591FC12573F400322816/$file/Joint+Seminar_A-62-659_S-2008-39.pdf|archivedate=2014-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|title=Security Sector Reform|last=|first=|date=|work=Folke Bernadotte Academy|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826130304/https://fba.se/en/how-we-work/security-sector-reform/|archivedate=2016-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
[[File:SSG and SSR.png|thumb|A diagram of the relationship between security sector reform and governance relative to time and quality|left]]To observe and measure the quality of SSG as well as set more definite objectives, [[international development]] actors generally break down good security sector governance into different principless that are believed to showcase different subparts of a healthy security sector under democratic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|title=What is Good Governance?|last=|first=|date=2009-06-10|website=United Nations ESCAP|language=en|access-date=2017-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423153306/http://www.unescap.org/resources/what-good-governance|archivedate=2017-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While exact configurations vary, some of the most common principles or objectives of good SSG that are commonly used include [[accountability]], [[rule of law]], and [[effectiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|title=Security Sector Governance and Reform: Guidelines for OSCE Staff|last=|first=|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Vienna|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825185357/http://www.osce.org/secretariat/231176|archivedate=2017-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Thomas G.|date=2000-10-01|title=Governance, good governance and global governance: Conceptual and actual challenges|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713701075|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=21|issue=5|pages=795–814|doi=10.1080/713701075|issn=0143-6597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A multitude of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors: For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, the [[use of force]] is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent [[law]]s are in place; oversight and [[separation of powers]] mechanisms are established and working; and the state's [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] use of force is regulated through strategies and policies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An operational level example would be improved and open interaction between the public and the security sector, including functioning [[freedom of information]] and [[complaint]] institutes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

SSR is aimed at the existence of both national security and [[human security]]. However, the goals of providing national and human security can be conflictual in the context of conflict-torn societies which lack the framework of democratic governance. According to Florian Weigand, the experiences of SSR in [[Afghanistan]], for example, have prompted a debate on the advantages of providing human rather than state security in the process of state-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/pdf/WP/WP135.pdf|title=How can security sector reforms contribute to State-Building?

SSR is not understood by researchers to be limited to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, [[Provisional government|transitional]] and [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after [[war]] has ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|title=Security Governance in Post-Conflict Peacebuilding|last=Bryden|first=Alan|last2=Hänggi|first2=Heiner|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2005|isbn=978-3-8258-9019-3|location=Geneva|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915024200/http://www.dcaf.ch/security-governance-post-conflict-peacebuilding|archivedate=2017-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanaa, Jane.

{{Sociology}}

In [[sociology]], '''social psychology''', also known as '''sociological social psychology''' or '''microsociology''', is an area of sociology that focuses on [[social actions]] and on interrelations of [[personality]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and [[mind]] with [[social structure]] and [[culture]]. Some of the major topics in this field are [[social status]], structural 
power, [[Social change|sociocultural change]], [[social inequality]] and [[prejudice]], [[leadership]] and [[Group behaviour|intra-group behavior]], [[Social exchange theory|social exchange]], [[group conflict]], [[impression formation]] and [[Impression management|management]], [[Conversation analysis|conversation structures]], [[socialization]], [[social constructionism]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[role]]s, and [[emotional labor]]. The primary methods of data collection are [[Sampling (statistics)|sample surveys]], [[Observational study|field observations]], [[Vignette (psychology)|vignette studies]], [[field experiment]]s, and [[Design of experiments|controlled experiments]].

== History ==
Sociological social psychology was born in 1902 with the landmark study by sociologist [[Charles Horton Cooley]], ''Human Nature and the Social Order'', which presented Cooley's concept of the [[looking glass self]]. The first textbook in social psychology by a sociologist appeared in 1908—''Social Psychology'' by [[Edward Alsworth Ross]]. The area's main journal was founded as ''Sociometry'' by [[Jacob L. Moreno]] in 1937. The journal's name changed to ''Social Psychology'' in 1978, and to ''[[Social Psychology Quarterly]]'' in 1979.

In the 1920s [[W. I. Thomas]] contributed the notion of the [[definition of the situation]], with the [[Thomas theorem|proposition]] that became a basic tenet of sociology and sociological social psychology: "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences."

One of the major currents of theory in this area sprang from work by philosopher and sociologist [[George Herbert Mead]] at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1894 forward.  Mead generally is credited as the founder of [[symbolic interactionism]]. Mead's colleague and disciple at Chicago, sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]], coined the name of the framework in 1937.

Sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], at [[Harvard University]] from 1927 forward, developed a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[Action theory (sociology)|theory of action]] which was adapted to [[Communication in small groups|small group research]] by Parsons' student and colleague, [[Robert Freed Bales]], resulting in a body of observational studies of [[Social relation|social interaction]] in groups using Bales' behavior coding scheme, Interaction Process Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Bales, Robert Freed (1950), ''Interaction Process Analysis'', New York: Addison-Wesley. Some studies using the method are included in Hare, A. Paul, Edgar F. Borgatta, &amp; R. F. Bales (1955), ''Small Groups: Studies in Social Interaction'', New York: Alfred A. Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt; During his 41-year tenure at Harvard, Bales mentored a distinguished group of sociological social psychologists concerned with [[Group dynamics|group processes]] and other topics in sociological social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;See the list of Bales' students at pages 332-3 of R. F. Bales (1999), ''Social Interaction Systems: Theory and Measurement'', New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major frameworks==

=== Symbolic interactionism ===
{{main|Symbolic interactionism}}
Contemporary symbolic interactionism originated out of ideas of George Herbert Mead and [[Max Weber]]. In this framework meanings are constructed during social interaction, and constructed meanings influence the process of social interaction. Many symbolic interactionists see the self as a core meaning constructed through social relations, and influencing social relations.

The structural school of symbolic interactionism uses shared social knowledge from a [[Macrosociology|macro-level]] [[culture]], [[natural language]], [[Institution|social institution]], or [[organization]] to explain relatively enduring patterns of social interaction and psychology at the [[Microsociology|micro-level]], typically investigating these matters with [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]]. Identity theory,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheldon Stryker|Stryker, Sheldon]], &amp; Burke, Peter J. (2000). "The past, present, and future of an identity theory". ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''63''': 284–297. Burke, P. J., and Jan E. Stets (2009). ''Identity Theory'', New York, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[affect control theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Heise, David R. (1979). ''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action'', New York: Cambridge University Press. MacKinnon, N. J. (1994). ''Symbolic Interactionism as Affect Control'', Albany, NY, State University of New York Press. Heise, D. R. (2007). ''Expressive Orider: Confirming Sentiments in Social Actions'', New York, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iowa School&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Dan E. (2011). "Toward a Theory of Interaction: The Iowa School," ''Symbolic Interaction'' '''34''': 340-348.&lt;/ref&gt; are major programs of research in this tradition. Identity Theory and Affect Control Theory both focus on how actions control mental states, thereby manifesting the underlying cybernetic nature of the approach, evident in Mead's writings&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Neil J. (1994). ''Symbolic Interactionism as Affect Control'', Albany, NY, State University of New York Press. Pp. 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Affect Control Theory provides a [[mathematical model]] of [[role theory]] and of [[labeling theory]].

Process symbolic interactionism stems from the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] and considers the meanings underlying social interactions to be situated, creative, fluid, and often contested. Researchers in this tradition frequently use [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods. A journal, ''Symbolic Interaction'', was founded in 1977 by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction as a central outlet for the empirical research and [[Conceptual system|conceptual studies]] produced by scholars in this area.

[[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] symbolic interactionists understand the notions of self and identity to be increasingly fragmented and illusory, and consider attempts at theorizing to be [[meta-narrative]]s with no more authority than other conversations. The approach is presented in detail by ''The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research''.&lt;ref&gt;Denzin, Norman K. and Yvonna S. Lincoln, Eds. (2005). ''The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research'', Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social exchange ===
{{main|Social exchange theory}}
[[Social exchange theory]] emphasizes the idea that social action is the result of ''personal choices'' made in order to maximize benefits and minimize costs. A key component of this theory is the postulation of the ''"comparison level of alternatives"'', which is the actor's sense of the best possible alternative (i.e. the choice with the highest net benefits or lowest net costs).

Theories of social exchange share many essential features with classical economic theories like [[rational choice theory]]. However, social exchange theories differ from economic theories by making predictions about the relationships between persons, and not just the evaluation of goods. For example, social exchange theories  have been used to predict human behaviour in romantic relationships by taking into account each actor's subjective sense of costs (i.e., volatility, economic dependence), benefits (i.e., attraction, chemistry, attachment), and comparison level of alternatives (i.e., if any viable alternative mates are available).

=== Theory of Status Characteristics and Expectation States ===
{{main|Expectation states theory}}
[[Expectation states theory]] and its popular "sub-theory", status characteristics theory, proposes that individuals use available social information to form expectations for themselves and others. Group members use stereotypes about competence to attempt to determine who will be comparatively more skilled in any given task, indicating to whom the group should listen and accord [[Social status|status]]. Group members use known ability on the task at hand, membership in social categories (race, gender, age, education, etc.), and observed dominance behaviors (glares, rate of speech, interruptions, etc.) to determine everyone's relative ability and assign rank accordingly. While exhibiting dominant behavior or being of a certain race, for instance, has no direct connection to actual ability, implicit cultural beliefs about who is relatively more or less socially valued drive group members to "act as if" they believe some people have more useful contributions than others. As such, the theory has been used to explain the rise, persistence, and enactment of [[social status|status hierarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|title=Why Status Matters for Inequality|journal=American Sociological Review|date=2014|volume=79|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1177/0003122413515997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social structure and personality ===
This research perspective deals with relationships between large-scale social systems and individual behaviors and mental states including feelings, attitudes and values, and mental faculties.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Jane D. and Kathryn J. Lively (2003). “Social Structure and Personality.” Pp. 77-102 in ''Handbook of Social Psychology'' edited by [[John DeLamater|J. DeLamater]]. New York: Kluwer/Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers focus on issues of health and how social networks bring useful social support to the ill. Another line of research deals with how education, occupation, and other components of social class impact values. Some studies assess emotional variations, especially in happiness versus alienation and anger, among individuals in different structural positions.

=== Social influence ===
{{Main|Social influence}}
Social influence is a factor in every individual's life. Social influence takes place when one's thoughts, actions and feelings are affected by other people. It is a way of interaction that affects individual behavior and can occur within groups and between groups. It is a fundamental process that affects ways of socialization, conformity, leadership and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. R., Louis, W. R., &amp; Schultz, P. W. (2011). Introduction: Social influence in action. Group Processes &amp; GP Intergroup Relations, 14(5), 599–603.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dramaturgy ===
Another aspect of microsociology aims to focus on individual behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, [[Erving Goffman]], claims that humans tend to believe that they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he is speaking. Much like a play, Goffman believes that rules of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Your Name Here |url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~jmoody77/TheoryNotes/Goffman.htm |title=Goffman: PSEL |publisher=Soc.duke.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group processes ===
From the sociological perspective, group processes scholars study how [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[Social status|status]], [[justice]], and [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] impact the structure and interactions that take place within groups. Group processes scholars study how group size affects the type and quality of interactions that take place between group members, an area of study initiated by the work of the German social theorist, [[Georg Simmel]]. '''Dyads''' consist of two people and '''triads''' consist of three people, and the fundamental difference is that one person who leaves a dyad dissolves that group whereas the same is not true of a triad. The difference between these two types of groups also indicates the fundamental nature of group size, which is that every additional member of a group increases the group's stability but also decreases the possible amount of intimacy or interactions between any two members. [[Social group|Groups]] are also distinguished in terms of how and why the members know each other, and this stems from whether they are members of '''primary groups''' consisting of close friends and family held together by '''expressive ties'''; '''secondary groups''' consisting of coworkers, colleagues, classmates, etc. held together by '''instrumental ties'''; or '''reference groups''' consisting of people who do not necessarily know or interact with each other but who use each other for standards of comparison for appropriate behaviors. Group processes researchers also study interactions between groups, such as in the case of [[Muzafer Sherif]]'s [[Realistic conflict theory#Robbers cave study|Robbers Cave Experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohall, D.E., Milkie, M.A., Lucas, J.W. 2014.

[[File:Albi (2012.08) 02.jpg|thumb|[[Albi Cathedral]]]]
'''Southern French Gothic''' ({{lang-fr|gothique méridional}}) is a specific style of [[Gothic architecture]] developed in the south of France. It arose in the early 13th century following the victory of the [[Catholic church]] over the [[Cathar heresy|Cathars]], as the church sought to re-establish its authority in the region, and as a result church buildings typically present features drawn from military architecture.  Southern French Gothic is simpler and less ornate than [[French Gothic architecture|northern French Gothic]], and differs also in that the construction material is typically brick rather than stone. In time the style came to influence secular buildings as well as churches, and spread beyond the area where Catharism had flourished.

== Origins ==
During the rise of [[Cathar heresy|Catharism]], the luxury of Roman Catholic Church was constantly criticized by the Cathar ecclesiastics. After the political eradication of the Cathar aristocracy during the [[Albigensian crusade]] (1209-1229), the clergy of southern France understood that after having won the war, it was necessary for them to win back the minds of the population. In addition to setting up the [[Medieval Inquisition]], they adopted a more austere and uncluttered architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;fr:La cathédrale Sainte-Cécile, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical area ==
Southern French Gothic, as its name suggests, is found in the southern part of France, mainly in the regions where [[Catharism]] had developed, and which were subjected to religious and military repression from the North. The reconquest by the Catholic hierarchy gave rise to the construction or reconstruction of many religious buildings, but also of secular ones. The regions concerned are therefore the current départements of the Haute-Garonne ([[Toulouse]]), the Tarn ([[Albi]]), the Tarn-et-Garonne ([[Montauban]]), the Ariège, the Gers, the Aude, the Pyrénées-Orientales, the Hérault, with instances in neighboring départements as well.

== Characteristics == 
Southern French Gothic is characterized by the austerity of the constructions, such as the use of solid [[buttresses]] rather than [[flying buttresses]], while the openings are few and narrow. [[Romanesque architecture]] persisted for longer in the south of France than in the north, and the transition to Gothic was progressive. Many of the buildings in the Southern Gothic style are thus built with a single nave, and are covered by roof-frames resting on diaphragm arches.

=== Brick construction ===

[[Image:ArcMitre.jpg|thumb|180px|Bell Tower of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins of Toulouse]], illustration from the '' Dictionary '' of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]]]
In an area poor in stone, the typical construction material was brick, whose use in the Southern French Gothic of the regions of Toulouse, Montauban, and Albi became one of its distinguishing marks. The builders used techniques adapted to this material, such as the mitre arches typical of this style. Brick lends itself to geometric decorative compositions, and consequently there are few sculptures integrated into the architecture. Depending on the type of clay used, the bricks can be molded or rounded by abrasion. Some buildings use stone sparingly to create colour contrasts.

Neighbouring regions coming under this influence but dominated by stone construction often adopted the same architectural vocabulary.

=== Single nave ===
After the Cathar episode, one goal of the Catholic church was the recovery of the faithful through preaching (hence the foundation by [[Saint Dominic|Dominique de Guzmán]] of the [[Dominican Order|order of the Friars Preachers]]). To this end the preference was for the single nave, which promotes acoustics and places all the faithful under the gaze of the preacher. The nave is lined with side chapels, lodged between the buttresses, and surmounted by large windows that illuminate it.

However, the presence of a single nave is not necessarily related to this desire, but may be related to other considerationssuch as a single pre-existing nave. Conversely, the very wide nave of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins of Toulouse]] is divided by a row of pillars, but is nevertheless a single entity.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bell tower ===

The bell towers can be of all types, but two forms stand out: the "Toulouse" bell tower, and the wall belfry.

==== Octagonal "Toulouse" bell tower ====
In the Toulouse region the typical bell tower appeared in the Romanesque period, with an octagonal floor plan and storeys progressively decreasing in size. In the transition to Gothic, only the shape of the bays changed. Bell towers are usually surmounted by a spire, but a certain number of these are missing, either because they have been destroyed, or because the construction was interrupted. The typical example is the bell tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint-Sernin of Toulouse]], enhanced in the Gothic period with mitre arches succeeding the Romanesque arched windows, but there are also ogival bays.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Wall belfry ====
The other form of bell tower, more common in smaller buildings, is the wall belfry, also frequently characterised by mitre arches, and often resembling fortifications in having elements such as battlements and machicolations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Fortification elements ===

Defensive elements such as battlements, machicolations, walkways, and watchtowers are frequent in Southern Gothic churches. Most of the time, except in cases where the church is included in a defensive system, these elements have only a decorative and especially a symbolic role, tending to assert the power of the Church. At the church of Notre-Dame de Simorre, it was the 19th-century architect and conservationist [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] who added battlements and watchtowers to the top of the buttresses.

File:Eglise Saint-Nicolas de Toulouse.jpg|Church of Saint-Nicolas, Toulouse
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Secular buildings ==

The term "Southern French Gothic" is applied mainly to buildings of worship, churches and cathedrals. The same architectural principles of sobriety of construction, absence or limitation of carved decoration, massive appearance, and defensive elements can however be found in buildings used for other purposes. Examples in Toulouse include mansions and the [[Saint-Raymond Museum|Saint-Raymond College]]; in Albi, the [[Musée Toulouse-Lautrec|Berbie Palace]], etc ...

'''''The Inner Circle''''' is a novel by [[T. C. Boyle]] first published in 2004 about the development of [[sexology]] in the United States and about [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s rise to fame during the late 1940s and early 1950s as seen through the eyes of one of his loyal assistants.

This assistant, however, John Milk, is a fictional character rather than a historical person. Boyle makes it unmistakably clear in the "Author’s Note" that ''The Inner Circle'' "is a work of fiction, and [that] all characters and situations have been invented, with the exception of the historical figures of Alfred C. Kinsey and his wife, Clara Bracken (McMillen) Kinsey".

==Plot introduction==
''The Inner Circle'' revolves around the tensions that are bound to arise if a small group of people deliberately abandons the traditional moral values with which they were raised in favour of an unconventional outlook on love, marriage and sex. While Kinsey preaches that sex is nothing but a "[[hormone|hormonal]] function" devoid of [[emotion]], John Milk has extreme difficulty adjusting to this concept where his own wife — the young and beautiful Iris — is concerned.

==Plot summary==

Milk's sexual [[coming of age]] starts in 1939 when he is a student at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] and attends Kinsey’s “marriage course”, a [[lecture]] in which the renowned zoologist propounds his theories and his plans for the first time in front of a large audience. Still a [[virginity|virgin]], he makes Kinsey’s acquaintance when the latter interviews him in order to take his “sex history”. Kinsey makes Milk his personal assistant despite his inexperience, but he turns out to be a quick learner, and thus the young man becomes the first member of what will be “the inner circle”: a handful of men (and, up to a point, also their wives) who furiously collaborate under Kinsey’s dictatorial rule towards the publication of the two volumes later referred to as the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey Report]].

==Characters in ''The Inner Circle''==
*[[Alfred Kinsey]] – Professor conducting studies of sex at college Milk attends
*Clara Bracken Kinsey – Alfred's wife
*John Milk – Kinsey's assistant and protagonist
*Iris Milk – John's wife

==Literary significance and criticism==
While the novel garnered generally favorable reviews, some reviewers and readers consider ''The Inner Circle'' to be one of Boyle’s lesser novels. The criticisms generally cite slow-moving and somewhat predictable plotting, as well as an overly-linear storyline.

The German translation of the novel bears the more lurid title '''''Dr. Sex'''''.

'''Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde''' (12 February 1873, [[Leeuwarden]] &amp;ndash; 27 April 1937 near [[Locarno]] in a plane crash) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[physician]] and [[gynæcologist]] who served as  director at the Gynæcological Institute in [[Haarlem]]. His 1926 book ''Het volkomen huwelijk'' (''The Perfect Marriage'') made him an instant international celebrity. The book advocated knowledge and sensuality in erotic life. In [[Germany]] ''Die vollkommene Ehe'' reached its 42nd printing in 1932 in spite of the fact that it was placed on the list of forbidden books, [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In Protestant and social democratic [[Sweden]], ''Det fulländade äktenskapet'' was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s.

The English translation, ''[[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]]'' was the best-known work on its subject for several decades, and was reprinted 46 times in the original edition, selling well over a half-million copies.

He is credited with showing in 1905 that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle.  This contributed to the improvement of [[calendar-based methods]] of birth control, and later to the creation of other [[fertility awareness]] systems.

==Definition==
Theory of mind is a [[theory]] insofar as the mind is the only thing being directly observed.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; The presumption that others have a mind is termed a theory of mind because each human can only intuit the existence of their own mind through introspection, and no one has direct access to the mind of another. It is typically assumed that others have minds analogous to one's own, and this assumption is based on the reciprocal, social interaction, as observed in [[joint attention]],&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"&gt;{{citation | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Baron-Cohen | contribution = Precursors to a theory of mind: Understanding attention in others | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | pages = 233&amp;ndash;251 | publisher = B.

As originally defined, it enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of—and thus be used to explain and predict—the behavior of others.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; Being able to attribute mental states to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies, in part, that one must be able to conceive of the mind as a "generator of representations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = C. | year = 2000 | title = The impact of sign language on the cognitive development of deaf children: The case of theories of mind | url = | journal = Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education | volume = 5| issue =3| pages = 266–276 | doi = 10.1093/deafed/5.3.266 | pmid=15454505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = C. | last2 = Melot | first2 = A.-M. | year = 2005 | title = Metacognitive development of deaf children: Lessons from the appearance-reality and false belief tasks | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 16–25 | pmid = 15647063 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00389.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person does not have a complete theory of mind, it may be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment.

Theory of mind appears to be an innate potential ability in humans that requires social and other experience over many years for its full development. Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind. [[Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a broader [[hypercognitive]] ability of the human mind to register, monitor, and represent its own functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., &amp; Spanoudis, G.

Overton (Ed.), Biology, cognition and methods across the life-span. Volume 1 of the Handbook of life-span development (pp. 36-55), Editor-in-chief: R. M. Lerner. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empathy]] is a related concept, meaning the recognition and understanding of the states of mind of others, including their beliefs, desires and particularly emotions. This is often characterized as the ability to "put oneself into another's shoes". Recent [[ethology|neuro-ethological]] studies of animal behaviour suggest that even rodents may exhibit ethical or empathetic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, Franz B.M. (2007), "Commiserating Mice" ''Scientific American'', 24 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While empathy is known as emotional perspective-taking, theory of mind is defined as cognitive perspective-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Catherine A.|last2=Baird|first2=Abigail A.|last3=Grafton|first3=Scott T.|title=Differential role of the orbital frontal lobe in emotional versus cognitive perspective-taking|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=44|issue=3|pages=374–383|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.06.011|pmid=16112148|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on theory of mind, in humans and animals, adults and children, normally and atypically developing, has grown rapidly in the 35 years since [[David Premack|Premack]] and Guy Woodruff's paper, "Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?".&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978" /&gt; The emerging field of [[social neuroscience]] has also begun to address this debate, by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks demanding the understanding of an intention, belief or other mental state in others.

An alternative account of theory of mind is given within [[Operant conditioning|operant]] psychology and provides significant [[empirical evidence]] for a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within what is called [[Relational frame theory|relational frame theory]]. According to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.

==Philosophical and psychological roots==
Contemporary discussions of Theory of Mind have their roots in philosophical debate—most broadly, from the time of Descartes' ''Second Meditation'', which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind. Most prominent recently are two contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature, to theory of mind: [[theory-theory]] and [[simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]]. The theory-theorist imagines a veritable theory—"folk psychology"—used to reason about others' minds. The theory is developed automatically and innately, though instantiated through social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, P. (1996). Simulation and self-knowledge: a defence of the theory-theory. In P. Carruthers &amp; P.K. Smith, Eds. ''Theories of theories of mind.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also closely related to  [[Social perception|person perception]] and  [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]] from social psychology.

The intuitive assumption that others are minded is an apparent tendency we all share. We [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] non-human animals, inanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. [[Daniel Dennett]] referred to this tendency as taking an "[[intentional stance]]" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D. (1987). The Intentional Stance. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an important distinction between taking an "intentional stance" toward something and entering a "shared world" with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.

The philosophical roots of the relational frame theory (RFT) account of Theory of Mind arise from contextual psychology and refer to the study of organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with a historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on contextualism, a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Functional Contextualism | publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science | url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/functional_contextualism_0 | first=Eric | last=Fox | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the development of this ability in human [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], has identified several behavioral precursors to theory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with other people are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full-fledged theory. In studies with non-human animals and pre-verbal humans, in particular, researchers look to these behaviors preferentially in making inferences about mind.                                                                                    
                                                                                         
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] identified the infant's understanding of attention in others, a social skill found by 7 to 9 months of age, as a "critical precursor" to the development of theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251" /&gt; Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as "of interest", and that seeing can induce beliefs. Attention can be directed and shared by the act of pointing, a joint attention behavior that requires taking into account another person's mental state, particularly whether the person notices an object or finds it of interest. {{anchor|protodeclarative}} Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest ("protodeclarative pointing") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention and interests of another may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"/&gt;

Understanding of others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or "aboutness", is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The "intentional stance" has been defined by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dennett | first1 = Daniel C. | year = 1987 | title = Reprint of Intentional systems in cognitive ethology: The Panglossian paradigm defended (to p. 260) | journal = The Brain and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 343–390 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00016393}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires. Both 2- and 3-year-old children could discriminate when an experimenter intentionally vs. accidentally marked a box with stickers as baited.&lt;ref name="Call, J. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Call | first1 = J. | last2 = Tomasello | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing intentional from accidental actions in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and human children (Homo sapiens) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 192–206 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.112.2.192 | pmid = 9642787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in ontogeny, [[Andrew N. Meltzoff]] found that 18-month-old infants could perform target manipulations that adult experimenters attempted and failed, suggesting the infants could represent the object-manipulating behavior of adults as involving goals and intentions.&lt;ref name="Meltzoff, A. 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = A. | year = 1995 | title = Understanding the intentions of others: Re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 838–850 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.31.5.838 | pmid = 25147406 | pmc = 4137788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While attribution of intention (the box-marking) and knowledge (false-belief tasks) is investigated in young humans and nonhuman animals to detect precursors to a theory of mind, Gagliardi et al. have pointed out that even adult humans do not always act in a way consistent with an attributional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gagliardi | first1 = J. L. | year = 1995 | title = Seeing and knowing: Knowledge attribution versus stimulus control in adult humans (Homo sapiens) | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 109 | issue = 2| pages = 107–114 |name-list-format=vanc| display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.109.2.107 | pmid = 7758287 | last2 = Kirkpatrick-Steger | first2 = KK | last3 = Thomas | first3 = J | last4 = Allen | first4 = GJ | last5 = Blumberg | first5 = MS }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, adult human subjects made choices about baited containers when guided by confederates who could not see (and therefore, not know) which container was baited.

Recent research in developmental psychology suggests that the infant's ability to imitate others lies at the origins of both theory of mind and other social-cognitive achievements like perspective-taking and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Meltzoff | first = Andrew N. | contribution = Imitation as a mechanism of social cognition: Origins of empathy, theory of mind, and the representation of action | editor-last = Goswami | editor-first = Usha | title = Blackwell handbook of childhood cognitive development | pages = 6&amp;ndash;25 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780631218401 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meltzoff, the infant's innate understanding that others are "like me" allows it to recognize the equivalence between the physical and mental states apparent in others and those felt by the self. For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that is, that they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults. A test of imitation by Alexandra Horowitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horowitz | first1 = Alexandra C. | year = 2003 | title = Do humans ape? or Do apes human? Imitation and intention in humans and other animals | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 325–336 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.117.3.325 | pmid = 14498809 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.688.3721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that adult subjects imitated an experimenter demonstrating a novel task far less closely than children did. Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.

While much research has been done on infants, theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood and into late adolescence as the synapses (neuronal connections) in the prefrontal cortex develop. The prefrontal cortex is thought to be involved in planning and decision-making.&lt;ref name="Laghi 2016 207–216"&gt;{{citation | last = Laghi | first = Fiorenzo | year = 2016 | title = The Role of Nice and Nasty Theory of Mind in Teacher-Selected Peer Models for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–216 | doi = 10.1177/0748175615596784 | last2 = Lonigro | first2 = Antonia | last3 = Levanto | first3 = Simona | last4 = Ferraro | first4 = Maurizio | last5 = Baumgartner | first5 = Emma | last6 = Baiocco | first6 = Roberto }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children seem to develop theory of mind skills sequentially. The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may have '''false beliefs''' and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in individualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Etel | first = Evren | year = 2015 | title = Social Competence, Theory of Mind, and Executive Function in Institution-reared Turkish Children | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 519–529 | doi = 10.1177/0165025414556095 | last2 = Yagmurlu | first2 = Bilge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
There is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (''r'' = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milligan|first=Karen|last2=Astington|first2=Janet Wilde|last3=Dack|first3=Lisa Ain | title = Language and theory of mind: meta-analysis of the relation between language ability and false-belief understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 622&amp;ndash;646 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01018.x | pmid = 17381794 | date = March–April 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.

Pragmatic theories of communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Dan.|first=Sperber|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=Wilson, Deirdre.|isbn=978-0631198789|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=32589501}}&lt;/ref&gt; assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey. Since a verbal utterance is often underdetermined, and therefore, it can have different meanings depending on the actual context theory of mind abilities can play a crucial role in understanding the communicative and informative intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some empirical results&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|pmid=29934630|pmc=6015048|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners, which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.

Carol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. One idea was that the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development. The belief is that this type of language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Miller child"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Carol A. | title = Developmental relationships between language and theory of mind | journal = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 142&amp;ndash;154 | doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2006/014) | pmid = 16782686 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }} [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32501769/Miller_06_offprint.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1508793985&amp;Signature=CJF5VXW6%2B%2FaiCFjyDr%2FfqeLHkh8%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_What_Is_a_Theory_of_Mind.pdf Pdf.]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been suggested empirically by findings indicating that participation in family discussion predict scores on theory of mind tasks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffman | first1 = Ted | last2 = Slade | first2 = Lance | last3 = Crowe | first3 = Elena | title = The relation between children's and mothers' mental state language and theory-of-mind understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 734&amp;ndash;751 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00435 | pmid = 12038548 | date = May–June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://web.psy.otago.ac.nz/pdfs/Ted%27s%20PDF%27s/2002ChiDev.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as findings showing that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with their parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woolfe | first1 = Tyron | last2 = Want | first2 = Stephen C. | last3 = Siegal | first3 = Michael | title = Signposts to development: theory of mind in deaf children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;778 | doi =  10.1111/1467-8624.00437| date = May–June 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.70.4337 }} [http://www.tyronwoolfe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Signposts_Child_Development.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a child's understanding of mental state words such as "''think''" and "''believe''". Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language.&lt;ref name="Miller child" /&gt; Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Chris | last2 = Pure | first2 = Kiran | last3 = Furrow | first3 = David | title = Children's understanding of the modal expression of speaker certainty and uncertainty and its relation to the development of a representational theory of mind | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 722&amp;ndash;730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02815.x | pmid = 2364747 | jstor = 1130957 | date = June 1990 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence ("Jimmy thinks the world is flat") from its embedded complement ("the world is flat") and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development. Recognizing these sentential complements as being independent of one another is a relatively complex syntactic skill and has been shown to be related to increased scores on theory of mind tasks in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Villiers | first1 = Jill G. | last2 = Pyers | first2 = Jennie E.  | title = Complements to cognition: a longitudinal study of the relationship between complex syntax and false-belief-understanding | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1037&amp;ndash;1060 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00073-4 | date = January–March 2002 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these hypotheses, there is also evidence that the neural networks between the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely connected. The temporoparietal junction has been shown to be involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well as perceive and reproduce words. The temporoparietal junction also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces, voices, and biological motion, in addition to theory of mind. Since all of these areas are located so closely together, it is reasonable to conclude that they work together. Moreover, studies have reported an increase in activity in the TPJ when patients are absorbing information through reading or images regarding other peoples' beliefs but not while observing information about physical control stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saxe|first=R|author2=Kanwisher, N |title=People thinking about thinking people.

In older age, theory of mind capacities decline, irrespective of how exactly they are tested (e.g. stories, eyes, videos, false belief-video, false belief-other, faux pas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Julie D.|last2=Phillips|first2=Louise H.|last3=Ruffman|first3=Ted|last4=Bailey|first4=Phoebe E.|title=A meta-analytic review of age differences in theory of mind.|journal=Psychology and Aging|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=826–839|doi=10.1037/a0030677|pmid=23276217|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decline in other cognitive functions is even stronger, suggesting that social cognition is somewhat preserved. In contrast to theory of mind, empathy shows no impairments in aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Andrea M. F.|last2=Kanske|first2=Philipp|last3=Eppinger|first3=Ben|last4=Li|first4=Shu-Chen|date=2017-09-08|title=The Aging of the Social Mind - Differential Effects on Components of Social Understanding|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-10669-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=11046|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-10669-4|pmid=28887491|pmc=5591220|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...711046R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two kinds of theory of mind representations: cognitive (concerning the mental states, beliefs, thoughts, and intentions of others) and affective (concerning the emotions of others). Cognitive theory of mind is further separated into first order (e.g., I think she thinks that…) and second order (e.g., he thinks that she thinks that…). There is evidence that cognitive and affective theory of mind processes are functionally independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Kalbe |first= Elke |year= 2010 |title= Dissociating Cognitive from Affective Theory of Mind: A TMS Study |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945209002184 |journal= Cortex |volume= 46 |issue=6 |pages= 769–780 |doi= 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.010 |pmid= 19709653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies of Alzheimer’s disease, which typically occurs in older adults, the patients display impairment with second order cognitive theory of mind, but usually not with first order cognitive or affective theory of mind. However, it is difficult to discern a clear pattern of theory of mind variation due to age. There have been many discrepancies in the data collected thus far, likely due to small sample sizes and the use of different tasks that only explore one aspect of theory of mind. Many researchers suggest that the theory of mind impairment is simply due to the normal decline in cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duval | first = Céline | year = 2011 | title = Age Effects on Different Components of Theory of Mind | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381001000245X | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–642 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.10.025  | pmid = 21111637 | last2 = Piolino | first2 = Pascale | last3 = Benjanin | first3 = Alexandre | last4 = Eustache | first4 = Francis | last5 = Desgranges | first5 = Béatrice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural variations ===
Researchers have proposed that five key aspects of theory of mind develop sequentially for all children between the ages of three to five.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Henry M.|last2=Liu|first2=David|date=2004-03-01|title=Scaling of Theory-of-Mind Tasks|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=75|issue=2|pages=523–541|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00691.x|pmid=15056204|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-step theory of mind scale consists of the development of diverse desires (DD), diverse beliefs (DB), knowledge access (KA), false beliefs (FB), and hidden emotions (HE).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Australian, American and European children acquire theory of mind in this exact order,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shahaeian|first=Ameneh|last2=Peterson|first2=Candida C.|last3=Slaughter|first3=Virginia|last4=Wellman|first4=Henry M.|title=Culture and the sequence of steps in theory of mind development.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1239–1247|doi=10.1037/a0023899|pmid=21639620|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies with children in Canada, India, Peru, Samoa, and Thailand indicate that they all pass the false belief task at around the same time, suggesting that the children develop theory of mind consistently around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Callaghan, T., Rochat, P., Lillard, A., Claux, M. L., Odden, H., Itakura, S., ... &amp; Singh, S. (2005). Synchrony in the onset of mental-state reasoning: Evidence from five cultures. ''Psychological Science'', ''16''(5), 378-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, children from [[Iran]] and [[China]] develop theory of mind in a slightly different order. Although they begin the development of theory of mind around the same time, toddlers from these countries understand knowledge access (KA) before Western children but take longer to understand false beliefs (FB).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Fang, F., Liu, D., Zhu, L., &amp; Liu, G. (2006). Scaling of Theory-of-Mind Understandings in Chinese Children. ''Psychological Science'', ''17''(12), 1075–1081. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01830.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers believe this swap in the developmental order is related to the culture of [[collectivism]] in Iran and China, which emphasizes interdependence and shared knowledge as opposed to the culture of [[individualism]] in Western countries, which promotes individuality and conflicting opinions. Because of these different cultural values, Iranian and Chinese children might take longer to understand that other people have different, sometimes false, beliefs. This suggests that the development of theory of mind is not universal and solely determined by innate brain processes but also influenced by social and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Empirical investigation==
Whether children younger than 3 or 4 years old may have any theory of mind is a topic of debate among researchers. It is a challenging question, due to the difficulty of assessing what pre-linguistic children understand about others and the world.  Tasks used in research into the development of Theory of Mind must take into account the ''[[umwelt]]''—(the German word ''Umwelt'' means "environment" or "surrounding world")—of the pre-verbal child.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

=== False-belief task ===
One of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is gaining the ability to attribute ''false belief'': that is, to recognize that others can have beliefs about the world that are diverging. To do this, it is suggested, one must understand how knowledge is formed, that people's beliefs are based on their knowledge, that mental states can differ from reality, and that people's behavior can be predicted by their mental states. Numerous versions of the false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task done by Wimmer and Perner (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the [[Sally–Anne test|"'Sally-Anne' test"]] or "'Sally-Anne' task"), children are told or shown a story involving two characters. For example, the child is shown two dolls, Sally and Anne, who have a basket and a box, respectively. Sally also has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room. While she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
Another example is when a boy leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that the boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.&lt;ref name = Mitchell&gt;{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Peter | contribution =  Acquiring a theory of mind | editor-last1 = Slater | editor-first1 = Alan | editor-last2 = Bremner | editor-first2 = J.

The results of research using false-belief tasks have been fairly consistent: most normally developing children are able to pass the tasks from around age four.&lt;ref name="Roessler, Johannes "&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roessler, Johannes |title=When the Wrong Answer Makes Perfect Sense - How the Beliefs of Children Interact With Their Understanding of Competition, Goals and the Intention of Others |journal=University of Warwick Knowledge Centre |volume=August 2014 |year=2013 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/knowledge/culture/when-the-wrong-answer-makes-perfect-sense-how-the-beliefs-of-children-interact-with-their-understanding-of-competition-goals-and-the-intention-of-others | accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, while most children, including those with [[Down syndrome]], are able to pass this test, in one study, 80% of children diagnosed with [[autism]] were ''unable'' to do so.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, Frith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | ref = harv }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also adults can experience problems with false beliefs. For instance, when they show [[hindsight bias]], defined as: "the inclination to see events that have already happened as being more predictable than they were before they took place."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, P. (2011). Acquiring a Theory of Mind. In Alan Slater, &amp; Gavin Bremner (eds.) An Introduction to Developmental Psychology: Second Edition, BPS Blackwell. page 371&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment by Fischhoff in 1975, adult subjects who were asked for an independent assessment were unable to disregard information on actual outcome. Also in experiments with complicated situations, when assessing others' thinking, adults can be unable to disregard certain information that they have been given.&lt;ref name = Mitchell/&gt;

===Unexpected contents===
Other tasks have been developed to try to solve the problems inherent in the false-belief task. In the "Unexpected contents", or "Smarties" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called "[[Smarties]]". After the child guesses (usually) "Smarties", it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who has not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she responds that another person will think that "Smarties" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils. Gopnik &amp; Astington (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Child Development |year=1988 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=26–37 |doi=10.2307/1130386 |pmid=3342716 |vauthors=Gopnik A, Aslington JW |title=Children's understanding of representational change and its relation to the understanding of false belief and the appearance-reality distinction. }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children pass this test at age four or five years.

===Other tasks===
The "false-photograph" task&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaitchik | first1 = D. | year = 1990 | title = When representations conflict with reality: the preschooler's problem with false beliefs and "false" photographs | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 41–68 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(90)90036-J | pmid = 2340712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Thaiss | first2 = L. | year = 1992 | title = Domain specificity in conceptual development | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 225–51 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(92)90013-8 | pmid = 1643814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is another task that serves as a measure of theory of mind development. In this task, children must reason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs.  Within the false-photograph task, either a location or identity change exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sabbagh | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Moses | first2 = L.J. | year = 2006 | title = Executive functioning and preschoolers' understanding of false beliefs, false photographs, and false signs | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1034–1049 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00917.x | pmid = 16942504 | last3 = Shiverick | first3 = S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the location-change task, the examiner puts an object in one location (''e.g.'', chocolate in an open green cupboard), whereupon the child takes a Polaroid photograph of the scene.  While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (''e.g.'', a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action.  The examiner asks the child two control questions: "When we first took the picture, where was the object?" and "Where is the object now?".  The subject is also asked a "false-photograph" question: "Where is the object in the picture?" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: "Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?" and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

To make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized:  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards.  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with [[looking time]] as the dependent variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach, Cognition (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts,&lt;ref name="Meltzoff, A. 1995"/&gt; and rates of pretend play.&lt;ref name="Leslie, A. M. 1991 pp. 63-77"&gt;Leslie, A. M. (1991). Theory of mind impairment in autism. In A.

===Early precursors===
Recent research on the early precursors of theory of mind has looked at innovative ways at capturing preverbal infants' understanding of other people's mental states, including perception and beliefs. Using a variety of experimental procedures, studies have shown that infants from their first year of life have an implicit understanding of what other people see&lt;ref name="Poulin-Dubois, D., Sodian, B., Tilden, J., Metz, U., &amp; Schoepper, B. 2007 pp 401-425"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15248370701612951 |title=Out of Sight is Not Out of Mind: Developmental Changes in Infants' Understanding of Visual Perception During the Second Year |year=2007 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Sodian |first2=Beate |last3=Metz |first3=Ulrike |last4=Tilden |first4=Joanne |last5=Schoeppner |first5=Barbara |journal=Journal of Cognition and Development |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=401–425}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what they know.&lt;ref name="Onishi, K. H., &amp; Baillargeon, R. 2005 pp. 255-258"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1107621 |title=Do 15-Month-Old Infants Understand False Beliefs? |year=2005 |last1=Onishi |first1=K.

Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being "reliable", compared to someone whose visual perception was "unreliable". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable looker were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable looker did not differ for either search locations. These findings suggest that 16-month-old infants can differentially attribute beliefs about a toy's location based on the person's prior record of visual perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016715 |title=The effect of a looker's past reliability on infants' reasoning about beliefs |year=2009 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Chow |first2=Virginia |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1576–82 |pmid=19899915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deficits==
The theory of mind impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective-taking. This is also sometimes referred to as ''[[mind-blindness]]''. This means that individuals with a theory of mind impairment would have a difficult time seeing phenomena from any other perspective than their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Moore, S.| year = 2002 | title = Asperger Syndrome and the Elementary School Experience | publisher = Shawnee Mission, KS: Autism Asperger Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and have a difficult time with social reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Baker, J.| year = 2003 | title = Social Skills Training: for children and adolescents with Asperger Syndrome and Social-Communication Problems | publisher = Mission, KS: Autism Asperger Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of Mind deficits have been observed in people with [[autism spectrum]] disorders, people with [[schizophrenia]], people with [[nonverbal learning disorder]], people with [[attention deficit disorder]],&lt;ref name="pmid21289541"/&gt; persons under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain. Theory of mind deficits have also been observed in deaf children who are late signers (i.e., are born to hearing parents), but the deficit is due to the delay in language learning, not any cognitive deficit, and therefore disappears once the child learns sign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Peterson | first = Candida | year = 2016 | title = Peer Social Skills and Theory of Mind in Children with Autism, Deafness, or Typical Development | url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=b9cdfd9c-d261-4e85-97bb-bd48f2a9b7bd%40sessionmgr4007 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–57 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1037/a0039833 | pmid = 26524383 | last2 = Slaughter | first2 = Virginia | last3 = Moore | first3 = Chris | last4 = Wellman | first4 = Henry }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
In 1985 [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], [[Alan M. Leslie]] and [[Uta Frith]] suggested that children with [[autism]] do not employ theory of mind&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, Frith"/&gt; and suggested that autistic children have particular difficulties with tasks requiring the child to understand another person's beliefs. These difficulties persist when children are matched for verbal skills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of age and verbal ability in the theory of mind task performance of subjects with autism | author=Happe, FG | journal=Child Development | year=1995 | volume=66 | issue=3 | pages=843–55 | doi=10.2307/1131954 | pmid=7789204| jstor=1131954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been taken as a key feature of autism.

Many individuals classified as autistic have severe difficulty assigning mental states to others, and they seem to lack theory of mind capabilities.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991"&gt;{{citation | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon | contribution = Precursors to a theory of mind: Understanding attention in others | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: Evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | pages = 233&amp;ndash;251 | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780631171942 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who study the relationship between autism and theory of mind attempt to explain the connection in a variety of ways. One account assumes that theory of mind plays a role in the attribution of mental states to others and in childhood pretend play.&lt;ref name=Leslie&gt;{{citation | last = Leslie | first = Alan M. | contribution = Theory of mind impairment in autism | editor-last = Whiten | editor-first = Andrew | title = Natural theories of mind: Evolution, development, and simulation of everyday mindreading | publisher = Basil Blackwell | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780631171942 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leslie,&lt;ref name=Leslie/&gt; theory of mind is the capacity to mentally represent thoughts, beliefs, and desires, regardless of whether or not the circumstances involved are real. This might explain why some autistic individuals show extreme deficits in both theory of mind and pretend play. However, Hobson proposes a social-affective justification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hobson | first = R.P. | title = Autism and the development of mind | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, N.J. | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780863772399}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that with an autistic person, deficits in theory of mind result from a distortion in understanding and responding to emotions.  He suggests that typically developing human beings, unlike autistic individuals, are born with a set of skills (such as social referencing ability) that later lets them comprehend and react to other people's feelings.  Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental delay, so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies, because they experience difficulty in different stages of growth. Very early setbacks can alter proper advancement of joint-attention behaviors, which may lead to a failure to form a full theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991"/&gt;

It has been speculated&lt;ref name="Leslie, A. M. 1991 pp. 63-77"/&gt; that Theory of Mind exists on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] as opposed to the traditional view of a discrete presence or absence. While some research has suggested that some autistic populations are unable to attribute mental states to others,&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251"/&gt; recent evidence points to the possibility of coping mechanisms that facilitate a spectrum of mindful behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dapretto | first1 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–30 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1038/nn1611 | pmid = 16327784 | last2 = Davies | first2 = MS | last3 = Pfeifer | first3 = JH | last4 = Scott | first4 = AA | last5 = Sigman | first5 = M | last6 = Bookheimer | first6 = SY | last7 = Iacoboni | first7 = M | pmc = 3713227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tine et al. suggest that [[autistic]] children score substantially lower on measures of social theory of mind in comparison to  children diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/505393 |pmid=22934174 |pmc=3420603 |title=Unique Theory of Mind Differentiation in Children with Autism and Asperger Syndrome |year=2012 |last1=Tine |first1=Michele |last2=Lucariello |first2=Joan |journal=Autism Research and Treatment |volume=2012 |pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, children with more advanced theory of mind abilities display more advanced social skills, greater adaptability to new situations, and greater cooperation with others. As a result, these children are typically well-liked.

Peer-mediated interventions (PMI) are a school-based treatment approach for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder in which peers are trained to be role models in order to promote social behavior. Laghi et al. studied if analysis of prosocial (nice) and antisocial (nasty) theory of mind behaviors could be used, in addition to teacher recommendations, to select appropriate candidates for PMI programs. Selecting children with advanced theory of mind skills who use them in prosocial ways will theoretically make the program more effective. While the results indicated that analyzing the social uses of theory of mind of possible candidates for a PMI program is invaluable, it may not be a good predictor of a candidate's performance as a role model.&lt;ref name="Laghi 2016 207–216"/&gt;

The autistic deficit in Theory of Mind has been challenged by some, who cite both insufficient evidence and contradictory evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vera|first=F|title=Illusions of Explanation: A Critical Review of the "Theory of Mind" Account of Autism|url=https://www.academia.edu/11175559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ariane-zurcher/autism-theory_b_1594706.html|title=Debunking the Theory of Mind|last=Zurcher|first=Ariane|date=2012-06-18|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate theory of apparent Theory of Mind deficits comes out of the [[social model of disability]], and posits that such deficits are a result of autistic individuals' status as a neurological minority, and the challenges that result from having to model the typical (non-spectrum) mind against their own, resulting in deficits compared with a typical mind modeling another typical mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://semioticspectrumite.wordpress.com/2018/01/26/the-belief-in-theory-of-mind-is-a-disability/|title=The belief in a theory of mind is a disability|date=2018-01-26|work=Semiotic Spectrumite|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
Individuals with the diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]] can show deficits in theory of mind. Mirjam Sprong and colleagues investigated the impairment by examining 29 different studies, with a total of over 1500 participants.&lt;ref name=Sprong&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprong | first1 = M. | last2 = Schothorst | first2 = P. | last3 = Vos | first3 = E. | last4 = Hox | first4 = J. | last5 = Van Engeland | first5 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 191 | issue = 1| pages = 5–13 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.107.035899 | pmid = 17602119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[meta-analysis]] showed significant and stable deficit of theory of mind in people with schizophrenia. They performed poorly on false-belief tasks, which test the ability to understand that others can hold false beliefs about events in the world, and also on intention-inference tasks, which assess the ability to infer a character's intention from reading a short story. Schizophrenia patients with [[negative symptoms]], such as lack of emotion, motivation, or speech, have the most impairment in theory of mind and are unable to represent the mental states of themselves and of others. Paranoid schizophrenic patients also perform poorly because they have difficulty accurately interpreting others' intentions. The meta-analysis additionally showed that IQ, gender, and age of the participants does not significantly affect the performance of theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref name=Sprong /&gt;

Current research suggests that impairment in theory of mind negatively affects clinical insight, the patient's awareness of their mental illness.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ng | first1 = R. | last2 = Fish | first2 = S. | last3 = Granholm | first3 = E. | year = 2015 | title = Insight and theory of mind in schizophrenia | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 225 | issue = 1–2| pages = 169–174 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.11.010 | pmid = 25467703 | pmc=4269286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insight requires theory of mind—a patient must be able to adopt a third-person perspective and see the self as others do.&lt;ref name=Konstan&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Konstantakopoulos | first1 = G. | last2 = Ploumpidis | first2 = D. | last3 = Oulis | first3 = P. | last4 = Patrikelis | first4 = P. | last5 = Nikitopoulou | first5 = S. | last6 = Papadimitriou | first6 = G.

Therapies that teach patients perspective-taking and self-reflection skills can improve abilities in reading social cues and taking the perspective of another person.&lt;ref name=Ng /&gt;

The majority of the current literature supports the argument that the theory of mind deficit is a stable trait-characteristic rather than a state-characteristic of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=Cassetta&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cassetta | first1 = B. | last2 = Goghari | first2 = V. | year = 2014 | title = Theory of mind reasoning in schizophrenia patients and non-psychotic relatives | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 218 | issue = 1–2| pages = 12–19 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2014.03.043 | pmid = 24745472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis conducted by Sprong et al. showed that patients in remission still had impairment in theory of mind. The results indicate that the deficit is not merely a consequence of the active phase of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=Sprong /&gt;

Schizophrenic patients' deficit in theory of mind impairs their daily interactions with others. An example of a disrupted interaction is one between a schizophrenic parent and a child. Theory of mind is particularly important for parents, who must understand the thoughts and behaviors of their children and react accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the ability to understand another person's thoughts, and the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person's thoughts.&lt;ref name=Mehta&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehta | first1 = U.

===Alcohol use disorders===
Impairments in theory of mind, as well as other social-cognitive deficits are commonly found in people suffering from [[alcoholism]], due to the [[neurotoxic]] effects of alcohol on the brain, particularly the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="pmid18412750"/&gt;

===Depression and dysphoria===
Individuals in a current [[major depressive episode]], a disorder characterized by social impairment, show deficits in theory of mind decoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = L. | last2 = Harkness | first2 = K.

===Developmental language disorder===
Children diagnosed with [[Developmental language disorder]] (DLD) exhibit much lower scores on reading and writing sections of standardized tests, yet have a normal nonverbal IQ.  These language deficits can be any specific deficits in lexical semantics, syntax, or pragmatics, or a combination of multiple problems. They often exhibit poorer social skills than normally developing children, and seem to have problems decoding beliefs in others. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that children with DLD have substantially lower scores on theory of mind tasks compared to typically developing children.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nilsson | first1 = Kristine Kahr | last2 = de López| first2 = Kristine Jensen | title = Theory of mind in children with specific language impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | pages = 143&amp;ndash;153 | doi = 10.1111/cdev.12462 | pmid = 26582261 | date = January–February 2016 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strengthens the claim that language development is related to theory of mind.

==Brain mechanisms==

=== In typically developing humans ===
Research on theory of mind in [[autism]] led to the view that mentalizing abilities are subserved by dedicated mechanisms that can -in some cases- be impaired while general cognitive function remains largely intact.

[[Neuroimaging]] research has supported this view, demonstrating specific brain regions consistently engaged during theory of mind tasks. [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] research on theory of mind, using verbal and pictorial story comprehension tasks, has identified a set of brain regions including the [[prefrontal cortex|medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC), and area around posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] (pSTS), and sometimes [[precuneus]] and [[amygdala]]/[[Brodmann area 38|temporopolar cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 |title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' |year=2003 |last1=Gallagher |first1=Helen L. |last2=Frith |first2=Christopher D. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=77–83 |pmid=12584026|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, research on the neural basis of theory of mind has diversified, with separate lines of research focused on the understanding of beliefs, intentions, and more complex properties of [[minds]] such as psychological traits.

Studies from [[Rebecca Saxe]]'s lab at MIT, using a false-belief versus false-photograph task contrast aimed at isolating the mentalizing component of the false-belief task, have very consistently found activation in mPFC, precuneus, and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right-lateralized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00230-1 |title=People thinking about thinking peopleThe role of the temporo-parietal junction in "theory of mind" |year=2003 |last1=Saxe |first1=R |last2=Kanwisher |first2=N |journal=NeuroImage |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1835–42 |pmid=12948738|title-link=Temporoparietal junction }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17470910601000446 |title=Reading minds versus following rules: Dissociating theory of mind and executive control in the brain |year=2006 |last1=Saxe |first1=Rebecca |last2=Schulz |first2=Laura E. |last3=Jiang |first3=Yuhong V. |journal=Social Neuroscience |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |pages=284–98 |pmid=18633794|citeseerx=10.1.1.392.1433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, it has been proposed that the right TPJ ([[rTPJ]]) is selectively involved in representing the beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01768.x |title=It's the Thought That Counts: Specific Brain Regions for One Component of Theory of Mind |year=2006 |last1=Saxe |first1=R. |last2=Powell |first2=L. J. |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=692–9 |pmid=16913952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some debate exists, as some scientists have noted that the same rTPJ region has been consistently activated during spatial reorienting of visual attention;&lt;ref name=DecLamm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1073858407304654 |title=The Role of the Right Temporoparietal Junction in Social Interaction: How Low-Level Computational Processes Contribute to Meta-Cognition |year=2007 |last1=Decety |first1=J. |last2=Lamm |first2=C. |journal=The Neuroscientist |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=580–93 |pmid=17911216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhm051 |title=Activity in Right Temporo-Parietal Junction is Not Selective for Theory-of-Mind |year=2007 |last1=Mitchell |first1=J. P. |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=262–71 |pmid=17551089}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Decety]] from the University of Chicago and Jason Mitchell from Harvard have thus proposed that the rTPJ subserves a more general function involved in both false-belief understanding and attentional reorienting, rather than a mechanism specialized for social cognition. However, it is possible that the observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be due to adjacent, but distinct, neuronal populations that code for each. The resolution of typical fMRI studies may not be good enough to show that distinct/adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these processes. In a study following Decety and Mitchell, Saxe and colleagues used higher-resolution fMRI and showed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately 6-10mm above the peak for representing beliefs. Further corroborating that differing populations of neurons may code for each process, they found no similarity in the patterning of fMRI response across space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004869 |title=Distinct Regions of Right Temporo-Parietal Junction Are Selective for Theory of Mind and Exogenous Attention |year=2009 |editor1-last=Lauwereyns |editor1-first=Jan |last1=Scholz |first1=Jonathan |last2=Triantafyllou |first2=Christina |last3=Whitfield-Gabrieli |first3=Susan |last4=Brown |first4=Emery N. |last5=Saxe |first5=Rebecca |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4869 |pmid=19290043 |pmc=2653721|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4869S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional imaging has also been used to study the detection of mental state information in Heider-Simmel-esque animations of moving geometric shapes, which typical humans automatically perceive as social interactions laden with intention and emotion.  Three studies found remarkably similar patterns of activation during the perception of such animations versus a random or deterministic motion control: mPFC, pSTS, [[fusiform face area]] (FFA), and amygdala were selectively engaged during the Theory of Mind condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2000.0612 |title=Movement and Mind: A Functional Imaging Study of Perception and Interpretation of Complex Intentional Movement Patterns |year=2000 |last1=Castelli |first1=Fulvia |last2=Happé |first2=Francesca |last3=Frith |first3=Uta |last4=Frith |first4=Chris |journal=NeuroImage |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=314–25 |pmid=10944414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02643290342000005 |title=Neural Foundations for Understanding Social and Mechanical Concepts |year=2003 |last1=Martin |first1=Alex |last2=Weisberg |first2=Jill |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology |volume=20 |issue=3–6 |pages=575–87 |pmid=16648880 |pmc=1450338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1208 |title=The role of the fusiform face area in social cognition: Implications for the pathobiology of autism |year=2003 |last1=Schultz |first1=R.

Note that this region is distinct from the temporo-parietal area activated during false belief tasks.&lt;ref name=Saxe4/&gt;  Also note that pSTS activation in most of the above studies was largely right-lateralized, following the general trend in neuroimaging studies of social cognition and perception. Also right-lateralized are the TPJ activation during false belief tasks, the STS response to biological motion, and the FFA response to faces.

[[neuropsychology|Neuropsychological]] evidence has provided support for neuroimaging results regarding the neural basis of theory of mind.  Studies with patients suffering from a lesion of the [[frontal lobes]] and the [[temporoparietal junction]] of the brain (between the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]]) reported that they have difficulty with some theory of mind tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rowe|first1=Andrea D|last2=Bullock|first2=Peter R|last3=Polkey|first3=Charles E|last4=Morris|first4=Robin G|title='Theory of mind' impairments and their relationship to executive functioning following frontal lobe excisions|journal=Brain|date=2001|volume=124|issue=3|pages=600–616|doi=10.1093/brain/124.3.600|pmid=11222459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn1223 |title=Left temporoparietal junction is necessary for representing someone else's belief |year=2004 |last1=Samson |first1=Dana |last2=Apperly |first2=Ian A |last3=Chiavarino |first3=Claudia |last4=Humphreys |first4=Glyn W |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=499–500 |pmid=15077111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows that theory of mind abilities are associated with specific parts of the human brain.

Similarly, [[fMRI]] studies with human participants have shown brain regions (assumed to contain mirror neurons) that are active when one person sees another person's goal-directed action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030079 |title=Grasping the Intentions of Others with One's Own Mirror Neuron System |year=2005 |last1=Iacoboni |first1=Marco |last2=Molnar-Szakacs |first2=Istvan |last3=Gallese |first3=Vittorio |last4=Buccino |first4=Giovanni |last5=Mazziotta |first5=John C. |last6=Rizzolatti |first6=Giacomo |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=e79 |pmid=15736981 |pmc=1044835}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These data have led some authors to suggest that mirror neurons may provide the basis for theory of mind in the brain, and to support simulation theory of mind reading (see above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5 |title=Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading |year=1998 |last1=Gallese |first1=V |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=493–501 |pmid=21227300 |last2=Goldman |first2=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence against the link between mirror neurons and theory of mind.  First, [[macaque|macaque monkeys]] have mirror neurons but do not seem to have a 'human-like' capacity to understand theory of mind and belief.  Second, [[fMRI]] studies of theory of mind typically report activation in the mPFC, temporal poles and TPJ or STS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1218 |title=Development and neurophysiology of mentalizing |year=2003 |last1=Frith |first1=U. |last2=Frith |first2=C.

Some investigators, like developmental psychologist [[Andrew Meltzoff]] and neuroscientist [[Jean Decety]], believe that mirror neurons merely facilitate learning through imitation and may provide a precursor to the development of Theory of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 |title=What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience |year=2003 |last1=Meltzoff |first1=A.

In a recent paper, [[Keren Haroush]] and [[Ziv Williams]] outlined the case for a group of [[neuron]]s in primates' brains that uniquely predicted the choice selection of their interacting partner. These primates' neurons, located in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] of rhesus monkeys, were observed using single-unit recording while the monkeys played a variant of the iterative [[prisoner's dilemma]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haroush K, Williams Z |year=2015 |title=Neuronal Prediction of Opponent's Behavior during Cooperative Social Interchange in Primates |journal=Cell |volume=160 |issue=6 |pages=1233–1245 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.045 |pmid=25728667 |pmc=4364450}}&lt;/ref&gt; By identifying cells that represent the yet unknown intentions of a game partner, Haroush &amp; Williams' study supports the idea that theory of mind may be a fundamental and generalized process, and suggests that ''[[anterior cingulate cortex]]'' neurons may potentially act to complement the function of mirror neurons during [[social interchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanfey AG, Civai C, Vavra P |year=2015 |title=Predicting the other in cooperative interactions |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661315001217 |journal=Trends Cogn.

===In autism===
Several neuroimaging studies have looked at the neural basis theory of mind impairment in subjects with [[Asperger syndrome]] and [[high-functioning autism]] (HFA).  The first PET study of theory of mind in autism (also the first neuroimaging study using a task-induced activation paradigm in autism) replicated a prior study in normal individuals, which employed a story-comprehension task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Happe  | year = 1996 | title = 'Theory of mind' in the brain.

However, because the study used only six subjects with autism, and because the spatial resolution of PET imaging is relatively poor, these results should be considered preliminary.

A subsequent fMRI study scanned normally developing adults and adults with HFA while performing a "reading the mind in the eyes" task: viewing a photo of a human's eyes and choosing which of two adjectives better describes the person's mental state, versus a gender discrimination control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = et al | title = Social intelligence in the normal and autistic brain: an fMRI study | journal = [[European Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 1891&amp;ndash;1898 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00621.x | pmid = 10336657 | date = June 1999 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors found activity in [[orbitofrontal cortex]], STS, and amygdala in normal subjects, and found no amygdala activation and abnormal STS activation in subjects with autism.

A more recent PET study looked at brain activity in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while viewing Heider-Simmel animations (see above) versus a random motion control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castelli  | year = 2002 | title = Autism, Asperger syndrome and brain mechanisms for the attribution of mental states to animated shapes | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 8| pages = 1839–1849 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awf189 | pmid = 12135974 | first1 = F | last2 = Frith | first2 = C | last3 = Happé | first3 = F | last4 = Frith | first4 = U }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to normally developing subjects, those with autism showed no STS or FFA activation, and significantly less mPFC and amygdala activation.  Activity in [[extrastriate cortex|extrastriate regions]] V3 and LO was identical across the two groups, suggesting intact lower-level visual processing in the subjects with autism.  The study also reported significantly less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group.  Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations in subjects with autism. A more informative analysis would be to compute functional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all-time series.

A subsequent study, using the incongruent/congruent gaze-shift paradigm described above, found that in high-functioning adults with autism, posterior STS (pSTS) activation was undifferentiated while they watched a human shift gaze toward a target and then toward adjacent empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelphrey  | year = 2005 | title = Neural basis of eye gaze processing deficits in autism | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 128 | issue = Pt 5| pages = 1038–1048 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh404 | pmid = 15758039 | first1 = KA | last2 = Morris | first2 = JP | last3 = McCarthy | first3 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of additional STS processing in the incongruent state may suggest that these subjects fail to form an expectation of what the actor should do given contextual information, or that feedback about the violation of this expectation doesn't reach STS. Both explanations involve an impairment in the ability to link eye gaze shifts with intentional explanations.  This study also found a significant anticorrelation between STS activation in the incongruent-congruent contrast and social subscale score on the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]], but not scores on the other subscales.

In 2011, an fMRI study demonstrated that the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=NeuroImage |year=2011 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=1832–1838 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.067 |pmid=21356316 |vauthors=Lombardo MV, Chakrabarti B, Bullmore ET, MRC AIMS Consortium, Baron-Cohen S |title=Specialization of right temporo-parietal junction for mentalizing and its relation to social impairments in autism }}&lt;/ref&gt;  rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information, irrespective of whether it is about oneself or others. It also points to an explanation at the neural level for the pervasive [[mind-blindness]] difficulties in autism that are evident throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=325 |issue=5942 |pages=883–885 |doi=10.1126/science.1176170 |pmid=19608858 |vauthors=Senju A, Southgate V, White S, Frith U |title=Mindblind eyes: an absence of spontaneous theory of mind in Asperger syndrome }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In schizophrenia===
The brain regions associated with theory of mind include the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STS), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the precuneus, and the amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = A. | last2 = Koelkebeck | first2 = K. | last3 = Brandt | first3 = M. | last4 = Wee | first4 = M. | last5 = Kueppers | first5 = K.

==Evolution==

The evolutionary origin of theory of mind remains obscure. While many theories make claims about its role in the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that Theory of Mind has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0112-x |title=Theory of Mind: Towards an Evolutionary Theory |year=2018 |last=Tsoukalas |first=Ioannis |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38–66}}[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCwSs2TrvPwwSU8rDyUkvtLYAuYfylMD/view?usp=sharing Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.

==Non-human==
{{see also|Animal consciousness|Theory of mind in animals}}

An open question is if other animals besides humans have a [[genetics|genetic]] endowment and [[social psychology|social]] environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind in the same way that human children do.&lt;ref name="Premack, D. G. 1978"/&gt; This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]] or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], [[consciousness]] and [[qualia]]. One difficulty with non-human studies of Theory of Mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.

Non-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Call and Tomasello's study&lt;ref name="Call, J. 1998"/&gt; that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts. Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using [[plover]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ristau |first1=Carolyn A. |year=1991 |chapter=Aspects of the cognitive ethology of an injury-feigning bird, the piping plovers |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKzhZYiQfZEC&amp;pg=PA91 |editor1-first=Carolyn A. |editor1-last=Ristau |title=Cognitive Ethology: Essays in Honor of Donald R. Griffin |pages=91–126 |location=Hillsdale, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=978-1-134-99085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0175-y |title=Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play |year=2008 |last1=Horowitz |first1=Alexandra |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=12 |pages=107–18 |pmid=18679727 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have shown preliminary evidence of understanding attention—one precursor of theory of mind—in others.

There has been some controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability—or inability—in animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00053-6 |title=Chimpanzee minds: Suspiciously human? |year=2003 |last1=Povinelli |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Vonk |first2=Jennifer |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=157–160 |pmid=12691763|citeseerx=10.1.1.494.1478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli ''et al.'' (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Povinelli | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Boysen | first3 = S.T. | year = 1990 | title = Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | pmid = 2225758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from whom to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one of a variety of mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can only guess. They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the "knower". By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139–151 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 | pmid=11170704}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached. William Field and [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh]] have no doubt that bonobos have developed Theory of Mind and cite their communications with a well known captive bonobo, [[Kanzi]], as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Jon|title=A Voluble Visit with Two Talking Apes|url=https://www.npr.org/2006/07/08/5503685/a-voluble-visit-with-two-talking-apes|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 experiment, ravens ''[[Corvus corax]]'' were shown to take into account visual access of unseen conspecifics. It is suspected that "ravens can generalize from their own perceptual experience to infer the possibility of being seen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160202/ncomms10506/full/ncomms10506.html | title=Ravens attribute visual access to unseen competitors | author1=Thomas Bugnyar|author2=Stephan A.

== Evolution of transgender terminology ==
Psychiatrist John F. Oliven of [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University]] coined the term ''transgender'' in his 1965 reference work ''Sexual Hygiene and Pathology'', writing that the term which had previously been used, ''[[transsexual]]ism'', "is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism' is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000441-196508000-00054 |title=Sexual Hygiene and Pathology |journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences |volume=250 |issue=2 |pages=235 |year=1965 |last1=Oliven |first1=John F. }}: "Where the compulsive urge reaches beyond female vestments, and becomes an urge for gender ("sex") change, transvestism becomes "transsexualism." The term is misleading; actually, "transgenderism" is what is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism. Psychologically, the transsexual often differs from the simple cross-dresser; he is conscious at all times of a strong desire to be a woman, and the urge can be truly consuming.", p. 514&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rawson |first=K.

== Transsexual and its relationship to transgender ==
{{dablink|See also: [[Transsexual]], especially {{format link|Transsexual#Terminology}}}}

The term ''transsexual'' was introduced to English in 1949 by [[David Oliver Cauldwell]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] coined the German term "Transsexualismus" in 1923, which Cauldwell translated into English.&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Harry Benjamin]] in 1966, around the same time ''transgender'' was coined and began to be popularized.&lt;ref name="Bevan" /&gt; Since the 1990s, ''transsexual'' has generally been used to describe the subset of ''transgender'' people&lt;ref name="Bevan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TR2006"&gt;''Transgender Rights'' (2006, {{ISBN|0-8166-4312-1}}), edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M. Juang, Shannon Minter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alegria"&gt;A. C. Alegria, ''Transgender identity and health care: Implications for psychosocial and physical evaluation'', in the ''Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners'', volume 23, issue 4 (2011), pages 175–182: "Transgender, Umbrella term for persons who do not conform to gender norms in their identity and/or behavior (Meyerowitz, 2002). Transsexual, Subset of transgenderism; persons who feel discordance between natal sex and identity (Meyerowitz, 2002)."&lt;/ref&gt; who desire to transition permanently to the gender with which they identify and who seek medical assistance (for example, [[sex reassignment surgery]]) with this. However, the concerns of the two groups are sometimes different; for example, transsexual men and women who can pay for medical treatments (or who have institutional coverage for their treatment) are likely to be concerned with [[medical privacy]] and establishing a durable legal status as their gender later in life.

Distinctions between the terms ''transgender'' and ''transsexual'' are commonly based on [[Sex and gender distinction|distinctions between ''gender'' (psychological, social) and ''sex'' (physical)]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Virginia Prince]] used ''transgender'' to distinguish cross-dressers from trans''sexual'' people ({{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/prince_vc.html |title=glbtq &gt; social sciences &gt;&gt; Prince, Virginia Charles |publisher=glbtq.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211063223/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/prince_vc.html |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}), writing in ''Men Who Choose to Be Women'' (in ''Sexology'', February 1969) that "I, at least, know the difference between sex and gender and have simply elected to change the latter and not the former."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=81336 |title=Sex -- Medical Definition |publisher=medilexicon.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012037/http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=81336 |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}: defines sex as a biological or physiological quality, while gender is a (psychological) "category to which an individual is assigned by self or others...".&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, transsexuality may be said to deal more with physical aspects of one's sex, while transgender considerations deal more with one's psychological gender disposition or predisposition, as well as the related social expectations that may accompany a given gender role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.uncw.edu/etd/2006/swanstromn/novaswanstrom.pdf UNCW: Developing and Implementing a Scale to Assess Attitudes Regarding Transsexuality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221213319/http://dl.uncw.edu/etd/2006/swanstromn/novaswanstrom.pdf |date=2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transgender people prefer the designation ''transgender'' and reject ''transsexual''.&lt;ref name="Polly"&gt;R Polly, J Nicole, ''Understanding the transsexual patient: culturally sensitive care in emergency nursing practice'', in the ''[[Advanced Emergency Nursing Journal]]'' (2011): "The use of terminology by transsexual individuals to self-identify varies.

In his 2007 book ''Transgender, an Ethnography of a Category'', anthropologist David Valentine asserts that ''transgender'' was coined and used by activists to include many people who do not necessarily identify with the term and states that people who do not identify with the term ''transgender'' should not be included in the transgender spectrum.&lt;ref name="Valentine" /&gt; [[Leslie Feinberg]] likewise asserts that ''transgender'' is not a self-identifier (for some people) but a category imposed by observers to understand other people.&lt;ref name="Stryker" /&gt; However, these assertions are contested by the Transgender Health Program (THP) at Fenway Health in Boston. It notes that there are no universally-accepted definitions, and terminology confusion is common because terms that were popular in at the turn of the 21st century may now be deemed offensive. The THP recommends that clinicians ask clients what terminology they prefer, and avoid the term ''transsexual'' unless they are sure that a client is comfortable with it.&lt;ref name="Fenway Health Glossary" /&gt;

[[Harry Benjamin]] invented a classification system for transsexuals and transvestites, called the [[Sex Orientation Scale]] (SOS), in which he assigned transsexuals and transvestites to one of six categories based on their reasons for cross-dressing and the relative urgency of their need (if any) for sex reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="benjaminscale"&gt;Benjamin, H. (1966). ''The transsexual phenomenon''. New York: Julian Press, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin considered a moderate intensity "true transsexual" to need either [[estrogen]] or [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] as a "substitute for or preliminary to operation";&lt;ref name="benjaminscale" /&gt; people who meet Benjamin's definition of a "true transsexual" but do not desire SRS include [[Miriam (entertainer)|Miriam Rivera]]. There are also people who have had SRS but do not meet the definition of "transsexual", such as [[Gregory Hemingway]].&lt;ref name="Hemingway1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Conway |first=Lynn |title=The Strange Saga of Gregory Hemingway |year=2003 |url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/GregoryHemingway.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031204151544/http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/GregoryHemingway.html |archivedate=2003-12-04 |df= }} {{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemingway2"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Schoenberg |first=Nara |title=The Son Also Falls From elephant hunter to bejeweled exhibitionist, the tortured life of Gregory Hemingway |newspaper=CHICAGO TRIBUNE |date=2001-11-19 |url=http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-p2cover2470306nov19.story?coll=ny-features-print |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011120185300/http://www.newsday.com/features/printedition/ny-p2cover2470306nov19.story?coll=ny-features-print |archivedate=2001-11-20}} {{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other categories ==
In addition to trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity is the opposite of their assigned sex, and who form the core of the ''transgender'' umbrella, being included in even the narrowest definitions of it, several other groups are included in broader definitions of the term. These include people whose gender identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine but may, for example, be [[androgynous]], [[bigender]], [[pangender]], or [[agender]]—often grouped under the alternative umbrella term ''[[genderqueer]]''&lt;ref name="Bilodeau" /&gt;—and [[third-gender]] people (alternatively, some references and some societies conceptualize transgender people as a third gender).&lt;ref name="Stryker3G" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrisler" /&gt; Although some references define ''transgender'' very broadly to include [[transvestism|transvestite]]s / [[cross-dressing|cross-dresser]]s,&lt;ref name="ReisnerEtAl" /&gt; they are usually excluded, as are [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetish]]ists (because they are considered to be expressing a [[paraphilia]] rather than a gender identification) and [[drag kings]] and [[drag queens]] (who are performers and cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining).

=== Drag kings and queens ===
{{See also|Drag king|Drag queen|Faux queen}}
''[[Drag (clothing)|Drag]]'' is a term applied to clothing and makeup worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. Drag performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by [[second-wave feminism]]. Drag artists have a long tradition in [[LGBT culture]]. Generally the term ''[[drag queen]]'' covers men doing female drag, ''[[drag king]]'' covers women doing male drag, and ''[[faux queen]]'' covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community have embraced the pornographically-derived term ''tranny'' to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing; however, this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bilerico.com/2008/09/is_tranny_offensive.php |title=Is 'Tranny' Offensive? |work=The Bilerico Project |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213214/http://www.bilerico.com/2008/09/is_tranny_offensive.php |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersex ===
{{main|Intersex}}
[[Intersex]] people have genitalia or other physical sex characteristics that do not conform to strict definitions of male or female, but intersex people are not necessarily transgender because they do not necessarily disagree with their assigned sex. Transgender and intersex issues often overlap, however, because they may both challenge rigid definitions of sex and gender.

Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender, throughout history the [[LGBT|gay, lesbian, and bisexual]] subculture was often the only place where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the [[gender role]] they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when legal or medical [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] was almost impossible. This acceptance has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and [[gender identity]] until the 1970s, and often perceived gender-variant people more as homosexuals who behaved in a gender-variant way than as gender-variant people in their own right. Today, members of the transgender community often continue to struggle to remain part of the same movement as lesbian, gay, and bisexual people and to be included in rights protections. In addition, the role of the transgender community in the history of LGBT rights is often overlooked, as shown in Transforming History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Retro Report |title=Transforming History |url=http://www.retroreport.org/video/transforming-history/ |website=Retro Report |publisher=Retro Report |accessdate=15 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710160835/http://www.retroreport.org/video/transforming-history/ |archivedate=10 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual orientation of transgender people ===
In 2015, the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] conducted a National Transgender Discrimination Survey. Of the 27,715 transgender and [[genderqueer|non-binary]] people who took the survey, 21% said the term "queer" best described their sexual orientation, 18% said "pansexual", 16% said "gay", "lesbian", or "same-gender-loving", 15% said "straight", 14% said "bisexual", and 10% said "asexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey |url=http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF |website=National Center for Transgender Equality |accessdate=6 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209150153/http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF |archivedate=9 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental healthcare ===
Most mental health professionals recommend therapy for internal conflicts about gender identity or discomfort in an assigned gender role, especially if one desires to [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]]. People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may benefit by talking through their feelings in depth; however, research on gender identity with regard to psychology, and scientific understanding of the phenomenon and its related issues, is relatively new.&lt;ref name="Brown&amp;Rounsley"&gt;Brown, M.L. &amp; Rounsley, C.A. (1996) ''True Selves: Understanding Transsexualism&amp;nbsp;– For Families, Friends, Coworkers, and Helping Professionals'' Jossey-Bass: San Francisco {{ISBN|0-7879-6702-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''transsexualism'', ''dual-role transvestism'', ''[[gender identity disorder]] in adolescents or adults,'' and ''gender identity disorder not otherwise specified'' are listed as such in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD)]] by the [[WHO]] or the American [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM)]] under codes F64.0, F64.1, 302.85, and 302.6 respectively.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV"&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of the diagnosis and its presence in the forthcoming ICD-11 is debated.

The ''[[DSM-5]]'' refers to the topic as ''[[gender dysphoria]]'' while reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garloch|first1=Karen|title=What it means to be transgender: Answers to 5 key questions|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/health-family/article76580862.html|accessdate=18 December 2016|publisher=Charlotte Observer|date=9 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220182205/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/health-family/article76580862.html|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people may meet the criteria for a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) "only if [being transgender] causes distress or disability."&lt;ref name="apatransgenderanswersdisorder"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx Answers to Your Questions About Transgender Individuals and Gender Identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615045832/http://apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx |date=2010-06-15 }} report from the website of the American Psychological Association - "Is being transgender a mental disorder?"&lt;/ref&gt; This distress is referred to as ''gender dysphoria'' and may manifest as depression or inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that transgender people suffer from GID; this misinterpretation has greatly confused transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender and whose gender is not directly causing inner frustration or impairing their functioning do not suffer from GID. Moreover, GID is not necessarily permanent and is often resolved through therapy or transitioning.  Feeling oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors of such others as legal entities does not indicate GID. GID does not imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GID is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this solution often, but not always, consists of undergoing a [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].&lt;ref name="Brown&amp;Rounsley" /&gt;

Clinical training lacks relevant information needed in order to adequately help transgender clients, which results in a large number of practitioners who are not prepared to sufficiently work with this population of individuals.&lt;ref name="L. Carroll, P.J. Gilroy, and J. Ryan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carroll |first1=L. |last2=Gilroy |first2=P.J. |last3=Ryan |first3=J. |title=Transgender issues in counselor education |journal=Counselor Education and Supervision |year=2002 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=233–242 |doi=10.1002/j.1556-6978.2002.tb01286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mental healthcare providers know little about transgender issues. Those who seek help from these professionals often educate the professional without receiving help.&lt;ref name="Brown&amp;Rounsley" /&gt; Many therapists who profess to know about transgender issues believe that transitioning from one sex to another{{spaced ndash}}the standard transsexual model{{spaced ndash}}is the best or only solution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This solution usually is good for transsexual people but is not the solution for other transgender people, particularly [[genderqueer]] people who lack an exclusively male or female identity. Instead, therapists can support their clients in whatever steps they choose to take to transition or can support their decision not to transition while also addressing their clients' sense of congruence between gender identity and appearance.&lt;ref name="10.1177/0361684312442161" /&gt;

Acknowledgment of the lack of clinical training has increased; however, research on the specific problems faced by the transgender community in mental health has focused on diagnosis and clinicians' experiences instead of transgender clients' experiences.&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Kristen E |title=Seeking support: Transgender client experiences with mental health services |journal=Journal of Feminist Family Therapy |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=17–40 |doi=10.1080/08952833.2013.755081 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08952833.2013.755081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy was not always sought by transgender people due to mental health needs. Prior to the seventh version of the [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SOC), an individual had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder in order to proceed with hormone treatments or sexual reassignment surgery.  The new version decreased the focus on diagnosis and instead emphasized the importance of flexibility in order to meet the diverse health care needs of transsexual, transgender, and all gender-nonconforming people.&lt;ref name=SOC&gt;{{cite web|title=Standards of care for the health of transsexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people—7th version |url=http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf |website=The World Professional Association for Transgender Health |accessdate=30 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303035205/http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care%20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for seeking mental health services vary according to the individual. A transgender person seeking treatment does not necessarily mean their gender identity is problematic. The emotional strain of dealing with stigma and experiencing [[transphobia]] pushes many transgender people to seek treatment to improve their quality of life, as one trans woman reflected: "Transgendered individuals are going to come to a therapist and most of their issues have nothing to do, specifically, with being transgendered. It has to do because they've had to hide, they've had to lie, and they've felt all of this guilt and shame, unfortunately usually for years!"&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt; Many transgender people also seek mental health treatment for depression and anxiety caused by the stigma attached to being transgender, and some transgender people have stressed the importance of acknowledging their gender identity with a therapist in order to discuss other quality-of-life issues.&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt; Others regret having undergone the procedure and wish to [[detransition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Problems still remain surrounding misinformation about transgender issues that hurt transgender people's mental health experiences. One trans man who was enrolled as a student in a psychology graduate program highlighted the main concerns with modern clinical training: "Most people probably are familiar with the term transgender, but maybe that's it. I don’t think I've had any formal training just going through [clinical] programs . . . I don’t think most [therapists] know. Most therapists—Master's degree, PhD level—they've had . . . one diversity class on GLBT issues. One class out of the huge diversity training. One class. And it was probably mostly about gay lifestyle."&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt; Many health insurance policies do not cover treatment associated with gender transition, and numerous people are under- or uninsured, which raises concerns about the insufficient training most therapists receive prior to working with transgender clients, potentially increasing financial strain on clients without providing the treatment they need.&lt;ref name="H.E. Benson" /&gt;  Many clinicians who work with transgender clients only receive mediocre training on gender identity, but introductory training on interacting with transgender people has recently been made available to health care professionals to help remove barriers and increase the level of service for the transgender population.&lt;ref name="Hanssman, Morrison, &amp; Russian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanssmann |first1=C. |last2=Morrison |first2=D. |last3=Russian |first3=E. |title=Talking, gawking, or getting it done: Providing trainings to increase cultural and clinical competence for transgender and gender-nonconforming patients and clients |journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=5–23 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2008.5.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues around psychological classifications and associated stigma (whether based in paraphilia or not) of cross-dressers, transsexual men and women (and lesbian and gay children, who may resemble trans children early in life) have become more complex since [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health|CAMH]] (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) colleagues [[Kenneth Zucker]] and [[Ray Blanchard]] were announced to be serving on the [[DSM-V]]'s Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2008NewsReleases/dsmwg.aspx Newsroom | APA DSM-5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927024218/http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2008NewsReleases/dsmwg.aspx |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMH aims to "cure" transgender people of their "disorder", especially in children.

Sexual assault, including molestation, rape, forced anal and oral sex, gang rape and stripping is being committed with impunity and there are reliable statistics and materials to support such activities. Further, non-recognition of identity of Hijras /transgender persons results in them facing extreme discrimination in all spheres of society, especially in the field of employment, education, healthcare etc.}}

Hijras/transgender persons face huge discrimination in access to public spaces like restaurants, cinemas, shops, malls etc. Further, access to public toilets is also a serious problem they face quite often. Since there are no separate toilet facilities for Hijras/transgender persons, they have to use male toilets where they are prone to sexual assault and harassment. Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity, therefore, impairs equality before law and equal protection of law and violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Some feminists and feminist groups are supportive of transgender people. Others are not. Though [[second-wave feminism]] argued for the [[sex and gender distinction]], some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause; e.g., they believed that male-to-female transition abandoned or devalued female identity and that transgender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Many transgender feminists, however, view themselves as contributing to feminism by questioning and subverting gender norms. [[Third wave feminism|Third-wave]] and contemporary feminism are generally more supportive of transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hines |first1=Sally |title=TransForming Gender: Transgender Practices of Identity, Intimacy and Care |date=2007 |publisher=Policy Press |location=Bristol |isbn=1861349165 |pages=85–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
In Latin American cultures, a [[travesti]] is a person who has been assigned male at birth and who has a feminine, transfeminine, or "femme" gender identity. Travestis generally undergo hormonal treatment, use female gender expression including new names and pronouns from the masculine ones they were given when assigned a sex, and might use breast implants, but they are not offered or do not desire sex-reassignment surgery. Travesti might be regarded as a gender in itself (a "third gender"), a mix between man and woman ("intergender/androgynes"), or the presence of both masculine and feminine identities in a single person ("bigender").

Deviating from the societal standards for sexual behavior, sexual orientation/identity, gender identity, and gender expression have a single umbrella term that is known as ''sexodiverso'' or ''sexodiversa'' in both Spanish and Portuguese, with its most approximate translation to English being "queer".

''Salzikrum'' is a compound word meaning ''male daughter.'' According to the [[Code of Hammurabi]], ''salzikrūm'' had inheritance rights like that of priestesses; they inherited from their fathers, unlike regular daughters.

== Media representation ==
[[File:Laverne Cox by Sachyn Mital.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Actress [[Laverne Cox]], who is trans, in July 2014]]
As more transgender people are represented and included within the realm of mass culture, the stigma that is associated with being transgender can influence the decisions, ideas, and thoughts based upon it. Media representation, [[culture industry]], and [[Social exclusion|social marginalization]] all hint at popular culture standards and the applicability and significance to mass culture as well. These terms play an important role in the formation of notions for those who have little recognition or knowledge of transgender people. Media depictions represent only a minuscule spectrum of the transgender group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=MTV to launch new channel for gay viewers in 2005&amp;nbsp;– May. 25, 2004 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/25/news/fortune500/mtv_gay_network |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2015-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211113528/http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/25/news/fortune500/mtv_gay_network/ |archivedate=2015-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which essentially conveys that those that are shown are the only interpretations and ideas society has of them.

=== Transgender Awareness Week ===
{{Main|Transgender Awareness Week}}
'''Transgender Awareness Week''', typically observed the second week of November, is a one-week celebration leading up to [[Transgender Day of Remembrance]]. The purpose of Transgender Awareness Week is to educate about transgender and gender non-conforming people and the issues associated with their transition or identity.

=== Transgender Day of Remembrance ===
{{Main|Transgender Day of Remembrance}}
'''Transgender Day of Remembrance''' (TDOR) is held every year on November 20 in honor of Rita Hester, who was killed on November 28, 1998, in an anti-transgender hate crime. TDOR serves a number of purposes:
* it memorializes all of those who have been victims of hate crimes and prejudice,
* it raises awareness about hate crimes towards the transgender community,
* and it honors the dead and their relatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transgenderdor.org/?page_id=4 |title=About TDOR at Transgender Day of Remembrance |publisher=Transgenderdor.org |date=1998-11-28 |accessdate=2011-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723151936/http://www.transgenderdor.org/?page_id=4 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans March ===
{{Main|Trans March}}
'''Trans March''' describes annual marches, protests or gatherings that take place around the world, often taking place during the time of the local pride week. These events are frequently organized by transgender communities to build community, address human rights struggles, and create visibility.

== Pride symbols ==
{{Main||Transgender flags|LGBT symbols#Gender symbols}}
[[File:Transgender Pride flag.svg|thumb|upright=0.95|Transgender Pride flag]]

A common symbol for the transgender community is the [[Transgender flags#Transgender Pride flag|Transgender Pride flag]], which was designed by the American transgender woman Monica Helms in 1999, and was first shown at a pride parade in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States in 2000.

The flag consists of five horizontal stripes, two light blue, two pink, with a white stripe in the center.

Helms describes the meaning of the flag as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The light blue is the traditional color for baby boys, pink is for girls, and the white in the middle is for "those who are transitioning, those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender", and those who are [[Intersexuality|intersex]]. The pattern is such that "no matter which way you fly it, it will always be correct. This symbolizes us trying to find correctness in our own lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ford |first=Zack |date=August 27, 2014 |title=Transgender Pride Flag Designer Applauds Smithsonian LGBT Artifacts Collection |url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/08/27/3476435/transgender-pride-flag/ |newspaper=ThinkProgress |location=United States of America |access-date=December 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032253/http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/08/27/3476435/transgender-pride-flag/ |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other transgender symbols include the butterfly (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis), and a pink/light blue [[yin and yang]] symbol.

Several [[gender symbol]]s have been used to represent transgender people, including [[⚥]] and [[⚧]].
