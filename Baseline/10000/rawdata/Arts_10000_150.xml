She was born in the [[Susquehanna Valley]].&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Adelia Gates Collection, 1879-1898 and undated|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217469|work=SIA RU007312|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates worked as a guardian, farmworker, teacher, and as a [[Lowell Mill Girls|factory worker in the Lowell Mills]] before being attending college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orpen|first=Adela Elizabeth Richards|title=The chronicles of the Sid: or, The life and travels of Adelia Gates|year=1897|publisher=Fleming H.

She started painting in her fifties, after taking lessons from [[Emilie Vouga]] in Geneva.&lt;ref name=SIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vouga, Emilie|year=2011|doi=10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00192924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her lifetime, a colorful biography of her life and travels was written by [[Adela Orpen|Adela Elizabeth Orpen]], published by the [[Religious Tract Society]]. After her death, over 600 of her works were exhibited and donated to the [[United States National Museum]], which later became the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;"Learned to paint at 50".

'''Alexandria''' is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]] in the United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 139,966,&lt;ref name="QF"&gt;{{cite web|title=State &amp; County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, the population was estimated to be 155,810.&lt;ref name="USCensusEst2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/51510,00|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located along the western bank of the [[Potomac River]], Alexandria is approximately {{convert|7|mi|0}} south of [[Downtown, Washington, D.C.|downtown Washington, D.C.]]

Like the rest of [[Northern Virginia]], as well as [[Central Maryland]], modern Alexandria has been influenced by its proximity to the U.S. capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]. Another is the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]]. In 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] moved to Alexandria, and in 2017, so did the headquarters of the [[National Science Foundation]].

The historic center of Alexandria is known as "Old Town". With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, [[antique shop]]s and theaters, it is a major draw for all who live in Alexandria as well for visitors. Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact and walkable. It is the 7th largest and highest-income independent city in Virginia.

A large portion of adjacent [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], mostly south but also west of the city, is named "Alexandria," but it is under the jurisdiction of Fairfax County and separate from the city; the city is sometimes referred to as the City of Alexandria to avoid confusion (see the "Neighborhoods" paragraph below). In 1920, Virginia's General Assembly voted to incorporate what had been Alexandria County as [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] to minimize confusion.

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:1878 Alexandria County Virginia.jpg|thumb|alt=Map labeled "Alexandria County" on old yellowed paper, with Potomac River along upper right|Map of Alexandria County (1878), including what is now [[Arlington County]] and the City of Alexandria.

On October 21, 1669 a patent granted {{convert|6,000|acre|km2}} to Robert Howsing for transporting 120 people to the [[Colony of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Brockett and Rock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Franklin Longdon|last2=Rock|first2=George W.|title=A Concise History of the City of Alexandria, Va: From 1669 to 1883, with a Directory of Reliable Business Houses in the City|date=1883|publisher=Gazette Book and Job office|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} That tract would later become the City of Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Brockett and Rock" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Virginia's comprehensive [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730|Tobacco Inspection Law of 1730]] mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale. One of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper [[Potomac River]] was at the mouth of [[Hunting Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html |title=Economic Aspects of Tobacco during the Colonial Period 1612–1776 |website=Tobacco.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ground proved to be unsuitable, and the warehouse was built half a mile up-river, where the water was deep near the shore.

Following the 1745 settlement of the Virginia's 10 year dispute with Lord Fairfax over the western boundary of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], when the Privy Council in London found in favor of Lord Fairfax's expanded claim, some of the Fairfax County gentry formed the [[Ohio Company]] of Virginia. They intended to conduct trade into the interior of America, and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the Potomac. The best location was Hunting Creek tobacco warehouse, since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships. Many local tobacco planters, however, wanted a new town further up Hunting Creek, away from nonproductive fields along the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28266 |title=Discovering the Decades: 1740s &amp;#124; Historic Alexandria &amp;#124; City of Alexandria, VA |website=Alexandriava.gov |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1746, Captain [[Philip Alexander II]] (1704–1753) moved to what is south of present Duke Street in Alexandria. His estate, which consisted of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, was bounded by Hunting Creek, Hooff's Run, the Potomac River, and approximately the line which would become Cameron Street. At the opening of Virginia's 1748–49 legislative session, there was a petition submitted in the [[House of Burgesses]] on November 1, 1748, that the "inhabitants of Fairfax (Co.) praying that a town may be established at Hunting Creek Warehouse on Potowmack River," as [[Hugh West]] was the owner of the warehouse. The petition was introduced by [[Lawrence Washington (1718–1752)]], the representative for Fairfax County and, more importantly, the son-in-law of [[William Fairfax]] and a founding member of the Ohio Company. To support the company's push for a town on the river, Lawrence's younger brother [[George Washington]], an aspiring surveyor, made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html|title=George Washington: Surveyor and Mapmaker|website=Loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the river site was amidst his estate, Philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of Hunting Creek (also known as Great Hunting Creek). It has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town ''Alexandria'', in honor of Philip's family. As a result, Philip and his cousin Captain [[John Alexander (captain)|John Alexander]] (1711–1763) gave land to assist in the development of Alexandria, and are thus listed as the founders. This John was the son of [[Robert Alexander II]] (1688–1735). On May 2, 1749, the House of Burgesses approved the river location and ordered "Mr. Washington do go up with a Message to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council]] and acquaint them that this House have agreed to the Amendments titled An Act for erecting a Town at Hunting Creek Warehouse, in the County of Fairfax."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia. General Assembly.

Waddey Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A "Public Vendue" (auction) was advertised for July, and the county surveyor laid out street lanes and town lots. The auction was conducted on July 13–14, 1749.

Almost immediately upon establishment, the town founders called the new town "Belhaven", believed to be in honor of a Scottish patriot, [[John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven and Stenton]], the Northern Neck tobacco trade being then dominated by Scots. The name Belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a Church and Market House, but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/richmondcity/newspapers/gazette5.txt|title=The Scheme of a Lottery, at Belhaven, in Fairfax County: January 24, 1750/51; Virginia Gazette extracts; The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol.12 No.2 (October 1903)|website=Files.usgwarchives.net|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779.

In 1755, [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] organized his fatal expedition against [[Fort Duquesne]] at [[Carlyle House]] in Alexandria. In April 1755, the governors of Virginia, and the provinces of [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], and [[Province of New York|New York]] met to determine upon concerted action against the [[Early Modern France|French]] in America.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

In March 1785, commissioners from Virginia and Maryland met in Alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states, finishing their business at [[Mount Vernon]]. The [[Mount Vernon Conference]] concluded on March 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the Potomac River. The Maryland legislature, in ratifying this agreement on November 22, proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations. This led to the calling of the [[Annapolis Convention of 1786]], which in turn led to the calling of the [[Federal Convention of 1787]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=573}}

In 1791, Alexandria was included in the area chosen by [[George Washington]] to become the District of Columbia.

In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], a British fleet launched a successful [[Raid on Alexandria]], which surrendered without a fight. As agreed in the terms of surrender the British looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wine]], and [[sugar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28306 | title=Discovering the Decades: 1810s | publisher=Alexandria Archaeology Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823 [[William Holland Wilmer]], [[Francis Scott Key]], and others founded the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cromey|first1=Robert Warren|title=Essays Irreverent|date=Sep 27, 2012|publisher=iUniverse|pages=184|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}} From 1828 to 1836,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=31254#African_American | title=Self-Guided Walking Tour Black Historic Sites | publisher=Alexandria Black History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandria was home to the [[Franklin &amp; Armfield]] Slave Market, one of the largest slave trading companies in the country. By the 1830s, they were sending more than 1,000 slaves annually from Alexandria to their [[Natchez, Mississippi]], and [[New Orleans]] markets to help meet the demand for slaves in Mississippi and surrounding states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jim Barnett and H.

A portion of the City of Alexandria—most of the area now known as "Old Town" as well as [[Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia|the areas of the city northeast of what is now King Street]]—and all of today's [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] share the distinction of having been the portion of Virginia ceded to the U.S. Government in 1791 to help form the new [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].  Over time, a movement grew to separate Alexandria from the District of Columbia. As competition grew with the port of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] fostered development on the north side of the Potomac River, the city's economy stagnated; at the same time, residents had lost any representation in Congress and the right to vote, and were disappointed with the negligible economic benefit (on the Alexandria side) of being part of the national capital. Alexandria still had an important port and market in the [[slave trade]], and as talk increased of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] slavery in the national capital, there was concern that Alexandria's economy would suffer greatly if this step were taken. After a referendum, voters petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the portion of the District of Columbia south of the Potomac River (Alexandria County) to Virginia. On July 9, 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceded Alexandria County to Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |title=Get to know D.C. – Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C. |publisher=History Society of Washington, D.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206013429/http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp |archivedate=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Alexandria was re-chartered in 1852 and became independent of [[Alexandria County, D.C.|Alexandria County]] in 1870. The remaining portion of Alexandria County changed its name to [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] in 1920.

The first fatalities of the North and South in the [[American Civil War]] occurred in Alexandria. Within a month of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], Union troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops at the base of King Street on the Potomac River on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the [[11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|New York Fire Zouaves]], Colonel [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]], sortied with a small detachment to retrieve a large [[Confederate flag]] displayed on the roof of the [[Marshall House (Alexandria, Virginia)|Marshall House Inn]] that had been visible from the White House. While descending from the roof, Ellsworth was shot dead by Captain James W. Jackson, the hotel's proprietor.

Alexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the war.

Failure to do so resulted in incidents including the arrest of ministers in their church.

In 1861 and 1862, escaped [[African-American]] slaves poured into Alexandria. Safely behind Union lines, the cities of Alexandria and Washington offered comparative freedom and employment. Alexandria became a major supply depot and transport and hospital center for the Union army.&lt;ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |title=Office of Historic Alexandria, Alexandria Freedmen's Cemetery: Historical Overview, April 2007, p. 2. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324140231/http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |archivedate=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863, escaped slaves legally remained the property of their owners. Therefore, they were labeled [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] to avoid returning them to their masters. Contrabands worked for the Union army in various support roles.

After all slaves in the seceding states were liberated, even more African Americans came to Alexandria. By the fall of 1863, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000{{mdash}}an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months.&lt;ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria" /&gt;

As of ratification of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Fifteenth Amendment]], Alexandria County's black population was more than 8,700, or about half the total number of residents in the county. This newly enfranchised constituency provided the support necessary to elect the first black Alexandrians to the City Council and the Virginia Legislature.&lt;ref name="alexandriaweba.com"&gt;[http://www.alexandriaweba.com/go/alexandriaafricanamericanhistory/freedmancemetery]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century the most common production in the city was glass, fertilizer, beer and leather. The glass often went into beer bottles. Much of the Virginia Glass Company effort went to supply the demands of the Robert Portner Brewing Company, until fire destroyed the St. Asaph Street plant on February 18, 1905. The Old Dominion Glass Company also had a glass works fall to fire, then built a new one. The Belle Pre Bottle Company held a monopoly on a milk bottle that they patented, yet that organization only lasted 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Commerce: {{Hanging indent | {{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Al|last2=Cressey|first2=Pamela J.|last3=Dennee|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Miller|first4=T.

=== History of libraries ===
John Wise, a local Alexandria businessman and hotel keeper, hosted a meeting in his home in 1789 to discuss the creation of a Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge. Members include Rev. James Muir, physician [[Elisha Cullen Dick]], and George Washington's personal attorney [[Charles Lee (Attorney General)|Charles Lee]]. The Society did not last for long. However, on July 24, 1794, the founders of the Society once again met at Wise's home to establish a subscription library. During the first year, one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the Library Company of Alexandria. Members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues. The company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the [[General Assembly of Virginia]].

[[File:Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First city library location within an apothecary shop]]
Druggist Edward Stabler was elected the first librarian and the library's first location is believed to have been housed in his [[Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop|apothecary shop]]. James Kennedy was elected the second librarian, and the library moved to his residence and place of business. Kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the Library Company. Those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library. The first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797. The collection grew over time, bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books. Most members were initially men, although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798. One noted female member in 1817 was [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary L.F. Custis]], wife of [[George Washington Parke Custis]].

The catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books, mostly on history and travel. By 1815, there were 1,022 entries in the catalog, and the collection had added more biographies, fiction, and magazines. The library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years, including the New Market House next to the City Hall, the [[Lyceum]] Company building, and Peabody Hall, which was owned by the Alexandria School Board. Raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge. In 1853, a lecture series was created to raise money. Speakers included Professor [[Joseph Henry]] of the Smithsonian, Colonel [[Francis H. Smith]] of the Virginia Military Institute, and humorist [[George W. Bagby]].

The arrival of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861 took its toll on the library collection. Members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the library's occupation by Union troops. The library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time. After the war, the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection. Funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.

In 1897, a group of women in Alexandria formed the Alexandria Library Association. The leaders of the group were Virginia Corse, Mrs. William B. Smoot, and Virginia Burke. They petitioned the school board to open a subscription library in Peabody Hall, using the old books stored there. Permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on December 1, 1897. In 1902, the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of Prince Street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the Confederate Hall, located at 806 Prince Street. In May 1903, the library moved to the Confederate Hall, now known as the Robert E. Lee Camp Hall Museum, where it stayed for 34 years.

In 1936, Dr. and Mrs. Robert South Barrett presented a proposal to the Library Association. They agreed to donate a building in memory of Dr. Barrett's mother, [[Kate Waller Barrett]], if the city would commit to running it as a public library. The city agreed and the Society of Friends offered a 99-year lease on an old Quaker graveyard located on Queen Street. The old library was closed on March 1 for the books to be packed and moved to the new library, which opened to the public in August 1937. The Alexandria Library Association became the Alexandria Library Society.

In 1939, the Barrett library was the scene of possibly [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker#Alexandria library sit-in|the nation's first sit-in demonstrations]], as [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker|Samuel Tucker]], a young law school graduate from the neighborhood, and several other African-American residents insisted on access to the racially segregated library where they had been banned.  Tucker later became a prominent attorney in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimcrowlivedhere.org/exhibits/show/1939-alexandria-library-sit-in |title=1939 Alexandria Library Sit-in |publisher=Jim Crow Lived Here |date= |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alexandriahistoricalsociety.wildapricot.org/history |title=Alexandria Historical Society – Alexandria's History |website=Alexandriahistoricalsociety.wildapricot.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the Library Society was reconstituted and took the earlier historic name Alexandria Library Company. A lecture series was also revived. Speakers included [[Thomas Jefferson]] biographer [[Dumas Malone]]. Some of the books belonging in the original collection of the Alexandria Library Company can now be found in the Local History/Special Collections Room at the Queen Street library that still carries Mrs. Barrett's name.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, William. ''The Alexandria Library Company''. Alexandria, Virginia: Alexandria Library, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Ellen Coolidge Burke]] became director. Burke brought [[bookmobile]] services to Alexandria, one of the first services in Virginia.  She oversaw the growth of the library system by the addition of two new branch libraries.  In April 1968 the Ellen Coolidge Burke Branch at 4701 Seminary Road was opened, and in December 1969 the [[James M. Duncan]] branch at 2501 Commonwealth Avenue.  Burke retired in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexandria.lib.va.us/client/en_US/home/;jsessionid=55F1FE7BBEDA3613D2634F145C817736.enterprise-23800?rm=ELLEN+COOLIDGE1%7C%7C%7C1%7C%7C%7C0%7C%7C%7Ctrue&amp;ic=true&amp;dt=list|title=Ellen Coolidge Burke|publisher=Alexandria Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The western portions of the city were annexed from those two entities beginning in the 1930s.

The [[address (geography)|addressing system]] in Alexandria is not uniform and reflects the consolidation of several originally separate communities into a single city. In Old Town Alexandria, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[King Street (Alexandria, Virginia)|King Street]] and west (only) from the Potomac River. In the areas formerly in the town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]], such as Del Ray and St. Elmo, building numbers are assigned east and west from Commonwealth Avenue and north (only) from King Street. In the western parts of the city, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[Virginia State Route 236|Duke Street]].

The [[ZIP code]] prefix 223 uniquely identifies the Alexandria postal area.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} However, the Alexandria postal area extends into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and includes addresses outside of the city. Delivery areas have ZIP codes 22301, 22302, 22203, 22304, 22305, 22306, 22307, 22308, 22309, 22310, 22311, 22312, 22314, and 22315,  with other ZIP codes in use for [[post office box]]es and large mailers (22313, 22331, 22332, 22333).

In 1830, John Hollensbury's home in Alexandria was one of two homes directly bordering an [[alleyway]] that received a large amount of [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse-drawn wagon]] traffic and loiterers.&lt;ref name="beloved"&gt;Bailey, Steve. (February 29, 2008) [[The New York Times]] ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/travel/escapes/29away.html A Tiny, Beloved Home That Was Built for Spite.]'' Section: F; Page F6. Location: 523 Queen St, Alexandria, VA 22314.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent people from using the alleyway, Hollensbury constructed a {{convert|7|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|25|ft|m}} deep, {{convert|325|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, two story home using the existing brick walls of the adjacent homes for the sides of the new home.&lt;ref name="beloved" /&gt; The brick walls of the [[spite house|Hollensbury Spite House]] living room have gouges from wagon-wheel hubs; the house is still standing, and is occupied.&lt;ref name="beloved" /&gt;

== Sports ==
Due to its proximity to Washington, Alexandria has only been the home of one professional sports team, the [[Alexandria Dukes]], a minor league baseball team which has moved to [[Woodbridge, Virginia|Woodbridge]] and is now named the [[Potomac Nationals]]. However, the [[Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League]] brought baseball back to Alexandria in 2008 in the form of the [[Alexandria (VA) Aces|Alexandria Aces]]. In addition, TC Williams, Bishop Ireton, St. Stephen's and Episcopal have storied histories in athletics, such as football, basketball, baseball and lacrosse. The largest youth sport in Alexandria is soccer with almost 2,500 players ages 2–18 who participate in the Alexandria Soccer Association.

== Parks and recreation ==
Alexandria has a distributed park system with approximately {{convert|950|acre|km2}} spread across 70 major parks and 30 [[recreation]] centers, of which [[Castanea pumila|Chinquapin]] is one of the largest. Chinquapin offers facilities for swimming, tennis, racquetball, and other sports. The city also organizes several sports leagues throughout the year including volleyball, softball and basketball.

The city is home to [[Cameron Run Regional Park]] which includes a water park with a [[wave pool]] and [[water slide]]s, as well as a [[miniature golf]] course and batting cages. A portion of the [[Mount Vernon Trail]], a popular bike and jogging path, runs through Old Town near the Potomac River on its way from the Mount Vernon Estate to Roosevelt Island in Washington, DC. There is also a largely unbroken line of parks stretching along the Alexandria waterfront from end to end.

As an independent city of Virginia (as opposed to an incorporated town within a county), Alexandria derives its governing authority from the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. In order to revise the power and structure of the city government, the city must request the General Assembly to amend the charter. The present charter was granted in 1950 and it has been amended in 1968, 1971, 1976, and 1982.

Alexandria adopted a [[council-manager]] form of government by way of referendum in 1921. This type of government empowers the elected City Council to pass legislation and appoint the City Manager. The City Manager is responsible for overseeing the city's administration.

The Mayor, who is chosen on a separate ballot, presides over meetings of the Council and serves as the ceremonial head of government. The Mayor does not have the power to veto Council action. Council members traditionally choose the person receiving the most votes in the election to serve as Vice Mayor. In the absence or disability of the Mayor, the Vice Mayor performs the mayoral duties.

In 2008, the City of Alexandria had 78 standing local boards, commissions, and committees to advise the City Council on major issues affecting the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.alexandriava.gov/bcroster/bc_list.pxe |title=Roster of Alexandria Boards, Commissions and Committees |website=Alexandriava.gov |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; All members are appointed by the City Council.
&lt;!--say, Alexandrians, isn't 78 boards &amp;c. a bit much? --&gt;

Alexandria is part of [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], represented by Democrat and Alexandria resident [[Don Beyer]], elected in 2014.

The state's senior member of the United States Senate is Democrat [[Mark Warner]], elected in 2008. The state's junior member of the United States Senate is Democrat [[Tim Kaine]], elected in 2012.

The city operates a jail for pre-trial and short-term inmates. This jail is used to house pre-trial inmates in federal espionage cases.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, David.

=== Schools ===
[[File:NVCC - Alexandria campus.jpg|thumb|alt=Big street with cars waiting at intersection|Entrance to [[Northern Virginia Community College]]'s Alexandria campus]]
The city is served by the [[Alexandria City Public Schools]] system and by the Alexandria campus of [[Northern Virginia Community College]]. The largest seminary in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], [[Virginia Theological Seminary]], is located on Seminary Road. [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech's]] Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center, also known as WAAC, is located on Prince Street in Old Town, offering graduate programs in Urban Affairs and Planning, Public and International Affairs, Architecture, and Landscape Architecture. [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] operates a Northern Virginia branch of its School of Social Work and [[The George Washington University]] (Washington DC) also has a campus near the King Street metro. This campus mainly offers professional and vocational programs, such as an executive MBA program, urban planning and security studies.

Alexandria has several of the Washington, D.C., area's top private schools, such as [[St. Stephen's and St. Agnes School]], [[Bishop Ireton High School]], and [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]]. Also in the city are Alexandria Country Day School, Commonwealth Academy, St. Mary's Catholic School, St. Rita's Catholic School, Blessed Sacrament School and [[Global Health College]].

Alexandria's public school system consists of thirteen elementary schools for grades 5-year-old Kindergarten through Grade 5. Middle Schools, George Washington and Francis C. Hammond, serve 6th through 8th graders. Minnie Howard Ninth Grade Center and [[T.C. Williams High School]] serve grades 9th and 10 through 12, respectively, for the entire city.

The demographics of Alexandria City Public Schools contrast with those of the city. In 2008, only 14% of the students at Francis C. Hammond Middle School were non-Hispanic whites, compared to about 60% when looking at the city as a whole. 27% were of Hispanic descent, and 48% were black. About 9% of the school was of Asian descent. In 2004, 62% of the schoolgoing children received free lunches; by 2008, that number had decreased to 56%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100069&amp;udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; At George Washington Middle School, 41% of students are non-Hispanic whites, 34% were Hispanic, and 21% was black; 2% of the students were Asian, and 52% of students received free lunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100071&amp;udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.C. Williams High School follows this trend as well; 23% of the students were classified as non-Hispanic whites, 25% as Hispanic, and 44% as black. 7% of the school was Asian, and 47% of all students received free lunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100080&amp;udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|website=Bestplaces.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Amtrak 82 at Alexandria Union Station in 2007.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Big shiny train facing us, at station with passengers on platform|Southbound [[Amtrak]] train at Alexandria's Union Station]]
Alexandria is bisected east and west by [[State Route 7 (Virginia)|State Route 7]], known as [[King Street, Alexandria, Virginia|King Street]]. The most western section of King St here once was the terminus of the Leesburg Turnpike. Interstate 95/495 (the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]]), including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, approximately parallels the city's southern boundary with Fairfax County. [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] crosses north and south through the western part of the city. Other major routes include north–south [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. 1]] (Patrick and Henry Streets after [[Patrick Henry]], [[Jefferson Davis Highway#Virginia|Jefferson Davis Highway]] and Richmond Highway), Washington St/[[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], Russell Rd, Quaker Lane, Van Dorn St and Beauregard St, and east–west Duke Street ([[State Route 236 (Virginia)|State Route 236]]), Braddock Rd and Janneys Lane/Seminary Rd.

Alexandria is south of, adjacent to [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] in Arlington County. Alexandria is also near to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Dulles, Virginia]].

[[Union Station (Alexandria)|Alexandria Union Station]], the city's historic train station, has [[Amtrak]] intercity services and the [[Virginia Railway Express]] regional rail service. The station is directly adjacent to the [[King Street – Old Town (WMATA station)|King Street – Old Town]] [[Washington Metro]] station, at the convergence of the [[Blue Line (Washington Metro)|Blue]] and [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Lines]]. Three other Metro stations in Alexandria are [[Braddock Road (Washington Metro)|Braddock Road]], [[Van Dorn Street (Washington Metro)|Van Dorn Street]], and [[Eisenhower Avenue (Washington Metro)|Eisenhower Avenue]].

The traditional boundary between Old Town and the latterly annexed sections of the city followed the railway now owned by [[CSX Transportation]].

The city government operates its own mass transit system, the [[DASH (bus)|DASH]] bus, connecting points of interest with local transit hubs. [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]], [[Washington Metro]], and the [[Virginia Railway Express]], better known as the VRE, also serve Alexandria. The city also offers a free "trolley" diesel bus service on King Street from the King Street Metro Station to the Waterfront&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dashbus.com/Trolley|title=DASH : King Street Trolley – FREE|website=Dashbus.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150209153908/http://www.dashbus.com/Trolley|archive-date=February 9, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a water taxi to and from the [[National Harbor]] development in Prince George's County, Maryland.

Until 2014, local legislation mandated that all new north/south streets in the city be named for Confederate military leaders.&lt;ref name=WBJ&gt;[https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2015/09/how-many-confederacy-tied-alexandria-streets-can.html Will Alexandria take action on its Confederacy-tied street names?

'''''Apollo and Marsyas''''' is the title of a 1637 painting by the Spanish artist [[José de Ribera]], now in the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium]]. Other versions are now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] and the [[Naples Archaeological Museum]]. They all show the [[Caravaggisti]]'s heavy influence on the artist and depict [[Marsyas]]' flaying by [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]].

'''Atamira Dance Company''' is a creator and presenter of [[Māori people|Māori]] contemporary dance theatre in [[Aotearoa]] ([[New Zealand]]). ''Atamira'' means to showcase or platform.
The company was founded in 2000 by Jack Gray, Dolina Wehipeihana, Louise Poitiki Bryant and Justine Hohaia. The company is based currently in Corban Estate Arts Centre in [[Waitakere City|Waitakere City, New Zealand]].
&lt;ref name="atamiradance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atamiradance.co.nz/|title=ATAMIRA Maori Contemporary Dance Company -|author=@URL|publisher=atamiradance.co.nz|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company takes their personal stories and that of their whakapapa to relate to Aotearoa's history and touch on significant contemporary issues. Atamira typically means stage however a more in depth meaning to the word relates to the process of caring for those who have died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danz.org.nz/atamira.php DANZ article on Atamira] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327094506/http://danz.org.nz/atamira.php |date=27 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2000, the company was founded as a response to the community need for a platform for Māori urban identity. They create works that aim to reach out to the audiences, and reflect the aspirations of many Māori people and  their ''mana whenua'' (maori rights). All dancers and choreographers involved with the company have links to New Zealand iwi.

In 2007 Atamira formed the Atamira Dance Collective Charitable Trust to promote Māori contemporary dance.

In 2010 Moss Patterson was appointed as the first Artistic Director. 

In 2014 They are currently creating the fifth series of 'Hou' (meaning ''new'').

===Founders===
The company was created in 2000 by Jack Gray with core members Dolina Wehipeihana, Louise Poitiki Bryant and Justine Hohaia. The four met during 1999 while Gray and Wehipeihana were studying contemporary dance at UNITEC, subsequently becoming acquainted with Hohaia and Bryant at a tertiary dance festival. At that point Bryant was studying Māori Studies at [[University of Otago]] and Hohaia at Wellington’s New Zealand School Of Dance. Upon meeting Gray, Wehipeihana and Hohaia, Bryant saw their love of dance and decided it was time for her to follow her passion too, and gave up her studies to transfer to the dance programme at UNITEC.

==Artistic director==
The current artistic director is Moss Patterson.
Patternson began his performance career as a musician composing and performing in [[Dunedin]]. This led him to study acting at The New Zealand College of Performing Arts and then on to study dance and choreography at UNITEC School of Performing and Screen Arts in Auckland.

Patterson has danced and choreographed for Atamira Dance Company, Black Grace Dance Company, Footnote Dance Company and Touch Compass. He is often compared to the Limbs dancer [[Alfred Williams]] when he dances. 

He has choreographed Te Paki, Haka, Te Whenua, Whakairo and Moko for Atamira Dance Company. In 2007, Patterson was awarded Best Choreography by TEMPO Dance Festival and Best New Choreographer in the NZ Listener for Whakairo.

Patterson was recognized for his major role as associate choreographer for the [[Rugby World Cup 2011]] Opening Ceremony and Sacre The Auckland Dance Project with the Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2012, Patterson made Poutama with the [[Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Moko with Atamira. During 2014 he has made Te Manu Ahi (The Firebird) with Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra to premiere on 22 October 2014.

Patterson has been the co-recipient of the CNZ Tup Lang Dance scholarship with Atamira Dance Company and the Te Whakahaungia choreographic award by [[Toi Māori Aotearoa]]. He is a regular speaker at local and national events and is a passionate advocate for Māori culture and Māori contemporary dance in New Zealand.

'''Boxen''' is a [[fictional world]] that [[C. S. Lewis]] ("Jack") and his brother [[Warren Lewis|W. H. Lewis]] ("Warren") created as children.  The world of Boxen was created when Jack's stories about Animal-Land and Warnie's stories about India were brought together.  In ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'', Jack explains that the union of Animal-Land and India took place "sometime in the late eighteenth century (their eighteenth century, not ours)".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S., ''Surprised by Joy'', 1955, Chapter V.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a time when [[influenza]] was ravaging many families, the Lewis brothers were forced to stay indoors and entertain themselves by reading. They read whatever books they could find, both those written for children and adults. Influenced by [[Beatrix Potter]]'s animals, C.S. Lewis wrote about Animal-Land, complete with details about its economics, politics/government, and history, as well as illustrations of buildings and characters.

The stories were published posthumously as ''Boxen: The Imaginary World of the Young C. S. Lewis'' Edited by Walter Hooper and first published by London: Collins May 28, 1985.  First American edition: San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Javanovich, October 17, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;In Pursuit of C. S. Lewis by Edwin W. Brown, M. D., Indianapolis: Proleptikos Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  (republished as ''Boxen: Childhood Chronicles Before Narnia'').

'''Capp Street Project''' was established as an experimental art space in 1983, at 65 Capp Street in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and was the first visual arts residency in the [[United States]] dedicated solely to the creation and presentation of new art installations and conceptual art.&lt;ref name="About CSP"&gt;{{cite web|title=About CSP - Capp Street Project Archive|url=http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/aboutcsp.html|publisher=California College of the Arts|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Capp Street Project name and concept has existed since 1983, although the physical space which the residency and exhibition program occupied has changed several times. In 1998 Capp Street Project united with [[California College of the Arts]]’ [[Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts]].&lt;ref name="20th Anniversary"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helfand|first1=Glen|title=Capp Street Project: 20th Anniversary Exhibition|url=http://artforum.com/archive/id=4393|website=ArtForum|publisher=Artforum International Magazine|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Wattis celebrated 30 years of Capp Street Project Art.&lt;ref name="30 years"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garchik|first1=Leah|title=CCA marks 30 years of Capp Street Project art|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/sfsnap/2014/02/21/cca-marks-30-years-of-capp-street-project-art/|website=SFGATE|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1983, Capp Street Project was created by Ann Hatch who acquired a [[David Ireland (artist)|David Ireland]] designed house at 65 Capp Street in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/aboutcsp.html|title=About CSP|website=Capp Street Project Archive|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hatch's original intention was to preserve the house as a work of art, a personal inquiry concerning patronage and the desire to nurture non-traditional art making processes, ultimately led in another direction. The artist-in-residency program was created and became central to Capp Street Project.

Capp Street Project became part of the [[Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts]] which is in turn part of the [[California College of the Arts]] in 1998 and the house at 65 Capp Street returned to the public sector.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Capp Street Project Archive|url = http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/index.html|website = libraries.cca.edu|access-date = 2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a program of Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts it is currently run by Anthony Huberman, the Director since 2013.&lt;ref name="Bliss"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Bliss|first1 = Chris|title = Anthony Huberman Appointed Director of the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts|url = https://www.cca.edu/news/2013/03/14/anthony-huberman-appointed-director-cca-wattis-institute-contemporary-arts|publisher = California College of the Arts|accessdate = 2016-02-03|date = 2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its inception, Capp Street Project has given more than 100 local, national, and international artists the opportunity to create new work through its residency and public exhibition programs.

== Artists ==

=== Some past Capp Street Artists and their projects ===
Glen Seator, 1997. Seator's Approach was a full-scale indoor re-creation of the street and sidewalk outside Capp Street Project and of the street-facing facade of the gallery's first floor. Writing in the summer 1997 issue of ArtNews, critic Kenneth Baker called Seator's installation "one of the great gallery shows in this city's history." Seator's large-scale architectural installations have won international acclaim.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Ann Hamilton (artist)|Ann Hamilton]], 1989. In Privation and Excesses, Hamilton used 700,000 pennies, among other materials, to create a poetic exploration of systems and mediums of exchange. The installation was featured on the cover of Artforum, a career-making event for the artist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://libraries-archive.cca.edu/capp/anc_r89a001.pdf|title = Ann Hamilton, Capp Street Project|date = |access-date = 2015-01-15|website = CCA Libraries|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Viola]], 1989. Viola's installation Sanctuary combined video, earth, and redwood trees to create an urban refuge. A renowned video artist, Viola was also awarded a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship in 1989.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Diller Scofidio + Renfro|Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio]], 1987. In the Drawing Room: versions and subversions, the collaborators—who also have an architectural practice—explored themes of domesticity, architecture, the home, and the body of the imagined resident of the installation.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

[[Border Arts Workshop|Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo (BAW/TAF)]], was a San Diego-based art collective included artists; [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], Emily Hicks, Bertha Jottar, Richard Lou, [[Victor Ochoa]], Robert Sanchez, Michael Schnorr and Rocío Weiss. In their 1989 exhibition ''Border Axes'' they created a communications network with modern equipment including fax machines, Xerox machines, an 800 phone line, and video equipment in hopes of dissolving the borders between the US and Mexico with alternative ways of communicating and collecting news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Border Lines: The Border Arts Workshop Goes High Tech|url = http://www.robertatkins.net/beta/witness/artists/formats/border.html|website = Robert Atkins|access-date = 2016-02-05|publisher = Village Voice News|date = 1989-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Emulating the style of [[Cirque du Soleil]], Circus Juventas's first show was at Saint Paul's Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school's enrollment quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent [[big top (circus)|big top]] facility, which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the [[Highland Park, Saint Paul|Highland Park]] neighborhood. That year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its most advanced students, each with a distinct theme.

These shows have proven popular with local audiences and have been well received critically, with reviewers praising the professionalism and fearlessness exhibited in the productions, while noting students' occasional missteps during performances. Circus Juventas students have performed and competed both around the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area and abroad. As of 2014, Juventas was the largest youth performing arts circus in North America. The school had tentative plans to add a second facility elsewhere in the region.

===Future===
In early 2014, the Butlers announced plans to expand their big top facility by an additional {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; The additional space would house a dance and theater studio, a costume shop, offices, and a {{convert|4500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} gym.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; Naming rights for the new structure would provide a component of the $4 million the school hoped to raise for the $2 million expansion, a $1 million addition to the circus's endowment, and eventual repairs to the building's exterior, estimated at $1 million.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; Betty Butler stated that the project stemmed from the desire to create "a true professional program, a separate program" for students looking to study and perform circus arts post-Juventas, even though she and her husband originally shied away from pre-professional training as a core aspect of their circus school.&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt;

According to Saint Paul's Parks and Recreation Department, the cliffside space which the expansion would occupy was deemed unsuitable for building a structure of the expansion's proposed size.&lt;ref name=fighting&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duchschere|first1=Kevin|title=Fighting with St. Paul, Circus Juventas hunts for new home|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/west/268673032.html?page=all|accessdate=July 26, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Butlers were considering building a new facility of up to {{convert|50000|sqft|m2}} in the western suburbs of Minneapolis–Saint Paul.&lt;ref name=fighting /&gt; Construction of a new building would likely cost $10 million, require a capital campaign to fund,&lt;ref name=fighting /&gt; and probably not begin for five to 10 years.&lt;ref name=staying&gt;{{cite news|last1=Combs|first1=Marianne|title=Circus Juventas: 'We're staying in St. Paul'|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/state-of-the-arts/2014/07/circus-juventas-were-staying-in-st-paul/|accessdate=August 1, 2014|work=MPR News|agency=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the school is performing a small expansion to its Highland Park space, on which the Circus has a lease for at least 17 more years, as of 2014.&lt;ref name=staying /&gt;

==Performances==
The school typically puts on two shows each year: a spring performance featuring less advanced students studying circus arts at beginning and intermediate levels, and a late summer show to display the talents of more advanced students.&lt;ref name=knightarts&gt;{{cite web|last=Schouweiler|first=Susannah|title=Circus Juventas' "Grimm" enchants|url=http://www.knightarts.org/community/stpaul/circus-juventas-grimm-enchants|work=Knight Arts|publisher=John S. and James L.

Much of the accompaniment for the big top summer shows came from [[Peter Ostroushko]], a local [[mandolin]] player.&lt;ref name=PJtC /&gt; Ostroushko, known for his work on the radio show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'',&lt;ref name="grimm pipress"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berdan |first1=Kathy |title=Under the magic big top, it's possible to be Grimm and happy at the same time |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623210625/http://www.twincities.com/stage/ci_18567010 |archivedate=June 23, 2015 |url=http://www.twincities.com/2011/07/28/under-the-magic-big-top-its-possible-to-be-grimm-and-happy-at-the-same-time/ |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date=July 29, 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; became involved in the youth circus after his daughter saw a show and decided to join.&lt;ref name=PJtC /&gt; In 2005, the Butlers discovered Ostroushko's affinity for the mandolin and [[fiddle]], and asked if he would play a [[Celtic music|Celtic]] song at the premiere of their upcoming summer big top show, ''Dyrnwych''.&lt;ref name=PJtC /&gt; He happily agreed, having expressed a lifelong dream of joining a circus, and played the track, "See It There/Con Cassidy's", not only at ''Dyrnwych''{{'s}} opening but also at each of its subsequent 18 performances.&lt;ref name=PJtC /&gt; The following year, he composed original music for the 2006 Juventas show, ''Pazzanni'', and expanded his band to five members, including himself on mandolin, fiddle, and [[mandocello]], Marc Anderson on percussion, Dan Chouinard on [[piano]], [[accordion]], and [[Electronic keyboard|keyboard]], Dirk Freymuth on electric and acoustic [[guitar]]s, and Joel Sayles on electric and acoustic [[bass guitar]]s.&lt;ref name=PJtC /&gt; Ostroushko again provided a score for ''Atlanticus'' and ''RavensManor'',&lt;ref name=PJtC /&gt; continued in 2010 with ''Sawdust'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Juventas tells story of the old traveling circus in "Sawdust"|url=http://aapress.com/arts/juventas-tells-story-of-the-old-traveling-circus-in-%E2%80%9Csawdust%E2%80%9D/|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=Asian American Press|date=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; then ''Grimm'',&lt;ref name="grimm pipress" /&gt; and finally ''Showdown''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Circus Juventas Provides Polished Showcase for Some Extraordinary Talent|url=http://spectaclemagazine.com/?page_id=2002|accessdate=June 18, 2014|work=Spectacle: An Online Journal of the Circus Arts|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracks from the first four shows for which he played, from ''Dyrnwych'' to ''RavensManor'', are anthologized on the album ''Peter Joins the Circus'', published by Borderland Productions in 2008.&lt;ref name=PJtC /&gt;

==Reception==
Jando Dominique, reporting for ''Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts'', summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as "always sold out and enthusiastically reviewed by the press."&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt; Renee Valois cited the age of the performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' review of ''Oz'' comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, "Dare I say Circus Juventas is more exciting than the troupe that inspired it?"&lt;ref name=ozwonder&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valois|first1=Renee|title=Circus Juventas' performance of 'Oz' is a wonder|url=http://www.twincities.com/stage/ci_23799191/circus-juventas-performance-oz-is-wonder|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''Minnesota Monthly'', Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's ''Showdown'': "There is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros."&lt;ref name=youngfearless /&gt; In ''Spectacle'', Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have "a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter."&lt;ref name="expanding spectacle" /&gt;

Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, "at two hours and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [''Grimm''{{'s}}] run time is an awfully long haul for the smallest circus-goers."&lt;ref name=knightarts /&gt; Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of ''Grimm'' that "there are moments&amp;nbsp;– just a few stand out&amp;nbsp;– when you realize that these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fairy tales in flight|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/126578298.html|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, writing for ''BroadwayWorld'', Elaina Lenertz stated, "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lenertz|first1=Elaina|title=Circus Juventas' Showdown Wows Audiences with Pint-Sized Performers|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/minneapolis/article/BWW-Reviews-Circus-Juventas-SHOWDOWN-Wows-Audiences-with-Pint-Sized-Performers-20120822|accessdate=June 23, 2014|work=BroadwayWorld|date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">'''Contemporary Tibetan art''' refers to the art of modern Tibet, or Tibet after 1950. It can also refer to art by the [[Tibetan diaspora]], which is explicitly political and religious in nature. Contemporary Tibetan art includes modern [[thangka]] (religious scroll paintings) that resemble ancient thangka, as well as radical, [[avant-garde]], works.

==Historical Tibetan art==
For more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of [[Tibet]]. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, for the most part being distemper on cloth or murals. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by uncredited artists. These works not only document spiritual concepts but also demonstrate the vitality of Tibetan [[aesthetics]] over the centuries in terms of the cross-fertilisation of stylistic influences from other Chinese, Nepalese, and Indian styles.

== After 1950 ==
Historical Tibetan art followed a formal system of art making that was used to spread Tibetan religious culture.  However, in 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]] gained sovereignty over [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] while still granting autonomy to the area.  This changed the social reality of life in Tibet, and modern Tibetan artists use their work as a mode of self-expression and exploration of their new, complex national identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anonymous: Contemporary Tibetan Art|last=Weingeist|first=Rachel Perera|publisher=ArtAsiaPacific|year=2013|isbn=|location=Hong Kong|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Tibetan artwork often conflicts with traditional artwork commissioned for religious purposes, and identity was largely tied to place, family lines, [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]], and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], with art serving as the transmission of the religion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tibetan art after 1950 raises questions of how [[globalization]] effects national and [[cultural identity]], the conflict between tradition and modernity, and the influence of religion in a more [[Secularity|secular]] age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyatso|first=Nathalie|date=July 1, 2008|title=Tibetan Art Today|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=ip,uid&amp;db=aft&amp;AN=505320320&amp;scope=site|journal=Art Press|volume=347|pages=52–59|via=EBSCO Host}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyatso's work incorporates pencils and stickers on paper using the technique of the Tibetan thankga.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He applies kitsch stickers to penciled images of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and often adds commentary in speech bubbles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These colorful children's stickers often take the form of characters from American movies and media, such as [[The Simpsons]] and [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gonkargyatso.com/exhibition/2015|title=Exhibitions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a cheap, consumerist appearance that contrasts with the meticulous and deliberate nature of their application.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These images draw the viewer's attention to the conflict between the meditative and spiritual aspects of Buddhism and worldly materialism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gyatso draws on his training in traditional art techniques to create work that explores Western consumer interests, the relationship between capitalism and culture, as well as the conflict between tradition and modernity, spirituality and materialism, and religion and secularism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Kansas City Crossroads District (31507881750).jpg|thumb|Crossroads, Kansas City in December 2016]]
The '''Crossroads''' (officially the '''Crossroads Arts District''') is a historic [[neighborhood]] near [[Downtown Kansas City]], Missouri.  It is centered at approximately 19th Street and Baltimore Avenue, directly south of the [[Downtown freeway loop|Downtown Loop]] and north of [[Crown Center]]. It is the city's main [[art gallery]] district and center for the [[visual arts]]. Dozens of galleries are located in its renovated warehouses and industrial buildings. It is also home to numerous restaurants, [[housewares]] shops, [[architecture|architects]], [[interior design|designers]], an [[advertising agency]], and other visual artists. The district also has several [[live music]] venues.

Numerous buildings in the neighborhood are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including the [[TWA Corporate Headquarters Building]], [[Western Auto Building]], and [[Firestone Building]]. There are two historic groups of buildings also on the Register—Working Class Hotels at 19th &amp; Main Streets (Midwest Hotel, Monroe Hotel, and Rieger Hotel) and Crossroads Historic Freight District (industrial buildings clustered along the tracks north of [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/jackson.htm |title=Jackson County National Register Listings |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180815/http://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/jackson.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crossroads district is also home to one of the county's largest remaining{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} examples of a Film Row district. The Film Row district consists of 17 buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Following the demolition of a Film Row building, the Film Row district was placed on Missouri Preservation's 2013 list of "watched properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://preservemo.org/places-in-peril/2013-2/|title=Missouri’s Most Endangered 2013|date=2015-02-20|work=The Missouri Alliance for Historic Preservation|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'' maintain offices in the neighborhood, along with [[HOK (firm)|HOK]] and [[Barkley Inc.|Barkley]]. The [[Belger Arts Center]] is also located in the district.

==First Fridays==
{{advert|section|date=August 2018}}
Art galleries generally open new shows on the first Friday of each month from 6 to 9 pm. This has become one of the region's most popular regular events as thousands of people flock to the Crossroads for gallery "open houses" amidst the Crossroads's unique atmosphere.

There are more than 60 galleries in the Crossroads district, making it one of the five largest arts districts in the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Crossroads Music Festival==
First held in late August 2005, the Crossroads Music Festival is an annual event organized by [http://www.spiceoflifeproductions.com Spice of Life Productions], which features local music artists. The 2005 event was held at Grinder's Sculpture Park (CrossroadsKC) at 18th Street and Locust Street. In addition to concert performances, offerings include [[short film]]s by local [[independent film]]makers and booths offering apparel by local designers, local independent print media, and [[carnival]] games.

==Tax abatements==
In 2007, one of Kansas City's development agencies began a program to allow property tax abatements for art-related business who would otherwise be priced out of the neighborhood by fast-rising property values. Neighborhood leaders lobbied for the program to prevent the "Soho Effect" of gentrification. Tax abatements had been granted to developers to attract new residents to the neighborhood with high-end condominiums and lofts next to the galleries.

'''Elizabeth Polack''' was an [[England|English]] playwright of the 1830s, notable for having been described by chroniclers of the period as England's first [[Jew]]ish woman [[melodrama]]tist.

Few historical records survive which detail Elizabeth Polack's life.  Although neither the year nor place of her birth have been noted, documentation of her activity as a playwright active in [[London]] between 1830 and 1838 remains for posterity.  Contemporary records credit her with five plays, only two of which, ''Esther, the Royal Jewess; or The Death of [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]'' and ''St. Clair of the Isles; or The Outlaw of [[Barra]]'', have survived. ''Esther'', with a story taken from the [[Old Testament]], and considered in its time to be a type of an "Exotic East" melodrama, was successfully produced in 1835 at London's [[Mile End]] [[Pavilion Theatre (Mile End)|Pavilion Theatre]] in the [[East End of London|East End]] (the Pavilion was later a centre for [[Yiddish theatre]] in London). 1838's ''St. Clair'', based on an 1803 novel by Elizabeth Helme, met, however, with a very modest reception.

Polack may have been a relation of [[Joel Samuel Polack]], the first Jewish settler of New Zealand. Joel's biographer writes that he lived with his sister in Piccadilly when he first returned to England; that sister may have been Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="gore"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sisters of Gore: seven Gothic melodramas by British women, 1790-1843 |first=John Charles |last=Franceschina |pages=227–284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8waoQn5L0wAC&amp;pg=PA227 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997|isbn=9780815317814 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federico Borrell García''' (January 3, 1912 &amp;ndash; September 5, 1936) was a [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] and [[Iberian Federation of Anarchist Youth|anarchist]] militiaman during the [[Spanish Civil War]], commonly thought to be the subject in the famous [[Robert Capa]] photo ''[[The Falling Soldier]]'' ('''''Loyalist Militiaman at the Moment of Death, Cerro Muriano, September 5, 1936''''').

He was born in [[Benilloba]], [[Valencian Community]], and went by the nickname "Taino". He worked at a mill in [[Alcoi]] and he founded the local branch of the anarchist [[Iberian Federation of Libertarian Youth]] (FIJL).  He joined the local Loyalist militia, the Columna Alcoiana, set up to defend the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] against the Spanish Nationalist forces of [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name=am&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Proving that Robert Capa's "Falling Soldier" is genuine: A detective story |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/capa_r.html |quote=Because Brotóns had himself fought at Cerro Muriano on September 5, 1936, he remembered from his first-hand knowledge that Federico Borrell García had been killed there that day. In the course of his research, Brotóns contacted the historian Francisco Moreno Gómez (author of the definitive book about the civil war on the Córdoba front), who informed him that the records in the Spanish government archives in [[Salamanca]] and [[Madrid]] confirm that only one member of the Columna Alcoyana died at Cerro Muriano on September 5, 1936. Brotóns then could be certain that the man in Capa's photograph must be Federico Borrell García. When Brotóns showed Capa's photograph to Federico's younger brother, Everisto, he confirmed the identification.  |work=[[American Masters]] |date= |accessdate=2008-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, on the morning of September 5, 1936, Borrell was one of about fifty men who arrived at Cerro Muriano in Córdoba to reinforce the militia against Francoist forces commanded by [[General]] [[José Enrique Varela]].  During that afternoon Borrell was defending the artillery battery to the rear of the Alcoi infantry when enemy troops infiltrated behind the Loyalists and fired at them from behind.  Borrell was fatally shot around five o’clock on or near the hill known as La Loma de las Malagueñas. According to Spanish government records, he was the only member of the Columna Alcoiana to die in the fighting at Cerro Muriano that day. Everisto García, his brother, identified him from the photo.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;

Other versions claim that Borrell could have been shot and killed by rebels when posing for Robert Capa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author= [[Isabel Hilton]] |coauthors= |title=The camera never lies. But photographers can and do |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/27/photography.pressandpublishing |quote= Capa was a great photographer but he was not averse to faking. In 1937 he fabricated footage for the ''March of Time'' newsreel series. He told the ''Life'' photographer, Hansel Mieth, that the Borrell picture had been taken when the militiamen were fooling around, not in the heat of battle as had been believed. She added that Capa seemed upset and said little more except that it "haunted him badly". ... As Borrell stood to pose for Capa, he was cut down by a rebel bullet. |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 27, 2008 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary ''[[La sombra del iceberg]]'' claims that the picture was staged and that Borrell is not the individual in the picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/02/02/valencia/1201946356.html "Autopsia al miliciano de Robert Capa"] ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''.

The  '''flag of Sardinia''', called the '''flag of the Four Moors''' or simply the '''Four Moors''' ({{lang-it|I quattro mori}}; {{lang-sc|Sos battor moros}} in Logudorese or ''Is cuattru morus'' in Campidanese), is the flag of the island of [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]), first officially adopted by the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]] in 1950 with a revision in 1999, describing it as a "white field with a red cross and a bandaged [[Maure|Moor's head]] facing away from the left (the edge close to the mast) in each quarter" (Regional Law 15 April 1999, n. 10, Article 1.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/86?v=9&amp;c=72&amp;s=1&amp;file=1999010&lt;/ref&gt;. It was also the historical flag and coat of arms of the Spanish and later Savoyard [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. 

The flag is composed of the [[St George's Cross]] and four heads of [[Moors]], which in the past were not forehead bandaged but blindfolded and turned towards the left. The most accepted hypothesis is that the heads represented the heads of Moorish princes defeated by the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]], as for the first time they appeared in the 13th century seals of the Crown of Aragon – although with a beard and no bandage, contrary to the Moors of the Sardinian flag, which appeared for the first time in a manuscript of the second half of the 14th century.

The oldest certified emblem of the four Moors dates back to 1281: it was the seal of the Royal Chancellery of Peter of Aragon, but the four heads had no bandages and were bearded; the coat of arms of Sardinia never appeared in such a way.
After that the kingdom of Sardinia was founded in 1326, it became part of the Crown of Aragon; these seals will come to closing documents of [[James II of Aragon|King James II]] (1326), [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso Benigno]] (1327-1336) and [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter]] I (1336-1387). Some specimens are preserved in the Historical Archive of the city of [[Cagliari]]. The late 14th century [[Gelre Armorial]] attributes the Four Moors to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the states of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. It is found in another Armorial perhaps from Lorraine area (preserved in the National Library of France) and of uncertain date but certainly in the 15th century. In 1509, another Portuguese Armorial Book (Livro do Armeiro-mor). Sardinia is represented only with the cross of St. George.

The Four Moors begin to be used consistently as a symbol of the Kingdom of Sardinia during the time of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], and especially from the time of the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. 
A book printed by [[Plantin Press|Plantin]], Antwerp, representing the funeral procession of Charles V composed of bishops and harnessed horses with the insignia of each state.

In Sardinia the first safe attestation of the coat of arms is on the cover of the Acts of the military arm of the Sardinian Parliament, the ''Capitols de Cort del Stament Militar de Serdenya'' printed in Cagliari in 1591. 

At this time, now the memories of the long and often fratricidal wars with the Judge of Arborea was ebbing away, the Iberian settlers were now included in the Sardinian society, with the passing of generations, becoming an integral part for inclusion in a political organization in which not only Sardinia, but also Aragon and Catalonia were small components. It meant that the accession at the Imperial Habsburg Ideology, reinvigorate also the sense of belonging to that little State that was represented by the Four Moors. Over the centuries the flag or coat of arms of the four Moors were depicted in various ways: without bandage, with blindfold or forehead, facing to luff or to fly end, or crowned, with no Moors, in reverse, and this according to the mode of the charged artist, such as that under the leadership of [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Francisco de Zurbaran]] represented in the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro]] in Madrid. Throughout the period of the Iberian monarchies the original design of the bandages on his forehead is respected.

Ever since the [[House of Savoy]] ruled Sardinia in the mid-18th century, instead, the iconography of putting the blindfold over the eyes of the Moors settled and continued to persist until 1999, within the flag of St. George, in every quarter and in the direction of the luff. The Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Sardinia clearly leads the four Moors with the bandage on their foreheads. The blindfold appears in 1800: it was either due to a mistake of a copyist or a deliberate act as a mark of protest against the Mainland rulers.

In 1952, the shield of the blindfolded eyes Four Moors became the official flag of the Autonomous Region and also adorned his banner (Decree of the President of the Republic of 5 July 1952). In 1999, a special regional law changed the flag of the Four Moors from the version adopted under Savoyard rule to the original one, as described in the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.gelocal.it/lanuovasardegna/archivio/lanuovasardegna/1999/04/14/SK104.html ''Sì ai quattro mori sbendati, Il governo approva la nuova bandiera sarda'', La Nuova Sardegna]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary origin==
[[File:QUATTRO MORI.jpg|thumb|200px|20th century coat of arms adopted by the [[Brigata Sassari]] the Sardinian soldier brigade during [[World War I]]]]
There are separate Spanish and Sardinian traditions to explain the origin of the flag and there is no consensus among scholars as to which is correct. According to the Spanish tradition, it was a creation of [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre|King Peter I of Aragon]], celebrating his victory at the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096. It was said that [[St. George]] miraculously appeared on the field of battle and that there were four severed heads of [[Saracen]] kings at the end; thus the red cross and white background of the [[St George's Cross]] and the heads of four Moors.&lt;ref name="Zurita1668"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerónimo Zurita|title=Anales de la Corona de Aragon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qyhXbIEF64C&amp;pg=PP5|accessdate=28 March 2013|year=1668|publisher=Dormer|at=p.32 paragraph XCVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sardinian-[[Pisa]]n tradition attributes the arms to a banner given by [[Pope Benedict VIII]] to the Pisans in aid of the [[Sardinians]] in a conflict with the Saracens of Musetto who were trying to conquer the Italian peninsula and Sardinia. This flag however has inverted colours and no heads on it.&lt;ref&gt;Ranieri Sardo, Cronaca di Pisa, (Manuscript Magliabecchi XXV-491, 1440-1450) a cura di Ottavio Banti, Istituto Italiano per il medioevo, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Kingdom of Sardinia was founded, the rulers of the island were known as archons (ἄρχοντες in Greek) or judges (''iudices'' in Latin, ''judikes'' in Sardinian, ''giudici'' in Italian). The island was organized into one "judicatus" from the 9th century on (see [[List of monarchs of Sardinia]]). After the Muslim conquest of Sicily in the 9th century, the Byzantines, who previously ruled Sardinia, couldn't manage to defend their far west province. Probably, a local noble family acceded to power, still identifying themselves as vassal of the Byzantines, but independent "de facto", as communications with Constantinople were very difficult. At the beginnings of the 11th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by Spanish Muslims. We have very little record of that war, only by Pisa and Genoa chronicles. Christians won, but after that, the previous Sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four more little judicati: Cagliari, Arborea, Gallura, and Torres or Logudoro; each one developed its own coat of arms. When, with the appointment of the King of Aragon as King of Sardinia, the island again became one united kingdom, only the Judicatus of Arborea survived, and fought for a century against the Kingdom of Sardinia for supremacy.

According to some, the flag derives from Alcoraz victory of 1096, is linked to the Crown of Aragon, and represents the [[Spanish Reconquista]] against the Moors who occupied most of the Iberian Peninsula. It is composed of the cross of St. George, also a symbol of the Crusaders fighting in the same time in the Holy Land, and the four severed heads, representing four major victories in Spain by the Aragonese: the reconquest of Zaragoza, Valencia, Murcia, and the Balearic Islands. According to others (Mario Valdes y Cocom),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/ssecretum1.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Moors represent the Egyptian [[Saint Maurice]], martyred under [[Diocletian]], and are shown in this manner, with the heads bandaged, in countless coats of arms in the Franco-German area. Even [[Saint Victor of Marseilles]], who was from the same Theban Legion commanded by Maurice and escaped the decimation, is represented by a blackamoor with a bandage on his forehead, as in the High Altar of [[St. Nicholas' Church of Tallinn]],&lt;ref&gt;Estonia, oil on wood, St. George, St. Nicholas and St. Victor of Marseilles, 1481 by Rode, Hermen (c.1468-1504)&lt;/ref&gt; now in the Art Museum of Estonia, Tallinn. The common tradition which links the stories of the two saints suggests that the symbol was designed between the [[St. Maurice's Abbey|St. Maurice Abbey]] [[Valais|Canton of Valais]] (Switzerland) and the [[Abbey of Saint Victor, Marseille|Abbey of St. Victor in Marseilles]]; each was built in the place of martyrdom of the respective saint. Between 1112 and 1166 the [[County of Provence]] was under the direct control of the kings of Aragon, and until 1245 ruled by descendants of the same dynasty. It should also be noted that the abbey of St. Victor of Marseilles had extensive property and political influence in Sardinia, especially in the [[Giudicato of Cagliari|Judicatus (kingdom) of Cagliari]], from the 11th to the 13th century. Actually, there are [[hagiography]]ies of many "Saint Victor" related to the [[Theban Legion]], as [[Viktor of Xanten]] or [[Victor of Solothurn]] and to the persecutions of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximinus II]] as [[Victor Maurus]] of [[Milan]], [[Vincent, Orontius, and Victor|Victor]] of [[Puigcerdà]], [[Spain]], probably inspired by the same martyr. 

However, the four Moors became the symbol of the Kingdom of Sardinia at its foundation, with the Corsican flag dating back to the same era, and became in time the flag of the island and its people. In any case, the meaning of the symbols, either two holy warriors or Moor heads cut off, makes it an emblem of warring Christianity, ''[[crusade]]r'' in the broad sense of the term, originated in a historical period of bitter conflict between Islam and Christianity, in which Sardinia was fully involved.

==Modern use==
[[File:Sardegna-Stemma.svg|thumb|200px|Coat of arms of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, with eye-blinded bendage]]
The [[Sardinian Action Party]] was founded in 1921, and adopted the four Moors as its symbol. It is conceivable that it had historically been interpreted as the icon of the four judges, as argued by Antonio Era, professor at the [[University of Sassari]] and the Regional Council, on 19 June 1950 in the discussion of the regional council before the vote that would declare the Four Moors to be the official flag of Sardinia. Era criticized the banner, stating:

{{bquote|Mind that the emblem of the Four Moors is not, as they say, the four judges in which Sardinia was divided nine centuries ago, when it was free and independent: it is an error of historical interpretation, and therefore it is not obvious nor indispensable to choose just that emblem. That is, yes, a popular coat of arms and consecrates the centuries-old tradition of Sardinia, as mentioned in the agenda, but it is not a ''very Sardinian'' emblem as it is usually imagined.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Era, Address to the Regional Council, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This speech denounced the fact that the flag was not of Sardinian origin, but it is also documentary evidence of popular feeling that he read it in the medieval Giudicati history. On the other side, the history of the Giudicati developed mainly after the victory of the maritime republics against the Saracens, which allowed the development of the four little kingdoms and the coincidence was perfectly expressed by the four Moors.

Out of the [[Sardinian nationalism|many separatist]] parties active on the island, a minor Sardist party (IRS) does not recognize the flag as being historically representative of Sardinia and its people, due to its origin dating back to Aragonese rule. Such party prefers to use the eradicated tree flag, the coat of arms of the judge of Arborea, considered the last autochthonous Sardinian state, as the party's flag. However, the eradicated tree is also the Aragonese emblem of Sobrarbe and, despite no in-depth studies, could also originate as part of the Aragonese conquest.

The '''Fortsas hoax''' refers to an incident in [[Binche|Binche, Belgium]], in 1840.  That year, booksellers, librarians, and collectors of rare books throughout [[Europe]] received a catalogue describing a collection of rare books to be auctioned.

According to the message, "Jean Nepomucene Auguste Pichauld, Comte de Fortsas", had been a collector of unique books — books of which only one copy was known to exist.  When he had died, on September 1, 1839, he had possessed 52 such books.  His heirs, not interested in collecting books, had decided to auction the collection.  The auction was to be held on August 10, 1840.

On the appointed date, numerous collectors and intellectuals gathered in Binche, hoping to bid on the books.  They learned, however, that the offices of the notary where the auction was to take place did not exist — nor did the street upon which the offices were supposedly located.  Notices which had been posted around Binche claimed that there would be no auction after all, because the town's public library had acquired the books; however, those attempting to visit the library to view the collection discovered that Binche possessed no public library.  Later it was discovered that there had never been a Comte de Fortsas.

It was eventually revealed that the hoax had been planned and carried out by antiquarian and retired military officer [[Renier Hubert Ghislain Chalon]], who enjoyed playing elaborate [[prank]]s on intellectuals.

Ironically, the original catalogue of fictitious unique books Chalon had sent to his victims has itself become a sought-after collectors' item.  It has since been reprinted several times.

'''The Glasgow School of Art''' ('''GSA''') is [[Scotland]]'s only [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]] self-governing [[art school]] offering university-level programmes and research in [[architecture]], [[fine art]] and [[design]].

The school is housed in a number of buildings in the centre of [[Glasgow]], the most famous of which was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in phases between 1896-1909. The Mackintosh Building, which became one of the city's iconic landmarks, was severely damaged by fires in May 2014 and June 2018.&lt;ref name="guardian-2018-fire"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carrell |first1=Severin |last2=Brooks |first2=Libby |last3=Rawlinson |first3=Kevin |title='Heartbreaking': fire guts Glasgow School of Art for the second time |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/16/firefighters-tackle-blaze-at-glasgow-school-of-art |accessdate=16 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1845 as the '''Glasgow Government School of Design''', the school changed its name to The Glasgow School of Art in 1853. It was first located at 12 Ingram Street and moved to the [[McLellan Galleries]] in 1869. 

In 1897, work began on a new building to house the school on Renfrew Street, funded by a donation of £10,000 from the Bellahouston Trust, left from the will of [[Moses Stevens of Bellahouston]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mackintosh-architecture.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/name/?nid=BellaTru&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], chosen for the commission by the school's director, [[Francis Henry Newbery|Francis Newbery]], who oversaw a period of expansion and fast-growing reputation. The first half of the building was completed in 1899 and the second half in 1909.

The School's campus has grown since that time and in 2009 an international architectural competition was held to find an architect-led design team who would develop the Campus Masterplan and design the Phase 1 building. The competition was won by New York-based [[Steven Holl]] Architects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevenholl.com |title=Steven Holl Architects |publisher=Stevenholl.com |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with Glasgow-based JM Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmarchitects.net/|title=jmarchitects|work=jmarchitects.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reid Building was completed in 2014 and sits opposite the now destroyed Mackintosh Building on a site previously occupied by the Foulis, Assembly and Newbery Tower Buildings.

The school has produced most of Scotland's leading contemporary artists including, since 2005, 30 per cent of [[Turner Prize]] nominees and four recent Turner Prize winners: [[Simon Starling]] in 2005, [[Richard Wright (artist)|Richard Wright]] in 2009, [[Martin Boyce]] in 2011 and [[Duncan Campbell (artist)|Duncan Campbell]] in 2014. The School of Architecture is highly rated by the architecture profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graduatearchitecture.com/ARCHSCHOOLS/archschools_en.html |title=World's Best Architecture Schools and Universities – Top 10 List |publisher=Graduatearchitecture.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216043303/http://www.graduatearchitecture.com/ARCHSCHOOLS/archschools_en.html |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the School of Design has been described by [[Design Week]] as "leaders in design education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art|url=http://www.fulbright.org.uk/about/partner-with-us/fulbright-partners/glasgow-school-of-art|work=Fulbright Partners|publisher=The US-UK Fulbright Commission|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School is organised into five academic schools, the [[Mackintosh School of Architecture]] (named after Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who is also the GSA's most revered alumnus), the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation (formerly the Digital Design Studio), specialising in digital and virtual technologies was launched in October 2016. The Innovation School was launched in September 2017. GSA also has a long-established portfolio of non-degree art and design classes for children and adults delivered through GSA Open Studio.

Disciplines include [[fine-art photography]] (founded by [[Thomas Joshua Cooper]] in 1982); [[painting]] and [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]] and [[environmental art]], [[product design]], [[Design engineering|product-design engineering]], [[textile design]], [[fashion design]], [[silversmithing]] and [[jewellery design]], [[interior design]], [[communication design]], [[interaction design]], and [[Architectural theory|architecture]].

===2014 fire===
[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|The façade of the Mackintosh building after the fire of 2014]]
The original Mackintosh building was severely damaged by fire on 23 May 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC-fight-to-save"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27541883 |title=Glasgow School of Art: Fire crews battle to save building |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/23/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-library|title=Glasgow School of Art fire  brought under control|date=23 May 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial fire service estimate was that 90 per cent of the building and 70 per cent of its contents had been saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27553056 |title=Glasgow School of Art: Fire crews save most of building |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire, which began in the basement, quickly spread upwards and, although it was brought under control quite quickly, significant damage was done to the historic studios and stairways. The renowned Mackintosh library was destroyed; the archive was water damaged, but was able to be air and freeze dried. There were no reported casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27556659 |title=Glasgow School of Art fire: Iconic library destroyed |publisher=BBC News|date= |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire broke out as students were preparing for their Degree Show. Eyewitnesses said that the fire appeared to have started when a projector exploded in the basement of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building just before 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="BBC-fight-to-save" /&gt;&lt;ref name=stv-2014-fire&gt;{{cite web|title=Firefighters battle major blaze at Mackintosh Glasgow School of Ar|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/276365-rennie-mackintosh-glasgow-school-of-art-on-fire/|work=STV News|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators later determined that the cause was not a faulty projector, but "a canister of expanding foam" used in close proximity to a hot projector, causing flammable gases to ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art blaze: Report says foam canister caused fire|author=Reevel Alderson, Home affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-30214533#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper, the use of aerosol cans is against school policy. The report from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service found that the design of the building contributed greatly to the spread of the fire: "the number of timber lined walls and voids, and original ventilation ducts running both vertically and horizontally throughout the building" as well as "a vertical service void", which "ran the entire height of the building … [and] allowed flames, hot gases, and smoke to travel". [[Fire damper| Fire and smoke dampers]], which are intended to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through ducts, had not been [[Retrofitting|retrofitted]]. In addition, an intended "fire suppression system" for the building had not been completed. A school staff member was on hand when the blaze first ignited, but was unable to contain the fast-spreading flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow School of Art fire a 'freak accident'|author=CRAIG BROWN|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-a-freak-accident-1-3616895|publisher=The Scotsman: Scotland on Sunday|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restoration ====
A careful restoration process began soon after the fire; work on restoring and recreating the Mackintosh design, including the famous library interior, started in 2016.&lt;ref name="SheaRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Christopher|title=Restoring a Charles Rennie Mackintosh Architectural Gem From the Ashes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/design/restoring-a-charles-rennie-mackintosh-architectural-gem-from-the-ashes.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration was performed with historical accuracy, including the use of original wood species such as [[longleaf pine]] and [[tulipwood]].&lt;ref name="BrooksRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Libby|title=Glasgow School of Art's library restoration begins in earnest|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/24/glasgow-school-of-art-mackintosh-library-fire-restoration-begins-in-earnest|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MackintoshRestoration"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mackintosh at the Glasgow School of Art|url=https://www.longleaflumber.com/the-mackintosh-at-the-glasgow-school-of-art/|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 fire===
A large fire broke out in the Mackintosh Building on 15 June 2018, causing extensive damage. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19&amp;nbsp;pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/world/europe/uk-fire-glasgow-school-of-art.html|title=Glasgow Jewel Goes Up in Flames for Second Time in 4 Years|publisher=Ny Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; No casualties were reported. {{As of|2018|June|18|alt=The cause of the fire is not yet known.}}&lt;ref name="guardian-2018-fire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glasgow fire: Major blaze ravages art school's Mackintosh Building |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44504659 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Murray &amp; Alan Dunlop Architects|Alan Dunlop]], visiting professor of architecture at [[Robert Gordon University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.e-architect.co.uk/aberdeen/scott-sutherland-rgu-glasgow|title=Scott Sutherland Aberdeen: School of Architecture - e-architect|date=2010-01-30|work=e-architect|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; who studied at the Mackintosh School of Architecture, was contacted by the press immediately after the fire and stated: "I can’t see any restoration possible for the building itself. It looks totally destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/16/glasgow-school-of-art-may-be-beyond-repair-after-fire|title=Glasgow School of Art may be beyond repair after second fire |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view was not supported by the early external building surveys, which appeared to indicate that much of the exterior had survived, though extensively damaged. Drone footage enabled a clearer assessment of the extent of the interior damage, and a programme of partial dismantling was established to stabilise the portions of the facade at risk of collapse, notably the south elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gsapress.blogspot.com/2018/07/news-release-work-begins-to-dismantle.html|title=Work begins to dismantle dangerous sections of the Mackintosh Building|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Glasgow City Council]] spokesperson said: "There is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, HES ([[Historic Environment Scotland]]) people and the art school is to save the building... Right now, people are operating on the understanding it will be saveable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/18/shell-of-glasgow-school-of-art-building-may-be-saved-from-demolition|title=Glasgow School of Art building expected to be saved from demolition|last=|first=|date=18 June 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted by Roger Billcliffe that “It has been voted Britain’s most important building several times over, and we have all of the information needed to recreate every detail, following extensive laser surveys after the first fire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/19/bulldoze-or-rebuild-architects-at-odds-over-future-of-glasgow-school-of-art|title=Bulldoze or rebuild?

The first opportunity for the school administration to visit the site happened on 19 June 2018. [[Muriel Gray]], Chair of the Board of Governors, stated: "This was the first opportunity for the expert team to see the building and begin what will be a long and complex process of determining the future of the Mack, but we remain optimistic. There is a huge desire to see Mackintosh’s masterpiece rise again, one which we all share. We have incredibly detailed information on the building collated over the last 4 years, and have worked with teams of talented craftspeople who were doing a tremendous job on the restoration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/about-gsa/key-information/mackintosh-building-fire-15-june-2018/|title=Statement from the GSA 19 June 2018 - Work to assess the condition of the Mackintosh Building underway|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent statement to the BBC, Professor Tom Inns, director of the school, affirmed that "This building is not beyond saving. It will be saved in some form." He continued to support his firm belief that the building should continue in its function as a working art school, rather than a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44530694|title=Fire-ravaged art school 'will be saved'|date=2018-06-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk factors====

At the time of the fire, [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinklers]] had yet to be installed in the building. Components for the fire suppression system had been delivered the day before, but were weeks away from assembly and testing. Building control officers have expressed concerns that the end walls may collapse. The building remains cordoned off and affected residents have been offered accommodation by Glasgow City Council.&lt;ref name="BBCSprinklers"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44592882 |accessdate = 24 June 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 24 June 2018 | title = Glasgow School of Art fire safety system 'was weeks away' |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2018 it was announced that work is being planned to take down parts of the building that are in danger of collapse. Compensation for local residents and businesses will be made available by the Scottish Government.&lt;ref name="BBCDismantle"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-44497880 |accessdate = 28 June 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 28 June 2018 | title = Glasgow School of Art in danger of 'sudden collapse' |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2018, Glasgow School of Art terminated its £25 million restoration contract with Kier following the Mackintosh Building fire.

==Campus==
[[File:gsa westernfacade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The western façade of the Mackintosh building]]
The school currently has two separate campuses: the School of Fine Art, Digital Culture, and MFA programmes are in the vicinity of the Mackintosh building. The School of Design – Textiles, Jewellery &amp; Silversmithing, Product Design Engineering, Product Design, Communication Design and Interior Design – the Centre for Advanced Textiles, Design Innovation Studio and the Where the Monkey Sleeps cafe have recently{{when|date=August 2018}} moved back to the Garnethill Campus with the occupation of the new Reid Building.

The Institute of Design Innovation (InDI), a research centre of the School of Design is based in Forres and the school has a Representative Office in Beijing, PRC. The GSA has a specialist research and postgraduate centre, [[Digital Design Studio]] (DDS), based on the southside of Glasgow in a new facility at [[Pacific Quay]] by the [[River Clyde]] in a building called The Hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hub-pq.com/home.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910023225/http://www.hub-pq.com/home.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-09-10|title=Graphic Design Agency / Brand Consultants Midlands – Alt Design|work=Alt Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mackintosh Building was the heart of the campus and continued to be a functioning part of the school until the first major fire on 23 May 2014. The building housed the [[Fine Art]] Painting department, first year studios and administrative staff. It houses the Mackintosh gallery which held many different exhibitions throughout the year. The Mackintosh Gallery (also known as the Mackintosh Museum) was the only part of the Mackintosh building open to the general public; all other areas of the school were only viewable by guided tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CathieRandall |url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/tours |title=Tours |publisher=Gsa.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to this rule was the Degree Show where all the studios within the Mackintosh building were opened to allow people to view the graduating year's final artworks. Since the fire of May 2014 the School of Fine Art has been temporarily housed in a campus at the Tontine Building, [[Merchant City]], Glasgow &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/visual/13412640.GSA_degree_show_takes_root_in_the_Trongate/|title=GSA Degree Show takes root in Trongate|last=|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Mackintosh Building underwent restoration and the newly acquired Stow Building is refurbished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/support-gsa/mackintosh-campus-appeal/|title=Mackintosh Campus Appeal|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=The Glasgow School of Art|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Richmond Building houses the Fine Art Photography department. The Mackintosh School of Architecture and the school's library and learning resources are situated in The Bourdon Building. The Barnes Building on West Graham Street is the base for the Sculpture and Environmental Art, International Foundation and Interaction Design programmes.

An international architectural competition was launched in March 2009 to find the design team to prepare a campus masterplan and detailed design of the first new building phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitecture.com/news/read/GSA+launches+international+search+for+architects|title=Scottisharchitecture.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the competition was Steven Holl Architects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waite |first=Richard |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/steven-holl-unveils-glasgow-school-of-art-mackintosh-designs/5207716.article |title=Steven Holl unveils Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh designs |publisher=Architects Journal |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in partnership with Glasgow’s JM Architects and Arup Engineering. Work commenced in 2011 and continued until 2013. The building was structurally complete in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/glasgow_school_of_art_competition.php|title=Glasgow School of Art Competition – Extension Building|work=Glasgow Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new building has been named the Reid Building after the last Director: Dame [[Seona Reid]], and won Building of the Year at the 2014 Architect's Journal awards – the AJ100 Awards in May 2014, and the Award for Arts or Entertainment Structures at the [[IStructE]]'s 2014 [[Structural Awards]].

==Singapore Campus==
Since September 2012, the GSA has delivered years 3 and 4 of its Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Programmes in Communication Design and Interior Design in Singapore, in partnership with the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] (SIT), based at the [[Temasek Polytechnic]] Campus in Tampines.
The programmes enable Diploma students from the Singapore Polytechnics to progress from a Diploma to a BA (Hons) degree. 
Students studying in Singapore benefit from the same programme of study and award as in the home institution, along with resources and equipment according to the GSA specifications.

==Students==
The GSA has been ranked in the top 10 of specialist educational institutions in ''[[The Guardian]]'' University Guide, ranking it the top specialist visual arts institution in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2011/may/17/universityguide |title=University guide 2012: Specialist institutions league table |date=17 May 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its degrees are validated by the [[University of Glasgow]]. Of its 1,900 students, almost 20 per cent are international, 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and approximately 20 per cent are postgraduate. The GSA is placed 10th in the 2015 QS World Rankings for Art and Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/art-design#sorting=rank%20region=%20country=%20faculty=%20stars=false%20search=|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2015 – Art &amp; Design|date=22 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2nd in the nationally ranking 2016 Complete University Guide league table for Art and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Art%20&amp;%20Design|title=Top UK University League Tables and Rankings 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HESA statistics show the GSA to have one of the lowest student drop-out rates in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7436091.stm |date=4 June 2008 |title=University drop-out rate |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/which-universities-have-the-highest-first-year-dropout-rates |date=28 August 2017 |title=Which universities have the highest first year dropout rates? |work=Channel 4 News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the funding councils published figures which placed Glasgow School of Art as having the second-lowest number of students from a working-class background out of a list of UK higher education institutions. With 7 per cent of its students coming from social classes IIIm, IV and V (skilled manual, semi-skilled or un-skilled workers), the figures put it above Oxford and Cambridge in terms of exclusivity. Glasgow School of art disputed the figures, explaining that the majority of its applicants did not come through the [[UCAS]] system on which the statistics were based so the numbers involved were very small. This was reinforced by [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|HEFCE]], which said the figures should be treated with care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacLeod|first=Donald|title=Glasgow 'posher' than Oxbridge|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/dec/18/accesstouniversity.highereducation|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=18 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the Commission on Widening Access (CoWA) found the percentage of Scottish-domiciled full-time first degree entrants from SIMD 20 (20 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland) at the GSA was 22.2 per cent. This is the second highest in Scotland, according to CoWA's report, with only [[University of the West of Scotland]] having more.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Widening Access – Technical paper on measures and targets, p11, Annex A (14 Mar 2016) [http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00496620.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The Glasgow School of Art is host to a number of high-profile research projects, funded primarily through the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]], and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], although other UK research councils have funded projects in the past.

At the last [[Research Assessment Exercise]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/ByHei/95|title=REF2014 results by institution/Glasgow School of Art|last=|first=|date=2014|website=results.ref.ac.uk|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the GSA had the largest art and design research community in Scotland and with 23 per cent of research evaluated as world leading. The GSA has a number of research centres including the Digital Design Studio, Mackintosh Environmental Architectural Research Unit, Institute of Design Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/55365510 |title=Institute of Design Innovation on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centre for Advanced Textiles and the Glasgow Urban Lab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ScottParsons |url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/research/research-centres/ |title=Research Centres |publisher=Gsa.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research professors include Professor Thomas Joshua Cooper, Professor Alastair Macdonald, Professor Tim Sharpe, Professor Irene McAra-McWilliam {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|list=OBE}}, Professor Ken Neil, Professor Johnny Rodger, Professor Christopher Platt, Professor Steve Love, Professor Paul Chapman and Professor Brian Evans.

==Exhibitions==
The school runs an annual public programme of exhibitions and events. The Reid Gallery has a curated programme that works with contemporary artists, designers and architects; and GSA staff and students, and makes connections to the heritage and architecture of the Glasgow School of Art and its collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.ac.uk/life/gsa-events|title=GSA Events|date=|publisher=Gsa.ac.uk|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19640">'''Hans Haacke''' (born August 12, 1936) is a German-born [[art]]ist who currently lives and works in New York.

==Early life==
Haacke was born in [[Cologne]], Germany. He studied at the ''Staatliche Werkakademie'' in [[Kassel]], Germany, from 1956 to 1960. He was a student of [[Stanley William Hayter]], a well-known and influential English printmaker, draftsman, and painter. From 1961 to 1962 he studied on a [[Fulbright grant]] at the [[Tyler School of Art]] at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]]. From 1967 to 2002 Haacke was a professor at the [[Cooper Union]] in New York City.
[[File:Condensation Cube of Haacke.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Condensation Cube'', begun 1965, completed 2008; [[Plexiglas]] and water; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]]]

During his formative years in Germany, he was a member of Zero (an international group of artists, active ca. 1957-1966).&lt;ref name="Framing"&gt;Haacke, Hans. ''Framing and Being Framed''. Halifax: Press of Nova scotia College of Art and Design, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; This group was held together with common motivations: the longing to re-harmonize man and nature and to restore art's metaphysical dimension. They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices.

Although their methods differed greatly, most of the work was [[monochromatic]], geometric, kinetic, and [[gestural]].&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt; But most of all they used nontraditional materials such as industrial materials, fire and water, light, and kinetic effects. The influence of the Zero group and the materials they used is clear in Haacke's early work from his paintings that allude to movement and expression to his early installations that are formally minimal and use earthly elements as materials.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt;

These early installations focused on systems and processes.  ''Condensation Cube'' (1963–65) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into [[land art]], but by the end of the 1960s his art had found a more specific focus.

==Systems work (1970–present)==
Haacke's interest in real-time systems propelled him into his criticism of social and political systems.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;Tate Collection.[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2217&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio "Hans Haacke"] Accessed October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In most of his work after the late 1960s, Haacke focused on the [[art world]] and the system of exchange between museums and corporations and corporate leaders; he often underlines its effects in  site-specific ways.

Haacke has been outspoken throughout his career about demystifying the relationship between museums and businesses and their individual practices. He writes, "what we have here is a real exchange of capital: [[financial capital]] on the part of the sponsors and [[symbolic capital]] on the part of the sponsored".&lt;ref name="Free Exchange"&gt;Bourdieu, P. and H. Haacke. ''Free Exchange''. Stanford: Stanford Univ Press, 1995. pg17.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this concept from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Haacke has underlined the idea that corporate sponsorship of art enhances their public reputation, which is of material use to them.  Haacke believes, moreover, that both parties are aware of this exchange, and as an artist, Haacke is intent on making this relationship clear to viewers.
[[File:Momapoll.gif|Momapoll|left|250|frame|Hans Haacke ''MoMA Poll'', 1970.]]

In 1970 Hans Haacke proposed a work for the exhibition entitled ''Information'' to be held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York (an exhibition meant to be an overview of current younger artists), according to which the visitors would be asked to vote on a current socio-political issue.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt; The proposal was accepted, and Haacke prepared his installation, entitled ''MoMA Poll'', but did not hand in the specific question until right before the opening of the show. His query asked, "Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?" Visitors were asked to deposit their answers in the appropriate one of two transparent [[Plexiglas]] ballot boxes. At the end of the exhibition, there were approximately twice as many Yes ballots as No ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ucsb.edu/faculty/budgett/algorithmic_art/haacke.html |title=Hans Haacke, MOMA Poll [1970] |accessdate=2007-09-20 |work=Algorithmic Art @ ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haacke's question commented directly on the involvements of a major donor and board member at MOMA, Nelson Rockefeller. This installation is an early example of what in the art world came to be known as [[institutional critique]].

In one of his best-known works, which quickly became an art historical landmark, ''Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings, A Real Time Social System, as of May 1, 1971,'' Haacke took on the real-estate holdings of one of New York City's biggest slum landlords. The work exposed, through meticulous documentation and photographs, the questionable transactions of Harry Shapolsky's real-estate business between 1951 and 1971. Haacke's solo show at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], which was to include this work and which made an issue of the business and personal connections of the museum's trustees, was cancelled on the grounds of artistic impropriety by the museum's director six weeks before the opening. (Shapolsky was not such a trustee, although some have misunderstood the affair by assuming that he was.) Curator Edward Fry was consequently fired for his support of the work.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Danto. "Art-Hans Haacke:Unfinished Business." ''The Nation'', February 14, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Alloway. "Art." ''The Nation'', August 2, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the abrupt cancellation of his exhibition and the trouble it had caused with the museum, Haacke turned to other galleries, to Europe and his native country, where his work was more often accepted. Ten years later he included the Shapolsky work—by then widely known—at his solo exhibition at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]], entitled  "Hans Haacke: Unfinished Business".&lt;ref name= "New York Times"&gt;Michael Brenson. "Art: In political Tone, Works by Hans Haacke." ''The New York Times'', December 19, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Free  Exchange"/&gt;

At the John Weber gallery in New York, in 1972, on two separate occasions, Haacke created a [[sociological]] study, collecting data from gallery visitors. He requested the visitors fill out a questionnaire with 20 questions ranging from their personal [[demographic]] background information to opinions on social and political issues. The results of the questionnaires were translated into [[pie chart]]s and [[bar graph]]s that were presented in the gallery at a later date.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt; They revealed, among other things, that most visitors were related in some way to the professions of art, art teaching, and museology, and most were politically [[Liberalism|liberal]].

In 1974, Haacke submitted another proposal that was subsequently rejected for an exhibition at the Wallraf-Richartz museum in [[Cologne]]. The work described a well-documented history of the ownership (with individual biographies of each of the owners) of [[Manet]]'s painting ''Bunch of Asparagus'' in the museum's collection, narrating how it came into the collection, and in which the [[Third Reich]] activities of its donor were revealed. Instead, the work was exhibited in the Paul Menz Gallery in Cologne with a color reproduction in place of the original.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt;

In 1975, Haacke created a similar piece to the Manet project at the John Weber gallery in New York, exposing the history of ownership of [[Seurat]]'s ''[[Models (painting)|Models]]'' (''Les Poseuses'') (small version).  In the same manner as the previous installation, this work showed the increase of the value of the work as it passed from one patron to another.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt;

Also In 1975, he created one of his most memorable installations, entitled ''On Social Grease''. The work, which takes its title from a speech by a corporate head of one of the world's major oil companies, is made up of carefully factured plaques exhibiting quotes from business executives and important art world figures. These plaques display their opinions on the system of exchange between museums and businesses, speaking directly to the importance of the arts in business practices.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

In 1978 Haacke had a solo exhibition at the [[Modern Art Oxford|Museum of Modern Art]] in Oxford, England, that included  the new work ''A Breed Apart'', which made explicit criticism of the state-owned [[British Leyland]] for exporting vehicles for police and military use to [[apartheid]] South Africa.

His 1979 solo exhibition at [[Chicago's Renaissance Society]] featured paintings that reproduced and altered print ads for [[Mobil]], [[AlliedSignal|Allied Chemical]], and [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]]

===1980s===
With extensive research Haacke continued throughout the 1980s to target corporations and museums in his work through larger scale installations and paintings. In 1982, at the documenta 7 exhibition, Haacke exhibited a very large work that included oil portraits of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 19th-century style, facing on the opposite wall a gigantic photograph of the demonstration against nuclear arms held earlier that year—the largest demonstration in Germany since the end of the [[Second World War]].  The clear implication, supported by Haacke's remarks, was that these two figures were attempting to roll back their respective nations to the socially and politically regressive, laissez-faire, and imperialist policies of the 19th century. In 1988 he was given an exhibition at the [[Tate Gallery]] in London at which he exhibited the portrait of Margaret Thatcher, full of iconographic references featuring cameos of [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Maurice]] and [[Charles Saatchi]].&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;C4 Contemporary Art. [http://c4gallery.com/artist/database/hans-haacke/hans-haacke.html "Profile: Hans Haacke"] Accessed October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Saatchis were well known not only as art collectors on an aggressive scale, widely affecting the course of the art world by their choices, but also as the managers of Thatcher's successful, fear-based political campaigns as well as that of the [[South African]] premier, [[P. W. Botha]].

===1990s===
Haacke's controversial 1990 painting ''Cowboy with Cigarette'' turned [[Picasso]]'s ''Man with a Hat'' (1912–13) into a cigarette advertisement. The work was a reaction to the [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] company's sponsorship of a 1989–90 exhibition about [[Cubism]] at the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref name="C4"/&gt;

Haacke has had solo exhibitions since, at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]], New York; the [[Van Abbemuseum]], Eindhoven; and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris.

In 1993 Haacke shared, with [[Nam June Paik]], the [[Golden Lion]] for the German Pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]]. Haacke's installation ''Germania'' made explicit reference to the pavilion's roots in the politics of [[Nazi Germany]].  Haacke tore up the floor of the German pavilion as Hitler once had done. In 1993, looking through the doors of the pavilion, past the broken floor, the viewer witnesses the word on the wall: "Germania", Hitler's name for Nazi Berlin.&lt;ref name="The Art Libel"&gt;''The Village Voice''. [http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-03-14/news/the-art-libel/ "The Art Libel"] Online article by Richard Goldstein. March 14, 2000. Accessed October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
At the 2000 [[Whitney Biennial]], at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York, Haacke presented a piece that is a direct reaction to art censorship. The piece called ''Sanitation'' featured six anti-art quotes from US political figures on each side of mounted American flags.The quotes were in a [[Blackletter|Gothic]] style script typeface once favored by Hitler's [[Third Reich]]. On the floor was an excerpt of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression. Lined up against the wall were a dozen garbage cans with speakers emitting military marching sounds.&lt;ref name="Art?"&gt;''Slate'' magazine. [http://www.slate.com/id/104878/ "Hans Haacke: Art or Punditry?"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Online article by Judith Shulevitz. March 16, 2000. Accessed October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Haacke notes that "freedom of expression is the focus of the work".&lt;ref name="The Art Libel"/&gt;

===Commissions===
[[File:Gift Horse - Hans Haacke - close-up.jpg|thumb|right|left|400|''Gift Horse'' on the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|Fourth plinth]] of London's [[Trafalgar Square]]]]

In 2000, a permanent installation was inaugurated in the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], the German Parliament building in Berlin, and in 2006 a public commission commemorating [[Rosa Luxemburg]] was completed in a three-block area in the center of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/30 Hans Haacke, January 11 - February 17, 2008] [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was announced that Haacke will be installing one of his works as part of the annual [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|Fourth Plinth commission]] in 2015. His winning commission of a bronze sculpture of a horse’s skeleton,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/07/riderless-horse-giant-thumb-fourth-plinth-trafalgar-square&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Gift Horse'', comes with an electronic ribbon tied to its front leg that displays a live ticker of prices on the London Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Rojas (February 7, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hans-Haacke-and-David-Shrigley-win-Fourth-Plinth-commissions/31777 Hans Haacke and David Shrigley win Fourth Plinth commissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209033725/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hans-Haacke-and-David-Shrigley-win-Fourth-Plinth-commissions/31777 |date=2014-02-09 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of Law===

Along with Adrian Piper and Michael Asher, Haacke uses a version of Seth Siegelaub and Robert Projansky's 1971 artist contract, [[:File:The_Artists_Reserved_Rights_Transfer_and_Sale_Agreement.pdf|The Artists Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement]] in order to control the dissemination, display and ownership of his art works.

==Writing and publications==

On being considered a political artist Haacke says: "it is uncomfortable for me to be a politicized artist.... the work of an artist with such a label is in danger of being understood one dimensionally without exception.... all artwork have a political component whether its intended or not".&lt;ref name="Hans Haacke talks Politics"&gt;ARTFORUM. [http://artforum.com/news/week=200413 "Germany Downsizes Culture; Hans Haacke Talks Politics ; More]" Accessed October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Burnham comments on Haacke's political growth and links its roots to exposure to a time of political unrest in the US surrounding the [[Vietnam War]]. Burnham also points to Haacke's joining the Arts Workers Coalition and the boycott of the [[São Paulo]] Bienal in Brazil in 1969 as catalyst for the artist's work to take a political direction.&lt;ref name="Framing"/&gt; Writing by Haacke and his close friends and colleagues, including documentation of his work, are collected in two separate books by the artist.

Hans Haacke first published a book about the ideas and processes behind his and other conceptual art called ''Framing and Being Framed''. Published in 1995, ''Free Exchange'', is a transcription of a conversation between Haacke and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] The two men met in the 1980s and, as Bourdieu states in the introduction, "very quickly discovered how much they have in common".&lt;ref name="Free Exchange"/&gt;

'''Heroin chic''' was a look popularized in mid-[[1990s in fashion|1990s fashion]] and characterized by [[Pallor|pale skin]], [[Periorbital dark circles|dark circles]] underneath the eyes, very skinny body, dark red [[lipstick]] and angular bone structure. The look, characterised by [[emaciated]] features and [[androgyny]], was a reaction against the "[[healthy]]" and vibrant look of models such as [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Claudia Schiffer]]. A 1996 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that the fashion industry had "a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] vision of beauty" that was reflective of [[heroin addiction|drug addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-08/news/ls-32243_1_fashion-industry|title=Why Dole Frowns On Fashion|last=Givhan|first=Robin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 8, 1996|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At the time during which heroin [[Chic (style)|chic]] emerged, the popular image of [[heroin]] was changing for several reasons. The price of heroin had decreased, and its purity had increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=durrant&gt;Durrant, Russil &amp; Jo Thakker. ''Substance Use &amp; Abuse: Cultural and Historical Perspectives''. Sage Publications (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vCYyDZE2umcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;sig=xzjPUzu6zRMaT0kFMhWrN-1XaJ8 p87]. {{ISBN|0-7619-2342-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|AIDS epidemic]] had made injecting heroin with unclean needles increasingly risky.&lt;ref name=durrant/&gt; Available heroin had become more pure, and snorting became a more common mode of heroin use.&lt;ref name=durrant/&gt;   These changes decreased the stigma surrounding the drug, allowing heroin to find a new market among the middle-class and the wealthy, in contrast to its previous base of the poor and marginalized.&lt;ref name=durrant/&gt; Heroin infiltrated pop culture through attention brought to addictions in the early 1990s. In film, the heroin chic trend in fashion coincided with a string of movies in the mid‑1990s—such as ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', [[Kids (film)|''Kids'']], ''[[Permanent Midnight]]'', and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''—that examined heroin use and drug culture.&lt;ref&gt;The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. ''Women under the Influence''. Johns Hopkins University Press (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=SbjHya9CaZkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;vq=%22heroin+chic%22&amp;sig=DzyyOE2Ce5taJalcDXcEEsSVaug p98]. {{ISBN|0-8018-8228-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grunge===
{{Main|Grunge}}
In the early 1990s, the rise of the [[grunge]] [[alternative rock]] music and subculture in Seattle brought media attention to the use of heroin by prominent grunge artists. In the 1990s, the media focused on the use of [[heroin]] by musicians in the Seattle grunge scene, with a 1992 ''New York Times'' article listing the city's "three principal drugs" as "[[espresso]], [[beer]] and heroin" &lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/style/grunge-a-success-story.html?pagewanted=all|title= Grunge: A Success Story |last=Marin |first=Rick |date=November 15, 1992 |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=January 29, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1996 article calling Seattle's grunge scene the "...subculture that has most strongly embraced heroin".&lt;ref name=heroin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/heroin.html |title=`Rock 'n' Horse: Rock's Heroin Connection |last=Dasein |first=Deena |date=December 1996 |publisher=Perfect Sound Forever |access-date=January 29, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Jonze from ''The Guardian'' states that "...heroin had blighted the [grunge] scene ever since its inception in the mid-80s" and he argues that the "...involvement of heroin mirrors the self-hating, nihilistic aspect to the music"; in addition to the heroin deaths, Jonze points out that [[Stone Temple Pilots]]' [[Scott Weiland]], as well as [[Courtney Love]], [[Mark Lanegan]] and [[Evan Dando]] "...all had their run-ins with the drug, but lived to tell the tale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/10/deadliest-music-genre-grunge-mike-starr |title=Mike Starr and the deadliest musical genre Another grunge star has died young. Tim Jonze asks: is it the most lethal genre?|last=Jonze|first=Tim|date=10 March 2011 |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 book stated that whereas in the 1980s, people used the "stimulant" [[cocaine]] to socialize and "...celebrate good times", in the 1990s grunge scene, the "depressant" heroin was used to "retreat" into a "cocoon" and be "...sheltered from a harsh and unforgiving world which offered...few prospects for...change or hope."&lt;ref name="Marion p. 888"&gt;Marion, Nancy E and Oliver, Willard M. ''Drugs in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture. and the Law''. ABC-CLIO, 2014 . p. 888.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading grunge band [[Alice in Chains]] had a song "God Smack", which included the line "stick your arm for some real fun", a reference to injecting heroin.&lt;ref name=heroin/&gt; Seattle grunge musicians known to use heroin included [[Kurt Cobain]], who was using "heroin when he shot himself in the head"; "[[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]] of [[Mother Love Bone]] [, who] overdosed on heroin in 1990"; "[[Stefanie Sargent]] of [[7 Year Bitch]][, who] died of an overdose of the same opiate in 1992...[and] [[Layne Staley]] of [[Alice in Chains]] [who] publicly detailed his battles with heroin...".&lt;ref name=seattletimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940420&amp;slug=1906421 |title=`Seattle Scene' And Heroin Use: How Bad Is It? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 20, 1994 |publisher=The Seattle Times |access-date=January 29, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]] of [[Alice in Chains]] &lt;ref name="Marion p. 888"/&gt;  and [[Jonathan Melvoin]] from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] also died from heroin. After Cobain's death, his "...widow, singer [[Courtney Love]], characterized Seattle as a drug mecca, where heroin is easier to get than in San Francisco or Los Angeles."&lt;ref name=seattletimes/&gt;

==Rise and fall==
This [[waif]]ish, emaciated look was the basis of the 1993 [[advertising]] campaign of [[Calvin Klein]] featuring [[Kate Moss]].  Film director and actor [[Vincent Gallo]] contributed to the development of the image through his Calvin Klein fashion shoots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvin Klein]] special on the Biography channel&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend eventually faded, in part due to the drug-related death of prominent fashion photographer [[Davide Sorrenti]].&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt;  In 1999 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' dubbed Brazilian supermodel [[Gisele Bündchen]] "The Return of the Sexy Model" and the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gisele B&amp;#252;ndchen |url=http://www.people.com/people/gisele_bundchen/biography |title=Celebrity Central: Gisele Bundchen biography |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and analysis==
Heroin chic fashion drew much criticism and scorn, especially from anti-drug groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-her1.htm Turns of Phrase: Heroin Chic]&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion designers, models such as [[Kate Moss]] and [[Jaime King]], and movies such as [[Trainspotting (film)|''Trainspotting'']] were blamed for glamorizing heroin use. Then-U.S.&amp;nbsp;president [[Bill Clinton]] condemned the look.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opioids.com/heroin/heroinchic.html President Clinton on Heroin Chic]&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators denied that fashion images made drug use itself more attractive. "There is no reason to expect that people attracted to the look promoted by Calvin Klein and other advertisers... will also be attracted to heroin, any more than suburban teen-agers who wear [[hip hop fashion|baggy pants and backward caps]] will end up [[drive-by shooting|shooting people from moving cars]]", wrote Jacob Sullum in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Sullum, Jacob.  [http://reason.com/opeds/jacob052397.shtml "Victims of Everything."] Reason Magazine (May 23, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the Season Nine ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Voice (Seinfeld)|The Voice]]", [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]] asks [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] about her "somewhat de&amp;#8209;poofed" hair, to which Elaine quips, "It’s the new look. You know, Heroin Chic?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheVoice.htm "The Voice"]. Seinfeld Scripts. Retrieved April 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">'''The Ho-Am Prize''' was established in 1990 by [[Lee Kun-hee|Kun-Hee Lee]], the Chairman of [[Samsung]], with a vision to create a new corporate culture that continues the noble spirit of public service espoused by the late Chairman Byung-chull Lee, founder of Samsung&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hoamprize.samsungfoundation.org/eng/foundation/intro.asp |title= The HO-AM Prize |publisher= Smsung |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ion Theodorescu-Sion''' ({{IPA-ro|iˈon te.odoˈresku siˈon}}; also known as '''Ioan Theodorescu-Sion''' or '''Teodorescu-Sion'''; January 2, 1882 – March 31, 1939) was a [[Romania]]n painter and draftsman, known for his contributions to [[modern art]] and especially for his traditionalist, [[Primitivism|primitivist]], [[handicraft]]-inspired and [[Christian art|Christian painting]]. Trained in [[academic art]], initially an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]], he dabbled in various modern styles in the years before [[World War I]]. Theodorescu-Sion's palette was interchangeably [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]], [[Divisionism|Divisionist]], [[Realist visual arts|Realist]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]], [[Synthetism|Synthetist]], [[Fauvism|Fauve]] or [[Cubism|Cubist]], but his creation had one major ideological focus: depicting peasant life in its natural setting. In time, Sion contributed to the generational goal of creating a specifically Romanian modern art, located at the intersection of folk tradition, primitivist tendencies borrowed from the West, and 20th-century [[Agrarianism|agrarian politics]].

Initially scandalized by Theodorescu-Sion's experiments, public opinion accepted his tamer style of the mid to late 1910s. Sion was commissioned as a war artist, after which his standing increased. His paintings alternated the monumental depictions of harsh rural environments, and their inhabitants, with luminous [[Balchik|Balcic]] seascapes and nostalgic records of suburban life. Their search for visual concreteness was a standard for the anti-Impressionist emancipation of the [[Art of Romania|Romanian artistic scene]] in the [[interwar period]].

By the mid-1920s, Sion's style became a visual component of the neo-traditionalist, "Romanianist" and [[neo-Byzantine]] current formed around ''[[Gândirea]]'' literary magazine. In the years before his death, the emergent [[avant-garde]] was voicing criticism of his new stylistic and ideological choices. Sion's oscillation between modernity and parochialism, his flirtation with [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics, and the eventual decline of his work endure as topics of controversy.

The son of a [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railways]] [[brakeman]] and the peasant-woman Ioana Ursu,&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.138, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion was born in [[Ianca]], [[Brăila County]],&lt;ref name="smmedalion"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Mocanu, [http://www.braila.djc.ro/DocumenteHtml.aspx?ID=2800 ''Medalion Ion Theodorescu - Sion. 70 ani de la trecerea în neființă''], at the [[Brăila County]]'s [http://www.braila.djc.ro/ Directorate for Culture and National Patrimony Sites]; retrieved November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and baptized into the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="pict&amp;zugr164"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/vestitorul/1937/BCUCLUJ_FP_279921_1937_013_017_018.pdf "Pictori și zugravi bisericești autorizați"], in ''Vestitorul'', Nr. 17-18/1937, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; On both sides, his family had origins in [[Transylvania]]'s [[Apuseni Mountains]] and the [[Breadfield]], regions at the time still part of [[Austria-Hungary]]; by popular account, some were ''[[Țara Moților|Moți]]'', that is to say [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] herders with a distinctly rustic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.122-123, 138-139, 149. See also Crainic, p.287; Tăslăuanu, p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Ion spent his early childhood on the [[Bărăgan Plain]], but grew up into a passionate hiker of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.138; Pavel, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, having attended primary and secondary school in the [[Danube]] port of [[Brăila]], the boy left for [[Bucharest]] to study at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts|National School of Fine Arts]], and graduated in 1897.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; From 1904 to 1907, with a [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Ministry of War]] scholarship to his name,&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.telegrafonline.ro/1173477600/articol/22533/compozitii_ale_pictorului_ion_theodorescusion_in_colectiile_muzeului_de_arta.html "Compoziții ale pictorului Ion Theodorescu-Sion, în colecțiile Muzeului de Artă"], in ''[[Telegraf - Constanța]]'', March 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; he traveled to [[France]]. Sion consequently enlisted at the ''[[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]]'', studying under academic masters [[Jean-Paul Laurens]] and [[Luc-Olivier Merson]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; He was a rebellious student, shaped by [[Socialism|socialist]] ideas, and squandered his scholarship money.&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"&gt;Vlasiu (2010), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Sion was rendered enthusiastic by news of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolution in Russia]], and was thrown out by his conservative patrons.&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"/&gt; He burned all his belongings except a copy of ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'', and traveled to [[French Algeria]], where he probably intended to apply for the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]].&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"/&gt; He later returned to Romania, but frequently traveled out of Romania on study trips. These took him to the [[Low Countries]], [[England]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; He was a staff [[cartoon]]ist (caricaturist) for various Romanian satirical papers, including ''Zavera'' ("The Trouble"), ''Nea Ghiță'' ("Uncle Ghiță") and [[George Ranetti]]'s ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]''.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;

From his French period, Theodorescu-Sion brought home the echoes of Impressionism, and the more modern influences of [[Paul Cézanne]], the post-Impressionist, and [[André Derain]], the Fauve, together with the optical theories of Divisionism.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Krikor Zambaccian]], [http://destinatii.liternet.ro/articol/116/Krikor-H-Zambaccian/Zambacu.html "Zambacu"], [[Editura LiterNet]]; retrieved November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1908 and 1915, the artist, still heavily indebted to the work of [[Henri Fantin-Latour]],&lt;ref name="mvsociete63-64"&gt;{{fr icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.istoria-artei.ro/resources/files/RRHA_2007.pdf "La société ''Tinerimea artistică'' de Bucarest et le symbolisme tardif entre 1902-1910"], in ''Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. Série Beaux-arts'', Vol. XLIV, 2007, p.63-64&lt;/ref&gt; was focused on creating Symbolist compositions with trees.&lt;ref name="ap92-93"&gt;Pavel, p.92-93&lt;/ref&gt; As he took more risks in his experimentation, he began looking to Cubist [[Georges Braque]] for a new way of arranging [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; In tandem with such contributions were Realistic works suggesting the influence of Romania's [[Camil Ressu]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adb(31)316"&gt;Broșteanu (1931), p.316&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolist movement and Balcic colony===
Sion was received into the innovative and eclectic society ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'', as one of its Symbolist recruits, in 1909, and shortly after exhibited his religious-themed portrait ''Lux in tenebris lucet'' ({{bibleverse|John|1:5|NIV}}).&lt;ref name="mvsociete63-64"/&gt; The same year, he sent his works to the Official Bucharest Salon, and shared with others the jury's Second Prize ''[[ex aequo]]''.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2010-12-01/Licitatie+Brancusi,+la+Paris "Licitație Brâncuși, la Paris"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', December 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem, he began hiking through the Carpathian and rural regions of Transylvania. His paintings record a growing interest in lives of its peasant inhabitants (and thus in his own peasant roots), with focus on the Romanian-inhabited areas of Apuseni, Breadfield or [[Mărginimea Sibiului]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.122-123, 138. See also Tăslăuanu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, Theodorescu-Sion also affiliated with a new wave of Romanian artists, who used simple forms, bold colors and clear contours to illustrate mystically-charged subjects. Alongside Sion, this group has been said to include [[Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck]], [[Friedrich Storck]]&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-47&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iosif Iser]], followed later by [[Rodica Maniu]] and [[Francisc Șirato]].&lt;ref name="gc823"&gt;Călinescu, p.823&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian [[George Călinescu]] describes this moment as having generated "calligraphic painting": "shaped by the contours and by the invention of ceremonial attitudes", and "most often stripped down to the drawing."&lt;ref name="gc823"/&gt;

The primitivists' activity in the visual realm is linked to the emergence of unconventional writers and the more radical manifestations of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist culture]]—commentators note their kinship with poet [[Adrian Maniu]] (Rodica Maniu's brother)&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.822-823&lt;/ref&gt; or with the minor Symbolists [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], [[N. D. Cocea]] and [[Theodor Cornel]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.39, 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion's first moment in the spotlight was in 1910, at the ''Tinerimea Artistică'' collective art show, which shocked the public and the academic authors.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45-46; Gogîltan, p.122, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The group, joined by sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]], found itself marginalized inside the exhibit, but received support in the Symbolist press.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the conclusions of other researchers, such as [[Theodor Enescu]], literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] sees in this movement, called "anti-academic post-impressionism", Romania's first departure from [[picturesque]] salon art, as well as a Romanian version of the [[Armory Show]] phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Sion was still regularly present at later ''Tinerimea'' salons. In 1912, he was extremely radical, allowing critics of the day to regard him as the prototype Romanian "[[Futurism|Futurist]]" (an expression of shocking newness, rather than an actual affiliation with the Futurist current).&lt;ref&gt;Vlasiu (2010), p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, his featured paintings included a rendition of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the Crucifixion]] and melancholic depictions of solitary shepherds.&lt;ref&gt;Duma, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he had a personal exhibit (his first-ever)&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; at the [[Romanian Atheneum]]. As noted by journalist [[Octavian Tăslăuanu]], the establishment still viewed his works with embarrassment, and "exiled" them into a lateral hall.&lt;ref name="oct248"&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.248&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913, a Romanian administration took over in [[Southern Dobruja]], and the region became of interest to Romanian artists. [[Balchik|Balcic]] (''Balchik''), once a promising port of export, declined economically, but its vistas and its exotic [[Islam in Romania|Muslim]] inhabitants made it a popular summertime resort and artists' colony.&lt;ref name="ivtonitza"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioana Vlasiu, [http://www.romlit.ro/tonitza_i_ntmplrile_artei_romneti2 "Tonitza și întâmplările artei românești"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 18/2002&lt;/ref&gt; Theodorescu-Sion joined this phenomenon at its earliest stage, and was, with Ressu, Iser, Cuțescu-Storck and others, a "founding member" of the Balcic painters' community.&lt;ref name="ivtonitza"/&gt; He was also involved on the art scene of [[Northern Dobruja]], commissioned to decorate the [[Constanța]] City Hall palace with a series of [[mural]]s.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; It was here that he first met art collector and mecena [[Krikor Zambaccian]],&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; who would purchase an exhibit a sizable portion of his later canvasses, including ''Moara din Balcic'' ("The Balchik Mill").&lt;ref&gt;Broșteanu (1931), p.313, 316&lt;/ref&gt; Zambaccian remembered Sion as a talented but peculiar and vindictive artist, who posed as artistic mentor but could not stand actual competition.&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt;

===War artist and ''Arta Română'' shows===
Around 1914, Sion had distanced entirely himself from Symbolism and the decorative lines of [[Art Nouveau]], advising his young pupil [[Lola Schmierer Roth]] to do the same—they both relied on a proto-Cubist composition into solid shapes, for which the model was Cézanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Intre-tensiunile-expresionismului-si-noul-umanism*articleID_14558-articles_details.html "Între tensiunile expresionismului și noul umanism"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 300-301, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Co-opted as a teacher at the National School of Fine Arts, Theodorescu-Sion was also one of the founding members of the Artists' Society, a leading Romanian professional association.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;

As Romania entered [[World War I]] in 1916, Ion Theodorescu-Sion was forced to interrupt his work on the Constanța murals.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; Once drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]], he returned to official and academic art: he was employed by [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Dumitru Iliescu-Turtucaia|Dumitru Iliescu]] to depict the [[Romanian Armed Forces]] in action.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; Sion witnessed (and painted) the subsequent [[Romania in World War I|storming of the Romanian front]] by the [[Central Powers]], and joined the exodus of Romanian soldiers and civil authorities into the eastern region of [[Moldavia]]. He was in [[Iași]], the provisional capital, where he began collaborating with other war artists driven away by the defeats.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; In 1918, Sion joined them as they broke with ''Tinerimea'', creating the new artistic forum ''Arta Română'' ("Romanian Art")—Ressu, [[Nicolae Tonitza]], [[Ștefan Dimitrescu]] and [[Oscar Han]] were among the other main affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Romanian authorities returned to Bucharest, Sion's work was featured in the Franklin Hall salon organized by [[Editura Minerva|Minerva Publishers]] (1919).&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", p.251; "Marius Bunescu", p.282&lt;/ref&gt; He still flirted with socialism, and, as noted by journalist [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște]], helped out in the 1920 funeral ceremony of [[Marxism|Marxist]] theorist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]: "The great old man [...] was being laid down on a bier that a group of socialist painters, headed by Teodorescu Sion, had previously wrapped in [[red flag (politics)|red fabric]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Boris Marian]], [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr231_232/pagina14.pdf "Opțiunile lui Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 231-232 (1031-1032), May–June 2005, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; His wartime conduct and artistic merits resulted in formal recognition, and he was granted high honors—the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]] (as Officer) and ''Bene Merenti'' Medal, both in 1923.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; The same year, he participated in the ''Arta Română'' exhibit with [[Argeș County]] landscapes, including ''Fântâna lui Manole'' ("[[Meșterul Manole|Manole]]'s Fountain").&lt;ref name="eugc257-258"&gt;{{ro icon}} Eugen Crăciun, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1922-1923/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1922_1923_002_016_017.pdf "Cronica artistică.

During the [[interwar period]], in addition to ''Tinerimea'' and ''Arta Română'' salons, Theodorescu-Sion exhibited his work at the Atheneum, the ''[[Universul]]'' newspaper art show, Dalles Gallery and various other venues.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; With Ressu and [[Arthur Verona]], Sion was also co-founder, in 1921, of Romania's first artists' [[trade union]] (''Sindicatul Artelor Frumoase''), which militated for basic [[social security]] but also had a political and (according to art expert Vasile Radu) "utopian" agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Radu, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/4afc38ea83992172E.pdf "Școlile artistice din Cluj și Timișoara între inițiativă privată și învățământ public"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002142450/http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/4afc38ea83992172E.pdf |date=2011-10-02 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 172, November 2009, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly, their plans earned official support during the interval when [[Victor Eftimiu]], a Symbolist playwright and rich art collector, was [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony (Romania)|Minister of Culture and the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_victor-eftimiu.html "Victor Eftimiu"], in [http://www.plural-magazine.com/ ''Plural Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}, Nr. 21/2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the early interwar years, Sion was also one of the art experts employed in the authentication of paintings by the Romanian classic [[Nicolae Grigorescu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/carul-cu-boi-cel-putin-40000-de-euro-837638.html "''Carul cu boi'', cel puțin 40.000 de euro"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', January 29, 2009; Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2010-04-07/Grigorescu,+Petrascu,+Tuculescu,+Aman,+in+topul+ofertelor+ "Grigorescu, Petrașcu, Țuculescu, Aman, în topul ofertelor"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', April 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gândirea'' years===
The 1920s were a new period of synthesis in Theodorescu-Sion's life, as he became the artistic exponent of a neo-traditionalist movement centered on ''[[Gândirea]]'' magazine. Welcomed there by art columnist [[Oscar Walter Cisek]],&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.101; Grigorescu, p.434-435, 445&lt;/ref&gt; and later by editor in chief [[Nichifor Crainic]],&lt;ref&gt;Crainic, 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsepistol"&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Scurtu, [http://www.romlit.ro/noi_contributii_despre_epistolograful_pamfil_seicaru "Noi contribuții despre epistolograful Pamfil Șeicaru"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2010&lt;/ref&gt; he provided illustrations to 1923's ''Satul meu'' ("My Village"), by ''Gândirist'' poet laureate [[Ion Pillat]].&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; Another former Symbolist, [[Tudor Arghezi]], welcomed the change in style, writing: "Whosoever remembers Theodorescu-Sion's angles, points, squares, circles, semicircles and spheres will have thanked him for handing in his cap and taking on a better suited hat, and for parting with the confabulations of a very reduced Symbolism".&lt;ref name="Vlasiu 2010, p.9"/&gt; The painter still took commissions from the Symbolist movement, providing illustration to a Symbolist play by [[Ion Minulescu]], in ''Cetiți-mă!'' monthly (January 1922).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Anca Andreescu, [http://www.bjastrasibiu.ro/conferinte/139-Anca%20Andreescu.pdf ''Conferințele Bibliotecii ASTRA, Nr. 139. Între jurnalistică și literatură''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030020/http://www.bjastrasibiu.ro/conferinte/139-Anca%20Andreescu.pdf |date=2014-05-08 }}, [[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA]], Sibiu, 2011, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter looked favorably to ''Gândirea''{{'}}s quest for a new national specificity in art, or "Romanianism". The authors of a 1970 retrospective, published with [[Editura Meridiane]], describe the period as follows: "From very different perspectives, the magazines ''[[Viața Românească]]'' and ''Gândirea'' [...] militated for the creation of artworks inspired from the Romanian reality; and if, at a later date, ''Gândirism'' would bear the imprint of exacerbated nationalism, as one of the carriers for the [[far right]] ideology, it is no less true that, in its beginnings, the magazine defined its aesthetic credo by balancing it against art's necessity of expressing a national reality."&lt;ref&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.241-242&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with author [[Felix Aderca]], Sion claimed: "The artistic feeling of Romanianism is separated from those of other peoples by a special sensitivity. Discretion applied to delicacy, harmony in a subdued chromatic. All things in union, calm and clear like a midsummer's afternoon."&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; Gogîltan links Theodorescu-Sion's main period with the establishment of [[Greater Romania]]: "Ion Theodorescu-Sion 'national-themed' canvasses were the visual rendition of a United Kingdom of Romania geography, following its incorporation of Transylvania, [[Banat]], [[Crișana]] and [[Bukovina]] in the year 1918."&lt;ref name="ag101"&gt;Gogîltan, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that Sion's passion for depicting shepherds on their seasonal treks, or [[transhumance]], is a symbol for Greater Romania as people meeting over [[pasture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-adapting himself to what critic [[Tudor Vianu]] calls "the mountaineer's experience", Sion was resuming his travels deep into the mountains, in both Argeș County and areas of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.94, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the paintings he presented for the public during the Ileana Gallery Art Show in 1925, the vast majority were landscapes of the mountains, or compositions with shepherds and mountain-folk such as ''La isvorul Troiței'' ("At the Troița [Trinity] Spring"), alternating with new Balcic seascapes.&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", ''passim''; Pavel, p.211-215&lt;/ref&gt; There is the occasional still life: ''Roz și roș'' ("Pink and Red"), which probably alluded to a poem by Transylvanian author [[Octavian Goga]], impressed Goga and was bought for the state by [[Ion Lapedatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; Sion returned to the same venue in early 1926, when his exhibited a diverse selection of his newer compositions,&lt;ref&gt;Cisek (1926), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and was rewarded with a higher class Order of the Crown.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8944 "Bucureștiul pitoresc (II)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', August 19, 2005 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted figure on Bucharest's [[Bohemianism|bohemian scene]], the painter frequented the artistic-literary club at [[Casa Capșa]] restaurant. He sat at the same table with some of the modernist and neo-traditionalist writers ([[Camil Baltazar]], [[Liviu Rebreanu]], [[Vasile Voiculescu]], [[Ilarie Voronca]]), and, story goes, was once caught up in a cake fight with the satirist and prankster [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Daniela Cârlea Șontică, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/la-un-svart-cu-capsistii-print-13785.htm "La un șvarț cu capșiștii"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', August 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sion satisfied public expectations with portraits of the Bucharest [[upper middle class]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8939 "Bucureștiul pitoresc (IV)"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', September 2, 2005 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed a design for the [[Vasile Alecsandri Mausoleum]]. He lost the latter commission to [[Paul Molda]]—reportedly, Sion preserved a bitter grudge against the [[Romanian Academy]], who had ruled against him in this matter.&lt;ref name="nc287"&gt;Crainic, p.287&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final decade===
Around 1927, Theodorescu-Sion was again concentrating on his murals: his only works at the Official Salon for that year were studies for a wall painting called ''Șipotul'' ("Gushing Spring").&lt;ref name="pcvr443-444, 446"&gt;[[Petru Comarnescu]], "Cronica artistică. Sensibilitatea artistică românească", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 6-7/1927, p.443-444, 446&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Constanța in 1928, he helped organize an official art show to mark the semicentennial of Romanian rule over that region.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; His own paintings were selected to represent Romanian art at [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|Expo 1929]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and was part of the 1930 international exhibits in [[The Hague]] and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;

By then, he had turned his back on the portrait genre, including on his trademark canvasses of peasants and shepherds, and his art became semi-abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.127, 128&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen in modernist circles, and contributed to the 1934 exhibit ''Peisajul bucureștean'' ("The Landscape of Bucharest"), with paintings dating back to 1919.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; A year later, he had a retrospective show at Dalles, which ran parallel to the debut exhibit of [[Alexandru Ciucurencu]]. Zambaccian recalls that Sion felt jealousy toward Ciucurencu's fast rise. According to Zambaccian's own account: "And since I was more preoccupied with Ciucurencu than Theodorescu Sion, he got upset and put up a sign on the door of his exhibit: 'No Entry for Dogs and Zambaccian'. Of course the storm soon subsided. The painter's wife tore off the card, and Theodorescu Sion kissed me when we met again!"&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt;

During the final five years of his life, Sion was becoming a sympathizer of [[King of Romania|Romania's King]], the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]; with [[Olga Greceanu]] and [[Marius Bunescu]], he represented, under Carol's rule, the officially-supported version of modern painting.&lt;ref name="ekmam"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Erwin Kessler]], [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-1-2006-2381.html "MAM"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 828, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; His work was again featured at a world's fair, the 1937 ''[[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]]'' in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; The same year, he was one of the artists involved in decorating the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|Bucharest Royal Palace (National Museum of Art)]],&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; and was registered as a state-approved church muralist by government ordinance.&lt;ref name="pict&amp;zugr164"/&gt;

Theodorescu-Sion died in Bucharest, on March 31, 1939,&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt; and was buried in a [[Bellu cemetery]] crypt.&lt;ref name="apmnir"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.monumenteromania.ro/index.php/monumente/detalii/ro/Monumentul%20funerar%20al%20pictorului%20Theodorescu%20Sion/2606/2447 ''Monumentul funerar al pictorului Theodorescu Sion''], at the [http://www.apmnir.ro/en/index.html Friends of the National Museum of History Association]; retrieved November 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His last selection of works was presented to the public as part of the Official Salon, which opened the same month in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="izsalonul2"&gt;{{ro icon}} I.

===Experimenter===
[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Tarani din Abrud.jpg|thumb|''Țărani din Abrud'' ("Peasants of [[Abrud]]", ca. 1913)]]

Theodorescu-Sion was probably the most protean Romanian oil painter.&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; Sion's interests in trying out formulas was taken with reserve by some in the public. Writing for the Transylvanian readership of ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', in May 1909, [[George Murnu]] contended: "Teodorescu Sion is a new talent that ought to work hard before reaching the profundity of observation which makes one an artist. He is altogether too preoccupied with technical matters and too superficial in his drawing."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[George Murnu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1909/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1909_008_010.pdf "A VIII-a expoziție a 'Tinerimii Artistice'"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 12/1913, p.221 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Tăslăuanu was to assess: "Mr. Theodorescu-Sion's art [...] doesn't agree with all people on first impression. [...] The primitive and decorative genre, with simple lines and expressive planes, has not won [it] many adherents. His way of seeing and rendering things seen relates him to the modern art of other countries."&lt;ref name="oct248"/&gt; However, "[his canvasses] are like those women who do not seek to please the eye and to resemble others. Once you get close to them, once you get to know them and study them, you fall under the spell of their profound simplicity and beauty."&lt;ref name="oct249"&gt;Tăslăuanu, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted in 1913 by ''Luceafărul'' art columnist G. Duma, Sion took his painting "science" from French academies and "the grand masters", techniques from [[Synthetism]] in his religious work, and modern decorative elements in his landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Duma, p.374&lt;/ref&gt; Duma describes Sion's 1913 paintings, especially ''Crai nou'' ("New Moon") and the Crucifixion, as a spiritual journey, and concludes: "In vibrant colors, with well-ordered planes, always directing us to the art of the future, the conscious painter Theodorescu-Sion dreams of and puts into song that [[aria]] which leads to immortality."&lt;ref&gt;Duma, p.376&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians have since disagreed about young Sion's focus on the existential mystery. Mariana Vida calls his early compositions "pathetically Symbolist",&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mariana Vida, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Ipostaze-ale-modernismului-%28I%29*articleID_22882-articles_details.html "Ipostaze ale modernismului (I)"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 503, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to [[Amelia Pavel]], his visions of solitary trees fuse [[Art Nouveau]], "with its twisted lineaments", with elements taken out of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="ap92-93"/&gt; She writes: "the leafless tree [is] a symbol of human alienation, of human powerlessness when faced with the immensity of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Pavel is explicitly contradicted by fellow Romanian scholar [[Dan Grigorescu]]: "the tree motif is probably closer to [Sion's] decorative-muralist vision of a hallmark monumentality, with its [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnicist]] implications".&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.445&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Symbolist context, Theodorescu-Sion's primitivism was a form of social investigation. G. Duma was among the early ones to describe Sion as the voice of a specific Romanian sensibility: "Theodorescu-Sion's art is the echo of a people's feelings [...]. It is the [[atavism]] of our purest art [...]. The artist creates, and the people he represents lives on through him, making it known to all other nations with definitive characteristics that [...] the sources of its own dreams are coming to light under a creative power. [...] One feels spiritually connected to Theodorescu-Sion, because one finds, buried into his pastures, the labor and suffering of a race that has produced the painter himself."&lt;ref&gt;Duma, p.373-374&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anca Gogîltan, the ''Tinerimea'' art show of 1910 was a watershed moment in the relationship between urban modern art and the rural majority of Romania, as both Theodorescu-Sion and [[Camil Ressu]] tackled rural life without idyllic conventionalism or moral indignation. She refers in particular to Sion's Transylvanian-themed ''Arat în Munții Abrudului'' ("Ploughing in the Mountains of [[Abrud]]"), "underlining man's civilizing action" rather than expressing "social critique".&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to World War I, Gogîltan argues, Sion and Ressu were the visual partners of Romanian [[agrarianism]] (or [[Poporanism]]), seeking to emphasize, like [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] in the literary field, the "dignity", "resilience" and economic importance of the Romanian peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.123, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

With his trips in [[Southern Dobruja]], his palette became more luminous, as discussed by Tăslăuanu: "In new Dobruja with its effusion of light and warmth, all colors are lighter; countours more imprecise, less defined; the coloring mixture and contrast more pronounced and richer. In the light-steeped atmosphere of Balcic and [[Ludogorie|Deliorman]], the artist found subjects that agree with his understanding of poetic color."&lt;ref name="oct249"/&gt; By 1919, he was also showing an interest in the landscape of suburbia. Cultural historian [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] argues that the resulting paintings, where the focus is on women and children, have an atmosphere of "calm" and "balance".&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; These scenes of family life contrast with his other preoccupations of the late 1910s. As [[Oscar Walter Cisek]] notes, Sion's colors were still luminous, but his canvasses "seemed to have concentrated [...] something from the darkness of the great war", and, for a while, huddled together "boulders of sheer matter".&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", p.251&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cisek, this preference hurt Sion's art for the next few years, but began to wear out with the completion of ''La isvorul Troiței''.&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", p.251-252&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of Romanian artistic modernity, the parallel evolution of Sion and [[Iosif Iser]] has intrigued various commentators. Reviewer [[Gheorghe Oprescu]] argues that the resemblance between the two is primarily modulated by Sion's temperamental changes, by his "restless, perhaps less sure of itself, being".&lt;ref name="gol'artrou"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Gheorghe Oprescu]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_l-art-roumain-de-1800-a-nos-jours.html "L'Art roumain de 1800 a nos jours"], in [http://www.plural-magazine.com/ ''Plural Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}, Nr. 28/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Another interwar critic, [[Aurel D. Broșteanu]], writes that Sion (like Iser, but with more rustic influences) contributed to "the assimilation of a pictorial objectivity", and set it out against "amorphous and disorganized Impressionism."&lt;ref name="adb(31)316"/&gt;

===''Gândirist'' painter===
[[File:Ion Theodorescu-Sion - Strajerii.jpg|thumb|''Străjerii'' ("The Guards", 1925)]]

Theodorescu-Sion's commitment to ''[[Gândirea]]'' aesthetics remains a much debated phase in his activity. Although the magazine's staff columnist noted with delight that he had abandoned his "belabored and obscure" methods for a "direct sensitivity",&lt;ref name="eugc257-258"/&gt; various authors propose that neo-traditionalism was the culmination of Theodorescu-Sion's decades of experiment. As a conclusion to his "calligraphic painting" theory, [[George Călinescu]] notes that "bit by bit, Romanian painting was gliding into the [[Neo-Byzantine]]",&lt;ref name="gc823"/&gt; while Cisek sees the 1920s Sion as a Romanian anti-Impressionist painter of the "volume" and the "classical form", compatible with Cézanne, Derain or [[Max Unold]].&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Ioan Theodorescu-Sion", p.250-251&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Tudor Vianu]] refers to ''La izvorul Troiței'' and other works from ca. 1925 as compositions of brute volumes, creating organic relationships between the figures and the landscape, an against claims that Theodorescu-Sion had become a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassic]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.212-215&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Pavel additionally writes that the mature Sion returned to painting trees, with Expressionist filtered through Derain's pictorial techniques and, more characteristically, with a growing interest in making others discover the rural landscape of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Meridiane authors, his "rhythmic sequencing of volumes" shows a mix of influences distilled from contemporary [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and echoes of the Symbolist master [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]].&lt;ref name="vd&amp;al242"&gt;Drăguț ''et al.'', p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment typically depicted in most of Theodorescu-Sion's post-1918 creative periods is that of the mountains, of Argeș and of [[Țara Moților|Motzenland]]. Vianu proposes that Theodorescu-Sion successfully fabricated himself the mentality of mountain dweller, with broken horizons and human figures seen from up close, with a somber palette that suggests "the coolness and secrecy one finds in a forest [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.211-212, 214&lt;/ref&gt; He notes: "one may document the nature of the man who created this painting style with his famous ''Self-portrait'' he exhibited [in 1925], where the protruding anatomy of his face, the unibrow, the one eye open and scanning, evoke in truth the very image of an ancestor from the mountains."&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; Sion's polemic with urban life was becoming explicit. As historian Anca Gogîltan writes, one of his ''Peisaje'' ("Landscapes"), dating ca. 1922, has "the delicate figure of a peasant woman showing up on the edge of a city, dominated by the modern city as a densely packed background, seemingly a screen of geometric shapes."&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.120-121&lt;/ref&gt; Still lifes such as ''Roz și roș'', she notes, show that he catered to the public's growing interest in folk art items, depicting rustic plates or {{not a typo|cruses}}; other works make note of the actual hierarchies of the rural space, showing women thoroughly involved in household chores such as laundering.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.137-138, 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1931 by Broșteanu, there were three deep influences on Sion's still lifes and portraits: the antique ceramic art of Romania, alongside Derain's pictorial vision, and, "unmistakably" so, the post-Impressionist canvasses of [[Ștefan Luchian]].&lt;ref name="adb(31)316"/&gt;

According to his promoter Cisek, Theodorescu-Sion's organic treatment of nature emanates from "the fundamental law" of Romania's ancient folk arts, namely: "man does not master surrounding nature; he grows from the stony and craggy soil [...] like plants, like trees, like animals."&lt;ref name="ag101"/&gt; This, Cisek argues, was the revelation of a true artistic expression of the Romanian soul, opposed to the idyllic canvasses of Impressionist master [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], but akin to the Poporanist prose of [[Calistrat Hogaș]].&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.101, 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, he assessed: "It has been said—and many among the artistically illiterate continue to repeat as much to this day—that only Grigorescu's art can ever be Romanian, and that Theodorescu-Sion's painting can have nothing in common with the substance of our soil. [...] tomorrow perhaps, [he] may find himself able to overturn skeptical impressions and theories".&lt;ref name="owc(26)43"&gt;Cisek (1926), p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Cisek depicts Sion as Romania's "best connoisseur of artistic techniques", with a "sovereign mastery",&lt;ref name="owc(26)43"/&gt; locating him at the opposite end from post-Grigorescu official art. Sion's understanding of national specificity, he argues, had nothing in common with the "mulligan" traditionalism of [[Octav Băncilă]] and [[Kimon Loghi]]: "if Mr. Loghi is a painter, then Teodorescu-Sion must surely be something else entirely! One should bear in mind that Mr. Teodorescu-Sion is still developing, whereas 'Master' Loghi has reached his summit. The summit of mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;Cisek, "Marius Bunescu", p.281&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, [[Nichifor Crainic]], who was a Grigorescu aficionado, posthumously described Sion as Grigorescu's one equal; however, he noted, Sion bowed to commissions, and as such never produced an actual masterpiece.&lt;ref name="nc286"/&gt;

Vianu's friend and ''Gândirea'' contributor [[Lucian Blaga]], a poet-philosopher on the search for Romanian specificity, applauded Theodorescu-Sion's paintings of "super-shepherds and super-peasants" in "Romanian landscapes",&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; while, from another side of modern literature, [[Victor Eftimiu]] celebrated Sion as a "cultured" and "refined" figure among the traditionalists.&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; Art reviewer [[Petru Comarnescu]] also suggests that Theodorescu-Sion did in fact live up to the expectation of a purely Romanian art, by going back to the "naturalized [[Byzantine art]]" of medieval muralists, particularly so in ''Șipotul''.&lt;ref name="pcvr443-444, 446"/&gt; Although he constructs a similar argument, the religious commentator Crainic finds that Sion was less secure as a Christian artist, even though, he notes, ''Gândirea'' itself encouraged him to paint modern [[Romanian icons]].&lt;ref name="nc287"/&gt;

==="Reactionary" modernist===
The mixture of themes and the controversies surrounding ''Gândirist'' politics have also touched Sion's artistic contributions. In the 1920s, the artistic vision proposed by Sion and Ressu was being contested by the [[avant-garde]] school of ''[[Contimporanul]]''. Also inspired by primitive art, its leaders [[Ion Vinea]] and [[Marcel Janco]] refused to view the others as actual exponents of peasant traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical experimenters, including Sion's student [[Jacques Hérold]], rejected tame modernism altogether, turning to [[Surrealism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Petre Răileanu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Mitul-transparentei*articleID_2009-articles_details.html "Mitul transparenței"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 115, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; but young neo-traditionalists such as [[Elena Popea]] found in it a source of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Aurel D. Broșteanu]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1930/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1930_010_011.pdf "Cronica plastică. Elena Popea"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 10-11/1930, p.403 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospectively, philosopher and curator [[Erwin Kessler]] finds in Sion the exponent of "a [[reactionary]] Romanian modernism": artistic nationalism, coming at a time when all modern Romanian art was divided along ethnic lines ("the ethnic component of classical modernism played an important role, one that should be explained, not occulted").&lt;ref name="ekmam"/&gt; Kessler additionally notes that there is a radical component to Sion's belief in the organic relationship of men and the soil, likening it to the main concepts of Romanian nationalism and traditionalism—from [[A. C. Cuza]]'s [[antisemitism]] to [[Virgil Madgearu]]'s agrarianism, and passing through Blaga's theory on folk architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.126-127&lt;/ref&gt; Also an antisemite, Crainic contended that Sion's art never made an impression on the art market, since the buyers were "mostly Jewish".&lt;ref&gt;Crainic, p.286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

Various critics have noted that Sion's works of the 1920s and '30s are generally awkward,&lt;ref name="smmedalion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kzzambacu"/&gt; "scholastic",&lt;ref name="gol'artrou"/&gt; or geometrical and impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;Gogîltan, p.127, 144&lt;/ref&gt; The Meridiane study finds some of his works to be "emphatic", noting that Sion "does not reach into the philosophical meaning of [[Romanian mythology|folk mythology]], retaining only its picturesque exterior."&lt;ref name="vd&amp;al242"/&gt; In some of his late canvasses, Sion makes a comeback to Symbolism, but gives it a "[[Rococo]]" twist, for instance by having his wife pose in [[crinoline]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Angelo Mitchievici]], ''Decadență și decadentism în contextul modernității românești și europene'', [[Editura Curtea Veche]], Bucharest, 2011, p.369-370.  {{ISBN|978-606-588-133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ion Theodorescu-Sion's "premature death" was, according to critic I. Zărnescu, a moment of crisis for Romanian art: "[it] leaves an emptiness in our art, just when he, the man of support and encouragement, was most sorely needed."&lt;ref name="izsalonul2"/&gt; The painter received several tributes from his peers. Novelist [[Camil Petrescu]] makes an oblique—and, [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] points out, chronologically inaccurate—mention of his urban landscapes in the 1933 novel ''[[Patul lui Procust]]''; Alexandrescu believes that it serves to amplify the nostalgic mood in that particular fragment of the book.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; In addition to his self-portraits, Sion's likeness was preserved in a bust, the work of sculptor [[Corneliu Medrea]] (according to Nichifor Crainic, Medrea "wonderfully" captured the painter's proud demeanor and physical beauty).&lt;ref name="nc286"/&gt; Medrea also designed Sion's crypt at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref name="apmnir"/&gt;

Sion's fame declined with the years.&lt;ref name="sapitorescii"/&gt; His cultural legacy was in part preserved by his ''Gândirea'' colleagues, including those who later moved into [[far right]] politics. After [[World War II]] and the establishment of [[Communist Romania|Romania's communist regime]], some of the latter were arrested, while others fled abroad. One of the latter was political journalist [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], who even took some of Sion's paintings with him when he relocated to [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref name="nsepistol"/&gt; In 1972, ''Gândirea''{{'}}s pro-[[Fascism|fascist]] editor Crainic had been released from jail and, once [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]], was writing chronicles in ''[[Glasul Patriei]]'', a communist magazine for the [[Romanian diaspora]]. His article on Theodorescu-Sion was read and admired by Șeicaru, who wrote back to thank his former employer.&lt;ref name="nsepistol"/&gt;

The [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] (MNAR) has a sizable Theodorescu-Sion collection. Much of it has been included in the Modern Romanian Art Gallery, reopened and rearranged by MNAR in 2001. Although long expected by critics,&lt;ref name="ekmam"/&gt; this new collection sparked debates: critic Gheorghe Vida found that Sion's presence, like that of other modern artists, was unjustly overshadowed by the inclusion of lesser, "second-shelf", painters of the interwar age.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe Vida, [http://www.romlit.ro/la_redeschiderea_galeriei_de_art_romneasc_modern "La redeschiderea Galeriei de artă românească modernă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 26/2001&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 donation of the [[Lola Schmierer Roth]] collection also supplemented MNAR's Theodorescu-Sion fund with works he had set aside for his former pupil.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Elena Olariu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Donatii-si-donatori-la-Muzeul-National-de-Arta-al-Romaniei*articleID_14625-articles_details.html "Donații și donatori la Muzeul Național de Artă al României"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 302-303, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other sizable Sion collections are held by the art museums of [[Constanța]]&lt;ref name="tlgfcompoz"/&gt; and [[Tulcea]],&lt;ref&gt;Marian Mocanu, [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_the-tulcea-art-museum-art-pantheon-for-the-romanian-artists.html "The Tulcea Art Museum - Art Pantheon for the Romanian Artists"], in [http://www.plural-magazine.com/ ''Plural Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}, Nr. 31/2008&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Zambaccian Museum]] in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Simina Stan, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/farmecul-discret-al-muzeului-zambaccian-ii-print-319212.htm "Farmecul discret al muzeului Zambaccian (II)"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Still emergent after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the Romanian art market was ambivalent in its treatment of Theodorescu-Sion's work. Writing in 2009, art critic [[Pavel Șușară]] denounced "an unacceptable disagreement" between Sion's status as a "first-class artist" and the low starting prices of his canvasses, as opposed to the "exorbitant sums" fetched by painters such as [[Sabin Bălașa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Șușară]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ntre_vocaia_cultural_i_provocrile_pieei "Între vocația culturală și provocările pieței"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2009&lt;/ref&gt; That year, his ''Cele trei vârste'' ("The Three Ages") was sold for 32,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2009-11-04/Un+Tonitza+tranzactionat+pentru+370.000+lei,+la+Casa+Alis "Un Tonitza tranzacționat pentru 370.000 lei, la Casa Alis"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in Theodorescu-Sion's work appears to have renewed itself by 2010, when the auctioned Sions fetched prices of the highest range.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2010-06-09/Ion+Theodorescu+Sion,+in+topul+vanzarilor "Ion Theodorescu Sion, în topul vânzărilor"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', June 9, 2010; [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2010-07-28/Un+Theodorescu+Sion,+la+65.000+lei "Un Theodorescu Sion, la 65.000 lei"], in ''Curierul Național'', July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The avant-garde's polemic with Sion's neo-traditionalism continues posthumously. In 2009, Erwin Kessler organized a collective show with the theme "Pork". Kessler explained that the pig, the staple food of modern Romania's [[consumerism]], stood to replace the sheep as the "[[totem]]" of Theodorescu-Sion and Nicolae Grigorescu.&lt;ref name="ekpigway"&gt;[[Erwin Kessler]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_the-pig-way.html "The Pig Way"], in [http://www.plural-magazine.com/ ''Plural Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321152817/http://www.plural-magazine.com/ |date=2012-03-21 }}, Nr. 33/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mpdecembr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Decembrie-luna-a-expozitiilor-de-grup*articleID_22956-articles_details.html "Decembrie – lună a expozițiilor de grup"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 505, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The tongue-in-cheek exhibit featured [[conceptual art]]works by [[Matei Bejenaru]], [[Dumitru Gorzo]], [[Ion Grigorescu]], [[Dan Perjovschi]] and various others.&lt;ref name="ekpigway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mpdecembr"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87488">'''Italian Renaissance painting''' is the painting of the period beginning in the late 13th century and flourishing from the early 15th to late 16th centuries, occurring in the Italian peninsula, which was at that time divided into many political states, some independent but others controlled by external powers. The painters of Renaissance Italy, although often attached to particular courts and with loyalties to particular towns, nonetheless wandered the length and breadth of Italy, often occupying a diplomatic status and disseminating artistic and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Antonello da Messina who travelled from Sicily to Venice via Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Florence]] in [[Tuscany]] is renowned as the birthplace of the [[Renaissance]], and in particular of Renaissance painting, although later in the era Rome and Venice assumed increasing importance in painting. A detailed background is given in the companion articles Renaissance and [[Renaissance architecture]].

Italian Renaissance painting is most often be divided into four periods: the Proto-Renaissance (1300–1425), the Early Renaissance (1425–1495), the [[High Renaissance]] (1495–1520), and [[Mannerism]] (1520–1600). The dates for these periods represent the overall trend in Italian painting and do not cover all painters as the lives of individual artists and their personal styles overlapped these periods.  

The Proto-Renaissance begins with the professional life of the painter [[Giotto]] and includes [[Taddeo Gaddi]], [[Orcagna]] and [[Altichiero]].
The Early Renaissance style was started by [[Masaccio]] and then further developed by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Verrocchio]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].  The High Renaissance period was that of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Coreggio]], [[Giorgione]], the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]].  The Mannerist period, dealt with in a separate article, included the latter works of [[Michelangelo]], as well as [[Pontormo]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bronzino]] and [[Tintoretto]].

The influences upon the development of Renaissance painting in Italy are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government and other aspects of society. The following is a summary of points dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.

===Philosophy===
A number of Classical texts, that had been lost to Western European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts and Early Christian Theology.  The resulting interest in [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church. A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Paolo Uccello]].

===Science and technology===
Simultaneous with gaining access to the Classical texts, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]] and Islamic scholars.
The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public. The development of [[oil paint]] and its introduction to Italy had lasting effects on the art of painting.

===Society===
The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]]. [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy. The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Giotto]], [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], formed an ethos that supported and encouraged many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential inlaw [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Much painting of the Renaissance period was commissioned by or for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. These works were often of large scale and were frequently cycles painted in [[fresco]] of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' or the life of a saint, particularly [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. There were also many [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings on the theme of [[Salvation]] and the role of the Church in attaining it. Churches also commissioned [[altarpiece]]s, which were painted in [[tempera]] on [[panel painting|panel]] and later in [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]]. Apart from large altarpieces, small devotional pictures were produced in very large numbers, both for churches and for private individuals, the most common theme being the ''Madonna and Child''.

Throughout the period, civic commissions were also important. Local government buildings were decorated with frescoes and other works both secular, such as [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''[[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government]]'', and religious, such as [[Simone Martini]]'s fresco of the ''[[Maestà (Simone Martini)|Maestà]]'', in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], [[Siena]].

Portraiture was uncommon in the 14th and early 15th centuries, mostly limited to civic commemorative pictures such as the equestrian portraits of Guidoriccio da Fogliano by [[Simone Martini]], 1327, in Siena and, of the early 15th century, [[John Hawkwood]] by [[Uccello]] in [[Florence Cathedral]] and its companion portraying [[Niccolò da Tolentino]] by [[Andrea del Castagno]].

During the 15th century portraiture became common, initially often formalised profile portraits but increasingly three-quarter face, bust-length portraits. Patrons of art works such as altarpieces and fresco cycles often were included in the scenes, a notable example being the inclusion of the Sassetti and [[Medici]] families in [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]'s cycle in the [[Sassetti Chapel]]. Portraiture was to become a major subject for High Renaissance painters such as [[Raphael]] and [[Titian]] and continue into the Mannerist period in works of artists such as [[Bronzino]].

With the growth of [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanism]], artists turned to Classical themes, particularly to fulfill commissions for the decoration of the homes of wealthy patrons, the best known being [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]] ''for the Medici. Increasingly, Classical themes were also seen as providing suitable allegorical material for civic commissions. Humanism also influenced the manner in which religious themes were depicted, notably on [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]]''.

Other motifs were drawn from contemporary life, sometimes with allegorical meaning, some sometimes purely decorative. Incidents important to a particular family might be recorded like those in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]'' that [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] painted for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] family at [[Mantua]]. Increasingly, still lifes and decorative scenes from life were painted, such as ''the Concert'' by [[Lorenzo Costa]] of about 1490.

Important events were often recorded or commemorated in paintings such as Uccello's ''[[Battle of San Romano]]'', as were important local religious festivals. History and historic characters were often depicted in a way that reflected on current events or on the lives of current people. Portraits were often painted of contemporaries in the guise of characters from history or literature.  The writings of [[Dante]], Voragine's ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and [[Boccaccio]]'s Decameron were important sources of themes.

In all these subjects, increasingly, and in the works of almost all painters, certain underlying painterly practices were being developed: the observation of nature, the study of anatomy, of light, and perspective.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Christiansen, ''Italian Painting'', (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The colours are rich and luminous, the figures are elongated and stylised.]]

===Traditions of 13th-century Tuscan painting===
The art of the region of Tuscany in the late 13th century was dominated by two masters of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] style, [[Cimabue]] of [[Florence]] and [[Duccio]] of [[Siena]]. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, [[Guido of Siena]], [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]] and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have been based, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting.&lt;ref&gt;John White, ''Duccio'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; In these [[tempera]] paintings many of the details were rigidly fixed by the subject matter, the precise position of the hands of the Madonna and Christ Child, for example, being dictated by the nature of the blessing that the painting invoked upon the viewer. The angle of the Virgin's head and shoulders, the folds in her veil, and the lines with which her features were defined had all been repeated in countless such paintings. Cimabue and Duccio took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, [[Pietro Cavallini]] of Rome.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===Giotto===
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -36- - Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Giotto]]: ''The Lamentation'', c. 1305, [[Scrovegni Chapel]], foreshadows the Renaissance.|alt= Square fresco.

Joseph of Arimethea holds the shroud. In Heaven, small angels are shrieking and tearing their hair.]]
[[Giotto]], (1266–1337), by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time.&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', (1568)&lt;/ref&gt; Giotto, possibly influenced by [[Pietro Cavallini]] and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of [[fresco]]es of ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of the Virgin'' that he painted in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] set a new standard for narrative pictures. His ''Ognissanti Madonna'' hangs in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's ''Santa Trinita Madonna'' and Duccio's ''Ruccellai Madonna'' where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made.&lt;ref&gt;All three are reproduced and compared at [[Italian Renaissance painting, development of themes]]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=Eimerl&gt;Sarel Eimerl, The World of Giotto, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taddeo Gaddi Shepherds.jpg|thumb|left|Taddeo Gaddi: ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' (detail), Santa Croce|alt= Fresco painted in grey, yellow and black. A blaze of yellow light comes from the upper right from an angel not visible in this detail. A startled shepherd lying on the ground is twisting around to see the angel. The light from the angel touches the mountainside, figures and sheep.]]

===Giotto's contemporaries===
Giotto had a number of contemporaries who were either trained and influenced by him,  or whose observation of nature had led them in a similar direction. Although several of Giotto's pupils assimilated the direction that his work had taken, none was to become as successful as he. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] achieved the first large painting of a night scene in an ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' in the [[Baroncelli Chapel]] of the Church of Santa Croce, Florence.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

The paintings in the ''Upper Church'' of the [[Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi]], are examples of naturalistic painting of the period, often ascribed to Giotto himself, but more probably the work of artists surrounding [[Pietro Cavallini]].&lt;ref name=Eimerl/&gt; A late painting by [[Cimabue]] in the ''Lower Church'' at Assisi, of the ''Madonna and St. Francis'', also clearly shows greater naturalism than his panel paintings and the remains of his earlier frescoes in the upper church.

===Mortality and redemption===

While horrible demons are clutching at them, the humans are intent on pursuing their evil ways of murder and seduction, seeming ignorant of their precarious state on the edge of a pit.]]
A common theme in the decoration of Medieval churches was the ''[[Last Judgement]]'', which in northern European churches frequently occupies a sculptural space above the west door, but in Italian churches such as Giotto's [[Scrovegni Chapel]], is painted on the inner west wall. The [[Black Death]] of 1348 caused its survivors to focus on the need to approach death in a state of penitence and absolution. The inevitability of death, the rewards for the penitent and the penalties of sin were emphasised in a number of frescoes, remarkable for their grim depictions of suffering and their surreal images of the torments of [[Hell]].

These include the ''Triumph of Death'' by Giotto's pupil [[Orcagna]], now in a fragmentary state at the Museum of Santa Croce, and the ''Triumph of Death'' in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] at [[Pisa]] by an unknown painter, perhaps [[Francesco Traini]] or [[Buonamico Buffalmacco]] who worked on the other three of a series of frescoes on the subject of Salvation. It is unknown exactly when these frescoes were begun but it is generally presumed they post-date 1348.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

Two important fresco painters were active in [[Padua]] in the late 14th century, [[Altichiero]] and [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]]. Giusto's masterpiece, the decoration of the [[Padua Cathedral|Cathedral]]'s Baptistery, follows the theme of humanity's Creation, Downfall and Salvation, also having a rare [[Apocalypse]] cycle in the small chancel. While the whole work is exceptional for its breadth, quality and intact state, the treatment of human emotion is conservative by comparison with that of [[Altichiero]]'s ''Crucifixion'' at the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]], also in [[Padua]]. Giusto's work relies on formalised gestures, where Altichiero relates the incidents surrounding Christ's death with great human drama and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Mgr. Giovanni Foffani, ''Frescoes by Giusto de' Menabuoi'', (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florence, at the ''Spanish Chapel'' of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]], Andrea Bonaiuti&lt;!---don't link because it goes to the wrong page.---&gt; was commissioned to emphasise the role of the Church in the redemptive process, and that of the [[Dominican Order]] in particular. His fresco ''Allegory of the Active and Triumphant Church'' is remarkable for its depiction of [[Florence Cathedral]], complete with the dome which was not built until the following century.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

===International Gothic===
During the later 14th century, [[International Gothic]] was the style that dominated Tuscan painting.  It can be seen to an extent in the work of Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which is marked by a formalized sweetness and grace in the figures, and Late Gothic gracefulness in the draperies. The style is fully developed in the works of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]], which have an elegance and a richness of detail, and an idealised quality not compatible with the starker realities of Giotto's paintings.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;

In the early 15th century, bridging the gap between International Gothic and the Renaissance are the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], many of which, being altarpieces in tempera, show the Gothic love of elaboration, gold leaf and brilliant colour. It is in his frescoes at his [[convent]] of Sant' Marco that Fra Angelico shows himself the artistic disciple of [[Giotto]]. These devotional paintings, which adorn the cells and corridors inhabited by the friars, represent episodes from the life of [[Jesus]], many of them being scenes of ''[[the Crucifixion]]''. They are starkly simple, restrained in colour and intense in mood as the artist sought to make spiritual revelations a visual reality.&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florence===
The earliest truly Renaissance images in Florence date from 1401, although they are not paintings. That year a competition was held amongst seven young artists to select the artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistry of St. John]], the oldest remaining church in the city.  The competitors were each to design a bronze panel of similar shape and size, representing ''the Sacrifice of Isaac''.

Two of the panels from the competition have survived, those by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Each panel shows some strongly classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. The figure kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also a reference to the art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it is more about human drama and impending tragedy.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M&gt;R.E. Wolf and R. Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghiberti won the competition. His first set of [[Baptistry doors]] took 27 years to complete, after which he was commissioned to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground for many of the artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of [[linear perspective]], the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art.

===Masaccio - Brancacci Chapel===
{{main|Brancacci Chapel}}

The first Early Rennaissance frescos or paintings were in started in 1425 when two artists commenced painting a fresco cycle of ''the Life of St. Peter'' in the chapel of the Brancacci family, at the Carmelite Church in Florence. They both were called by the name of Tommaso and were nicknamed [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]], Slovenly Tom and Little Tom.

More than any other artist, Masaccio recognized the implications in the work of Giotto. He carried forward the practice of painting from nature. His frescos demonstrate an understanding of anatomy, of foreshortening, of linear perspective, of light, and the study of drapery. In the [[Brancacci Chapel]], his ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|Tribute Money]]'' fresco has a single vanishing point and uses a strong contrast between light and dark to convey a three-dimensional quality to the work.  As well, the figures of ''[[Adam and Eve]] being expelled from Eden'', painted on the side of the arch into the chapel, are renowned for their realistic depiction of the human form and of human emotion. They contrast with the gentle and pretty figures painted by Masolino on the opposite side of ''Adam and Eve receiving the forbidden fruit''. The painting of the Brancacci Chapel was left incomplete when Masaccio died at 26 in 1428. The ''Tribute Money'' was completed by Masolino while the remainder of the work in the Chapel was finished by [[Filippino Lippi]] in the 1480s. Masaccio's work became a source of inspiration to many later painters, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name=OC&gt;Ornella Casazza, ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel'', (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of linear perspective===
[[File:Paolo Uccello 043.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|Paolo Uccello: ''The Presentation of the Virgin'' shows his experiments with perspective and light.|alt=Fresco. A scene in muted colours showing the porch of a temple, with a steep flight of steps. The Virgin Mary, as a small child and encouraged by her parents, is walking up the steps towards the High Priest.]]
During the first half of the 15th century, the achieving of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of [[linear perspective]] was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside [[Florence Cathedral]] and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous [[trompe l'oeil]] niche around the ''Holy Trinity'' he painted at [[Santa Maria Novella]].&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

According to Vasari, [[Paolo Uccello]] was so obsessed with perspective that he thought of little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three [[Battle of San Romano]] paintings (completed by 1450s) which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective.

In the 1450s [[Piero della Francesca]], in paintings such as ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]'', demonstrated his mastery over linear perspective and also over the science of light. Another painting exists, a cityscape, by an unknown artist, perhaps Piero della Francesca, that demonstrates the sort of experiment that Brunelleschi had been making. From this time linear perspective was understood and regularly employed, such as  by [[Perugino]] in his ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]'' (1481-82) in the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

The ruler sits to the left on a throne. The building is Ancient Roman in style. To the right, two richly dressed men and a barefooted youth stand in a courtyard, much closer to the viewer, so appearing larger.]]

===Understanding of light===
[[Giotto]] used tonality to create form. [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in his nocturnal scene in the Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light could be used to create drama. [[Paolo Uccello]], a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes. He did a number of these in ''terra verde'' or "green earth", enlivening his compositions with touches of vermilion. The best known is his equestrian portrait of [[John Hawkwood]] on the wall of [[Florence Cathedral]]. Both here and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Annarita Paolieri, ''Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, Andrea del Castagno'', (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piero della Francesca]] carried his study of light further. In the ''Flagellation'' he demonstrates a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Murray and Pier Luigi Vecchi, Piero della Francesca, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], revered by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] worldwide, was particularly evoked in Florence, where there was a miraculous image of her on a column in the corn market and where both the Cathedral of "Our Lady of the Flowers" and the large Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] were named in her honour.

The miraculous image in the corn market was destroyed by fire, but replaced with a new image in the 1330s by [[Bernardo Daddi]], set in an elaborately designed and lavishly wrought canopy by [[Orcagna]]. The open lower storey of the building was enclosed and dedicated as [[Orsanmichele]].

Depictions of the [[Madonna and Child]] were a very popular art form in Florence. They took every shape from small mass-produced terracotta plaques to magnificent altarpieces such as those by [[Cimabue]], [[Giotto]] and [[Masaccio]].

In the 15th and first half of the 16th centuries, one workshop more than any other dominated the production of Madonnas. They were the della Robbia family, and they were not painters but modellers in clay. [[Luca della Robbia]], famous for his ''cantoria gallery'' at the cathedral, was the first sculptor to use glazed terracotta for large sculptures. Many of the durable works of this family have survived. The skill of the della Robbias, particularly [[Andrea della Robbia]], was to give great naturalism to the babies that they modelled as [[Jesus]], and expressions of great piety and sweetness to the Madonna. They were to set a standard to be emulated by other artists of Florence.

Among those who painted devotional Madonnas during the Early Renaissance are [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Verrocchio]] and [[Davide Ghirlandaio]]. The custom was continued by Botticelli who produced a series of Madonnas over a period of twenty years for the [[Medici]]; [[Perugino]], whose Madonnas and saints are known for their sweetness and  [[Leonardo da Vinci]], for whom a number of small attributed Madonnas such as the ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' have survived. Even [[Michelangelo]] who was primarily a sculptor, was persuaded to paint the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'', while for [[Raphael]], they are among his most popular and numerous works.

===Andrea Mantegna in Padua and Mantua===
One of the most influential painters of northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]] of [[Padua]], who had the good fortune to be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor [[Donatello]] was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero [[Erasmo da Narni|Gattemelata]], still visible on its plinth in the square outside the [[Basilica of Sant'Antonio]]. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.

At only 17 years old, Mantegna accepted his first commission, fresco cycles of the ''Lives of Saints James and Christopher'' for the [[Ovetari Chapel]] in the transept of the[[church of the Eremitani]], near the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in Padua. Unfortunately the building was mostly destroyed during World War II, and they are only known from photographs which reveal an already highly developed sense of perspective and a knowledge of antiquity, for which the ancient University of Padua had become well known, early in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;Diana Davies, Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists, (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mantegna's last work in Padua was a monumental  [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno altarpiece]], created for the abbot of the [[Basilica of San Zeno]], [[Verona]] from 1457 to 1459.&lt;ref name=EL/&gt; This polyptych of which the predella panels are particularly notable for the handling of landscape elements, was to influence the further development of Renaissance art in Northern Italy&lt;ref name=EL&gt;Elena Lanzanova, trans. Giorgina Arcuri, ''[http://www.arcadja.com/artmagazine/en/2008/06/23/restoration-of-mantegna’s-san-zeno-altarpiece-in-florence/ Restoration Of Mantegna’S San Zeno Altarpiece In Florence]'', Arcadja, (2008-06-23), (accessed: 2012-07-13)&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000960 metmuseum Madonna and Child with Saints Girolamo dai Libri  (Italian, Verona 1474–1555 Verona), edit: 2000–2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantegna's most famous work is the interior decoration of the [[Camera degli Sposi]] for the [[Gonzaga family]] in [[Mantua]], dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes of the life of the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being about family life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a [[trompe l'oeil]] view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;  Mantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, carried out by a mastery of perspective, both in frescoes and in ''[[sacra conversazione]]'' paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries.

===Antonello da Messina===
In 1442 [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] became [[Kingdom of Naples|ruler of Naples]], bringing with him a collection of [[Flemish painting]]s and setting up a [[Humanism|Humanist Academy]]. [[Antonello da Messina]] seems to have had access to the King's collection, which may have included the works of [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence indicates that Antonello was likely in contact with Van Eyck's most accomplished follower, [[Petrus Christus]], in Milan in early 1456 and likely learned the techniques of oil painting, including painting almost microscopic detail and minute gradations of light, directly from Christus.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, his works' calmer expressions on peoples' faces and calmness in the works' overall composition also appears to be a Netherlandish influence.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361)&lt;/ref&gt; Antonello went to [[Venice]] in 1475 and remained there until the fall of 1476 so it is likely that Antonello passed on the techniques of using oil paints,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; painting the gradation of light, and the principles of calmness to Venetian Painters, including Giovanni Bellini, one of the most significant painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy, during that visit.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 563; Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Antonello painted mostly small meticulous portraits in glowing colours. But one of his most famous works, ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Antonello da Messina)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'', demonstrates his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. The composition of the small painting is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited [[Piero della Francesca]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

==Progression Towards the High Renaissance==

===Patronage and Humanism===

In Florence, in the later 15th century, most works of art, even those that were done as decoration for churches, were generally commissioned and paid for by private patrons. Much of the patronage came from the Medici family, or those who were closely associated with or related to them, such as the Sassetti, the Ruccellai and the Tornabuoni.

In the 1460s Cosimo de' Medici the Elder had established [[Marsilio Ficino]] as his resident [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosopher, and facilitated his translation of [[Plato]] and his teaching of [[Platonic philosophy]], which focused on humanity as the centre of the natural universe, on each person's personal relationship with God, and on fraternal or "platonic" love as being the closest that a person could get to emulating or understanding the love of God.&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;Hugh Ross Williamson, ''Lorenzo the Magnificent'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Medieval]] period, everything related to the Classical period was perceived as associated with paganism. In the Renaissance it came increasingly to be associated with enlightenment. The figures of [[Classical mythology]] began to take on a new symbolic role in Christian art and in particular, the Goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] took on a new discretion. Born fully formed, by a sort of miracle, she was the new [[Eve]], symbol of innocent love, or even, by extension, a symbol of the [[Virgin Mary]] herself. We see Venus in both these roles in the two famous tempera paintings that Botticelli did in the 1480s for Cosimo's nephew, Pierfrancesco Medici, the ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' and the ''[[Birth of Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Baldini, ''Primavera'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], a meticulous and accurate draughtsman and one of the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the [[Sassetti Chapel]] at Santa Trinita and the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. In these cycles of the ''Life of St Francis'' and the ''Life of the Virgin Mary'' and ''Life of John the Baptist'' there was room for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, [[Agnolo Poliziano]]. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

===Flemish influence===
From about 1450, with the arrival in Italy of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Flemish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and possibly earlier, artists were introduced to the medium of [[oil paint]]. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists.

In 1483 the huge altarpiece of ''[[Portinari Altarpiece|the Adoration of the Shepherds]]'' painted by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence. Painted as early as 1475 at the behest of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and installed in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a [[still life]] of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.&lt;ref name=W&amp;M/&gt;

===Papal commission===

To the right and left stand the other disciples and some onlookers, who are distinguished by Renaissance clothing. There are many more small figures in the square behind them.]]In 1477 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] replaced the derelict old chapel at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] in which many of the papal services were held. The interior of the new chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, appears to have been planned from the start to have a series of 16 large frescoes between its pilasters on the middle level, with a series of painted portraits of popes above them.

In 1480, a group of artists from Florence was commissioned with the work: Botticelli, [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. This fresco cycle was to depict ''Stories of the Life of Moses'' on one side of the chapel, and ''Stories of the Life of Christ'' on the other with the frescoes complementing each other in theme. ''The Nativity of Jesus'' and the ''Finding of Moses'' were adjacent on the wall behind the altar, with an [[altarpiece]] of the ''Assumption of the Virgin''  between them. These  paintings, all by Perugino, were later  destroyed to paint Michelangelo's ''Last Judgement''.[[File:Ghirlandaio,_Domenico_-_Calling_of_the_Apostles_-_1481.jpg|thumb|380px|Domenico Ghirlandaio and workshop:''[[Vocation of the Apostles]]'', [[Sistine Chapel]]|alt=Rectangular fresco]]
The remaining 12 pictures indicate the virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. 
The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included a great number of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged [[Pharaoh]]s and the devil himself. Each painting required a [[landscape]]. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in [[Botticelli]]'s scene of ''The Purification of the Leper'', there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case ''[[The Temptation of Christ (Sistine Chapel)|The Temptations of Christ]]''.

[[Perugino]]'s scene of ''[[Christ Giving the Keys to Peter (Perugino)|Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter]]''  is remarkable for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, the beauty of the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two [[triumphal arch]]es, and centrally placed an octagonal building that might be a Christian [[baptistry]] or a Roman [[Mausoleum]].&lt;ref name=Giaco&gt;{{cite book|first=Massimo|last= Giacometti|title=The Sistine Chapel|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Renaissance painting==

The High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Early Renaissance" and "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to a dynamic whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, pg. 659 and 662&lt;/ref&gt; Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 145 &lt;/ref&gt; and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour.&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; David Piper, ''The Illustrated History of Art'', Crescent Books, New York, 1991, pg. 129; Jacob Burchhardt, '' Cinerone'' 1841; Franz Kugler ''Handbook of Art History'' 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael,&lt;ref&gt;Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129; Wurdram pg. 147; Johann Joachim Winklemann, ''Lives of Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects'' 1672.&lt;/ref&gt; although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525&lt;ref&gt;Kugler; Honour and Flemming, pg. 466&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the army of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Lanzi.&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cite Leonardo da Vinci's the [[Last Supper|''Last Supper'']], started in 1495 and completed in 1498, as being the first work of the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 662; Frommel pg.172; Hartt pg. 627; Piper pg. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture and Architecture'', 1985, Frederick Hartt states that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.  The High Renaissance was dominated by three painters - Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael; while Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and Titian were the leaders of Venetian High Renaissance painting, with Correggio and Andrea de Sarto being other significant painters of the High Renaissance style.

===Leonardo da Vinci===
[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] (1452-1519) spent his formative years training in the [[Florence]] workshop of [[Verrocchio]] before moving Milan where he worked from 1482-1499 before spending 1500-1506 back in Florence.  Because of the scope of his interests and the extraordinary degree of talent that he demonstrated in so many diverse areas, he is regarded as the archetypal "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]". But it was first and foremost as a painter that he was admired in his own time, and as a painter, he drew on the knowledge he gained from his other interests.
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Leonardo da Vinci: ''[[The Last Supper (da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco, in very damaged condition, of the Last Supper. The scene shows a table across a room which has three windows at the rear. At the centre, Jesus sits, stretching out his hands, the left palm up and the right down. Around the table, are the disciples, twelve men of different ages. They are all reacting in surprise or dismay at what Jesus has just said. The different emotional reactions and gestures are portrayed with great naturalism.]]
Leonardo was a scientific observer. He learned by looking at things. He studied and drew the flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, the form of the rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed [[cadaver]]s from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews.

Leonardo achieved a degree of realism in the expression of human emotion, prefigured by Giotto but unknown since Masaccio's ''Adam and Eve''. Leonardo's ''Last Supper'', painted from 1495-1498 in the refectory of a monastery in Milan, became the benchmark for religious narrative painting for the next half millennium.  Many other Renaissance artists painted versions of ''the Last Supper'', but only Leonardo's was destined to be reproduced countless times in wood, alabaster, plaster, lithograph, tapestry, crochet and table-carpets.

More than any other artist, he advanced the study and painting of "atmosphere". In his paintings such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (c.1503-1517) and ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' (1483-1486) (the earliest complete work fully of his hand), he used light and shade with such subtlety that, for want of a better word, it became known as Leonardo's "sfumato" or "smoke".  He exhibited a revolutionary use of colour by defining the transition between figures by colour modulation instead of by actual lines.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His work invited the viewer into a mysterious world of shifting shadows, chaotic mountains and whirling torrents.  Another significant work of Leonardo's was ''[[The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c.1503-1519); the monumental three-dimensional quality of the group and the calculated effects of dynamism and tension in the composition made it a model that inspired Classicists and the Mannerists in equal measure.&lt;ref&gt;"Leonardo da Vinci" in ''Encyclopedia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the direct impact of the works themselves, Leonardo's studies of light, anatomy, landscape, and human expression were disseminated in part through his generosity to a retinue of students.&lt;ref&gt; name=Vasari/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Michelangelo: ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''|alt= Rectangular fresco. God is in the act of creating the first man, who lies languidly on the ground, propped on one elbow, and reaching towards God. God, shown as a dynamic elderly man, is reaching his hand from Heaven to touch Adam and fill him with life.]]
In 1508 [[Pope Julius II]] succeeded in getting the Florentine sculptor [[Michelangelo]] (1475-1564) to agree to continue the decorative scheme of the Sistine Chapel. The [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] was constructed in such a way that there were twelve sloping pendentives supporting the vault that formed ideal surfaces on which to paint the [[Twelve Apostles]]. Michelangelo soon devised an entirely different scheme, far more complex both in design and in iconography. The scale of the work, which he executed single handed except for manual assistance, was titanic and took nearly five years to complete.

The Pope's plan for the Apostles would thematically have formed a pictorial link between the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]] narratives on the walls, and the popes in the gallery of portraits.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt; It is the [[twelve apostles]], and their leader Peter as first Bishop of Rome, that make that bridge. But Michelangelo's scheme  went the opposite direction. The theme of Michelangelo's ceiling is not God's grand plan for humanity's salvation. The theme is about humanity's disgrace. It is about why humanity and the faith needed Jesus.&lt;ref name=TLT&gt;T.L.Taylor, ''The Vision of Michelangelo'', Sydney University, (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

Superficially, the ceiling is a [[Humanism|Humanist]] construction. The figures are of superhuman dimension and, in the case of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], of such beauty that according to the biographer [[Vasari]], it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of [[platonic love]]. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.&lt;ref name=TLT/&gt;

Vasari praised Michelangelo's seemingly infinite powers of invention in creating postures for the figures. [[Raphael]], who was given a preview by [[Bramante]] after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino and the other in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], his portrait of Michelangelo himself in ''[[The School of Athens]]''.&lt;ref name=Giaco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Bartz and Eberhard König, ''Michelangelo'', (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldschieder, ''Michelangelo'', (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelangelo's later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541, shows a Mannerist style, with generally elongated bodies, which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

===Raphael===
With [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]]'s (1483-1520) name is synonymous with the High Renaissance, although he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30 and died at the age of 37 just one year after Leonardo. It cannot be said that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work was the culmination of all the developments of the High Renaissance.

A gloomy figure in the foreground sits leaning on a block of marble.|Raphael: ''The [[School of Athens]]'', commissioned by [[Pope Julius II]] to decorate a suite now known as the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the Vatican]]
Raphael was born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the [[Umbria]]n workshop of [[Perugino]], an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the ''Betrothal of the Virgin'', which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's ''Christ giving the Keys to Peter''.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt; 

Raphael, who moved to Florence in 1504 and to Rome in 1508, unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and luminous colours of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo, and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which ''the [[School of Athens]]'' (1509-11) in the Stanza della Segnaturais is uniquely significant.

This fresco depicts a meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, gathered in a grand classical setting around the central figure of [[Plato]], whom Raphael has famously modelled upon [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The brooding figure of [[Heraclitus]] who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]], and is a reference to the latter's painting of the Prophet [[Jeremiah]] in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources identify this figure as [[Il Sodoma]], but it is an older, grey-haired man, while Sodoma was in his 30s. Moreover, it strongly resembles several self-portraits of Perugino, who would have been about 60 at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

But the main source of Raphael's popularity was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted, in slightly different poses, a similar plump, calm-faced blonde woman and her chubby babies the most famous probably being ''La Belle Jardinière'' ("The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden"), now in the [[Louvre]]. His larger work, the ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'', used as a design for countless [[stained glass]] windows, has come, in the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.&lt;ref&gt;David Thompson, ''Raphael, the Life and Legacy'', (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Cuzin, ''Raphael, his Life and Works'', (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giovanni Bellini=== 
[[File:Giovanni bellini, madonna di brera, 1510, 01 adjusted.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Giovanni Bellini: ''[[Madonna and Child (Bellini, Milan, 1510)|The Brera Madonna]]'']]
[[File:Pala di San Zaccaria (Venezia).jpg|thumb|upright=1.40|[[Giovanni Bellini]], ''The [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]''|alt= Oil painting. A large altarpiece in which the Madonna sits on a raised throne, with four saints and an angel as described in the article.]] A leader of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian School]] of painting, [[Giovanni Bellini]] (1430-1516) was born within a year of his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]], his brother-in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Antonello da Messina]], but lived a decade longer than the first two and almost three decades longer than the latter.  He was painting right up until his death and his works illustrate several influences. His early works show the influence of Mantegna with incisive lines and clearly delineated colours&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 120; Ruanch pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; while after Messina's stay in Venice in 1475-1476 his works adopted a Flemish-like realism and luminous colours, which shows he was highly successful at adopting the techniques of oil painting brought by Messina.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 655; Wundram pg. 120; Hartt pg. 563&lt;/ref&gt; He was first the teacher of [[Giorgione]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but was later influenced by Giorgione, most notably in adopting tonalism wherein paint is applied in superimposed layers creating a soft diffused effect so figures and landscapes become more unified in atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi ''One Thousand Years of Painting'', Electa, Milan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bellini became the only great 15th-century painter to cross the threshold from the Early Renaissance to the High Renaissance style with works such as ''[[Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan]]'' (1501),&lt;ref&gt; Wundrum Pag. 147 and Pg.121; Hartt, Pg. 645&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Doge shows a calmness Bellini likely learned from Messina,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 361&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Baptism of Christ (Bellini)|Baptism of Christ]]'' (1500–1502). Bellini, like [[Raphael]], also produced numerous small Madonnas in rich glowing colour, usually of more intense tonality than his Florentine counterpart. 

Traditionally, in the painting of altarpieces of the ''Madonna and Child'', the enthroned figure of the Virgin is accompanied by saints, who stand in defined spaces, separated physically in the form of a polytych or defined by painted architectural boundaries. [[Piero della Francesca]] used the Classical niche as a setting for his enthroned Madonnas (with saints grouped around the throne), as [[Masaccio]] had used it as the setting for his ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. 

Bellini used this same form, known as ''Sacred Conversations'', in several of his later altarpieces [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece|such as that]] for the Venetian church of [[San Zaccaria]] (1505). It is a masterful composition which uses tonalism and extends the real architecture of the building into the illusionistic architecture of the painting, making the niche a sort of [[loggia]] opened up to the landscape and to daylight which streams across the figures of the Virgin and Child, the two female saints and the little angel who plays a [[viola]] making them brighter than [[Saint Peter|Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Jerome|Saint Jerome]] in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|title=Giovanni Bellini|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giorgione===
[[File:Giorgione tempest.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Giorgione: [[The Tempest|''The Tempest'']]|alt= Oil painting. A mysterious landscape with Classical ruins. A man stands to the left, and to the right a nude woman feeds a baby]]
 
Despite the brevity of his career (he died in 1510 at about 35)&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt; and the low number of works universally agreed to be totally by his hand (as low as 4 or 5),&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione is often credited as being the founder of the Venetian High Renaissance style,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 645; Raunch pg. 388; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; although different scholars cite different reasons for asserting this. 

One is his increasing use of gradations of colour and light (colour modulation), including sfumato, often achieved by tonalism,&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt; to define the shapes of figures and landscapes and to create an atmosphere wherein all components of the painting are unified.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 165; Raunch pg.646; Hartt pg. 646&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believe he may have been taught this by Leonardo da Vinci who is said to have visited Venice in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Wundram pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', 1505, the use of line and colour modulation are equally balanced but in ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', c.1510, colour modulation almost entirely replaces line creating an artistic vision in which humankind and nature are combined.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 145 and pg. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the ''Tempest'' one of the most important paintings produced in Italy as the components are held together by colour and there is a dreamy atmosphere of perfect harmony.&lt;ref&gt; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Giorgione was the first painter to assign a leading role to nature&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103; Stokstad pg. 682; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt; and whenever his paintings feature a landscape it becomes an integral part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388; Hartt pg. 647; Stokstad pg. 682&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'', when compared to Giovanni Bellini's similar The ''[[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]]'', illustrates another innovation of Giorgione - adjusting the directions and positions of the figures, such as the lance held by St. Liberale to the left and the folds in the Madonna's robe being placed in parallel, to more unify the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 648; Luffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Giorgione's paintings are always ambiguous in their meaning and open to different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Tempest (Giorgione)|The Tempest]]'', the naked woman feeding a baby and the clothed man, and a flash of lightning, perhaps represents [[Adam and Eve]] in their post-Eden days, or perhaps it does not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Another painting attributed to him, ''[[The Three Philosophers]]'', may represent the [[Magi]] planning their journey in search of the infant Christ, or it may not.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102; Raunch pg. 388)&lt;/ref&gt;  None of Giorgione's paintings has ever had a certain interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 388&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until recent years, it had appeared certain that Giorgione painted the very first female nude that stands, or rather, lies, as a subject to be portrayed and admired for beauty alone with the ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'', 1510. While it had been long accepted that Titian finished the landscape of the painting after Giorgione's death, many art scholars are increasingly questioning if Giorgione painted the entire female body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titian===
[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Titian: ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]]''|alt= whose dynamic three-tier composition and colour scheme established him as the preeminent painter north of Rome.]]

[[Titian]] (c. 1490-1576) trained in the workshop of Giovanni Bellini alongside Giorgione and then assisted Giorgione.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392; Stokstad pg. 684; Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Following Giorgione’s death, he was the monarch of the Venetian School for over 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; His early work shows strong influences of Bellini and Giorgione,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684; Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; but he soon he took the principles of form and colour announced by those two&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647&lt;/ref&gt; and established colour, not line, as the major determinant in painting&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 647; Wundram pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; thereby consummating the Venetian High Renaissance style.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 392&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by applying colours of paint paste-like in patches alongside each other with loose and sweeping brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; This brought out the light and colour in equal measure at the same time;&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; he was famous in his own day as the master of light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 684&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strength of Titian was the composition of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;(Wundram  pg. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pesaro Madonna]], 1519-1526, he moves the Madonna from the centre instead placing her at the upper vertex of a powerful diagonal line (as opposed to the usual vertical or horizontal) which still focuses the attention on the Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 393; Stokstad 684&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first works to group figures in an circular, ascending  structure.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]], 1516-1518, also features diagonal lines (shaped by the cherubs located around the Virgin) which carries the triumphant message of the painting upward into the upper levels of the Church of Frari in Venice on whose altar it stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg.649&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the first to have visual suggestion of movement;&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 152&lt;/ref&gt; all of Titian’s works have a new dynamism in the movements of people compared to the static elements of other High Renaissance painters.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 176; Raunch pg. 393&lt;/ref&gt; The Assumption of the Virgin also features, like all of his paintings, glowing, deep, rich colours due to Titian’s applying layer after layer of paint, sometimes of different colours.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 649; Stokstad pg. 685&lt;/ref&gt;  

Titian was also the most sought after portraitist of his time and brought portraiture to the same level of esteem as narrative painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Highly notable are the ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'',1548, an equestrian picture in a symphony of purples, and the portrait of Doge [[Andrea Gritti]], ruler of Venice, perhaps Titian's most powerful portrait.  

As Titian aged, he maintained a generally High Renaissance style until his last years, when figure was almost completed dissolved in the movement of colour,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 650&lt;/ref&gt; so he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of Italian painting which had moved almost completely towards Mannerism by 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, Titian can be considered the founder of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correggio===

[[File:Cathedral (Parma) - Assumption by Correggio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Correggio:  ''[[Assumption of the Virgin]]]]

[[Correggio]] (1489-1534), who never visited Rome, but must have seen the works of the Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, worked in a personal High Renaissance style in Parma in Northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the open heaven filled with floating figures church dome which became a hallmark of the 17th Century Baroque period with his [[Vision of St. John on Patmos|''Vision of St. John the Evangelist'']], 1520-1524, in Parma’s San Giovanni Evangelista, and the [[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|''Assumption of the Virgin'']], 1526-1530, in Parma Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639; Raunch pg. 383; Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  One art scholar states that in the latter, Correggio creates a “dazzling illusion:  the architecture of the dome seems to dissolve and the form seems to explode through the building drawing the viewer up into the swirling vortex of saints and angels who rush upwards to accompany the Virgin in to heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad pg. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  

In those domes and other works, his bold use of perspective, usually by setting a dark colour against light colours to enhance the illusion of depth, is described as astonishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 638; Zuffi pg. 132; Raunch pg.383; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt; His chief interest was painting light and he anticipates the effects to be achieved by Caravaggio at the start of the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; His mastery of foreshortening (causing objects to look shorter because they are angled to the viewer) to create perspective is described as perhaps the most skillful ever.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Hartt pg. 638&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', 1531-1532, Correggio painted a strong contrast between the luminous figure of Io and the soft but dark clouds filling the sky,&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt; which seem to envelop Io’s gleaming body.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio was able to execute the diffuse effect of clouds, haze or mist perfectly&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 383&lt;/ref&gt; and together with colour modulation infuses his characters with a distinct sense of weightlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 174; Janson pg. 516&lt;/ref&gt;  He painted flesh in a delicate, voluptuous manner that has never been surpassed&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 639&lt;/ref&gt; and presents a new concept of feminine beauty only rediscovered during the Rococo period.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Zuffi pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio had many pupils but none carried on his style but he prefigured many components of Baroque painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 383; Janson pg. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Significant High Renaissance Painters===

[[Andrea del Sarto]] (1486-1530), a Florentine, drew upon both Michelangelo and Raphael in his work, but went far beyond them in the portrayal of facial expressions and gestures, as evidenced in ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'',1517.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; His figures show a greater individuality than earlier High Renaissance works while losing none of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s, he remained faithful to the ideals of the High Renaissance, such as in paintings’ compositions&lt;ref&gt;Wundram pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and with the faces of his figures usually being calm and often beautiful, showing none of the torment of his Mannerist contemporaries,&lt;ref&gt;Hartt pg. 635&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom were his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lorenzo Lotto]] (1480-1556), one of the most important High Renaissance painters in Venice,&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 724&lt;/ref&gt; also spent time in other areas of Northern Italy as, perhaps due to his greater focus on realist detail and on line than rather than colour compared to the Venetian school, he was not much appreciated in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 126; Raunch 398&lt;/ref&gt; While he painted a variety of subjects, he was an excellent portrait painter who had a superior ability to see into the soul of his subjects and to portray a depth of feeling in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Raunch 398; Zuffi pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He usually included other objects in the background or foreground of the portrait to portray the subject's character.&lt;ref&gt;Zuffi pg. 127; Raunch pg. 399&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Influence of Italian Renaissance painting==
The lives of both [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]] extended well into the second half of the 16th century. Both saw their styles and those of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Antonello da Messina]] and [[Raphael]]  adapted by later painters to form a disparate style known as [[Mannerism]], and move steadily towards the great outpouring of imagination and painterly virtuosity of the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] period.

The artists who most extended the trends in Titian's large figurative compositions were [[Tintoretto]] and [[Veronese]], although Tintoretto is considered by many to be a Mannerist. [[Rembrandt]]'s knowledge of the works of both Titian and Raphael is apparent in his portraits. The direct influences of Leonardo and Raphael upon their own pupils was to effect generations of artists including [[Poussin]] and schools of Classical painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Antonello da Messina's work had a direct influence on [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Martin Schongauer]] and through the latter's engravings, countless artists including the German, Dutch and English schools of [[stained glass]] makers extending into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=DD/&gt;

Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and later ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' had direct influence on the figurative compositions firstly of Raphael and his pupils and then almost every subsequent 16th-century painter who looked for new and interesting ways to depict the human form. It is possible to trace his style of figurative composition through [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], to [[el Greco]], [[Carracci family|Carracci]], [[Caravaggio]],  [[Rubens]], [[Poussin]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] to both the [[Classical Revival|Classical]] and the [[Romantic art|Romantic]] painters of the 19th century such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]].

Under the influence of the Italian Renaissance painting, many modern academies of art, such as the [[Royal Academy]], were founded, and it was specifically to collect the works of the Italian Renaissance that some of the world's best known art collections, such as the [[National Gallery, London]], were formed.

[[File:Louvre Pyramid.jpg|thumb|The Louvre Pyramid|372x372px]]

The '''Louvre Pyramid''' (Pyramide du Louvre) is a large [[glass]] and metal [[pyramid]] designed by Chinese-American architect [[I.M. Pei]], surrounded by three smaller pyramids, in the main courtyard (Cour Napoléon) of the Louvre Palace ([[Palais du Louvre]]) in [[Paris]]. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre Museum]]. Completed in 1989,&lt;ref name="SimonsNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=5 Pieces of Europe's Past Return to Life: France; A vast new exhibition space as the Louvre renovates |work=The New York Times|date=28 March 1993|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF1F39F93BA15750C0A965958260|accessdate=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become a landmark of the city of [[Paris]].

==Design and construction==
[[File:Louvre Palace.jpg|thumb|Inside the Pyramid: the view of the Louvre Museum in Paris from the underground lobby of the pyramid.]]

Commissioned by the President of [[France]], [[François Mitterrand]], in 1984, it was designed by the architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The structure, which was constructed entirely with [[glass]] segments and metal poles, 
reaches a height of {{convert|21.6|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/94 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020112004520/http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/94/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 January 2002 |title=Architecture: Louvre Pyramid |work=Glass on the Web |date=June 2005 |accessdate=16 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its square base has sides of {{convert|34|m|ft}} and a base surface area of {{convert|1000|m2|ft2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Official Press Release|first1=Louvre|title=“Pyramid” Project Launch: The Musée du Louvre is improving visitor reception (2014-2016)|url=http://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/dp_pyramide%2028102014_en.pdf|website=Louvre|accessdate=16 May 2016|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 603 [[rhombus|rhombus-shaped]] and 70 triangular glass segments.&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"/&gt;
The pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of [[Montreal]] (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and [[RFR Engineers|Rice Francis Ritchie]] of [[Paris]] (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcfandp.com/a/p/8315/s.html |title= Grand Louvre: Phase I |publisher=Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyramid and the underground lobby beneath it were created because of a series of problems with the Louvre's original main entrance, which could no longer handle the enormous number of visitors on an everyday basis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Visitors entering through the pyramid descend into the spacious lobby then ascend into the main Louvre buildings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For design historian [[Mark Pimlott]], "I.M. Pei’s plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network... the architectonic framework evokes, at gigantic scale, an ancient atrium of a [[Pompeii]]an villa; the treatment of the opening above, with its tracery of engineered castings and cables, evokes the atria of corporate office buildings; the busy movement of people from all directions suggests the concourses of rail termini or international airports."&lt;ref name="Pimlott"&gt;{{cite book |last= Pimlott |first= Mark |year= 2007 |url= http://www.artdesigncafe.com/The-Grand-Louvre-I-M-Pei-Pimlott-2007 |chapter= The Grand Louvre &amp; I.M. Pei |type= Excerpt |title= Without and Within: Essays on Territory and the Interior |via= artdesigncafe |publisher= Episode Publishers |location= Rotterdam |access-date= 13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other museums have duplicated this concept, most notably the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]]. The [[Dolphin Centre]], featuring a similar pyramid, was opened in April 1982, by [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Phil |last= Steer |url= http://www.romford.org/sports/swimming/dolphin/dolphin01.htm |title= Dolphin Centre: Brief History |work= Romford Now &amp; Then |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111123140716/http://www.romford.org/sports/swimming/dolphin/dolphin01.htm |archivedate= 23 November 2011 |df= dmy-all }}{{Self-published source|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction work on the pyramid base and underground lobby was carried out by the [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]] construction company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/history-sites.htm?OpenAgent&amp;the_grand_louvre_museum |title= History |publisher= Vinci |date=  |accessdate= 16 January 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111001122424/http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/history-sites.htm?OpenAgent&amp;the_grand_louvre_museum |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1839, according to one newspaper account, in ceremonies commemorating the "glorious revolution" of 1830, "The tombs of the Louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags. In front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape, and surmounted by a funeral vase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=The Paris Sketch Book Of Mr. M. A. Titmarsh|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The construction of the pyramid triggered many years of strong and lively aesthetic and political debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tempest|first1=Rone|title=Controversial New Pyramid Entrance to the Louvre Opens in Paris|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-30/entertainment/ca-1039_1_glass-pyramid|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticisms tended to fall into four areas:  (1) the modernist style of the edifice being inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre;  (2) the pyramid being an unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt;  (3) the project being an immodest, pretentious, megalomaniacal folly imposed by then-President [[François Mitterrand]]; and (4) Chinese-American architect [[I.M. Pei]] being insufficiently French to be entrusted with the task of updating the treasured Parisian landmark.&lt;ref name="IM PEI Pyramid"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Richard|title=I.M. Pei's Pyramid: A Provocative Plan for The Louvre|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/magazine/im-pei-s-pyramid-a-provative-plan-for-the-louvre.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those criticizing the aesthetics said it was "sacrilegious" to tamper with the Louvre's majestic old French Renaissance architecture, and called the pyramid an anachronistic intrusion of an Egyptian death symbol in the middle of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Pei Pyramid and New Louvre Open Today|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/29/arts/pei-pyramid-and-new-louvre-open-today.html?pagewanted=1|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, political critics referred to the structure as ''Pharaoh Francois' Pyramid''.&lt;ref name="IM PEI Pyramid"/&gt;
Many still continue to feel the harsh modernism of the edifice is out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stamberg|first1=Susan|title=Landmark At The Louvre: The Pyramid Turns 20|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121097261|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=16 May 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carbone|first1=Ken|title=Viva Le Louvre! At 20, I.M. Pei's Controversial Pyramid Defies Critics|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1271948/viva-le-louvre-20-im-peis-controversial-pyramid-defies-critics|website=Fast Company|publisher=Mansueto Ventures, LLC|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Souza|first1=Eduardo|title=AD Classics: Le Grande Louvre / I.M.

During the design phase, there was a proposal{{by whom|date=May 2015}} that the design include a spire on the pyramid to simplify window washing. Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated.

==Urban legend of 666 panes==
It has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, "the [[number of the beast]]", often associated with [[Satan]]. Dominique Stezepfandt's book ''François Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers'' declares that "the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the [[Book of Revelation]] (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6."

The story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead).  The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles).&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"/&gt;  A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass.&lt;ref name="secrets"&gt;''Secrets of the Code'', edited by Dan Burstein, p. 259.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.

Elementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a [[triangular number|triangle]], thus giving &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{17\cdot(17+1)}{2}=153&lt;/math&gt; rhombic panes (171 panes total).  The side with the entrance has 11 panes fewer (9 rhombic, 2 triangular), so the whole pyramid consists of &lt;math&gt;4\cdot153-9=603&lt;/math&gt; rhombi and &lt;math&gt;4\cdot18-2=70&lt;/math&gt; triangles, 673 panes total.

The myth resurfaced in 2003, when [[Dan Brown]] incorporated it in his best-selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', in which the protagonist reflects that "this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666 panes of glass&amp;nbsp;— a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number of [[Satan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brown. ''The Da Vinci Code'', p. 21.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, David A. Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: "If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story."&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt;

==''La Pyramide Inversée''==
{{Main|La Pyramide Inversée}}
''La Pyramide Inversée'' (''The Inverted Pyramid'') is a skylight in the [[Carrousel du Louvre]] shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum. It looks like an upside-down and smaller version of the ''Louvre Pyramid''.

==Renovation==
Designed for a museum that attracted 4.5 million visitors a year, the pyramid proved inadequate by the time the Louvre's attendance had doubled in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the layout of the foyer area in the Cour Napoleon beneath the glass pyramid is undergoing a thorough redesign, including better access to the pyramid and the Passage Richelieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Javier |last=Pes |date=28 April 2014 |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvres-director-makes-unblocking-pyramid-bottleneck-a-priority/32552 |title=Louvre's Director Makes Unblocking Pyramid Bottleneck a Priority |work=[[The Art Newspaper]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429215635/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvres-director-makes-unblocking-pyramid-bottleneck-a-priority/32552 |archivedate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monographic series''' (alternatively, '''monographs in series''') are scholarly and scientific books released in successive volumes, each of which is structured like a separate book or [[monograph|scholarly monograph]].
[[File:Loeb Classical Library.jpg|thumb|A volume in the [[Loeb Classical Library]]. Each installment in this monographic series is devoted to a Greek or Latin author, and is accompanied by extensive commentary and notes from the editors.]]

==Semantics==
In general books that are released serially (in successive parts) once a year, or less often, are called [[Book series|series]]. Publications that are released more often than once a year are known as [[periodical]]s. If the volumes can each stand on their own as a separate book, they are called monographs in series, if not they are called '''book sets'''.

==Associations==
The connection among books belonging to such a series can be by discipline, focus, approach, type of work, or geographic location. Examples of such series include "Antwerp Working Papers in Linguistics";&lt;ref&gt;"Antwerp working papers in linguistics" {{OCLC|66592270}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile" (Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger, Copenhagen);&lt;ref&gt;Early English manuscripts in facsimile" {{ISSN|0070-7856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland reference library; "Canterbury Tales Project" &lt;ref&gt;Garland reference library; "Canterbury Tales Project" {{ISSN|1351-3435}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''); [[Early English Text Society]].

The ''[[Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology]]'' (a series of 19th-century editions of theological works by [[Church of England]] writers, devoted to significant [[Anglo-Catholic]] figures,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Middleton, ''Fathers and Anglicans'' (2004), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[John Henry Parker]]) is an example of a common usage in naming monographic series; another example is the [[John Harvard Library (series)|John Harvard Library]] which consists of notable works relating to the United States. The [[Loeb Classical Library]] is a series of editions of Greek and Latin texts in which the original texts are accompanied by translations into English; the series was begun by James Loeb and is published by [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Lee Simmons, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222542/https://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=12377 Little Big Books: the red and green guides to the wisdom of the Ancient World]" in ''The Weekly Standard'' no. 40 (3 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Series intended for general readers may also have "library" in their titles, e.g. [[Everyman's Library]].

==Categorization==
Libraries and indexing services handle them in various ways. The [[Library of Congress]] catalogs each part of them as an individual book with an individual call number and [[ISBN]] and a series note (technically a series added entry for the overall series, which has its [[ISSN]], and usually a call number. As the Library of Congress receives two copies of most scholarly books as [[copyright]] deposits, it normally keeps one by individual call number and one by series call number. Most other libraries do not have that luxury and have to choose. The Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2nd edition allows either of these options to be used.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association, et al. ''Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules''; 2nd ed., edited by Michael Gorman and Paul W. Winkler. London: Library Association, 1976; ch. 2, sect. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medical library|Medical libraries]] almost always keep them together as a series. The biomedical indexing service [[PubMed]] from the [[National Library of Medicine]] treat the individual volumes in such a series as if they were volumes in a journal.

* ''[[Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology]]'' {{ISSN|0065-2598}}

==Themed volumes==
In many cases each volume in such a series itself contains individual chapters or articles written by different authors, usually on the same general theme. The Library of Congress does not list each such article separately, but PubMed does.

A frequent occasion for such a themed volume is a celebration in honor of a person's scholarly work. If done at retirement or on an anniversary (e.g. 60th birthday), it is usually called a [[Festschrift]] or celebration volume. If after death, it is usually called a [[memorial]].

The publisher Variorum Reprints began publishing its Collected Studies series in 1970. Each of these volumes contains "a selection of articles by a leading authority on a particular subject ... reprinted from a vast range of learned journals, [[Festschrifts]], conference proceedings ...". These volumes are published by [[Ashgate Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=1449|title=Variorum Collected Studies|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Musaeum Clausum''''' ([[Latin]] for ''Sealed Museum''), also known as '''''Bibliotheca abscondita''''', is a [[Tract (literature)|tract]] written by Sir [[Thomas Browne]] which was first published posthumously in 1684. The tract contains short sentence descriptions of supposed, rumoured or lost books, pictures, and objects. The subtitle describes the tract as an inventory of ''remarkable books, antiquities, pictures and rarities of several kinds, scarce or never seen by any man now living''. Its date is unknown: however, an event from the year 1673 is cited.

Like his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'', ''Musaeum Clausum'' is a catalogue of doubts and queries, only this time, in a style which anticipates the 20th-century [[Argentina|Argentinian]] short-story writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] who once declared: "To write vast books is a laborious nonsense; much better is to offer a summary as if those books actually existed."

Browne however was not the first author to engage in such fantasy. The French author [[Rabelais]] in his epic ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' also penned a list of imaginary and often obscene book titles in his "Library of Pantagruel," an inventory which Browne himself alludes to in his  ''[[Religio Medici]]''.

As the 17th century [[scientific revolution]] progressed the popularity and growth of antiquarian collections, those claiming to house highly improbable items grew. Browne was an avid collector of antiquities and natural specimens, possessing a supposed [[unicorn]]'s horn, presented to him by [[Arthur Dee]]. Browne's eldest son [[Edward Browne (physician)|Edward]] visited the famous scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]], founder of the ''Museo Kircherano'' at [[Rome]] in 1667, whose exhibits included an engine for attempting [[perpetual motion]] and a [[Brazen head|speaking head]], which Kircher called his ''Oraculum Delphinium''. He wrote to his father of his visit to the [[Jesuit]] priest's "closet of rarities".

Early museums such as Kircher's were private affairs - wooden arks or cabinets where antiquarians kept collections of curious objects. The intellectual collector of such curiosities was the forerunner of today's professional natural historian and scientist. Physicians in particular took an interest in natural history. One of the best known early collectors was [[Hans Sloane]]. Distinguished in medicine and science, Sloane was President of both the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. The books and objects he collected, including those auctioned from the libraries of Thomas Browne and his son Edward in 1711, became the foundation of the [[British Museum]].

The sheer volume of book-titles, pictures and objects listed in ''Musaeum Clausum'' is testimony to Browne's fertile imagination. However, his major editors, [[Simon Wilkins]] in the nineteenth century (1834) and Sir [[Geoffrey Keynes]] in the twentieth (1924) summarily dismissed it. Keynes considered its humour too erudite and "not to everyone's taste."

Browne's miscellaneous tract may also be read as a parody of the rising trend of private museum collections with their curios of doubtful origin, and perhaps also of publications such as the so-called ''[[Musaeum Hermeticum|Museum Hermeticum]]'' (1678), one of the last great anthologies of alchemical literature, with their divulging of near common-place alchemical concepts and symbols.

'''Newgrounds''' (collectively '''Newgrounds.com, Inc.''') is an American online entertainment and [[social media]] website and company. It hosts user-generated content such as gaming, filming, audio and artwork composition in four respective website categories. While [[AOL]] and [[Geocities]] had [[Static hosting|statically hosted]] user-generated content, Newgrounds provided visitor-driven voting and ranking of user-generated animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@SeanBuckelew/newgrounds-64831b97a5a8|title=Newgrounds: Everything by Everyone|last=Buckelew|first=Sean|date=2014-12-27|website=Sean Buckelew|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The site's founder and owner, Thomas "Tom" Fulp, founded the site and company in 1995 and produces in-house content over at the headquarters and offices, based in the [[Glenside, Pennsylvania|Glenside]] neighborhood of [[Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania|Cheltenham Township]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheltenhamtownship.org/businessdirectory/business_dir.htm#N|title=Cheltenham Township Business Directory|date=January 2007|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout &amp; Overview==
===Content &amp; General===
[[User-generated content]] can be uploaded and categorized into either one of the site’s four web portals: ''Games'', ''Movies'', ''Audio'', and ''Art''. A submission entered undergoes the process termed the ''Blam-And-Protect'' system, where it can be critiqued and rated from other users (up to 5 stars) or reviewed by users. Total scores succeeding judgement determine if whether the content will "saved"(added onto the database) or "blammed"(deleted but still saved as per ''Obituaries'' section). 

Art and audio composition is categorized in a relatively different method called "Scouting". Alike the ''Blam-And-Protect'' system, it filters out stolen content, spam, or prohibited material online via users and site moderators (referred as "Mods"). When an individual is scouted, its submitted property becomes virtually visible to everyone else, and then given the privilege to also scout authors.

Submissions are organized in the general "Portal", where it accompanies the genres into a single place to view authored material. It also stores throwback content in earlier years, statuses of judged submissions, and current and past daily winners on display.

Content and context are liable to be reported for review to the Mods and staff members by flagging it for plausible violations to the site's guidelines, if regarded by multiple users. The homepage of Newgrounds includes featured submissions from each category, as well online awards and honors to users whose submission that fall under the site’s requirements to earn it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrojunk.com/community/post/index/45064|title=The History Of Newgrounds {{!}} Retro Junk|website=www.retrojunk.com|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult-oriented content is general in nature of the site, but restricted only to users ages 18 and up though no safeguard is subject to assure this. 

Online competitions and contests are open at some times, where an individual can win and receive prizes presented by either a recognized user or staff member upon following a given theme.

===User communication &amp; Behavior===
The site includes a ''Community'' portal, where users can be able to communicate with others through various [[Internet forum]]s. Such forums can be locked if it is in violation. Another communication system developed on the site, termed "Private Messaging" and abbreviated as PM, is also granted, similar to the service of [[email]] where users can send messages via other users. A live [[chat room]] is also available.

==History==

===1990s - Organization===

In 1991, at the age 13, Tom Fulp launched a [[Neo Geo]] fanzine under the name "New Ground" sending issues to approximately 100 members of a club originating on the internet in [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/about-newgrounds/history#wiki_toc_1|title=1991: The Zine|website=newgrounds.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulp launched a website as ''New Ground Remix'' using a hosting service, increasing popularity in the summer of 1996 after BBS games ''Club a Seal''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gimletmedia.com/episode/episode105-how-we-first-met/|title=#105 At World's End - Reply All by Gimlet Media|website=gimletmedia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Assassin'' were created by Fulp while a student at [[Drexel University]], Pennsylvania. Fulp created the sequels to his creations, as games Club a Seal II and Assassin II," along with the decision to develop a separate hosting site, titled as ''New Ground Atomix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/about-newgrounds/history#wiki_toc_4|title=1997: The Tale of Two Newgrounds|website=newgrounds.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulp began experimenting with Macromedia Flash, along with programming a Flash-compatible homepage that was later introduced to his secondary site, "Telebubby Fun Land", and was later released. Fulp later merged his two websites to form another website with the name ''Newgrounds'', leading to him to change hosts to accommodate the increasing traffic, and started selling merchandise to pay for the website's hosting bills. Introducing banner ads to pay for growing payments in 1999, Fulp partnered with [[Troma Entertainment|Troma]], who hosted the site in exchange for a share of ad revenue. A chat room and message board was added onto the website, which allowed people visiting the website to interact with each other. Many users had begun submitting their own Flash creations to Fulp, in which he decided in a portion of the site called "The Portal." A friend of Fulp named Ross developed the “Grounds Gold System”, which allowed users to gain points for visiting the site and voting submissions online. Ad revenue had increased, so Ross was hired, starting development of an current automated Portal, which would allow users to submit their own generated content to the website.

===2000s - Developments===

After the [[dot-com bubble]] collapsed, Newgrounds struggled in paying its hosting costs. The affiliation with Troma ended in 2003 and Newgrounds switched to another bandwidth provider, which significantly reduced hosting costs. 2004 saw Newgrounds recovering from the online market crash, and the [[Numa Numa Dance]] viral phenomenon made its debut on Newgrounds near the end of the year, and became one of the first viral videos on the internet. Medals, the equivalent of in-game [[achievement (video gaming)|achievements]], were introduced for the first time through the API software in 2009, soon followed by a "Sharing" component that would allow content to be distributed within games, such as custom level designs. The Art Portal in its complete form was launched in June of the same year, along with the renovation of the company’s headquarters.

===2010s - Improvements===

In 2011, the Newgrounds Annual Tournament of Animation (NATA) began as a 4–6 month long animation competition on Newgrounds sponsored by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]. In 2012, Newgrounds published their first mobile game, titled ''GroundCats'', on [[iOS]]. That same year, major changes to the website included the launch of the video player, allowing users to publish movies that were not in .SWF format for the first time, and support for HTML5-coded games, which meant users were no longer limited to submitting movies and games made in Flash. In 2013, the site suffered heavily through financial issues and closed down its online market following the year after. Platform mobile game ''[[Geometry Dash]]'' developed by RobTop Games allowed songs from Newgrounds to be used in levels made with the level editor with the release of its 1.9 update in 2014. The Audio Portal consisted of submitted copyrighted songs for use in the game, leading to [[Nightcore]], along with [[Mashup (music)|mashups]], banned as a result.

An similar issue of copyrighted concurred in 2016, when the site began receiving complaints that old content and files contained unlicensed commercial music and images, resulting in several submissions being removed by moderators and staff. In 2018, new servers and video-encoding-software were unveiled, along with developments for the site to be ad-free, and improve page performance.

'''Pseudo-athlete''' is a concept in Roman portraiture, favored in the late Republican Period, to describe a sculpture that has a combination of a veristic head and an idealized body. [[Verism]] shows the person portrayed without idealizing features, with warts, wrinkles, and other physical defects and deformities. Verism goes beyond a realistic rendering. There was a positive value of age and experience in Rome, so it manipulates the facial expression in an attempt to convey the stern traditional Roman values. One of the potential origins of the veristic style is from Roman funeral masks. The masks were used to give an impersonation of the deceased at the [[Roman Forum]]. Therefore, it was critical that the masks reproduced the appearance of the deceased and portrayed all of their features. The public funerals were to portray the character of the deceased, so artists were encouraged to make the masks as expressive as possible using the traditionally prized Roman values: stern moral seriousness (''[[gravitas]]''), firmness and strictness of judgement (''severitas''), determination and self-possession (''constantia''), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett, C. (2005). The Roman Nude: Heroic Portrait Statuary 200 B.C.-A.D. 300. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While the origin of [[verism]] is highly debated as to whether it was from Italic, Etruscan, Roman, Egyptian, or Greek influence, the purpose for realistic, unidealized rendering was specific. The signs of age were used as indicators of wisdom and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Gisela M. A. Richter. (1955). [http://doi.org/10.2307/298742 The Origin of Verism in Roman Portraits]. The Journal of Roman Studies, 45, 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The body remains idealized due to Greek influence.  In Greek sculpture there is a concept of [[heroic nudity]]. It is used to indicate that a sculpture's apparently mortal human subject is in fact a hero or semi-divine being.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"&gt;Kleiner, F. (2010). Portraiture. In A History of Roman Art (Enhanced ed., pp. 54-56). Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman examples ==

=== Pseudo-Athlete of Delos ===
[[File:1477 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Pseudo-Athlete of Delos, 80 AD ca. - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto,.jpg|thumb|1477 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Pseudo-Athlete of Delos, 80 AD ca. - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto,]]
The Pseudo-athlete of Delos is a life-size nude male portrait that was found in the House of the Diadoumenos on the Greek island of Delos. It belonged to a Roman business man and dates back to 100 BCE. Stylistic traits of Greek sculpture, such as the [[contrapposto]] of the Polykleitan original and the sharp upturn of the head reminiscent of [[Hellenistic sculpture]], were incorporated. In contrast, the bald head, prominent ears, and wrinkled face is reminiscent of the Republican style, as is the combination of the veristic head with the idealized body.  The idealized nude body is symbolic of the concept of [[heroic nudity]] in Greek sculpture.  The realistic head is symbolic of wisdom and experience that comes with age. In Greek portraiture, the head and body show a consistent age. However, in the Roman pseudo-athlete there is a disconnect.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt; The draped cloth carefully placed across the left shoulder is reminiscent of the Roman toga, while the nude body is typical in Greek statues.&lt;ref&gt;Squire, M. (2011). The Art of the Body: Antiquity and its Legacy. London: I.B. Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt; The body is used as a prop for the head. In the Delos pseudo-athlete, nudity is used as a costume or garment since the business man would not have appeared nude in public or in front of his guests.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt; The combination of the Greek style body with a Roman head makes the sculpture from Delos a great example of the Roman pseudo-athlete.

=== Tivoli General ===
[[File:General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01.JPG|thumb|General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01]]
In Tivoli, at the Sanctuary of Hercules, a pseudo-athlete portrait of a general was found.  The marble sculpture with a veristic Roman head and idealized Greek body dates back to 75-50 BCE. To show his rank in the army and hold up the heavy marble statue, there is a [[cuirass]] at his side. His typical Republican stern and wrinkled face is contrasted by a youthful almost nude body that exudes power and is in the tradition of a Hellenistic ruler. Through the reference back to Greek idealized body, the patron expresses cultural superiority. The general exudes modesty by using a draped cloth to cover his genitals.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt;

[[File:Ros 1.jpg|thumb|The Ring of Stones, Uren 1940:opp. p.30]]

The '''Ring of Stones''', also known as the '''Circle of Stones''', is a stone arrangement which may have been constructed by some of the 68 marooned passengers and crew from the Dutch ship the [[Vergulde Draeck]], wrecked about 100 kilometres north of Perth, Western Australia in 1656. The Ring of Stones was reportedly first seen in 1875 by [[Admiralty]] surveyor Alfred Burt, and his companion Harry Ogbourne on the coast of [[Western Australia]]. No official report was made of the discovery at the time, however, and it was not until 1930 that the sighting was reported to the Commissioner of the Western Australia Police by Burt. Burt identified the Ring of Stones as being on the central west coast of Western Australia, between [[Woodada Well]] and the coast, about “half a mile” from the coast.&lt;ref name="Burt1"&gt;Letter and accompanying mud-map from Alfred Burt to Commissioner of Police for Western Australia - 3 November 1930 (WA State Records Office: Police).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burt’s discovery==

Alfred Earl Burt was the son Sir [[Archibald Burt]], first [[Chief Justice of Western Australia]]. Alfred Burt ultimately rose to become Registrar of Titles and Deeds in Western Australia.

On 3 November 1930 Burt wrote to the [http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Aboutus/CommissionerofPolice/tabid/894/Default.aspx Commissioner of the Western Australia Police] to report his discovery of the Ring of Stones in 1875:

{{quotation|I was attached to the Admiralty Marine Survey as Draftsman under Capt. Archdeacon RN in 1875 and was camped at a Well on the old coast road from Geraldton to Perth called ‘Woodada’.

One day I had occasion to visit the coast about nine miles distant in order to take provisions to Capt. Archdeacon who was camped there, and also to receive instructions. I started with Mr Harry Ogbourne and a pack horse. When nearing the ocean we struck a dense thicket and when cutting our way through we found a cleared part of about 14 feet square with thicket all around, and in the centre was a complete circle of stones.&lt;ref name="Burt1" /&gt;}}

Burt indicated on the mud-map accompanying his letter that the Ring of Stones was ‘4 feet’ [1.2 m] in diameter, in a circular clearing ‘14 feet’ [5.2 m] in diameter. He had wanted to return to the site to investigate further, but Captain Archdeacon refused permission. Prior to his death, Ogbourne confirmed that there were no other stones nearby,&lt;ref name="Mirror1"&gt;Hidden treasure on Western Australian coast! What happened to the wealth of ‘The Gilt Dragon’ wreck on our shores in 1665 [sic]. The Mirror, 21 January 1933, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; and so it would appear that the Ring of Stones was not a natural formation but one that was man-made.

Burt had informed of the Commissioner of Police of his discovery of the Ring of Stones because he had just been made aware of a document in [http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/heeres J. E. Heeres] 1899 publication, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0501231h.html The Part Borne by the Dutch in the Discovery of Australia, 1606 – 1765], reporting the loss of the Dutch ship [[Vergulde Draeck]] on the coast of Western Australia on 28 April 1656. His attention had been drawn to this record by journalist Dircksey Cowan, daughter of [[Edith Cowan]]. She had been interviewing Burt in regard to the [http://www.thsoa.org/pdf/tihr_200809.pdf Deadwater Wreck], north of Busselton, which he had also seen in 1876 in company with Captain Archdeacon, while still engaged in the Admiralty survey. The [[Vergulde Draeck]] had been carrying 78,600 guilders, which went down with the ship, not being recovered until after the wreck was located in 1963. Burt, however, believed the Circle of Stones may have marked the location of a ‘Treasure Trove’, the specie from the [[Vergulde Draeck]], and it would seem that this was his reason for informing the Commissioner of Police.

The Commissioner of Police took no immediate action. However, the discovery by two boys, Fred and Alister Edwards, of 40 coins dating from 1618 to 1655, including Spanish reales, in sandhills north of [[Seabird]] early in 1931,&lt;ref name="Anon1"&gt;Anonymous (1931), ‘Police news: Human bones found,’ West Australian, 4 February 1931, p.11; Flowers, G. 2001 Gilt Dragon Terrestrial Investigation: Skeleton and Coin Sites, April 2001 (Innaloo: Maritime Archaeology Association of Western Australia) Annexures: Interview with Fred Edwards pp.2-4; Interview with Alister Edwards pp.1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; triggered a frenzy of speculation, mostly relating to the wreck of the [[Vergulde Draeck]], and its treasure. Consequently, in May 1931 the police instigated a search for the Ring of Stones. The expedition was led by Constable Sam Loxton from [[Dongara]] and included Burt, local landowner Mr A. R. Downes, and another local, a Mr Parker. Between 8 and 11 May the members of the expedition endeavoured to re-locate the Ring of Stones in the area identified by Burt. However, this part of the coast is dominated by dense scrub, mostly wattle, rocky limestone-strewn ground and steep sand ridges.&lt;ref name="Burt1" /&gt; Burt commented that in places the scrub was so impenetrable that “even a bullock could not penetrate it.”&lt;ref name="Burt1" /&gt; The expedition failed. Questions were raised about the accuracy of Burt’s recall.&lt;ref name="Loxton"&gt;Report of Samuel J. Loxton, Constable, relative to Search of Lost Treasure, 4 March 1932 (WA State Records Office: Police).&lt;/ref&gt; But in the end it was decided to make another attempt after firing the area, to make movement and searching easier. And so in late February 1932 another search was undertaken.

The 1932 expedition was again led by Constable Loxton and included Downes, but not Burt. It had been arranged for local Aboriginal people, the [http://www.ausanthrop.net/resources/ausanthrop_db/detail.php?id_search=173 Yuat], to fire the country prior to the commencement of the expedition. Some of the [http://www.ausanthrop.net/resources/ausanthrop_db/detail.php?id_search=173 Yuat] were also recruited to guide the expedition and to burn off parts of the country missed by the earlier fires. For almost a week the party trekked up and down the coast and through the bush, again with no result.&lt;ref name="Loxton" /&gt; Loxton noted that the ‘Sand Drift Hills’ as he called the dunes, “increase in size so quickly I would think it quite possible that the Spot may have been covered up years ago.”&lt;ref name="Loxton" /&gt;

[[File:Ros 2.jpg|thumb|“Treasure Believed To Be Buried Here”, ''The Mirror'', 21 January 1933, p.8]]

==Treasure hunt==

No further action appears to have been taken by the police following the second expedition, but in July 1932 a farmer from [[Three Springs, Western Australia|Three Springs]], Fred King, wrote to Constable Loxton informing him of a line of stones which were “placed in a straight line running east and West for about one mile at spaces about 150 yards apart pointing to a large Sandhill on the Coast and about [http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Aboutus/CommissionerofPolice/tabid/894/Default.aspx Woodada Well] on the East end about 3 miles from the sea.” King noted that, “At present these stones are hidden by thick scrub.”&lt;ref name="Loxton" /&gt; Although King’s letter was mentioned in a report regarding the searches for the [[Vergulde Draeck]]’s treasure in ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' the following year,&lt;ref name="Mirror1" /&gt; nothing eventuated and it was simply placed on file.

In March 1933 Constable Loxton filed another report indicating a Mr Stokes, at that time ill in hospital, claimed he had been with Burt and Ogbourne when they found the Ring of Stones in 1875.&lt;ref name="Loxton" /&gt; There matters rested until a well-known author and bushman J. E. Hammond, a friend of Alfred Burt’s, decided that he would endeavour to find the Ring of Stones. It appears that some time in 1937 Hammond spent a fortnight searching, burning “several hundred acres of scrub” in the process, without success, before concluding that the Ring had been covered by drifting sand.&lt;ref name="Uren"&gt;Uren, M. 1940 Sailormen’s Ghosts: The Abrolhos Islands in Three Hundred Years of Romance, History, and Adventure (Melbourne: Robertson and Mullens)&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation about the treasure from the [[Vergulde Draeck]] then re-intensified in March 1938 when it was reported that more old coins had been found by children from the Baramba Assisted School, in the same locality as the Edwards find.&lt;ref name="wa1"&gt;‘Pieces of eight – treasure trove near Gingin,’ West Australian, 18 March 1938, p.17; Flowers 2001, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears to have been a rehash of the Edwards find in 1931. Then, in December 1938, Jack Hayes and Gabriel Penney located a Ring of Stones, which they took to be Burt’s Ring of Stones. Their find was reported in ''[[The West Australian]]'' on 10 February 1939.&lt;ref name="wa2"&gt;‘Circle of stones. Long search ends.’  West Australian, 10 February 1939, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears Penney, a brumby hunter, had come across a stone arrangement around 1931 but had not investigated further at the time.&lt;ref name="Uren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wa2" /&gt; But then in December 1938 he told Hayes, licensee of the [http://www.dongaramotel.com.au/ Dongara Hotel], about it and the two men set out to relocate the site. They drove in a utility to within ‘about nine miles’ [14.4&amp;nbsp;km] of the Ring and then made their way on foot. They were “considerably hampered by the thorny bush,” but Penney led Hayes to the exact spot. As Hayes described it:

{{quotation|There were three groups of stones in a cleared area ... One was in the form of a ring and the other two were rectangular in shape, situated on each side of the circle. One of the rectangular areas had a base line of about 22 yards in length with sides about three feet long.}}

Photos were taken, unfortunately of poor quality, which show the Ring and part of one the projecting lines of stones.

According to Hayes, the “whole formation was arranged in such a manner as to act as a pointer.”&lt;ref name="wa2" /&gt; The Ring was located “at least two miles from the coast,”&lt;ref name="Uren" /&gt; but no more specific locational information was provided. They duly dug for the treasure, but all they encountered was limestone bedrock “under not more than two inches of sand, with occasional potholes about six to nine inches deep.”&lt;ref name="Uren" /&gt; And so there the treasure hunt ceased. A search in 1991 of the [http://henrietta.slwa.wa.gov.au/search~S2?/aUren/auren/1%2C27%2C171%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=auren+malcolm+1900+1973&amp;31%2C%2C57 Uren Papers] held by the [[State Library of Western Australia]] failed to locate the original letter from Hayes to Uren.

== Expeditions by Gerritsen and others ==

In his 1994 book, ''And Their Ghosts May Be Heard'', [[Rupert Gerritsen]] speculates that perhaps the Ring of Stones had been constructed by the lost sailors from the [[Vergulde Draeck]], to indicate to any would-be searchers that they were heading inland, in a north east direction, as indicated by the longer arm of the projecting line of stones.&lt;ref name="Gerritsen1"&gt;Gerritsen, R. 1994/2002 ''And Their Ghosts May Be Heard'' (South Fremantle: Fremantle Arts Centre Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible explanations for the Ring of Stones, such as it being an Aboriginal stone arrangement or a stock route marker, were considered but neither appeared to be viable alternatives. The oldest stock route ran through better watered country about 15&amp;nbsp;km inland, and Aboriginal stone arrangements in southern WA are rare.&lt;ref name="Gerritsen1" /&gt; None appear to be of the form described by Hayes, and they are not usually sited in such inhospitable and out-of-the-way places. A recent claim linking the Ring of Stones with a supposed Aboriginal heritage site, the [[Eneabba Stone Arrangement]], is not supportable.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

To ascertain the exact nature of the Ring of Stones, Gerritsen, in collaboration with Bob Sheppard, researcher and principal of [[Warrigal Press]], undertook extensive research and field investigations.  Relying primarily on reports published in newspaper and information in [[Malcolm Uren]]’s book, ''Sailormen’s Ghosts'',&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/963099?lookfor=title:(Sailormen's%20Ghosts)%20%23format:Book&amp;offset=4&amp;max=5&lt;/ref&gt; Gerritsen, Sheppard and others undertook an initial expedition to relocate the Ring of Stone in April 2004. The area targeted was based on a map published in ''The Mirror'' in 1933, the path Burt took in 1875 and the limited positional information provided by Hayes and Penney.

Because the search area was relatively inaccessible, being coastal scrub and heath covering steep relic dunes, two 4-wheel drive vehicles were used. However, owing to the scrubby nature of the terrain, much of which had been burnt in a bushfire in the preceding year or two, staking of the vehicles’ tyres considerably hampered progress. Before the day was out the expedition was forced to retire to the small coastal town of Leeman with every tyre, including spares, staked and in a varying degree of deflation.

Based on this experience Gerritsen concluded that the only viable way to search was on foot. He was about to embark on another expedition in October 2008 when Sheppard was able to source Burt’s original letter, mud-map and relevant reports from police files  archived in the State Records Office of Western Australia. It was evident from these documents that the form, location and size of Burt’s Ring of Stones was distinctly different from the Ring of Stones found by Hayes and Penney. It was realised that two different ‘Ring of Stones’ had, in fact, been reported.

[[File:Ros 3.jpg|thumb|Gerritsen’s finding, 28 October 2008]]
Armed with the documents from police archives, including Burt’s mud-map, Gerritsen then based his search on the distance from the coast given by Burt, and the Ring of Stones’ relative position as indicated on the mud-map. As a result he was able to locate what appeared to be the site of Burt’s Ring of Stone within a day, on 28 October 2008. This location appeared to be confirmed the next day by following the latter part of the route Burt had taken from Woodada Well, as indicated on his mud-map. However, while the location matched Burt’s designation and description, in the centre of the clearing was a pile of stones, 2.1 m long, 1.0 m wide and 20&amp;nbsp;cm high, resembling a grave. Gerritsen took photographs and GPS readings and conducted a metal detection search. Upon his return to Perth he informed Sheppard, who visited the site a few days later and confirmed that the location seemed to be correct and that the pile of stones did appear to resemble a grave.

==Major Crime Squad investigation==
[[File:Ros 4.jpg|thumb|Gerritsen's discovery in June 2009.]]

The Maritime Archaeology Department of the Western Australian Museum was then informed. Because of the suspicion that this may have been a grave, Gerritsen was advised to inform the Western Australia Police. This was duly done, and all relevant information and photographic evidence was also supplied. This material was then passed on to the Major Crime Squad.

The Major Crime Squad initiated an investigation and reported in February 2009 that this was not a grave but simply a pile of stones. Gerritsen speculated that the pile of stones was the remnant of Burt’s Ring of Stones, the stone having been piled in the middle of the clearing by treasure hunters as some point in the past as they searched for the treasure they believed was there.&lt;ref name="Gerritsen2"&gt;Gerritsen, R (2010). ''Marooned mariners and mudmaps: The search for the Ring of Stones'', '''The Globe''' 64:17 - 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent discovery of two other stony areas by Sheppard and Gerritsen only 200–300 m away, where stones also seem to have been piled up, provides some support for this contention.

==Further expeditions==

Following this, attention turned to locating Hayes and Penney’s Ring of Stones. Whereas Burt’s Ring of Stones had been ‘half a mile’ from the coast, was ‘4 ft.’ in diameter and a simple circle; the Hayes-Penney Ring of Stones was ‘about’ or ‘at least two mile from the coast’, was ‘eight feet’ across,&lt;ref name="Uren" /&gt; and had a line of stones leading off it, so that is looked ‘like a pointer’.&lt;ref name="wa2" /&gt; Apart from the distance from the coast there was, however, little specific locational information provided in Hayes and Penney’s account. It would appear that they drove south from Dongara to the end of a dirt track to within ‘about nine miles’ of their Ring of Stones, and then proceeded on foot for ‘seven or eight miles’ [11.2 - 12.8&amp;nbsp;km].&lt;ref name="Uren" /&gt;

Based on the limited, imprecise and inconsistent information provided by Hayes, and utilising maps contemporaneous with the time of Hayes and Penney’s discovery of their Ring of Stones, an attempt was made to reconstruct their journey. This placed the Hayes-Penney’s Ring of Stones approximately 25&amp;nbsp;km south southeast of Dongara and about 30&amp;nbsp;km north of Burt’s Ring of Stones.

In order to eliminate other possibilities Gerritsen also began to investigate Aboriginal stone arrangements on this part of the coast, as listed on the Western Australian Department of Indigenous Affairs Aboriginal Heritage Inquiry System, specifically the sites designated as Eneabba Stone Arrangement (Site No. 4760) and Eneabba West (Site No. 15297). The Eneabba Stone Arrangement, however, could not be found in the designated location, despite a thorough search.&lt;ref name="Gerritsen2" /&gt; When examined by Gerritsen it was quite apparent the Eneabba West site did not resemble the Ring of Stones in the slightest.&lt;ref name="Gerritsen2" /&gt; However, the remains of what appeared to be a man-made stone wall, overlooking a shallow valley, was located in proximity to the Eneabba West site by Gerritsen on 17 June 2009.

The structure is situated in a relatively inaccessible and inhospitable location and has the appearance of being a lookout or a defensive structure. Despite close examination, test pitting and metal detection of the surrounds on two occasions in 2009, no sign of any human occupation or presence could be found{{Clarification needed|date=March 2018}}. Possible explanations for this structure that are under consideration are: that is an Aboriginal stone arrangement, or that it was constructed by survivors from the [[Vergulde Draeck]], runaway convicts, drovers or recreational campers, or by those engaged in military exercises in the area.

The search for the Hayes-Penney Ring of Stone commenced in June 2009. A 6.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; search area was delineated, the parameters of which were based on a reconstruction of the journey Hayes and Penney undertook, the locational details contained their account, and the uncertainties inherent in this. The search was also guided by the published photographs, which provide visual clues as to the nature of the country where they encountered the Ring of Stones.

By July 2010 the search of the designated search area had been completed, without result.
An approach was then made by Gerritsen in July 2010 to the archives section of [[West Australian Newspapers]] to ascertain if they had retained the letter Hayes wrote to Uren in February 1939, as well as the “rough sketch of the locality” and at least one additional photo, which Uren had indicated had accompanied the original letter.&lt;ref name="Uren" /&gt; This was not successful.

The search for the Hayes-Penney Ring of Stones is therefore still continuing. Since the beginning of July 2010 other search strategies have been employed based on alternative hypotheses on the location of the Ring of Stones and reconstructions of the journey by Hayes and Penney.

'''''Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments''''' is a 1735 [[oil painting]] by [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts an array of famous [[Rome|Roman]] monuments in a rural setting.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Panini was a famed painter of [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]], architectural fantasies. In this case, he combined a staggering array of monuments by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] without regard to topography. From left to right, he included the [[Temple of Hadrian]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli|Temple of Vesta]], the [[Maison Carrée]], and the [[Theater of Marcellus]], all of them surrounding the [[Obelisk of Thutmose III]]. In front of this overabundance of history, he placed the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|equestrian statue]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]], around which contemporary Roman peasants carry out their business.

While quite cavalier with regards to geography, Panini was remarkably faithful in his architectural reconstructions. He carefully edited out later additions to the original buildings, such as the walled-in sections in the arches of the Theater of Marcellus and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini's]] bell towers on the Pantheon's pediment.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
Panini's earliest training was with a painter of [[theatrical scenery]], and certain elements of that early influence can be seen in this painting. The arrangement of monuments is very similar to the way architectural perspective was achieved in the Italian theater. At the front of the "stage" are the peasant-actors in quaint costumes.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

Fashionable European youths undertook the [[Grand Tour]] throughout the eighteenth century, and for half a century to either side, and liked to bring back souvenirs of their travels. Thus, sketches and paintings of landmarks such as those in the ''Capriccio'' were very lucrative for Panini and his contemporaries. Escapism and contemplation were more important than geographical accuracy, so Panini was free to rearrange scenery in paintings like this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Facos|first=Michelle|authorlink=Michelle Facos|title=An Introduction to Nineteenth Century Art|year=2011|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=0203833074|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk4WgsO2OZsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Roman+Capriccio:+The+Pantheon+and+Other+Monuments+Panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GqS3n-u_PS&amp;sig=jaws0rhmEZ3zItkz89u1Lo1PFXo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mv8HUY2pKsTgyQGcyoCABg&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20Capriccio%3A%20The%20Pantheon%20and%20Other%20Monuments%20Panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creative reorganization led to a better comprehension of the ideal, rather than current, conditions of the monuments and the civilization that made them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Innes|first=Randy Norman|title=On the Limits of the Work of Art: The Fragment in Visual Culture|year=2008|format=thesis|publisher=[[University of Rochester]]|location=[[Rochester, New York]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hG2bSQ4K9M0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Roman+Capriccio:+The+Pantheon+and+Other+Monuments+Panini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YwAIUZPXCaj1ygHkyID4BQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20Capriccio%3A%20The%20Pantheon%20and%20Other%20Monuments%20Panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1836, where it was described by the ''[[Morning Post]]'' as "one of those amazing pictures by which Mr Turner dazzles the imagination and confounds all criticism: it is beyond praise”.

It had been commissioned from Turner by [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro of Novar]] and remained in his family collection until it was bought by the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|5th Earl of Roseberry]] in 1878.

[[File:Tuke, Henry Scott (1858–1929), Ruby, gold and malachite, 1902.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henry Scott Tuke]], ''Ruby, Gold and Malachite'', 1902]]

'''''Ruby, Gold and Malachite''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by [[Henry Scott Tuke]].  It depicts six young men in and around a boat, bathing in the sea.  It was painted near [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1902, along with two other works by Tuke, ''The Run Home'' and ''Portrait of Alfred de Pass''.   It was one of his greatest successes.

The painting measures {{convert|117|cm|in}} by {{convert|159|cm|in}}.  It was acquired by the [[City of London Corporation]] and is displayed at the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]].

==Background==
[[File:Tuke, Henry Scott (1858–1929), "August Blue," 1893.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Scott Tuke]], ''[[August Blue]]'', 1893-4, Tate Britain.]]
Tuke was born in [[York]] in 1858, but his family moved to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] the following year, where it was hoped the milder climate would ameliorate the tuberculosis suffered by his father, the physician [[Daniel Hack Tuke]]. He showed early talent for art, and studied at the [[Slade School of Art]] in London in 1874–9 and in Paris from 1881 to 1883, and also travelled to Italy.  He returned to [[Cornwall]] to live in Falmouth 1883, and is usually identified as a member of the [[Newlyn school]].  Many of his works involve boys or young men, often in or beside the sea, and usually naked, although generally in a position where their genitals are hidden from view.

==Painting==
The painting depicts six young men at [[Newporth Beach]] near Falmouth on a summer's day, in and about a rowing boat on the sea by the shoreline.  The painting shows no horizon, making it the open-air space more enclosed and intimate.  Four of the subjects are [[art nude|naked]]: one swimming to the upper left, one resting on rocks to the lower left, one wading and holding the boat to the lower right, and one sitting on the side of the boat in the centre.  The two others are clothed: one standing in white trousers holding an oar at the rear of the boat, and one sitting in the boat with white hat and trousers and an eye-catching red top.
[[File: Ruby, Gold and Malachite (detail).jpg|thumb|A detail from ''Ruby, Gold and Malachite'', with Charlie Mitchell as model.]]

The painting is ambiguous, and can be read in several ways: as a celebration of athletic masculinity; a representation of the innocence and purity of youth, unselfconscious in a natural setting; an image of a lost [[rural idyll]]; a depiction of the sons of empire; or (in the aftermath of the [[Boer War]]) as celebration of pleasure and an implicit criticism of the militarisation of youth.  Many commentators note Tuke's acquaintance with the [[Uranian]] movement and discern a [[homoerotic]] charge.

The title ''[[Ruby]], [[Gold]] and [[Malachite]]'' – referring to the red, yellow and green tones used in the work&amp;nbsp;– echo an essay by [[John Addington Symonds]], and may refer back to the opening lines of a poem "The Sundew" published by [[Algernon Swinburne]] in 1866: "A little marsh-plant, yellow-green, // And pricked at lip with tender red".  The poem describes a lovers' tryst in marshland, witnessed by a [[sundew]].  Swinburne's poem was the inspiration for Tuke's 1894 work, ''[[August Blue]]'', the title of Tuke's painting being a quotation from the closing lines of the poem.

Tuke used several of his regular models for the work, including the brothers Richard and Georgie Fouracre, Bert White, Harry Cleave, and Charlie Mitchell (1885–1957, shown resting on the rocks in the lower left) who was Tuke's boatman for 30 years.  Tuke left Mitchell £1,000 in his will.

==Reception==
Pictures of naked youths outside of a classical context were not generally acceptable in this period, with a notable exception for depictions of bathing: another prominent example is [[Thomas Eakins]]' ''[[The Swimming Hole]]'' (1883–5).  Tuke was elected an [[Associate of the Royal Academy]] in 1900 and a full member of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1914.  His work remained popular until the First World War ended the gilded age of late Victorian and Edwardian England.   Tuke's work fell out of favour after the war, and Tuke died in 1929.  His work regained popularity after it was discovered by a generation of [[openly gay]] art enthusiasts in the 1970s.

A '''self-fulfilling prophecy''' is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to [[positive feedback]] between belief and behavior. Although examples of such [[prophecy|prophecies]] can be found in literature as far back as [[ancient Greece]] and [[History of India|ancient India]], it is 20th-century [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] who is credited with coining the expression "self-fulfilling prophecy" and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article ''Self-Fulfilling Prophecy'', Merton defines it in the following terms: 
{{quote|The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a ''false'' definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come ''true''. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=SFP-48&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In other words, a positive or negative prophecy, strongly held belief, or [[delusion]]—declared as truth when it is actually false—may sufficiently influence people so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy.

Self-fulfilling prophecy are effects in ''[[behavioral confirmation]] effect'', in which behavior, influenced by expectations, causes those expectations to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darley |first=John M. |first2=Paget H. |last2=Gross |title=Stereotypes and prejudice: essential readings |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Stangor |year=2000 |publisher= Psychology Press |page=212 |chapter=A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labelling Effects |isbn=978-0-86377-589-5 |oclc=42823720}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is complementary to the [[self-defeating prophecy]].

==History of the concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Merton's concept of the ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' stems from the [[Thomas theorem]], which states that "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences".&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Child in America: Behavior Problems and Programs |last=Thomas |first=W. I. |authorlink=W. I. Thomas |year=1928 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn= |pages=572 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas, people react not only to the situations they are in, but also, and often primarily, to the way they perceive the situations and to the meaning they assign to their perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/nominal-interest-rates-and-money-supply-and-demand-1147766|title=How Money Supply and Demand Determine Nominal Interest Rates|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Therefore, their behaviour is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to the situations they are in, rather than by the situations themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.

Merton took the concept a step further and applied it to recent social phenomena. In his book ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', he conceives of a [[bank run]] at the fictional Last National Bank, over which Cartwright Millingville presides. It is a typical bank, and Millingville has run it honestly and quite properly. As a result, like all banks, it has some [[Asset|liquid assets]] (cash), but most of its assets are invested in various ventures. Then one day, a large number of customers come to the bank at once—the exact reason is never made clear. Customers, seeing so many others at the bank, begin to worry. False rumours spread that something is wrong with the bank, and more customers rush to the bank to try to get some of their money out while they still can. The number of customers at the bank increases, as does their annoyance and excitement, which in turn fuels the false rumours of the bank's [[insolvency]] and upcoming [[bankruptcy]], causing more customers to come and try to withdraw their money. At the beginning of the day—the last one for Millingville's bank—the bank was not insolvent. But the rumour of insolvency caused a sudden demand of withdrawal of too many customers, which could not be answered, causing the bank to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy. Merton concludes this example with the following analysis:

{{quote|The parable tells us that public definitions of a situation (prophecies or predictions) become an integral part of the situation and thus affect subsequent developments. This is peculiar to human affairs. It is not found in the world of nature, untouched by human hands. Predictions of the return of [[Comet Halley|Halley's comet]] do not influence its orbit. But the rumoured insolvency of Millingville's bank did affect the actual outcome. The prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfilment.&lt;ref name="merton"&gt;{{cite book |title= Social Theory and Social Structure|last= Merton|first= Robert K|authorlink= Robert K. Merton|year= 1968|publisher= [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 978-0-02-921130-4|oclc= 253949|pages= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Merton concluded that the only way to break the cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy is by redefining the propositions on which its false assumptions are originally based.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In economic "expectations models" of inflation, peoples' expectations of future inflation lead them to spend more today and demand higher nominal interest rates for any savings, since they expect that prices will be rising. This demand for higher nominal interest rates and increased spending in the present, in turn, create inflationary pressure and can cause inflation even if the expectations of future inflation are unfounded.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The expectations theory of inflation played a large role in [[Paul Volcker]]'s actions during his tenure as the Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] in combating the "[[stagflation]]" of the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the self-fulfilling prophecy the ''Oedipus effect'':

{{quote|One of the ideas I had discussed in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' was the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted. I had called this the "Oedipus effect", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. … For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences. But in biology, too—even in molecular biology—expectations often play a role in bringing about what has been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |year=1976 |publisher=Open Court |location=LaSalle, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87548-343-6 |oclc=2927208 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early precursor of the concept appears in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'': "During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment" (chapter I, part II).

===Applications===
Examples abound{{examples|date=May 2014}} in studies of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] and the related [[self-perception theory]]; people will often change their [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] to come into line with what they profess publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco-Villanueva, M. A., [http://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/econo/article/view/14336 El Efecto “Pricebo”: Cómo los precios pueden influenciar la percepción sobre la calidad del cannabis y sus implicaciones en las políticas de precios"], ''Pensamiento Crítico,'' vol. 22, n. 2, pp 175-210&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the United States, the concept was broadly and consistently applied in the field of public education reform, following the "[[War on Poverty]]". Theodore Brameld noted: "In simplest terms, education already projects and thereby reinforces whatever habits of personal and cultural life are considered to be acceptable and dominant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brameld |first=T. |authorlink= |year=1972 |title=Education as self-fulfilling prophecy |journal=Phi Beta Kappa |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=8–11, 58–61 [p. 9]|url= |quote= }} Quoted by Wilkins (1976), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of teacher attitudes, beliefs and values, affecting their expectations have been tested repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkins |first=William E. |authorlink= |year=1976 |title=The Concept of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=Sociology of Education |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–183 |issn=0038-0407|quote= |doi=10.2307/2112523 |jstor= 2112523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of the "inevitability of war" is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has received considerable study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The role of expectancy |title=The Tensions That Cause Wars |last=Allport |first=G. |authorlink= |editor=Cantrill, H. |year=1950 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana |isbn= |pages=43–78 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is similar to that discussed by the philosopher [[William James]] as "[[The Will to Believe]]." But James viewed it positively, as the self-validation of a belief.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Just as, in Merton's example, the belief that a bank is insolvent may help create the fact, so too, on the positive side, confidence in the bank's prospects may help brighten them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Similarly, Stock-exchange panic episodes, and speculative bubble episodes, can be triggered with the belief that the stock will go down (or up), thus starting the selling/buying mass move, etc.

A more Jamesian example: a swain, convinced that the fair maiden ''must'' love him, may prove more effective in his wooing than he would had his initial prophecy been defeatist.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is extensive evidence{{where|date=May 2014}} of "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", where the seemingly private expectations of individuals can predict the outcome of the world around them. The mechanisms by which this occurs are also reasonably well understood: it is simply that our own expectations change our behaviour in ways we may not notice and correct. In the case of the "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", others pick up on non-verbal behaviour, which affects their attitudes. A famous{{according to whom|date=May 2014}} example includes a study where teachers were told arbitrarily that random students were "going to blossom".{{Failed verification|date=May 2014}}  Oddly, those random students actually ended the year with significantly greater improvements.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal-2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenthal |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Covert communication in laboratories, classrooms, and the truly real world |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |publisher=Blackwell |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=151–154 |doi= 10.1111/1467-8721.t01-1-01250|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Rosenthal2003.pdf |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pygmalion in the Classroom|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Robert|last2=Jacobson|first2=Lenore|year=2003|publisher=Crown House|isbn=9781904424062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In Canadian ice hockey, junior league players are selected based on skill, motor coordination, physical maturity, and other individual merit criteria. However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0–11 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates. These factors make them actually become the best players, fulfilling the prophecy, while the real selection criterion was age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=978-0-316-01792-3|pages=20–25|chapter=1 – The Matthew Effect|laysummary=http://www.rugbyiq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1199:is-it-because-of-talent-that-athletes-succeed&amp;catid=102:mental-toughness&amp;Itemid=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same [[relative age effect]] has been noticed in Belgian soccer after 1997, when the start of the selection year was changed from August 1 to January 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helsen|first=WF |author2=Starkes, JL |author3=Van Winckel, J|title=Effect of a change in selection year on success in male soccer players|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2000-11-01|volume=12|issue=6|pages=729–735|pmid=11534065|doi=10.1002/1520-6300(200011/12)12:6&lt;729::AID-AJHB2&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype==
{{Main|Stereotype threat}}
This specific form of self-fulfilling prophecy is very common and takes many forms. For example, the expectancy for a political party to act in a certain way—based on [[Internalized racism|race]], religion, gender and much more—can eventually lead the said party to imitate the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R. (19992000). Personality. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 492). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, media, and the arts==
In literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as [[plot device]]s. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.

===Classical===
Many myths, legends and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. "Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change". (Wilkins 1976:177).&lt;/ref&gt; In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.&lt;!--own what?--&gt; The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.

====Greek====
[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]
The best known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.

Although the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Danaë]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Danaë to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Danaë because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Danaë's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.

Greek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked—but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88&lt;/ref&gt; In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.

People do not necessarily have to unsuccessfully avoid a prophecy in order for the prophecy to be self-fulfilling. For example, when it was predicted that [[Zeus]] would overthrow his father, [[Cronus|Cronos]], and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, he actively waged war against him in a direct attempt to fulfill this prophecy. This makes the prophecy a self-fulfilling one because it was the prophecy itself that gave Zeus the inspiration to do it in the first place.

====Roman====
[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]
The story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him like he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.

====Persian====
Another example of a self-fulfilling prophecy is detailed by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his account of [[Cyrus the Great]]'s life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams. Both dreams involved something particular (in the first dream, a flood, while in the second dream, a fruit bearing vine) emerging from his daughter Mandane's pelvis and covering the entirety of Asia. After consulting the Magi, he was informed that the dreams
foreshadowed the birth of a child who would eventually rule in his place. Terrified by the prophecies, Astyages summoned [[Harpagus]] and commanded him to kill the child after it's born. Harpagus, however, was reluctant to kill the child and so assigned the task to one of Astyages' cowherds. The cowherd likewise hesitated and so he and his wife devised a plan to expose their own child, that was born dead, to a desolate place in the mountains while raising the other child as their own. The child was afterwards named Cyrus. One day, when Cyrus was 10 years old, an incident with one of the children he was playing with brought him before king Astyages to give account for his actions. While listening to Cyrus' words, Astyages became suspicious that Cyrus could be the child he wanted to kill. After pressuring his cowherd to relay to him everything about the child, the cowherd finally revealed everything about how he happened upon the child and how he decided to raise him as his own. Astyages, angered with Harpagus summoned him as well and Harpagus likewise revealed the truth. In revenge, the king killed Harpagus' son and later made this act known to Harpagus. However, he spared Cyrus' life as the magi, attempting to further clarify the prophecy to him, accidentally misinterpreted it and thus saved Cyrus. After some time Harpagus, possibly driven by revenge, took advantage of Cyrus' prosperous growth and Astyages' misdeeds to persuade him to revolt against Astyages. His efforts eventually proved successful as Cyrus became king and Astyages was imprisoned. {{sfn|Herodotus|p=1.107-130}}

====Arabic====
A variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is "[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the "[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in "[[The Tale of Attaf]]", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]
Self-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

====Russian====
[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad "The Song of the Wise Oleg". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].

====European fairy tales====
Many fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.

Another fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.

In some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.

====Shakespeare====
[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.

The later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should "Beware Macduff" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.

===Modern===
Similar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symoné]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it.

====New Thought====
The [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that "like attracts like" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, ''Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour'', Journal of Australian Studies: 101&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, all things are created first by imagination, which leads to thoughts, then to words and actions. The thoughts, words and actions held in mind affect someone's intentions which makes the expected result happen. Although there are some cases where positive or negative attitudes can produce corresponding results (principally the [[placebo]] and [[nocebo]] effects), there is no scientific basis to the law of attraction.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web

==Causal loop==
{{see also|Causal loop|Newcomb's paradox}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, 37–49&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he cannot change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Seyid Yahya Bakuvi was born in [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]] into a rich family. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi lived in the 15th century, in [[Baku]] in the palace of [[Khalilullah I]].&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Hocazade – Seyid Yahya eş-Şirvani, İstanbul, 1319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Bartold, F. Köprülü – İslam medeniyyeti tarihi, Ankara, DİB, 1984, səh 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rıhtım"&gt;M.

Mustakimzde – Şerhi Virdü – Settar, SK: Pertev Paşa, N611&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he was engaged in [[Sufism]], and was a follower of the eminent Sheikh Sadr ad-Din al Khalvati, leader of the tariqa’s [[Shirvan]]. After the sheikh’s death, Seyid Yahya quarreled with a student Pirizade about who would lead Khalvati’s sect; he then left Shamakhi to move to Baku. In Baku he settled in the palace of Khalilullah I, where he enjoyed wide popularity as a philosopher and scientist. Soon the number of his followers (in countries of the [[Near East]], too) exceeded ten thousand people.

==Death==
According to one source, the date of Bakuvi’s death was 862 AH (1457), to another it was 868 AH (1463). There is a [[Mausoleum of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi]] in the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshahs’ Palace]] complex. The date on that building is the date of mausoleum's construction.

==Bakuvi’s works==
15 works of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi have been saved up to date. His works have a sufistic and mystic character. They are kept in cities of [[Turkey]]: [[Istanbul]] (“Muradiye” library), [[Konya]], [[Manisa]]. Seyid Yahya wrote such philosophic treatises as “Sharkh-I Gulshani-raz”(“Comments to flower garden of secrets”), “Asrar at-Talibin” (“Secrets of searchers of the truth”), “Symbolism of signs”, “Comments to the Safavids dynasty”, “Secrets of spirits” and others, penetrated through religious and mystic ideas which are valuable sources in the sphere of investigation of philosophy, astronomy and math.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14980">[[File:George Enescu.jpg|thumb|Enescu in the 1940s]]
'''Symphony No. 5''', in D major is a large-scale composition for orchestra, tenor soloist, and female choir by the Romanian composer [[George Enescu]], using a text by the Romanian poet [[Mihai Eminescu]]. Drafted in 1941 and partially orchestrated at some later date, the symphony was left unfinished at Enescu's death, but has been completed posthumously, first partially by {{ill|Cornel Țăranu|ro}} in 1970–72 and 1990, then in complete form by [[Pascal Bentoiu]] in 1995.

==History==
[[File:853874 enescu3015.jpg|thumb|Luminiș, Enescu's villa near Sinaia, where he composed the Fifth Symphony]]
Although the ideas in it had doubtless been gestating for some time, Enescu began writing the Fifth Symphony during his annual summer break at his villa, [[Luminiș]], in [[Sinaia]] in 1941, completing the entire draft in a span of something less than one month. The starting date is unknown, but Enescu might have been prompted to begin the symphony by the outbreak of [[Romania in World War II|war in Romania]] on 22 June. The first movement is dated 1 July in the manuscript and the second movement 8 July. The third movement is undated, but the fourth and final movement of the draft was completed on 19 July. For reasons that are not entirely clear, but must have had something to do with the war, Enescu broke off work at this point {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=22}}. At some later date (perhaps in Romania before September 1946, or later, in Paris), Enescu set about the orchestration, completing twenty-five pages (about two-thirds) of the first movement, up to a culminating chord in the fifth bar of the recapitulation {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=530–32}}.

The first movement of the Symphony, in the completion by Cornel Țăranu, was premiered at the Cluj Musical Autumn in 1972 under the baton of Emil Simon. Encouraged by its reception, Țăranu set about the more difficult task of completing the rest {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=22}}. After finishing a piano-score version, he orchestrated the finale, which was first presented together with the first movement at the Enescu Festival of 1991 in Bucharest, performed by the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra]] under {{ill|Cristian Mandeal|ro}} {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=529}}. Although Țăranu had hoped to complete the orchestration of the other two movements as well, he was prevented from doing so and asked Pascal Bentoiu to undertake the task. Realizing that the orchestrational integrity of the whole would otherwise suffer, Bentoiu (with Țăranu's agreement) reworked the entire finale as well as the unfinished third of the first movement, and the completed symphony was finally premiered in Bucharest by the Romanian National Orchestra and Radio Choir, with Florin Diaconescu, tenor soloist, conducted by {{ill|Horia Andreescu|ro}}, on the opening concert of the 1996–97 season {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=530}}.

==Analysis==
The symphony has four [[movement (music)|movements]]:
*Moderato sciolto
*Andantino moderato piacevole
*Vivace con fuoco
*Andante grave
The overall form of the symphony involves, typically for Enescu, a [[Cyclic form|cyclical]] metamorphosis of thematic "characters", setting out from a definitively shaped but spontaneous block of sonorities {{harv|Firca and Niculescu|1971|loc=1004}}. It involves a broadening of the concept of clyclic form, however, in that the allocation of roles for the various themes is constantly changing, in a sort of perpetual variational thinking. The main theme of the first movement, for example, will become a secondary theme in the finale. Similarly, the internal arrangement of elements within each theme group also changes with every recurrence {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=20}}.

The first movement (Moderato sciolto) is written in a free [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro form]] {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=20}}. The first thematic group is striking for the breadth of its melodic content, which is not usual for any symphony, and is not found in Enescu's previous four essays in the form. Within the composer's catalogue, it is necessary to go back to the [[Octet (Enescu)|String Octet]] (1900) or the "Prélude a l'unison" from the Second Orchestral Suite (1915) to find a comparable treatment. This theme group extends for twelve pages of orchestral score, up until the solo violin enters at rehearsal-number 7, marked ''dolente''. At first this seems to be just a bridge, but proves to be the most important element of the second thematic group. This second group, in contrast to the first, presents a small number of well-defined motifs and phrases, and continues for only four pages of score, to the beginning of the [[Development (music)|development]] section at rehearsal number 11 {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=531–32}}. The treatment of the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] materials is one of "characters in the making"—figures and motives that will evolve over the remainder of the entire symphony {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=20}}. The tumultuous development section reaches its climax after five bars of the recapitulation are already under way. It is at this point that Enescu's completed orchestration ceases, and what follows is surpisingly compressed, reaching the second thematic group after only sixteen bars. The composer's intention seems to have been to create in the first movement only a summary of what is to follow in the rest of the symphony, with anticipations in place of the expected resolutions. The movement concludes with an announcement of a new theme, which will become the opening theme of the second movement, at exactly the same pitch—a device that Enescu used frequently, ever since the Octet and the First Orchestral Suite. He will do exactly the same thing at the junction of the third and fourth movements {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=532}}.

The second movement (Andantino moderato piacevole) is in Enescu's mature [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsodic]] style. It opens with a long viola solo, recalling the [[Mode (music)|modal]] sound world of the composer's nearly contemporaneous Opp. 27 and 28: the Third Orchestral Suite (''Villageoise'') and the ''Impressions d'enfance'' for violin and piano. After a repetition by the oboe, accompanied by other woodwinds, the viola returns, accompanied in an improvisational, [[Lăutari|lăutărească]] style. (The scoring here is indicated scrupulously by the composer in the draft score.) The chromatic/[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]] musical language gives way here to a fluid modal world that passes easily from one ''[[Gregorian mode#Tonality|finalis]]'' to another, with accompanying pedals, shifting [[Ison (music)|isons]], [[Quartal and quintal harmony|quartal-quintal chords]] and [[Secundal|secundal harmonies]], as well as locally "displaced" chords {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=22}}. Structurally, the movement is extremely free, beginning with a series of thematic expositions in an A B A' B' C D sequence, then continuing from rehearsal 32 with only the material already presented up to that point. Although recapitulation is occasionally suggested, the only real recapitulation occurs with the return of the solo viola's unmistakably Romanian theme three bars after rehearsal number 46 {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=533}}.

The third movement (Vivace con fuoco) is a [[scherzo]], written in 2/2 time with an inner pulsation of triplets. The thematic material is drawn entirely from the first movement, especially from the second part of the first thematic group. After a dense opening passage, the texture gradually thins out, eventually giving way to a sort of chorale (taking the place of the conventional trio section), though with continuing bursts from the first theme. This central section closes in a "triumphal" quality, with suggestons of the secondary thematic group from the first movement. This scherzo is the only real allegro movement of the symphony and may be regarded as a redevelopment of the material from the first movement, along the lines of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s procedure in his [[Chamber Symphony No. 1 (Schoenberg)|First Chamber Symphony]] {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=23}}. The movement is extremely modulatory. At rehearsal number 65, the theme from the first movement's second group, originally ''dolente'' in the solo violin, now enters forcefully, and the momentum is broken. Four bars after rehearsal 68, the movement closes with two statements of the subject that will launch the finale {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=534}}.

The finale (Andante grave) is an extended cantata for tenor solo, female choir, and orchestra, using as text an early variant of the poem "Mai am un singur dor" (I Have but One Desire) by Mihai Eminescu. Its overall form, in outline, is {{harv|Țăranu|1973|loc=23–24}}:
*Fugato – stretto – pedal
*Recapitulative development of material from all the preceding movements
*Cantata – final coda
The subject of the opening fugato is derived from that ''dolente'' theme from the solo violin in the first movement. Here it is assigned (by the composer himself in the sketch) to the brass. The effect is funereal (in his edition, Bentoiu has taken the liberty of adding to the tempo marking, in brackets, "Quasi marcia funebre"), implacable, rigid, and magnificent. The section comes to an end with the main theme from the second movement, "almost as if we were invited to read a name on a wooden cross" {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=524}}.

==Text==
[[File:Eminescu 1.jpg|thumb|left|Mihai Eminescu in 1884]]
The text used in the last movement of the symphony does not quite correspond to any of the four "official" versions of Eminescu's poem, but is based on an early variant beginning with the words "De-oi adormi curând / În noaptea uitării / Să mă duceţi tăcând, / La marginea mării" (When soon I'm laid to rest / in the quiet evening / bring me silently / to the seashore). Eminescu's variant has nine stanzas, but for the symphony, Enescu has added an extra one in the penultimate position. It is taken from the final version, but with the last two lines exchanged in order to match the ''abab'' rhyme scheme of the earlier variant: "Luceferi ce răsar / Din umbră de cetini / O să-mi zâmbească iar / Fiindu-mi prieteni" (Rising evening stars / from the shadow of the branches / will smile on me again / having been my friends) ({{harvnb|Bentoiu|2010|loc=535}}; {{harvnb|Țăranu|1973|loc=24}}).

The '''''Symphony in E''''', first performed on March 10, 1866, was the only [[symphony]] composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]]. Since Sullivan's death, it has frequently been called the "Irish" Symphony as it was composed in Ireland, and as a homage to [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|"Scotch Symphony"]].

The piece was generally well-received at its early performances.

==History==
Sullivan began work on his symphony in 1863, when he was 21 years old. From holiday in northern Ireland, he wrote to his mother that "as I was jolting home ... through wind and rain on an open [[Jaunting car|jaunting-car]], the whole first movement of a symphony came into my head with a real Irish flavour about it – besides scraps of the other movements."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The composer later wrote, "I always meant to call it the 'Irish Symphony', but I modestly refrained, as it was courting comparison with the 'Scotch Symphony'." [i.e. [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|Symphony No 3]].]&lt;ref&gt;Young, note 17 to Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The title did not appear on the published score until after Sullivan's death, in the [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]] edition of 1915. Sullivan wrote in 1899 to his cousin, the music critic B. W. Findon: "Had I known that [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] would name his work an 'Irish Symphony', I think I should have knocked my modesty on the head."&lt;ref&gt;Findon, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of the symphony took place at [[The Crystal Palace]] on 10 March 1866, conducted by [[August Manns]], who had previously conducted the London première of Sullivan's [[incidental music]] to [[The Tempest (Sullivan)|''The Tempest'']].&lt;ref name=Jacobs41&gt;Jacobs, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The advertised programme for the concert also included [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' sung by [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''Jubel'' Overture, and his song "The Valley", sung by [[Charles Santley]], Beethoven's Overture to ''[[Fidelio]]'' and his [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Symphony]], and violin solos played by [[Carl Rosa]].&lt;ref&gt;"Crystal Palace Concert", ''[[The Morning Post]]'', 10 March 1866, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The symphony had its second performance on 11 April at [[St James's Hall]] at a concert of the Musical Society of London;&lt;ref&gt;"Music – The Musical Society of London", ''The Daily News'', 13 April 1866, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the conductor was [[Alfred Mellon]].&lt;ref name=naxos&gt;Burn, Andrew. (2007). Notes to Naxos CD 8.570351 {{oclc|611357010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/symphony/times1866b.html "Concerts"], ''The Times'', April 16, 1866, via The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July, it was given a third performance, at what was billed as "Mr Arthur S. Sullivan's Grand Orchestral Concert".&lt;ref name=standard&gt;"St. James's Hall", ''[[London Evening Standard|The Standard]]'', 12 July 1866, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The programme consisted mainly of Sullivan's works, including the overture to ''[[The Sapphire Necklace]]'' and excerpts from ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'', conducted by the composer. Among the performers was the popular singer, [[Jenny Lind]], who co-sponsored the concert, sang four musical numbers including two Sullivan songs, and attracted a capacity audience.&lt;ref name=standard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/symphony/times1866c.html "St. James's-Hall"], ''[[The Times]]'', July 13, 1866, via The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was well received, though the music critics, both then and later, observed the influence of other composers. The critic in ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, after the first performance, "The symphony [is] the best musical work, if judged only by the largeness of its form and the number of beautiful thoughts it contains, for a long time produced by any English composer. ... Mr Sullivan should abjure Mendelssohn, even [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and above all [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], for a year and a day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/symphony/times1866a.html "Concerts"], ''The Times'', 12 March 1866, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1960 study of Sullivan's music Gervase Hughes also detects echoes of Schumann, and of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] as well.&lt;ref name=h11&gt;Hughes, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 analysis, [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]] comments that the symphony predates the well known symphonies of Brahms, Tchaikovsky and Dvořák, and concurs with earlier analysts that the principal influences on Sullivan's score were Schubert, Schumann and Mendelssohn. Lamb remarks on the themes for trombones and lower strings in the second movement, which "lend the work an especial solemnity", and finds the general mood of the symphony quite serious. Nonetheless Lamb  finds that work "also displays Sullivan at his lightest, above all in the joyous third movement … with its jaunty theme for oboe and delightful interplay between pizzicato strings and bubbling woodwind."&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;Lamb, Andrew. Notes to Chandos CD 9859 (2000) {{oclc|811240559}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the analyst Andrew Burn commented that the finale displays an early example of one of the composer's favourite devices: a melody, first heard on the oboe, is combined in counterpoint with a rhythmic theme in the first violins: "Such a device was to become a hallmark of the composer in the double choruses of his operettas".&lt;ref name=naxos/&gt;

The symphony was performed regularly during Sullivan's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/sullorch.htm#symphony "Symphony in E, 'Irish' (1866)"], the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 12 July 2009, accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It received few performances in the twentieth century, but it has been heard more frequently in recent decades and was the major work of the opening concert of the first [[English Music Festival]] (broadcast by the [[BBC]]) in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishmusicfestival.org.uk/emf2006.html Official website of the English Music Festival] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922153423/http://www.englishmusicfestival.org.uk/emf2006.html |date=2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four CD recordings of the piece have been issued, and a new study score edition has been published by a German firm, Musikproduction Jürgen Höflich&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikmph.de/musical_scores/composers_sales/scorelist_eng.htm ''Irish Symphony''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923083926/http://www.musikmph.de/musical_scores/composers_sales/scorelist_eng.htm |date=2006-09-23 }}, Musikproduction Jürgen Höflich, reprinting the Novello &amp; Co edition, with a new introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The symphony has four movements:
*[[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] – Allegro, ma non troppo vivace
*Andante espressivo
*[[Allegretto]]
*[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] vivace e con brio

The playing time is about thirty five minutes (or slightly longer if the exposition repeat is taken in the first movement).&lt;ref&gt;Notes to CPO CD 999 171-2 (1994) {{OCLC| 34029969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ''Andante'' introduction opens with the alternation in octaves of [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] in dotted rhythm, played by the brass, answered by a '[[Dresden amen|Dresden Amen]]' motif on the strings (a Mendelssohnian touch).&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; The main Allegro part of the first movement has divided critical opinion. In ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' in 1969, [[Edward Greenfield]] commented, "The first theme in E minor may be very Mendelssohnian in shape, rhythm and key, but it provides the first real sign of Sullivan's genuine vitality of imagination,"&lt;ref name=gramophone&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "Sullivan: Symphony in E major, ''Irish'', ''The Gramophone'', February 1968, p. 1167&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hughes considers that though [[sonata form]] is competently handled, the first subject, "a violin cantabile of soaring promise, falls to pieces at the seventh bar."&lt;ref name=h11/&gt;
*The second movement, in B major, is based on what Greenfield calls "a very Mendelssohnian melody" which "survives [[The Salvation Army]] treatment on horns and alto trombone in octaves, only to culminate in an outrageous crib of the second movement of Schubert's [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Unfinished]], a phrase first on oboes and then on violins."&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; Hughes describes the movement as lyrical, but with "a rather jejeune accompaniment".&lt;ref name=h11/&gt;
*The [[scherzo]] third movement, in C major, has attracted the most favourable comments from critics. Hughes notes that it is not in conventional symphonic scherzo form, following instead a pattern ABCA with a short coda based on B&lt;ref name=h11/&gt; in which Greenfield heard an astonishing similarity to the finale of Schubert's [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Great C major Symphony]].&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; The jaunty main theme of the movement is given to the oboe, always one of Sullivan's favoured instruments.
*The finale contains no unconventional features, though Greenfield comments that it brings "one of those [[descant]]s (fast dotted rhythm against a conventionally soaring melody) that became one of the trademarks of the operettas".

Hughes sums the symphony up thus: "In spite of the promising first movement and a modicum of competent thematic development, the symphony cannot be counted as a satisfactory achievement. Too much of the material is machine-made – as yet we find few signs of true spontaneity."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Greenfield concludes that the symphony is "a charming example of Victorian art at its least inhibited."&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; Lamb finds that despite the serious tone of much of the work, the symphony has "an all-pervading charm" and demonstrates "a thoroughly proficient handling of the orchestra".&lt;ref name=lamb/&gt;

'''''The Montgomery County Bulletin''''' or simply '''''The Bulletin''''' was a free [[alternative weekly]] newspaper distributed in [[Montgomery County, Texas]]; a suburban county north of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. It claimed a circulation of 20,000 copies before being forced out of business in 2008 due to evidence of massive [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2196875/|title=Scanned excerpt of The Bulletin|date=2008-08-06|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP-reply"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2008/08/montgomery_county_plagiarism.php|title=R.I.P., Plagiarizing Montgomery County Paper|last=Downing|first=Margaret|date=2008-08-08|publisher=[[Houston Press]] blog|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/61988/montgomery-county-bulletin-the-big-ripoff/|title=Montgomery County Bulletin’s Big Ripoff|last=Gross|first=Jason|date=2008-08-11|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The paper was founded in 1969 as a [[pennysaver|shopper]].  In 1998, Mike Ladyman, former publisher of ''Wheels'' magazine (no relation to the [[Wheels (magazine)|Australian publication]]) bought the paper and turned it into an alternative weekly.  He largely ran it as a mom-and-pop business, delivering the paper himself.  He largely left the writing to Mark Williams, a freelance writer who was listed as a staff reporter and music editor.&lt;ref name="HP-reply"/&gt;

In Ladyman's first year of ownership, the ''Bulletin'' received the "Most Improved Newspaper" award from the [[Texas Community Newspaper Association]].&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;

==Plagiarism scandal==

In late July 2008, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' music critic Jody Rosen got word that a Williams piece about [[Jimmy Buffett]] that appeared in the March 2008 ''Bulletin'' was almost a verbatim copy of a 2007 piece Rosen had written for ''Slate''.  Rosen did a search on [[Google]], and discovered that all of Williams' articles dating back to at least 2005 had been copied wholesale from numerous sources.  Williams appeared to have stolen work from diverse publications such as ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[salon.com]]'', ''[[NME]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and the ''[[Boston Globe]]''. The Buffett article that triggered his initial inquiry, for instance, had been lifted from Rosen's 2007 piece and two other articles.  He also found at that Williams had stolen at least one of his other articles for ''Slate.''&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/5931508.html|title=Montgomery Co. weekly faces plagiarism accusations|author=C. Shropshire and M. Casady|date=2008-08-07|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OTM&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080812013709/http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/08/08/03 Free Copy]. [[NPR]] and [[WNYC]], 2008-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Rosen obtained a copy of the ''Bulletin's'' latest issue, and found that nearly every article in it appeared to have been plagiarized.  Rosen suggested that "in purely statistical terms, [...] the articles in the Montgomery County Bulletin [may] amount to the greatest plagiarism scandal in the annals of American journalism".
&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2196810/|title=Dude, You Stole My Article|last=Rosen|first=Jody|date=2008-08-06|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rosen published his article on August 6, 2008; some observers suggested that Mark Williams was simply a ''[[nom de plume]]'' of Mike Ladyman, but in a ''[[Houston Press]]'' interview Ladyman denied the charge and called ''Slate's'' piece “an attack, an attention-grabbing hatchet job”. He also complained of Rosen's attitude in the affair and claimed that he was not given sufficient time and details to react appropriately and diligently. “The mistake I made was not working fast enough for Jody Rosen and apparently I needed to be punished for it.”&lt;ref name="HP-reply"/&gt; Ladyman announced he was shutting down ''The Bulletin''', and blamed Williams for the plagiarism. Williams himself published a bitter and sarcastic open letter to Rosen in which he wrote, describing himself as the victim of the critic's quest for [[blogosphere]] fame: "Of course, you are certainly owed an apology, but one has to ponder for a moment just why that is; after all, you have most definitely garnered the attention of the bloggers that you evidently crave in abundance with this manufactured scandal." Williams claimed that he had not intentionally plagiarized articles but had simply used [[press kit]] material without realizing that they included work of other journalists: "I did so thinking it was cleared for such use; but, as [Rosen] so subtly pointed out, I was mistaken."&lt;ref name="HP-reply"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chronicle/&gt; In turn, Rosen contested the timeline presented by Ladyman, and blamed him for shunning his responsibilities as the newspaper's editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2008/08/jody_rosen_slate_montgomer_cou.php|title=Jody Rosen of Slate Responds, Deals With A Squalling Kid|last=Downing|first=Margaret|date=2008-08-08|publisher=[[Houston Press]] blog|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal also spawned discussion on the thin line which separates plagiarism from very commonplace [[news aggregator|news aggregation]]. In the conclusion of his piece, Rosen quipped "Mike Ladyman and company may simply be bringing guerrilla-style 21st-century content aggregation to 20th-century print media: publishing the [[Napster]] of newspapers." &lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2225/aggregation-vs-plagiarism-a-modern-problem-hits-an-old-medium/|title=Aggregation vs. Plagiarism: A Modern Problem Hits an Old Medium |author=JR Raphael|date=2008-08-07|publisher=The Inquisitr|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2008/08/08/the-slate-the-bulletin-and-the-plagiarist/|title=The Slate, The Bulletin and The Plagiarist|author=Jonathan Bailey|date=2008-08-08|publisher=Plagiarism Today|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Craig Silverman]] of Regret the Error described the ''Bulletin'' as "perhaps the first newspaper to pursue plagiarism as a standard operating procedure."&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Craig. [http://www.regrettheerror.com/2008/12/16/crunks-2008-the-year-in-media-errors-and-corrections Crunks 2008: The Year in Media Errors and Corrections]. Regret The Error, 2008-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosen was a guest on [[NPR]]'s ''[[On the Media]]'' on August 8, 2008.  He suggested that the ''Bulletin'' really didn't need a Website because it was a free paper supported by advertising in the print edition.  He thought that Williams' plagiarism probably would have gone unnoticed had not the paper's Website opened it up to being searched on Google.&lt;ref name=OTM/&gt;

[[File:Tipu's Tiger front view 2006AH4173.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], London showing the prostrate European being attacked]]
'''Tipu's Tiger''' or '''Tippu's Tiger''' is an eighteenth-century [[automaton]] or mechanical toy created for [[Tipu Sultan]], the  ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in India. The carved and painted wood casing represents a tiger savaging a near life-size European man. Mechanisms inside the tiger and man's bodies make one hand of the man move, emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunts from the tiger. In addition a flap on the side of the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small [[pipe organ]] with 18 notes.

The tiger was created for Tipu and makes use of his personal emblem of the tiger and expresses his hatred of his enemy, the British of the [[East India Company]]. The tiger was discovered in his [[Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace|summer palace]] after East India Company troops [[Battle of Seringapatam|stormed Tipu's capital]] in 1799. The [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]], [[Lord Mornington]] sent the tiger to Britain initially intending it to be an exhibit in the [[Tower of London]]. First exhibited to the London public in 1808 in [[East India House]], then the offices of the East India Company in London, it was later transferred to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in 1880 (accession number 2545(IS)).&lt;ref name="V&amp;A web"&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger with keyboard on display 2006AH4168.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger with the organ keyboard visible]]
Tipu's Tiger was originally made for Tipu Sultan (also referred to as Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth-century literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]) around 1795.&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"/&gt; Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on the uniforms of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces.&lt;ref name=ModernAsianStudies&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brittlebank | first1 = K. | title = Sakti and Barakat: The Power of Tipu's Tiger. An Examination of the Tiger Emblem of Tipu Sultan of Mysore | journal = Modern Asian Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–269 | doi =  10.2307/312813| year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 312813 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His throne rested upon a probably similar life-size wooden tiger, covered in gold; like other valuable treasures it was broken up for the highly organised [[Prize money|prize fund]] shared out between the British army.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Davis, 156-157 on the throne, and 153-157 on the prize fund generally&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu had inherited power from his father [[Hyder Ali]], a Muslim soldier who had risen to become ''dalwai'' or commander-in-chief under the ruling Hindu [[Wodeyar dynasty]], but from 1760 was in effect the ruler of the kingdom. Hyder, after initially trying to ally with the British against the [[Maratha]]s, had later become their firm enemy, as they represented the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom, and Tipu grew up with violently anti-British feelings.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=23-24}}

The tiger formed part of a specific group of large [[caricature]] images commissioned by Tipu showing European, often specifically British, figures being attacked by tigers or elephants, or being executed, tortured and humiliated and attacked in other ways. Many of these were painted by Tipu's orders on the external walls of houses in the main streets of Tipu's capital, [[Seringapatam]].{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=24}} Tipu was in "[[Franco-Indian alliances#Proposals of Tippu Sahib|close co-operation]]" with the French, who were at war with Britain and still had [[French India|a presence]] in South India, and some of the French craftsmen who visited Tipu's court probably contributed to the internal works of the tiger.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=24-25}}

Tipu's Tiger is notable as an example of early musical automata from India,&lt;ref name="RaceMusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theracemusic.net/the-history-of-electronic-music/part13-the-first-portable-music-player-%E2%80%93-the-most-popular-automatic-music-instrument-in-the-world |title=Part 13.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically about half an inch thick, and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II. There are many openings at the head end, formed to match the pattern of the inner part of the painted tiger stripes, which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better, and the tiger is "obviously male". The top part of the tiger's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws. The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=66}} Examination and analysis by the V&amp;A conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6099083 V&amp;A Conservation in Action - Tippoo's Tiger] video, accessed, 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure is clearly in European costume, but authorities differ as to whether it represents a soldier or civilian; the current text on the V&amp;A website avoids specifying, other than describing the figure as "European".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html Tippoo's Tiger on Victoria &amp; Albert Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825074241/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html |date=25 August 2006 }}; to Ord-Hume he is "a European soldier" (Part 1, 21), but to de Almeida and Gilpin he is "an English gentleman" (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a "regular grunting sound" simulating the roar of the tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, summarized at p. 64 and throughout in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of both shell and workings, and analysis of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture. The presence of French artisans and French army engineers within Tipu's court has led many historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton.&lt;ref name=Archer&gt;{{cite book

==History==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger Salmond 1800.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first published illustration of Tipu's Tiger in [[James Salmond]]'s book of 1800]]
Tipu's Tiger was part of the extensive plunder from Tipu's palace captured in the fall of Seringapatam, in which Tipu died, on 4 May 1799, at the culmination of the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]]. An ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the Governor General of the East India Company, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], wrote a memorandum describing the discovery of the object:&lt;ref&gt;The St James's Chronicle, April 1800; also reported in the Edinburgh Caledonian Mercury 24 April 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stronge|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"In a room appropriated for musical instruments was found an article which merits particular notice, as another proof of the deep hate, and extreme loathing of Tippoo Saib towards the English. This piece of mechanism represents a royal Tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an Organ, within the body of the Tyger. The sounds produced by the Organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress intermixed with the roar of a Tyger. The machinery is so contrived that while the Organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up, to express his helpless and deplorable condition. The whole of this design was executed by Order of Tippoo Sultaun. It is imagined that this memorial of the arrogance and barbarous cruelty of Tippoo Sultan may be thought deserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

The earliest published drawing of Tippoo's Tyger was the frontispiece for the book "A Review of the Origin, Progress and Result, of the Late Decisive War in Mysore with Notes" by [[James Salmond]], published in London in 1800. It preceded the move of the exhibit from India to England and had a separate preface titled "Description of the Frontispiece" which said:&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle24"&gt;As quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/thistle24.htm|title=2.4 Tippoo's Tiger: Frontispiece |author=Wood, Col Mark |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"This drawing is taken from a piece of mechanism representing a royal tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an organ within the body of the tyger, and a row of keys of natural notes. The sounds produced by the organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress, intermixed with the roar of a tyger. The machinery is so contrived, that while the organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up to express his helpless and deplorable condition.

The whole of this design is as large as life, and was executed by order of Tippoo Sultaun, who frequently amused himself with a sight of this emblematic triumph of the Khoodadaud, over the English, Sircar. The piece of machinery was found in a room of the palace at Seringapatam appropriated for the reception of musical instruments, and called the Rag Mehal.

The original wooden figure from which the drawing is taken will be forwarded, by the ships of this season, to the Chairman of the Court of Directors, to be presented to his Majesty. It is imagined that this characteristic emblem of the ferocious animosity of Tippoo Sultaun against the British Nation may not be thought undeserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

Unlike Tipu's throne, which also featured a large tiger, and many other treasures in the palace, the materials of Tipu's Tiger had no intrinsic value, which together with its striking iconography is what preserved it and brought it back to England essentially intact. The Governors of the East India Company had at first intended to present the tiger to the Crown, with a view to it being displayed in the [[Tower of London]], but then decided but to keep it for the Company. After some time in store, during which period the first of many "misguided and wholly unjustified endeavours at "improving" the piece" from a musical point of view may have taken place, it was displayed in the reading-room of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] Museum and Library at [[East India House]] in [[Leadenhall Street]], London from July 1808.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=29-31}}&lt;ref&gt;153-157&lt;/ref&gt;

It rapidly became a very popular exhibit, and the crank-handle controlling the wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by the public. The French author [[Gustave Flaubert]] visited London in 1851 to see the [[Great Exhibition]], writes [[Julian Barnes]], but finding nothing of interest in [[The Crystal Palace]], visited the East India Company Museum where he was greatly enamoured by Tipu's Tiger.&lt;ref name="Pritchett Symbols"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/tipusultan/symbols/symbols.html |title=Symbols |author=Pritchett, Prof Frances W.  |year=2000 |website=Tipu Sultan of Mysore (r. 1782-99) |publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1843 it was reported that "The machine or organ ... is getting much out of repair, and does not altogether realize the expectation of the visitor".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the crank-handle disappeared, to the great relief of students using the reading-room in which the tiger was displayed, and ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' later reported that
{{quote|"These shrieks and growls were the constant plague of the student busy at work in the Library of the old India House, when the Leadenhall Street public, unremittingly, it appears, were bent on keeping up the performances of this barbarous machine.

When the East India Company was taken over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, [[Whitehall]] until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new [[India Office]], which occupied part of the building still used by today's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in [[South Kensington]], which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V&amp;A records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] through the summer and spring.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keats-Shelley"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30210016 |title=News and Notes|author=Mann, Phyllis G. |journal=Keats-Shelley Journal, Vol 6.

In recent times, Tipu's Tiger has formed an essential part of museum exhibitions exploring the historical interface between Eastern and Western civilisation, colonialism, ethnic histories and other subjects, one such being held at the Victoria and Albert Museum itself in autumn 2004 titled "Encounters:the meeting of Asia and Europe, 1500&amp;ndash;1800".&lt;ref name="Jaffer (2007)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffer |first1=Amin |editor1-first=Francisco José |editor1-last=Gomes |others=Alexandra Curvelo, Clare Anderson , Bhaswati Bhattacharya , Kévin Le Doudic , Momin Chaudhury , Samuel Berthet , Bhagwan S.

Today Tipu's Tiger is arguably the best-known single work in the Victoria and Albert Museum as far as the general public is concerned. It is a "must-see" highlight for school-children's visits to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and functions as an iconic representation of the museum, replicated in various forms of memorabilia in the museum shops including [[postcard]]s, model kits and stuffed toys.&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kromm|first1=Jane|last2=Bakewell|first2=Susan Benforado|title=A history of visual culture: Western civilization from the 18th to the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO2scveOMokC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=17 July 2011|date=2 February 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-492-1|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors can no longer operate the mechanism since the device is now kept in a glass case.

The British hunted tigers, not just to emulate the [[Mughals]] and other local elites in this "royal" sport, but also as a symbolic defeat of Tipu Sultan and any other ruler who stood in the path of British domination.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The tiger motif was used in the "Seringapatam medal" which was awarded to those who participated in the 1799 campaign, where the British lion was depicted as overcoming a prostrate tiger, the tiger being the dynastic symbol of Tipu's line. The Seringapatam medal was issued in gold for the highest dignitaries who were associated with the campaign as well as select officers on general duty, silver for other dignitaries, field officers and other staff officers, in copper-[[bronze]] for the non-commissioned officers and in [[tin]] for the privates. On the reverse it had a frieze of the storming of the fort while the obverse showed, in the words of a nineteenth-century tome on medals, "the BRITISH LION subduing the TIGER, the emblem of the late Tippoo Sultan's government, with the period when it was effected and the following words 'ASSUD OTTA-UL GHAULIB', signifying the Lion of God is the conqueror, or the conquering Lion of God."&lt;ref name="Carter_1893_Medals"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Norie and Wilson |publication-place = London |title = War medals of the British army, and how they were won |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14047956M/War_medals_of_the_British_army_and_how_they_were_won. |last= Carter |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas Carter (writer) |edition = War medals of the British army, and how they were won. |publication-date = 1893 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu's Tiger is also notable as a literal image of a tiger killing a European, an important symbol in England at the time, and from about 1820 the "Death of Munro" became one of the scenes in the repertoire of [[Staffordshire pottery]] figurines.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=26}}&lt;ref name="de Almeida, 38"/&gt; Tiger-hunting in the [[British Raj]], is also considered to represent not just the political subjugation of India, but in addition, the triumph over India's environment.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The iconography persisted and during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] ran a political cartoon showing the Indian rebels as a tiger, attacking a victim in an identical pose to Tipu's Tiger, being defeated by the British forces shown by the larger figure of a lion.

Motives for collection of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter as having a social and cultural context.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalter |first1=Barrett  |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Review Essay: "Shopping, Collecting, and Feeling at Home" |journal=Eighteenth-Century Fiction |volume=20 |issue=3, Article 11 |pages= 469–477|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth_century_fiction/v020/20.3.kalter.html |doi= 10.1353/ecf.0.0008|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated by the need to display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt; In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and ''objet's d'art''&amp;nbsp; from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in the minds of the British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt;

==As a musical instrument==
[[File:Tipu Sultan's Tiger.JPG|thumb|Side view, showing how the handle when turned gets in the way of the player of the keyboard]]

In a detailed study published in 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, and in doing so much of its original operating principles have been destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31, though his main discussion of the matter is in his Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each "comprising eighteen notes, [which] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are [[unison]]s - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a [[Voix céleste|celeste]] effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature".{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|p=69}} The tiger's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate [[bellows]] located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by unbolting and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted "grunt-pipe" until it reaches a point where it slips down "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound"{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|pp=64-66, photos 67-68}} Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}

Works on the noise-making functions included those made over several decades by the famous organ-building firm [[Henry Willis &amp; Sons]], and Henry Willis III, who worked on the tiger in the 1950s, contributed an account to a monograph by Mildred Archer of the V&amp;A. Ord-Hume is generally ready to exempt Willis work from his scathing comments on other drastic restorations, which "vandalism" is assumed to be by unknown earlier organ-builders.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 30, and Part 2 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
There was a detailed account of the sound-making functions in ''[[The Penny Magazine]]'' in 1835, whose anonymous author evidently understood "things mechanical and organs in particular".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 75, preceding his full reproduction of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; From this and Ord-Hume's own investigations, he concluded that the original operation of the man's "wail" had been intermittent, with a wail only being produced after every dozen or so grunts from the tiger above, but that at some date after 1835 the mechanism had been altered to make the wail continuous, and that the bellows for the wail had been replaced with smaller and weaker ones, and the operation of the moving arm altered.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/8973957 video] of [[David Dimbleby]] playing the grunt and wail only&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzling features of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 71, 73, 75, 77, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard, which is largely original, is "unique in construction", with "square ivory buttons" with round [[lathe]]-turned tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is "practical and convenient" they are spaced such that "it is almost impossible to stretch the hand to play an octave".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, 73, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The two stop control knobs for the organ are located, "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is now rarely played, but there is a V&amp;A video of a recent performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6699473 Vimeo.com] ''Conservation in Action - Playing Tippoo's Tiger Part 2'', and [http://vimeo.com/6099330 ''Part 1'', with the top of the tiger removed], accessed 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Grabmaljohannes13.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]]
The '''Tomb of Antipope John XXIII''' is the [[marble]]-and-bronze [[tomb]] [[Church monument|monument]] of [[Antipope]] [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (Baldassare Cossa, c.&amp;nbsp;1360–1419), created by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] for the [[Florence Baptistry]] adjacent to [[Florence Cathedral|the Duomo]]. It was commissioned by the executors of Cossa's will after his death on December 22, 1419 and completed during the 1420s, establishing it as one of the early landmarks of [[History of Florence#Renaissance Florence|Renaissance Florence]]. According to [[Ferdinand Gregorovius]], the tomb is "at once the [[sepulchre]] of the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]] in the church and the last [[list of extant papal tombs|papal tomb]] which is outside Rome itself".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossa had a long history of cooperation with Florence, which had viewed him as the legitimate pontiff for a time during the [[Western Schism]]. The tomb monument is often interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the legitimacy of Cossa's pontificate by linking him to the spiritually powerful site of the Baptistry.&lt;ref name="Lightbown 1980, p. 107"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 16l; Caplow, 1977, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The evocation of papal symbolism on the tomb and the linkage between Cossa and Florence have been interpreted as a snub to Cossa's successor [[Pope Martin V]]&lt;ref name="Lightbown 1980, p. 107"/&gt; or vicarious "[[Medici]] self-promotion", as such a tomb would have been deemed unacceptable for a Florentine citizen.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 156; Strocchia, 1992, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb monument's design included figures of the [[Theological virtues|three Virtues]] in [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s, Cossa's [[Coat of arms|family arms]], a gilded bronze [[effigy|recumbent effigy]] laid out above an inscription-bearing [[sarcophagus]] supported on corbel brackets, and above it a [[Madonna and Child]] in a [[Lunette|half-lunette]], with a [[Baldachin|canopy]] over all. At the time of its completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence,&lt;ref name="l26"/&gt; and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo.&lt;ref name="l24"/&gt; The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by [[art historian]]s, as have the interpretations of its design and [[iconography]].

==Antipope John XXIII==
[[Image:Johannes XXIII Gegenpapst.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antipope John XXIII]]
{{main|Antipope John XXIII}}
Antipope John XXIII had a complicated life, legacy, and relationship with the city of Florence. Baldassare Cossa was a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] nobleman who grew up in [[Bologna]]. [[Pope Boniface IX]] elevated Cossa to the [[Archdiocese of Bologna]] in 1396 and made him a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1402. After the [[Council of Pisa]] in 1409, Cossa encouraged rebellion against [[Pope Gregory XII]], who refused to resign. Cossa was deprived of his cardinalate, but it was restored by [[Antipope Alexander V]], who had been elected by the council.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 4; Caplow, 1977, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossa succeeded Alexander V as John XXIII in 1410. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by France, England, [[Bohemia]], [[Prussia]], [[Portugal]], parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and [[Venice]]; however, the [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] was regarded as pope by the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Kingdoms of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and Gregory XII was still favored by [[Ladislaus of Naples]], [[Carlo I Malatesta]], the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|princes of Bavaria]], [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]], [[Elector of the Palatinate]], and parts of Germany and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome in 1413, John XXIII was forced to flee to Florence. He was compelled by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], to convoke the [[Council of Constance]] in 1414, although when the threat to his pontificate and possibly his person became apparent, he fled in 1415. Although he expected his departure would disperse the council, the members of which he called to join him under the protection of [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]], it continued to operate where they were. As John XXIII tried to make his way towards the territory of [[John the Fearless|John II]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], Frederick IV surrendered him to the custody of Sigismund and the Council, and he was imprisoned by Louis III.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the Council deposed John XXIII on May 29, 1415 and elected [[Pope Martin V]] on November 11, 1417; Martin V proceeded to Florence in February 1419.&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 137; Lightbown, 1980, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Cossa was ransomed by the [[Republic of Florence]] in 1419 (Louis III had abandoned the allegiance of Sigismund in 1417), as orchestrated by [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; His ransom may have been a reward for past assistance to Florence, or a manoeuvre to put pressure on Martin V (still in Florence; he would arrive in Rome in September 1420), or both.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Cossa had helped Florence conquer [[Pisa]] in 1405 in his capacity as [[Papal legate]] to Bologna and, as pope, had designated the [[Medici bank]] as the depository-general for the papal finances.&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florence, Cossa submitted to Martin V on June 14, 1419 and was rewarded with a cardinal's hat on June 26, only to die on December 22.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Although given the title of Cardinal Bishop of [[Tusculum]], Cossa called himself "Cardinal of Florence".&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral===
Cossa's body was moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as prescribed by the ''Ordo Romanus'', was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white [[mitre]] with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, pp. 154–5; Strocchia, 1992, p. 138; Lightbown, 1980, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioning==
[[Image:Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]], one of the executors of Cossa's will]]
The commissioning of Cossa's tomb monument was negotiated for about a decade following Cossa's death. Cossa's [[will (law)|last will and testament]]—written on his death bed on December 22, 1419—made several of the customary Florentine civic bequests, acts of charity, and traditional ecclesiastical courtesies, but the bulk of his estate was left to his nephews Michele and Giovanni.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The bequests to his nephews took priority, and his estate remained disputed by various creditors while the tomb was being completed.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossa designated four prominent Florentines as his [[executor]]s: Bartolommeo di Taldo Valori, Niccolò da Uzzano, [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]], and Vieri Guadagni,&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing any two of the executors to act on behalf of all four, as Valori and Medici appear to have done.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Valori died on September 2, 1427, by which time Guadagni was also deceased and Uzzano had long lost interest, leaving the remaining work of commissioning entirely to Giovanni, or—more likely—[[Cosimo de' Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The executors claimed that Cossa had revealed his desire for burial in the Baptistry to them but had been too modest to request it in his will.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Most later scholars accept this testimony of the executors, attributing Cossa with "tact—and tactics", although at least one has postulated that the executors chose the site of the Baptistry against Cossa's wishes.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FlorenceMuseodellOperaBaptistFinger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cossa willed a relic, believed to be the right [[index finger]] of [[John the Baptist]], to the Baptistry (''reliquary pictured'')]]

Documentary records indicate that, on January 9, 1421, [[Palla Strozzi]], on behalf of the [[Arte di Calimala]], the [[guild]] who were responsible for the upkeep of the Baptistry, authorized a "''breve et honestissima''" ("small and inconspicuous") monument in the Baptistry, but not the chapel requested by Cossa's will; present scholarship accepts Strozzi's assertion that burial within the Baptistry was a considerable honor, perhaps beyond the status of Cossa.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 59; Caplow, 1977, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; After this meeting, there are no extant records from the Calimala regarding the tomb as the bulk of documents from the 1420s have been lost,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; although the notes of Senatore [[Carlo Strozzi]], who went through the records, are extant.&lt;ref name="Lightbown"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Calimala's acquiescence is traditionally explained by Cossa's donation of the [[relic]] of the right [[index finger]] of [[John the Baptist]] (and 200&amp;nbsp;[[Italian coin florin|florins]] for an appropriate [[reliquary]]) to the Baptistry.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 101–102; Strocchia, 1992, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; With this finger John was believed to have pointed to Jesus, saying "[[Agnus Dei|Ecce Agnus Dei]]" ("Behold the lamb of God") in {{bibleverse||John|1:29|KJV}}. The long and complicated history of the relic would only have increased the legendary status of the finger: [[Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople|Philotheus Kokkinos]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] presented it in 1363 to [[Pope Urban V]], who passed it to his successors [[Pope Gregory XI|Gregory XI]] and [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]], who was dispossessed of it during the siege of [[Nocera Inferiore|Nocera]], after which John XXIII bought it for 800&amp;nbsp;florins and wore it on his person before hiding it in the monastery of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence|Santa Maria degli Angeli]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion==
[[Image:Sangiovennniinner.jpg|thumb|The Tomb was designed to integrate with the interior of the [[Florence Baptistry]].]]
The chronology of the tomb monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine [[Civil law notary|notary]], in 1424 (by the [[Florentine calendar]]) part of the tomb was installed.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelozzo's ''[[Catasto]]'' from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner for about two years ("''due anni o incircha''") and that three-fourths of the 800&amp;nbsp;florin budget had been spent.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 105–108; Grassi, 1964, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1964, pp. 59–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici requested 400 of the 800&amp;nbsp;florins that had been deposited with the [[Arte dei Mercatanti o di Calimala|Calimala]], likely for work already completed.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, as it had been obliged to with the finger reliquary.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_2"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, [[Vasari]]'s claim in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Vite]]'' of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, ''Vite'', ed. Milanesi, ii, 1878, p. 399. Cited by Caplow, 1977, p. 106; McHam, 1989, p. 156; Lightbown, 1980, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that the sarcophagus was installed on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains to say a daily mass for Cossa's soul.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_2"/&gt; The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 59; Caplow, 1977, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of completion is unknown but an extreme ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus ante quem]]'' is given by the death in 1431 of Pope Martin V, who is known to have visited the completed tomb; other factors may push the ''terminus ante quem'' back significantly into the 1420s.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 116–119; McHam, 1989, p. 157; Strocchia, 1992, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The most reliable such indication is that in September 1428 [[Jacopo della Quercia]] returned to Bologna and produced a wall tomb with [[Virtues]] reflecting in minute details the Cossa Virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari suggests that the tomb went over budget, costing 1,000&amp;nbsp;florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 116; Lightbown, 1980, p. 23. This claim is also made by Del Migliore, 1684, ''Firenze città nobilissima''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original source for this claim is unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500&amp;nbsp;florins,&lt;ref name="Janson-1963"&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; yet its exactness may be taken with a [[grain of salt]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Image:Interior of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Venice) - Monumento del doge Tommaso Mocenigo - Pietro Lamberti e Giovanni di Martino da Fiesole.jpg|thumb|The closely contemporary Venetian tomb of [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Tommaso Mocenigo]], of 1423.]]
The Baptistry already contained three [[sarcophagi]]: those of Bishop Ranieri (d. 1113) and two reused Roman sarcophagi.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 16, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tomb monument at {{convert|7.32|m|ft|2}} in height was easily the tallest monument in the Baptistry, and—at the time—in Florence.&lt;ref name="l26"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] contains few tombs, with some notable exceptions, such as that of Aldobrandino Ottobuoni.&lt;ref name="l24"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb monument adapted to the conditions imposed by the Calimala and integrated with the interior of the Baptistry. The [[wall tomb]] was required to be placed between two existing [[Corinthian order|Corinthian column]]s—those between [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]]'s North Doors and the western tribune—constituting one-third of one of the octagonal walls, near the altar and facing Ghiberti's East Doors.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 120; Lightbown, 1980, p. 24; McHam, "Donatello's Tomb of Pope John XXIII", p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The setting starves the tomb monument of light, especially when the Baptistry's doors are closed, which is normally the case.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be even darker were it not for the "screen" back wall protruding {{convert|48.4|cm|in|1}} from the Baptistry wall.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The white and brown (and whitish-brown) marble further integrates the structure with the [[polychromatic]] white and green of the Baptistry interior.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 149; Lightbown, 1980, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars accept the colored sketch of Buonaccorso Ghirberti as evidence that the "original effaced polychromy" of the tomb was more integrated,&lt;ref name="Janson"/&gt; although others contend that the sketch is too inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The canopy's interaction with the columns and [[conceit]] of being supported by the Baptistry cornice make the tomb monument further "wedded to the architecture" around it, even if the marriage is [[morganatic]].&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the effigy on the sarcophagus, all the other sculpted figures are in [[high relief]].

Although the style of the work is thoroughly classicising, the overall form reflects the grandest type of the medieval Italian wall tomb, in which the vertical piling-up of a series of different elements is characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 1996, pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Gothic sculpture always retained considerable elements of classicism, and it was not necessary for Donatello and Michelozzo to adopt a radically original overall scheme from those of [[Tino di Camaino]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1285–1337), the [[Siena|Siennese]] sculptor whose wall-tombs of a century before had been very influential throughout Italy.  A life-size marble effigy lying on top of an elevated protruding sarcophagus is highly typical.  The motif of curtains at the top is often found in monuments using Gothic decorative details, and the shape recalls the triangular [[gable]] tops of monuments in a more thoroughly Gothic style; other monuments have curtains, often held open by angels, around the effigy, and then sculptures above.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, pp. 15–19 and 183–186.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cossa monument is often compared to the monument to [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Tommaso Mocenigo]] of Venice, of 1423, which has high relief saints in shell niches on and above the sarcophagus, above which a large pair of curtains sweep up to a single terminal; however the architectural detailing here is Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 46 and fig. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the Cossa tomb itself was elaborated on, and adapted to local conventions, in the tomb by the same team for Cardinal Brancacci in Naples,&lt;ref&gt;John T. Paoletti, Gary M. Radke; ''Art in Renaissance Italy'', 2005, pp. 242–243, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85669-439-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced the monument to [[Leonardo Bruni]] by [[Bernardo Rossellino]], of about 20&amp;nbsp;years later, in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]; ''Early Renaissance'', p. 57-59, 1967, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Base===
The base slab, or [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]], of the tomb monument rests on a {{convert|38|cm|in|0|sing=on}} high [[plinth]], separated by a [[cornice]] and [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] [[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]s. The pylon is {{convert|1.39|m|ft|2}} high and {{convert|2.02|m|ft|2}} wide, decorated with a [[frieze]] of winged angel heads (perhaps [[seraphim]]) and [[Garland (decoration)|garland]]s and ribbons.&lt;ref name="l26"/&gt;

===Virtues===
[[File:Tomba dell'antipapa giovanni xxiii, 02.JPG|thumb|Virtues by Michelozzo]]
Above the pylon, separated by the cornice, are the [[theological virtues|three Virtues]]—from left to right, [[Faith]], [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], and [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]]—in shell niches, separated by four [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster|fluted pilasters]]. Such a motif is unprecedented in [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] funerary sculpture but found at this date in [[Venice]], [[Padua]],&lt;ref name="Janson-1963"/&gt; and especially Cossa's native [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janson suggests that one "need not go all the way to Venice" to find such motifs.&lt;ref name="Janson-1963"/&gt; Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the [[cardinal Virtues]] used for [[laymen]], and the [[theological virtues]] reserved for ecclesiastics, including the [[Brancaccio]] tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the [[Siena Cathedral#Baptistry|Siena Baptistry]], whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|1.05|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tall Faith, to the right of Charity, is holding a [[Eucharist]]ic [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]; the {{convert|1.07|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tall Charity is holding a [[cornucopia]] and a [[brazier]] (or flaming vase); and the {{convert|1.06|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_3"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of [[Abundantia]], [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 133; Lightbown, 1980, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the "immediacy" of the trope of [[lying in state]], which was otherwise dominant on [[Quattrocento]] wall tombs.&lt;ref name="McHam"&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarcophagus and inscription===
Above the Virtues, four classical [[Corbel|consoles]] decorated with [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves support the sarcophagus. In the [[Triptych|tripartite]] space between the consoles—from left to right—are Cossa's family arms with the [[papal tiara]], the papal [[coat of arms]], and Cossa's family arms with the cardinal's hat.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''rilievo schiacciato'' (a type of very shallow [[bas-relief]] pioneered by Donatello) on the [[architrave]] sarcophagus ({{convert|2.12|m|ft|2|sing=on}} wide and {{convert|0.7|m|ft|2|sing=on}} high) depicts two [[putto|putti]] or spiratelli ("little spirits") holding open a large inscribed [[parchment]], perhaps in the style of a [[papal brief]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The putti (or spiratelli) share many characteristics with their ancient counterparts, except for their crossed legs.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-start}}
{{col-2}}
The inscription reads:&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980"/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{{lang|la|IOAN''n''ES QVO''n''DAM PAPA&lt;br&gt;
XXIII''us''. OBIIT FLORENTIE A&lt;br&gt;
N''n''O D''omi''NI MCCCCXVIIII XI&lt;br&gt;
KALENDAS IANVARII}}
&lt;/center&gt;
{{col-2}}
Which translates to:
&lt;center&gt;
John the former pope&lt;br&gt;
XXIII. Died in Florence&lt;br&gt;
A.D. 1419, on 11th&lt;br&gt;
day before the Calends of January
&lt;/center&gt;
{{col-end}}
[[Image:Marzocco di donatello.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The ''Marzocco'' was a symbol of Florentine rule.]]
Pope Martin V objected to a portion of the inscription—"{{lang|la|IOAN''n''ES QVO''n''DAM PAPA}}"—because he thought it implied Cossa had died as pope (the [[Latin]] "{{lang|la|quondam}}" could mean either "the former" or "the late"). The use of "olim Papa", as was common in many contemporary documents, instead of "quondam Papa" would probably have removed Martin V's objections.&lt;ref name="Lightbown"/&gt; Martin himself suggested instead that Cossa be identified as a Neapolitan cardinal, thus emphasizing instead his submission.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 105; McHam, 1989, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary sources report that the [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] mimicked the reply of [[Pontius Pilate]] regarding the inscription on the cross of Christ: "What is written, is written."&lt;ref name="McHam-1989"&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin V himself was buried underneath an undecorated bronze floor slab,&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; the only known example of a two-dimensional papal monument,&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 1964, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; although also the first to be set in the central nave of a major basilica, the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, 1992, p. 62; Lightbown, 1980, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and cast in bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 1904, p. 76; Lightbown, 1980, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Avery, Donatello's ''Ascension of Christ and the Giving of the Keys to St. Peter'' may have been intended to share the front of the sarcophagus,&lt;ref&gt;Avery, 1994, pp. 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt; further strengthening the papal associations, which were created by dating Cossa's death using the ancient Roman [[Calends]] of January, which was uncommon on Florentine tombs, but was used in papal ones.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effigy===
On top of the sarcophagus, the [[bier]] of the effigy is supported by lions whose shape mimics [[Trecento]] consoles.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The lions may be based on the Florentine ''[[:it:Marzocco (simbolo)|Marzocco]]'', as if to mark John XXIII in the same manner as a conquered city-state. As Donatello's ''Marzocco'' for the papal apartment in [[Santa Maria Novella]] conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous,&lt;ref name="McHam-1989"/&gt; and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.&amp;nbsp;1342) in the [[Bargello]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomba dell'antipapa giovanni xxiii, 13.JPG|thumb|The sarcopagus with the antipope ''gisant'']]
The bier and the pall spread over it are tilted towards the viewer with the lion supporting the head standing {{convert|2|cm|in|0|sing=on}} shorter, increasing the visibility of the [[effigy]], especially the head.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 1904, p. 63; Lightbown, 1980, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gilding|gilded-bronze]], life-size effigy itself makes no attempt to argue for Cossa's papal status, dressing Cossa clearly in the costume of a cardinal;&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 43; McHam, 1989, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; the bedding it rests on is of un-gilt bronze.  The opening in the 16th century of the sarcophagus confirmed that Cossa's actual burial clothes matched the effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no precedent for a three-dimensional gilded-bronze effigy on an Italian tomb monument; there was, however, a {{convert|6|ft|m|2|sing=on}} gilt bronze statue on the balcony of the Palazzo della Briada in Bologna commissioned by [[Pope Boniface VIII]].&lt;ref name="McHam-1989"/&gt;

Some scholars suggest that Donatello created the effigy with the aid of a [[death mask]],&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 44; Grassi, 1965, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; but others disagree.&lt;ref name="Janson-1963_2"&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canopy===
Behind the effigy is a {{convert|1.34|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tripartite pylon with sunk molded borders supporting the cornice and framed by two additional Corinthian pilasters. Above it rests an [[entablature]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] on a [[Lunette|half-lunette]], a typical—symbolizing intercession—motif for a tomb.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 149, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Above the effigy and Madonna is a gilt-edged architectonic canopy decorated with patterned stemmed flowers, giving the [[conceit]] of being supported by the ribbed brass ring, an impossibility given its weight. McHam&lt;ref name="McHam"/&gt; suggests that the canopy is based on the "Dome of Heaven", and thus the ''[[Baldachin|baldacchino]]'' of papal enthronement. However, Lightbown&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; is emphatic that the double-summited canopy looped against the pillars is not a baldacchino, but rather a secular bed-canopy.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
{{main|Donatello|Michelozzo}}
[[Image:Prato, duomo pulpito di donatello e michelozzo.JPG|thumb|upright|The external pulpit for the [[Prato Cathedral|Duomo of Prato]], another collaboration of Donatello and Michelozzo]]
The tomb monument was the first collaboration between [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]], who went on to collaborate on the [[tomb of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci]] in the Church of [[Sant'Angelo a Nilo]] in Naples, the tomb of [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Papal Secretary]] Bartolomeo Aragazzi in what is now the [[Duomo]] of [[Montepulciano]], and the external pulpit of the [[Prato Cathedral|Duomo of Prato]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of their partnership, Donatello was already well known for his statues of prophets and saints for the Duomo and [[Orsanmichele]], while Michelozzo was more obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Both had worked for a time for Ghiberti, whose workshop then led Florentine sculpture.

Nearly every element of the tomb monument has been attributed to both Donatello and Michelozzo by different [[art history|art historians]].&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 122–140; Janson, 1963, pp. 63–64; Lightbown, 1980, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These characterizations are mostly of [[historiography|historiographical]] interest: attribution to Donatello is more of an indication of what is valued by each commentator than any objective criteria; often, aspects are attributed to Michelozzo explicitly because they are "less well executed".&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_3"/&gt;

Descriptions from 1475 to 1568 attribute all of the tomb except for the figure of Faith to Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern sources reverse this dichotomy, attributing all of the tomb to Michelozzo with the exception of the gilded bronze effigy.&lt;ref name="McHam"/&gt; Some sources credit Donatello only with the bronze effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Grassi, 1964, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Janson, of the marble work, only the ''[[putto|putti]]'' can be attributed to "Donatello's own hand".&lt;ref name="Janson-1963_2"/&gt; Donatello's alleged deficiencies in casting or in architecture have been proposed as the reason for his partnership with Michelozzo,&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, pp. 50–56, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to his busy schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1731">There are numerous active artist-run initiatives (ARIs) in the [[United Kingdom]], often working around and critiquing the functioning of larger art institutions and organisations. An ARI is a project independently run by visual artists which generally showcases the work of local and emerging artists; many exist on low budgets and are managed by artist collectives. In the UK, ARIs tend to be smaller and less permanent than public and municipal organisations and can, for example, become established for the duration of an event or for the period of a lease on a property. 

Most ARIs in the UK are funded by the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]], the national development agency for the arts in the UK, distributing public money from Government and the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]].

City Racing: The Life and Times of an Artist-Run Gallery, published in 2002 is a revealing account by the artists, of a ten-year-long ARI based in London from 1988-1998

[[File:Keilberg 110429 ama fec(22).jpg |thumb|upright|A ''Buckelbergwerk'' with its doors opened and set up in the [[Keilberg (Schneeberg)|Keilberghaus]] near [[Schneeberg (Ore Mountains)|Schneeberg]].]]

A '''Weihnachtsberg''' is a decorative, mountain-like model of the landscape of the [[Ore Mountains]] (between [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]]), which is set up indoors during the [[Christmas]] period. It portrays the [[nativity scene]] and [[mining|mining motifs]] as well as local themes. The figures and objects are often movable and mechanically driven.

The Weihnachtsberg has its origins in the so-called ''Buckelbergwerk'' models of the 18th century, which only had mining subjects. In the 19th century, Christmas scenes were added.
