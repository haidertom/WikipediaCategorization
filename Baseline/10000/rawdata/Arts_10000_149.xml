'''Albert Bernard Feldstein''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛ|l|d|s|t|iː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZpF3RhRxl0 "The Artists of EC Comics"]&lt;!--at 3:35--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; October 24, 1925 – April 29, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] writer, editor, and artist, best known for his work at [[EC Comics]] and, from 1956 to 1985, as the editor of the [[satire|satirical]] magazine ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''. After retiring from ''Mad'', Feldstein concentrated on [[Visual arts of the United States|American paintings]] of Western wildlife.&lt;ref name=vanhollebeke&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canovan.com/Artwork/AlInterview.htm |title=Interview with Al Feldstein |author=VanHollebeke, Jim |origyear=1999 |year=2002 |work= |publisher=Canovanograms |accessdate=10 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222111655/http://www.canovan.com/Artwork/AlInterview.htm |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dlugos/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Al Feldstein was born October 24, 1925, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to a [[Jewish]] household.&lt;ref&gt;https://13thdimension.com/the-13-most-influential-jewish-creators-and-execs-part-3/&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of Max, who made dental molds, and Beatrice Feldstein.&lt;ref name=weber /&gt; After winning an award in the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] poster contest, he decided on a career in the art field and studied at the [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts|High School of Music and Art]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=weber /&gt; 

==Career==
While in high school, he was hired by [[Jerry Iger]] to work in the [[Eisner &amp; Iger|S. M. Iger Studio]],&lt;ref name=dlugos /&gt; a packager of comic-book stories supplying outsourced content to publishers entering the new medium. He recalled,
{{quote|...running errands, erasing pages and doing general gofer work after school for three dollars a week (later raised to five...then twelve over the Summer, full time!). ... It was there (at the Iger Studio) that I began to learn to do comic-book art — first, by inking backgrounds, then penciling and inking backgrounds, then inking figures penciled by others, then penciling and inking figures, and finally doing whole pages from beginning to end.&lt;ref name=dlugos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classic-horror.com/newsreel/al_feldstein_interview |title=Al Feldstein Interview |author=Dlugos, Jenn |year=2003 |work= |publisher=Classic-Horror.com |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226081932/http://classic-horror.com/newsreel/al_feldstein_interview |archivedate=December 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His earliest background art was for ''[[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]]''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

After graduating from high school he attended the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]].&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; Feldstein freelanced art for comic books, including [[Fox Comics]]. Feldstein recalled that Bob Farrell, whom he considered a "wheeler-dealer" driving a convertible Cadillac, introduced him to [[Fox Publications#Victor Fox|Victor Fox]] in return for a commission from all payments Fox made to him. Feldstein rewrote Farrell's scripts for Fox and produced the art for the stories. He described Fox as the "typical exploiting comic book publisher of his day, grinding out shameless imitations of successful titles and trends" and mistreating his writers and artists.&lt;ref name=ComicArtVille&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicartville.com/victorfox.htm |title=The Weird Wonder(ous) World of Victor Fox's Fantastic Mystery Men |author=Berk, Jon |year=2004 |work= |publisher=Comicartville.com |accessdate=January 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qyaYxmNI?url=http://www.comicartville.com/victorfox.htm |archivedate=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertham&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wertham.webs.com/history/fox.html |title=Who was Victor S. Fox? |author=Wertham, Fredric |year=2008 |work= |publisher=From the Desk of Dr. Wertham |accessdate=10 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061240/http://wertham.webs.com/history/fox.html |archivedate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldstein wrote, drew and packaged the complete ''Junior'' and ''Sunny'' books for Fox, and produced a comic book adaptation of ''[[Meet Corliss Archer]]''. Warned by his letterer Jim Wroten to be cautious about payments from Victor Fox, who'd "gotten himself into financial trouble", Feldstein approached [[Bill Gaines]], who'd just taken over as EC Comics publisher following his father's death in a speedboat crash. Feldstein's initial EC assignment was drawing a teenage book, the beginning of a long working relationship with Gaines.&lt;ref name=ComicArtVille/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertham/&gt;

===EC Comics===
Arriving at EC in 1948, Feldstein began as an artist, but he soon combined art with writing, eventually editing most of the EC titles. Although he originally wrote and illustrated approximately one story per comic, in addition to doing many covers, Feldstein finally focused on editing and writing, reserving his artwork primarily for covers. From late 1950 through 1953, he edited and wrote stories for seven EC titles.

As EC's editor, Feldstein created a literate line, balancing his genre tales with potent graphic stories probing the underbelly of American life. In creating stories around such topics as racial prejudice, rape, domestic violence, police brutality, drug addiction and child abuse, he succeeded in addressing problems and issues which the 1950s radio, motion picture and television industries were too timid to dramatize.&lt;ref name=dlugos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hajdu&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ten-Cent Plague |last=Hajdu |first=David |authorlink=David Hajdu |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |isbn=0-312-42823-5 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4dWeMZLTXScC&amp;dq=The+Ten-Cent+Plague |accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While developing a stable of contributing writers that included [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]], [[Otto Binder]], [[Daniel Keyes]], [[Jack Oleck]] and [[Carl Wessler]], he published the first work of [[Harlan Ellison]]. EC employed the comics industry's finest artists and published promotional copy to make readers aware of their staff. Feldstein encouraged the EC illustrators to maintain their personal art styles, and this emphasis on individuality gave the EC line a unique appearance. Distinctive front cover designs framing those recognizable art styles made Feldstein's titles easy to spot on crowded newsstands.&lt;ref name=vanhollebeke/&gt;

Those comic books, known as EC's ''[[List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Trend|New Trend]]'' group, included ''[[Weird Science (comics)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[Weird Fantasy]]'', ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'', ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'', ''[[Shock SuspenStories]]'', ''[[Crime SuspenStories]]'', ''[[Panic (comics)|Panic]]'' and ''[[Piracy (comics)|Piracy]]''. After the New Trend titles folded in 1955, Feldstein edited EC's short-lived [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Direction|New Direction]] line, followed by EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] magazines.&lt;ref name=vanhollebeke/&gt;

===''Mad''===
[[File:Craig Fischer, Al Feldstein and Ben Towle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Feldstein, center, at the 2008 Heroes Con]]After industry and government pressures forced Gaines to shut down most of his EC titles, Feldstein was briefly separated from the company.  But when [[Harvey Kurtzman]] left ''Mad'' in 1956, Gaines turned to his former editor. Feldstein spent the next 29 years at the helm of what became one of the nation's leading and most influential magazines. It is unclear what the circulation of the magazine was when Feldstein took over but it is estimated to be between 325,000 and 750,000. By the 1960s, it had increased to over a million, and by the 1970s, it had doubled to two million.&lt;ref name=weber/&gt; Circulation multiplied more than eight times during Feldstein's tenure, peaking at 2,850,000 for an issue in 1974 (and an average of 2.1 million for that year), although it declined to a third of that figure by the end of his time as editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/slaubau/madcirc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315224710/http://users.ipfw.edu/slaubau/madcirc.htm |archivedate=2017-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanhollebeke/&gt;&lt;ref name=dlugos/&gt;

Feldstein has been credited with giving the magazine the personality of a "smart-alecky, sniggering and indisputably clever spitball-shooter."&lt;ref name=weber/&gt;

Many new cartoonists and writers surfaced during the early years of Feldstein's editorship. This process leveled off in the 1960s as the magazine came to rely on a steady group of contributors. Feldstein's first issue as editor (#29) was also the first issue to display the twisted work of cartoonist [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]]. The following issue, #30, marked the debuts of longtime cover artist [[Norman Mingo]] and artist [[Bob Clarke (illustrator)|Bob Clarke]].  [[Kelly Freas]] first appeared in issue #31.  Issue #32 brought artists [[Mort Drucker]], [[George Woodbridge]] and [[Joe Orlando]], while issue #33 introduced readers to writers [[Frank Jacobs]] and [[Tom Koch]]. [[Al Jaffee]], who had appeared in four of editor Kurtzman's last issues before leaving with him, returned just a year and a half later.  [[Larry Siegel]] and [[Arnie Kogen]] began writing for the magazine in 1958-59.  By the end of 1962, with the additions of [[Antonio Prohías]], [[Paul Coker Jr.]], [[Jack Rickard]], [[Don Edwing]], [[Dick DeBartolo]], [[Stan Hart]], [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]] and [[Lou Silverstone]], he had fully established both the format and the talent pool that kept the magazine a commercial success for decades.&lt;ref name=vanhollebeke/&gt;

===Retirement===
[[File:Motherspridefeldstein.jpg|thumb|250px|''Mother's Pride'' by Al Feldstein]]
After he retired from ''Mad'' in 1984, Feldstein began painting again after his son, Mark Feldstein, gave him his first oil paint set since pre-''Mad''.&lt;!--Following is an uncited quote:, commenting, "Since my retirement, I have returned to my first love, fine art. I do landscapes, wildlife and Western paintings. I also do 'cover-revisited' paintings of my old EC science-fiction, horror and crime covers for collectors."--&gt; He left [[Connecticut]] and relocated in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], where he spent three years painting the [[Teton Range]] and its wildlife.&lt;ref name=dlugos/&gt; Two of his paintings from that period placed in the Top 100 of Arts for the Parks, a competition created in 1986 by the National Park Academy of the Arts.&lt;ref name="HFA-Montana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houseoffineart.com/gallery/alfeldstein_bio.htm |title=Al Feldstein Biography |author= |date= |work=Gallery Artists |publisher=House of Fine Art, Montana |accessdate=10 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldstein moved in 1992 to [[Paradise Valley, Montana|Paradise Valley]], [[Montana]], near [[Livingston, Montana|Livingston]], finding new approaches to depict the Western way of life in his [[acrylic paint]]ings. In 1999, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts degree by [[Rocky Mountain College]] in [[Billings, Montana]], and that year again ranked in the Top 100 of the Arts for the Parks' Competition. He is represented by numerous Northwest galleries, and he continued to create his Western, wildlife and landscape paintings at his &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;270&amp;nbsp;acre&amp;nbsp;(1.1&amp;nbsp;km²)&lt;/span&gt; ranch south of Livingston and north of [[Yellowstone National Park]].&lt;ref name="HFA-Montana"/&gt;

In 2000, he was invited to give the Commencement Address to the new century's first graduating class at [[Rocky Mountain College]].&lt;ref name="HFA-Montana"/&gt;

He was inducted into the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame]] in 2003.

In 2011, he received the [[Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement]] from the [[Horror Writers Association]].&lt;ref name="HWA"&gt;(March 24, 2011), "[http://hellnotes.com/datlow-feldstein-win-lifetime-horror-award/ Datlow, Feldstein Win Lifetime Horror Award] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122154053/http://hellnotes.com/datlow-feldstein-win-lifetime-horror-award/ |date=November 22, 2016 }}," Hell Notes. Retrieved November 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldstein died on April 29, 2014 at his home in Paradise Valley, Montana, near Livingston.&lt;ref name=weber&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber|first=Bruce|title=Al Feldstein, the Soul of Mad Magazine, Dies at 88|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/business/media/soul-of-mad-magazine-al-feldstein-dies-at-88.html?ref=obituaries|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502112759/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/business/media/soul-of-mad-magazine-al-feldstein-dies-at-88.html?ref=obituaries|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No cause of death was released.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Matthew|title=Al Feldstein, Who Headed Mad Magazine, Dies|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/al-feldstein-headed-mad-magazine-dies-23536255|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Associated Press|date=30 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501110752/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/al-feldstein-headed-mad-magazine-dies-23536255 |archivedate=1 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American News Company''' was a magazine, newspaper, book, and comic book distribution company founded in 1864&lt;ref&gt;"Patrick Farrelly," ''The Publishers' Weekly'' (April 30, 1904).&lt;/ref&gt; by Sinclair Tousey,&lt;ref&gt;"DEATH OF SINCLAIR TOUSEY, MANY WHO FOUNDED AMERICAN NEWS[sic], 'New York Times'' (June 17, 1887).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Record of Current Events", ''The American Monthly Review of Reviews'' (August 1910), pp 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; which dominated the distribution market in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The company's abrupt 1957 demise caused a huge shakeup in the publishing industry, forcing many magazine, comic book, and paperback publishers out of business.

==Early years==
The American News Company had its roots in two New York City newspaper and periodical wholesaling firms: Sinclair Tousey's company on Nassau St., and the firm Dexter, Hamilton &amp; Co. at 22 Ann St. These were the two largest news and periodical wholesalers in New York City at the time of their merger on Feb. 1, 1864, when American News Company was formed. The seven original partners were Sinclair Tousey, John E. Tousey, Harry Dexter, George Dexter, John Hamilton, Patrick Farrelly, and Solomon W. Johnson. These partners formed the core of the company's management until the death of the last surviving partner, Solomon Johnson, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;"Solomon Johnson Dead," ''The American Stationer'', Jan. 25, 1913, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair Tousey was the company's first president, followed after his death by Harry Dexter, who was succeeded by Solomon Johnson.

The company's Boston branch was formed by taking over the wholesale periodical business of Boston bookseller Alexander Williams. In 1854, Williams had bought out the business of [[William Pembroke Fetridge|Fetridge &amp; Co.]], which operated on the corner of State St. and Washington a large magazine store known as the Periodical Depot or the Periodical Arcade.&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander Williams", ''Publishers' Weekly'', January 20, 1900, p.61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams worked up an extensive trade as a jobber of newspapers and periodicals to out of town dealers all over the East Coast, and by the time ANC was organized the wholesale side of the business had grown too large for Williams to handle alone. Along with two smaller competing firms, Dyer &amp; Co. and Federhen &amp; Co.,&lt;ref&gt;"Boston Notes", ''New England Stationer and Printer'', January 1900, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the Boston trade was reorganized as a subsidiary of American News under the name New England News Company, with Williams as one of the principal shareholders. Initially an officer of the new corporation, Williams was a bookstore proprietor at heart and left soon afterward in 1869 to take over the famous "[[Old Corner Bookstore]]".&lt;ref&gt;"A Change at the "Old Corner"", ''Publishers' Weekly'', April 14, 1883, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the company formed it added to its newspaper and magazine business a book jobbing department, under the supervision of a Mr. Dunham; this grew to be one of the largest in the country.

With the end of the Civil War, the firm grew rapidly along the expanding railroads as they opened up the West, with the commencement of coast-to-coast continental rail service in 1869. Legislation passed by Congress required the railroads to transport newspapers and periodicals as second class bulk mail at a special low subsidized rate—one cent per pound for any distance between news agencies, so that a bundle of New York newspapers could be sent across the continent to Los Angeles for the same price that it could be shipped across the river to Newark—and ANC exploited the availability of cheap rail transport to expand their distribution network across the continent, so far ahead of the competition that they effectively shut any possible rivals out of the market, establishing their periodical depots by the hundreds in every city and large town on the rail system. At the same time, the number of periodicals being published in America was exploding: [[Frank Luther Mott|Frank Mott]], in ''A History of American Magazines'', estimates that the number of titles being published boomed from 700 at the end of the Civil War to 3300 in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, Frank L. ''A History of American Magazines, 1865-1885'' (Harvard Univ. Press, 1938), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, an article in ''The American Newsman'' summed up the company's success: "It is as the keeper of a thousand secrets involving the fortunes of publishers and authors that the American News Company surrounds its vast and intricate system with an atmosphere of mystery, so that few persons have any idea of its really astounding proportions. It has gradually absorbed the smaller organizations until it now embraces thirty-two powerful news companies, with an annual operating expense of $2,488,000 and an annual business of something like $18,000,000. This organization handles the bulk of the reading matter of the United States and supplies nearly nineteen thousand dealers."&lt;ref&gt;"The American News Company Up to Date," ''The American Newsman'', vol. 10, no. 11 (November 1893), p. 4-5. Unsigned article reprinted from ''The New York Herald'', October 1, 1893, 3rd section, p. 6 (as "A Vast System of Distribution").&lt;/ref&gt;

On any given day, a hundred new issues of the thousands of titles ANC handled would typically be fed into the ANC distribution system. In New York City alone (at that time consisting solely of Manhattan and the Bronx) 125 wagons and drivers crisscrossed the city every day making deliveries, with 14 local neighborhood substations.

ANC employed directly in 1893 1,154 people, with a weekly payroll of $16,255; with $1 million in real estate holdings and $1.4 million in merchandise on hand. It extended extensive credit to the firms it did business with and $800,000 was due at any given time in accounts receivable from dealers around the country. It owned outright 18 buildings around the country and rented 39 more, and had $200,000 invested in horses and wagons. The branches of the company at this time were located in Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Montreal, Newark, New Orleans, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Providence, San Francisco, Springfield (Mass.), St. Louis, St. Paul, Toronto, Troy, and Washington D.C. These branches were organized as subsidiaries under different names, for example the Chicago branch was the Great Western News Company, founded in 1866. The International News Company, on Duane Street in New York, was the branch handling the company's extensive overseas business. A branch called the Union News Company existed solely to sell newspapers and magazines on the railroads, with 300 newsstands in railroad stations which by 1893 covered 40% of the entire US railroad system, paying $1000 a day for exclusive rights. Under this system, Union News could keep the ''Chicago Tribune'' out of the Chicago area train stations until the ''Tribune'' agreed to their terms. In 1958, the FTC found that Union News was operating nearly a thousand newsstands around the country (the next largest operator had 57), putting Union News in a position to dictate terms and demand rebates from publishers.

Typically, in the post-Civil War era, ANC in its position as the middleman between publishers and newsstand dealers would allow the newsstand dealers to keep between 5 and 10 cents on the sale of a 35-cent magazine like the monthly ''Harper's'', and three cents on a 10-cent magazine like ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.  Unsold copies of most titles were fully returnable, although some titles were sold to the dealers as non-returnable at a steeper discount, similar to today's "[[direct market|direct sale]]" comic book market.

American News's monopoly position in the market was virtually unchallenged until [[Frank Munsey]], frustrated by ANC's refusal to handle his cheap 10 cent pulp magazines, was forced to set up his own distribution, Red Star News.&lt;ref&gt;"The Red Star News Company", ''Munsey's Magazine'', December 1897, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of the so-called ID or independent distributors. Munsey balked when ANC informed him that 4 cents was the most they would pay wholesale for a magazine that sold for 10 cents retail, and Munsey retaliated by cutting out the middleman and setting up his own distributor to sell directly to newsdealers for 7 cents a copy.&lt;ref&gt;"Frank A. Munsey," ''Printers' Ink, March 20, 1907, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Munsey was followed in time by [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]], [[Fawcett Publications|Fawcett]], [[Curtis Publishing Company|Curtis]], [[Moe Annenberg|Annenberg]] and [[Harry Donenfeld|Donenfeld]], all constrained by various factors into setting up their own independent distribution networks outside the ANC monopoly; nonetheless ANC remained by far the dominant firm up until its collapse.

== Background ==
American News functioned both as a national distributor and as a local periodical wholesaler. After World War II, headed by Henry Garfinkle, the company had over 300 branches blanketing the United States, and employed several thousand employees. During the middle of the century, American News stood as the largest book wholesaler in the world, dominating the industry. It also had a near stranglehold on the distribution of magazines and newspapers within the United States market, dominating that industry as well. Listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], it had more than 5400 stockholders.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;[http://ny.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19681015_0000326.SNY.htm/qx "PERIODICAL DISTRIBS. v. AMERICAN NEWS CO.,"] UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (October 15, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[New Jersey]], American News also had offices in downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;The Park Place buildings were designed by female architect [[Fay Kellogg]]. See: [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/11/12/104882402.pdf "New York's Real Lure for Women -- Opportunity,"] ''The New York Times'' (November 12, 1911). Accessed May 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic book clients of American News included [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], [[Dell Comics]], and [[Toby Press]]. [[DC Comics|National Comics]] had its own distributor, [[Independent News Company]], and was able to take on distribution for other comic book publishers after American News failed. Comic book publishers who were not able to come to terms with National's distributors quickly went under, and others were limited in the number of titles they were allowed to distribute under the new arrangements—Atlas (later known as Marvel Comics) was rationed to eight titles a month. The change also affected paperback book publishers like Lion Library, which went out of business when Independent News (which was already distributing rival New American Library) refused to take it on. [[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] paperbacks, which had been founded as a subsidiary of ANC in 1941 in the early days of the paperback boom, managed to survive the crash and was taken over by Hearst.

Many magazines distributed in the 1940s were in [[pulp magazine|pulp]] format; by the end of 1955, nearly all had either ceased publication or switched to [[digest size|digest]] format. This change was largely the work of the refusal of American News and other distributors to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable.&lt;ref name=AshleyV3_88&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Ashley |authorlink= Mike Ashley (writer)| title=The History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 3 1946–1955| publisher=Contemporary Books, Inc| location=Chicago | year=1976|isbn=0-8092-7842-1 | page = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s boom in science fiction magazine publishing, with 30 new titles being launched, turned overnight into collapse with the failure of ANC. Other pulp fiction genres—western, romance, detective—suffered a similar extinction event. These sections of the magazine field were already in decline and it was simply not worth the effort to rescue already marginal magazine titles.

== Demise ==
In 1952, the government began antitrust litigation against ANC which was destined to drag on until the company's demise. Around 1955 major magazine publishers began disengaging themselves from ANC and making other arrangements for newsstand distribution.  When ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' and ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'', two of their biggest-selling titles, folded in January 1957, it came as a serious blow to ANC at a time when the company was already on financially shaky ground. In April [[Dell Publishing]] announced that they were pulling out and making other arrangements for their distribution.

The mammoth company's abrupt demise in June 1957 has been a source of speculation for decades. One theory is that a speculator became aware that a bookkeeping peculiarity in American News' accounts could allow a large profit from liquidating the company. He acquired control, and proceeded to sell off the assets, ultimately winding the company up.&lt;ref name=TM_191&gt;Michael Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was summarized in a 1960 lawsuit:
{{blockquote|In 1955 the defendant Henry Garfinkle and the members of his family acquired 11 per cent of the stock in the defendant American News Company. Soon thereafter he became its president. ... The defendant American News Company, notwithstanding its great size and notwithstanding its apparent dominance in the periodical distribution field, commencing in the fifties began to encounter difficulties. It lost franchise after franchise and began sustaining heavy losses. By 1957 it had sustained losses in connection with its distribution of periodicals in excess of $8,000,000.00. In 1957 it decided to cease its activities as a national distributor and local wholesaler. It laid off around 8,000 of its employees and sold all of the equipment used in connection with its distribution activities. By June 1957, it was entirely out of business as a national distributor and as a local wholesaler.&lt;ref name="lawsuit" /&gt;}}

An alternative (but somewhat similar explanation) for the company's demise has been offered by comic book historian and author [[Gerard Jones]]. The company in 1956...
{{blockquote|had been found guilty of restraint of trade and ordered to divest itself of the newsstands it owned. Its biggest client, [[George Delacorte]], announced he would seek a new distributor for his [[Dell Comics]] and paperbacks. The owners of American News estimated the effect that would have on their income. Then they looked at the value of the [[New Jersey]] real estate where their headquarters sat. They liquidated the company and sold the land. The company ... vanished without a trace in the [[suburban]] growth of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book'' (Basic Books, 2004; trade paperback {{ISBN|0-465-03657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Repercussions ==
The effect on the American magazine market was catastrophic. Many magazines had to switch to one of the independent distributors, who were able to set their own conditions for taking on new business. This often forced the magazines to change from a [[digest size]] to a larger format, and to become monthly rather than bimonthly or quarterly. Many magazines could not afford to make these changes, both of which required either high circulation or a strong advertising base, and many magazines folded as a result.&lt;ref name=TM_191/&gt;

An example of a company that the change in distributor had a drastic impact on is [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], which was forced to switch distribution to [[Independent News]], owned by [[National Periodical Publications]], owner of Atlas' rival, [[DC Comics]]. Because of this, Atlas was constrained as to its publishing output for the next decade (including the early years of its successor, [[Marvel Comics]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5lHwfKOI2?url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html "Stan the Man &amp; Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas,"] ''Comic Book Artist'' (2).

{{Culture of Albania}}

The '''Architecture of Albania''' ({{IPA-sq|aɾˈki:tɛk:uɾa ʃcipˈta:ɾɛ}} — {{lang-sq|Arkitektura e Shqipërisë}}) is a reflection of [[Albania]]'s historical and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="hisarch"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Keida Lulo, Kevin Tummers|title=History of Albanian Architecture Model, Various Authors, 1970 - 2.12.ARCHITECTURE and Urban Development|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:K1Re5ez6erQJ:www.seda.org.al/download/i/mark_dl/u/4012653116/4611166538/2.3-Architecture.pdf+&amp;cd=7&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de|website=seda.org.al|page=1|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's architecture was influenced by its location within the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and progressed over the course of history as it was once inhabited by numerous civilisations including the [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]]s, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s as well as modern [[Austro-Hungarian empire|Austro-Hungarian]]s and [[Italians]]. In addition, missionaries, invaders, colonisers and traders brought cultural changes that had a large profound effect on building styles as well as techniques.

During [[classical antiquity]], cities and towns in Albania have evolved from within the [[castle]] to include [[dwelling]]s, religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques. Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the country, which effectively begins with constructions from the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] such as in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]] and [[Shkodër]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POLITISCHE ORGANISATIONSFORMEN IM VORRÖMISCHEN SÜDILLYRIEN|url=http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/atti2003/siewert.pdf|website=fondazionecanussio.org|page=58|language=German|format=PDF|quote=Die Urbanisierung Illyriens begann im späten 5.

After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], Albania became an integral part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. They have left a legacy, most visible in the cities and surroundings of [[Korçë]], [[Berat]], [[Voskopojë]] and [[Gjirokastër]], in the form of castles, churches and monasteries with grandiose wealth of visible [[mural]]s and [[fresco]]s. The country also has many surviving monuments from the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman]] period. They left their mark with the many mosques and other buildings they constructed, that contributed to make Berat and Gjirokastër an UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In the 18th and 19th century, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by various Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of western European cities; this can be particularly seen in [[Tirana]] and Korçë. They introduced [[architectural style]]s such as [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]].

Following the establishment of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communism in Albania]], the country's architecture development was radically changed by the socialist ideology and numerous historic and [[Sacred architecture|sacred]] buildings across Albania were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karin Myhrberg - [[University of Gothenburg]]|title=Heritage from the Communist Period in Albania - An Unwanted Heritage Today?|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29221/1/gupea_2077_29221_1.pdf|website=gupea.ub.gu.se|location=Gothenburg|page=12|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Arta Dollani, Antonella Lerario and Nicola Maiellaro|title=Sustaining Cultural and Natural Heritage in Albania|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/8/792/pdf|website=mdpi.com|pages=1–19|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while squares in major towns were redesigned.

== Overview of Albania ==
{{See also|Geography of Albania|History of Albania}}

[[File:Albania space.jpg|137px|thumb|Topography of [[Albania]].]]

Albania is a [[Mediterranean]] country, lying to the east of [[Italy]], across the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Although the country occupies the southwestern portion of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], bordered by [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} to the northeast, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the east and [[Greece]] to the south and southeast. It has a varied and contrasting topography with high mountains, rocky shores, coastal wetlands, sandy beaches, steep canyons and gorges and islands of various shapes and sizes.

In terms of topography, the country encompasses [[coastal plain]]s in the west to the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north, the [[Sharr Mountains]] in the northeast, [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains|Skanderbeg Mountains]] in the center, [[Korab|Korab Mountains]] in the east, [[Pindus Mountains]] in the southeast and [[Ceraunian Mountains]] in the southwest along the [[Albanian Riviera]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea Coast]].

The country experiences mostly [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] climate with [[Continental climate|continental]] influences.&lt;ref name="climate1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Ministry of Environment (Albania)|Ministry of Environment of Albania]]|title=Albania's Second National Communication to the Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/albnc2.pdf|website=unfccc.int|location=Tirana|page=28|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that the climate is characterised by mild winters and hot, dry summers. The warmest areas of the country are along the west, where climate is profoundly impacted by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The coldest parts of the country are at the north and east, where snowy forested climate is prevalent.

During the [[Iron Age]], Albania was originally home to the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greeks]]. Following the centuries, it was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. The emergence of a unified Albanian state dates back to the establishment of the [[Principality of Arbër]] in 1190 AD.

== Periods ==

=== Antiquity ===

The beginnings of architecture in Albania dates back to the middle [[Neolithic Age]] with the discovery of prehistoric dwellings in Dunavec and [[Maliq]].&lt;ref name="neo"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization]]|title=Archaeology and art of Albania, Ecuador, China, Bulgaria|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000748/074870eo.pdf|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|pages=4–6|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were built on a wooden platform that rested on stakes stuck vertically into the [[soil]].&lt;ref name="neo"/&gt; Prehistoric dwellings in Albania consist of three types such as houses enclosed either completely on the ground or half underground, both found in [[Cakran]] near [[Fier]] and houses constructed above ground.

During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] started to organize itself in the territory of Albania. The Illyrians were an [[ethnic group]] with distinct culture and art, while it is believed that [[Albanians]] are the descendants of the Illyrians but no enough evidence is left to get a conclusion. Cities within [[Illyria]] were mainly built on the tops of high mountains surrounded by heavily fortified walls. Further, the history of Albania has not been kind to the Illyrian architectural monuments. Few monuments from the Illyrians are still preserved such as in [[Amantia]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Scodra]], [[Lissus]] and [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme|Selca e Poshtme]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilkes, O., Albania An Archaeological Guide, I.B.Tauris 2012, {{ISBN|1780760698}}, p263&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amphitheatre of Butrint 2009.jpg|210px|thumb|right|[[Butrint]] has been included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Butrint|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following the [[Illyrian Wars]], the architecture in Albania developed significantly in the 2nd century BC with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s. The conquered settlements and villages such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Byllis]], [[Dyrrachium]] and [[Dropull|Hadrianopolis]] were notably modernised following Roman models, with the building of a forum, roads, theatres, promenades, temples, aqueducts and other social buildings. The period also marks the construction of stadiums and thermal baths that were of social importance as places of gathering.

Previously populated by various [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greek tribes]], [[Butrint]] became a [[protectorate]] and subsequently a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen|title=Hellenistic and Roman Butrint|publisher=Butrint Foundation, 2009|isbn=9780953555680|url=https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&amp;id=nFoqAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=butrint+roman+architecture&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=butrint+|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen, Richard Hodges, Sarah Leppard|title=Butrint 4: The Archaeology and Histories of an Ionian Town|publisher=Oxbow Books, 2013|isbn=9781842174623|page=9|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=q3x-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=butrint+roman+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy5_Wkiv3YAhWM2qQKHe_vB7gQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=butrint%20roman%20architecture&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays, it demonstrates a high level of Roman urbanisation, while it is among the best preserved remains of Roman heritage in Albania. They left its legacy in form of city walls, an aqueduct, the forum, [[basilica]]s, [[Baptistery|baptister]]ies, baths, an [[amphitheatre]] and [[Insulae|houses]] for the middle classes, as well as [[Domus|mansions]] with central courtyards which were decorated with various mosaics and murals.

[[Dyrrachium]] thrived during the Roman period and became a protectorate after the Illyrian Wars. The [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre of Durrës]], which the Romans built, was at that time the largest amphitheatre in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Albania|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides, 2015|isbn=9781841628554|page=87|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ZR3XBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=dyrrachium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M0l655960E&amp;sig=vDqIETWT82pXwqFo8RIjF8KK5vU&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiptZu_lP3YAhWQGOwKHVfLDkQ4ChDoAQg2MAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dyrrachium&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Roman monument that survived up to the present.

The [[Via Egnatia]], built by [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Gnaeus Egnatius]], functioned for two millennia as a multi-purpose highway, which once connected the cities of [[Durrës]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west to [[Constantinople]] on the [[Marmara Sea]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Sear|title=Roman Architecture - Cornell paperbacks|publisher=Cornell University Press, 1983|isbn=9780801492457|page=270|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Rkdt_p6uvw0C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=via+engatia+architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0LgjYep-lP&amp;sig=4X9MRTt4yILklQwVHfeUgBg479M&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfjIW3kf3YAhXCyKQKHcR1BtQQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=via%20engatia%20architecture&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the route gave the Roman colonies of the [[Balkans]] a direct connection to Rome.

=== Middle Ages ===

Medieval cities in Albania are classified according to two criteria:

*Cities associated with fortifications, such as Berat and Gjirokastra
*Cities that lie in flat or steep terrains such as Tirana, Kavaja, and Elbasan.

During the [[Middle Ages]], a variety of [[architecture style]]s developed in the form of dwelling, defence, worship and engineering structures.
When the [[Roman Empire]] divided into east and west, Albania remained under the [[Eastern Roman empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. In behalf to that, the architecture was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s. Many extensive churches and monasteries were built during that period mainly in the centre and south of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Agricultural University of Tirana]]|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some inherited historic structures were damaged by invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the consolidation of the Albanian feudal principalities gave rise to ''Varosha'', or neighbourhoods outside city walls. Examples of such developments are the [[Arberesh]] principalities centred in [[Petrele]], [[Kruje]] and [[Gjirokastra]] originating from the feudal castle. In the 15th century, close attention was given to protective structures such as the castle fortifications of Lezha, Petrela, [[Devol (Albania)|Devoll]], Butrint, and [[Shkodra]]. More reconstructions took place in strategic points such as the Castle of [[Elbasan]], [[Preza]], [[Tepelena]], and [[Vlora]], the latter being the most important on the coast. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the great Pashaliks of the period such as the Bushati Family, [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]], and [[Ali Pashe Tepelena]] reconstructed several fortifications such as the Castle of Shkodra, Berat, and Tepelena respectively. It is important to note that Ali Pashe Tepelena embarked on a major castle building campaign throughout Epirus.

[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|220px|thumb|left|The [[Ardenica Monastery]] near Fier.]]

During the medieval period, mosques in Albania fell into two categories: those covered with a dome, and those with a roof covered hall. The latter were immediately adopted following the Ottoman invasion, by transforming the existing churches of Shkodra, Kruje, Berat, Elbasan and Kanina. For instance, the [[Lead Mosque, Shkodër|Lead Mosque]] built by [[Mustafa Pasha Bushati]] in Shkodra resembles a typical Istanbul mosque.

On the other hand, Christian religious structures inherited many features from their palaeo-Christian predecessors. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, a series of small structures for Christian with simple layouts were built like the [[Voskopoja]] basilica, [[Ardenica Monastery]], and Church of St. Nicholas in Voskopoja. The latter is one of the most valuable architectonic monuments in Albania. Its interior walls are covered with paintings by the renowned painter [[David Selenica]], and by brothers Constantine and Athanasios Zografi.

=== Modern ===

During the 18th century, the city silhouette in Albania began to include places of worship and the Clock Tower. These, together with other social structures such as thermal baths, fountains, and ''[[madrasa|medrese]]'' further enriched the city centre and its neighbourhoods.

In the 19th century, the ''bazaar'' emerges as a production and exchange centre, while the city expands beyond the castle, which completely loses its function and inhabitants. During this period, Shkodra and Korca become important commerce and skilled crafts centres.
 
[[File:Tirana_panorama_2016.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Skanderbeg Square]] in [[Neo-renaissance|Neo-Renaissance]] style.]]

The first half of the 20th century begins with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, continues with [[Fan Noli]]'s government, [[King Zog]]'s kingdom, and ends with the Italian invasion. During this time, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by Austro-Hungarian architects, giving them the appearance of European cities.

The centre of [[Tirana]] was the project of [[Florestano Di Fausto]] and Armando Brasini, well known architects of the [[Benito Mussolini]] period in Italy. Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre.

The plan underwent revisions by the Albanian architect Eshref Frashëri, the Italian architect Castellani, and the Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler. The rectangular parallel road system of Tirana e Re district took shape, while the northern portion of the main Boulevard was opened. These urban plans formed the basis of future developments in Albania after the [[second World War]].

}}

From 1944 to 1991, cities experienced an ordered development with a decline in architectural quality. Massive socialist-styled [[apartment]] complexes, wide roads, and [[factories]] were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and a number of historic buildings demolished.
 
The period after the fall of communism is often described negatively in terms of [[urban area|urban]] development. Kiosks and apartment buildings started to occupy former public areas without planning, while informal districts formed around cities from internal [[Immigration|migrants]] leaving remote rural areas for the western lowland. Decreasing urban space and increased traffic congestion have become major problems as a result of lack of planning. 
As part of the 2014 Administrative Division Reform, all town centres in Albania are being physically redesigned and façades painted to reflect a more Mediterranean look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&amp;kat=88 |title=Ndarja e re, mbeten 28 bashki, shkrihen komunat &amp;#124; Shekulli Online |publisher=Shekulli.com.al |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140113102623/http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&amp;kat=88# |archive-date=2014-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/ |title=Reforma Territoriale - KRYESORE |publisher=Reformaterritoriale.al |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much has been achieved, critics argue that there is no clear vision on Tirana's future. Some of the pressing issues facing Tirana are loss of public space due to illegal and chaotic construction, unpaved roads in suburban areas, degradation of Tirana's Artificial Lake, rehabilitation of Skanderbeg Square, an ever-present smog, the construction of a central bus station and lack of public parking space. Future plans include the construction of the Multimodal Station of Tirana and the tram line, rehabilitation of the Tiranë River area, construction of a new boulevard along the former Tirana Railway Station and the finishing of the Big Ring Road.

=== Berat ===
{{See also|Berat}}

[[File:Berat UNESCO 2016 Albania.jpg|210px|thumb|Scenic view over Gorica.]]

[[Berat]], otherwise known as the city of a thousand windows, is a small city in Southern Albania. The architecture of Berat is diverse and enfolds the inheritance of the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] but also of various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city among others the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Nevertheless, the cityscape is notably embossed by the [[Ottoman architecture|architectural style]] of the Ottomans and boasts a wealth of structures of exceptional [[History of Albania|historical]] and [[Albanian art|architectural]] interest. This led the city to become a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

[[File:Old town of berat albania 3.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The old town of Berat is dominated by Ottoman houses.]]

The city is separated intro three parts such as the residential quarter within the fortress or known as Kalaja, Mangalem and Gorica. The [[Berat Castle|Kalaja]] is believed to have been found in antiquity as it was the settlement of the [[Illyrian tribe|Illyrian]] tribe of the [[Illyrian tribe#Deretini|Desaretes]].&lt;ref name="briefhis"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Brief description of Berat|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Venice/pdf/special_events/Berat1.pdf|website=unesco.org|location=Berat|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was known as [[Antipatrea]] when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s conquered the city and called it Albanorum Oppidum.&lt;ref name="briefhis"/&gt; Over the centuries it has been subject to numerous conquest by the Byzantines and Ottomans.

Kalaja is well-preserved and consists of numerous houses, most of which are built of stone. Numerous churches with extraordinary decorated [[icon]]s and [[mural]]s still survives including the [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] and [[St. Mary of Blachernae Church, Berat|St. Mary of Blachernae Church]]. Islamic architecture is represented with the ruins of the [[Red Mosque, Berat|Red Mosque]] and [[White Mosque, Berat|White Mosque]]. Worth seeing is the [[cistern]] that was constructed by the Romans. The prominent [[Onufri Museum of Icons]] is also located within the castle and displays works of [[Onufri]] and other important Albanian painter.

[[File:Berat_-_kalaja.jpg|210px|thumb|Remains of the [[Berat Castle]].]]

Houses within the Mangalem quarter were built along a steep hill towards the Gorica quarter. The facades that faces the valley have characteristically [[overhang (architecture)|overhanging windows]]. Therefore, Berat owes its titel to the district, the "city of a thousand windows". There are three Ottoman mosques that include the [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]], [[Lead Mosque, Berat|Lead Mosque]] and notably the [[Bachelors' Mosque|Bachelors Mosque]]. The [[Halveti Teqe, Berat|Halveti Teqe]] stands behind the King Mosque and enclose an impressive carved ceiling.

Gorica was for a long time only connected through the [[Gorica Bridge]] to the rest of Berat. It is among the most popular Ottoman bridges in Albania that was built in 1780 by [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha|Ahmed Kurt Pasha]]. The Saint Spyridon Monastery is another prominent attraction due to its admirable [[Post-Byzantine architecture|Post-Byzantine style]].

=== Korçë ===
{{See also|Korçë}}

[[File:Korca,_Albania_2017.jpg|210px|thumb|right|The [[Resurrection Cathedral, Korçë|Resurrection Cathedral]] in the center.]]

The architecture in [[Korçë]] is characterised by mansions and residential buildings, cobbled streets and wide boulevards with many cafés and restaurants. There is an architectural mix, due to the turbulent history, of [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] styles. Italian and French influences increased after the beginning of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, the city has preserved some of its history in its streets and facades.

[[File:Korca_Old_Bazaar.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The [[Old Bazaar of Korçë|Old Bazaar]] during reconstructions.]]

The city was an important trade and economic centre during the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Machiel Kiel|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania (1385-1912)|date=1990|location=Istanbul|isbn=9290633301|page=163|edition=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Ottoman rule, the [[Old Bazaar of Korçë|Old Bazaar]] developed rapidly to become the city's main centre of commerce. Although [[bazaar]]s were typical Ottoman trading complexes developed in the towns of Albania and elsewhere in the [[Balkans]]. The Ottoman architecture is predominant within the bazaar, while recent reconstructions have led to the application of elements specific to [[modern architecture]].

The [[Resurrection Cathedral, Korçë|Resurrection Cathedral]] is located in the center north of Bulevardi Republika. It is one of the largest [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] [[cathedral]]s in Albania, as well as one of the city's symbols and primary tourist attractions. The cathedral is a [[Nave|three-nave]] structure and belongs to [[Byzantine style]]. It stands slightly elevated on an [[Podium|estrade]] and consists mainly of cream-white to ivory-colored stones and red bricks. The interior walls and domes are decorated with [[icon]]s and [[fresco]]es.

The [[Mirahori Mosque]] was built in 1484 and founded by [[Iljaz Bey Mirahor]]. The [[minaret]] and dome of the building was damaged by an earthquake and was recently restored. It consists of white [[limestone]] blocks that lie on layers of red bricks. It is only one of the few monuments of the Ottoman period in the city and the surrounding county.

The [[Dormition of the Theotokos Church, Labovë e Kryqit|Dormition of the Theotokos Church]] in [[Labovë e Kryqit]] is one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture in the country. Its interior is decorated with various mosaics and [[fresco]]es and coverings of great artistic value. It is a typically Byzantine church with a high central dome with nave and aisles arranged in a cruciform plan.

The [[St. Anthony Church, Durrës|St. Anthony Church]] of [[Durrës]] is another important example of Byzantine architecture. It was built in the [[Cape of Rodon]], owning a direct proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The structure was built in the 14th century and stands close to the [[Rodoni Castle]], which was built by [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]].

[[File:Church of Rubik1.webm|210px|thumb|right|The [[Rubik Monastery Church|Monastery]] of [[Rubik, Albania|Rubik]].]]

The monastery is an impressive representative of Byzantine architecture with many [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque features]].  
 
The history of Albania has not been kind to Early Christian architectural monuments. Scattered throughout the country, there are still structures and remains of churches and monasteries from that period such as the [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] of [[Berat]], [[St. Nicholas Monastery Church, Mesopotam|St. Nicholas Monastery Church]] in [[Mesopotam]], [[St. Mary's Church, Maligrad|St. Mary's Church]] of [[Prespa National Park|Maligrad]], [[St. Mary of Blachernae Church (Berat)|St. Mary of Blachernae Church]] of Berat, [[Paleochristian Church, Lin|Paleochristian]] and [[Byzantine Church, Lin|Byzantine Church of Lin]].

The combinations of brick and stone were very frequent in [[Ottoman architecture]], while brick was used mainly for arches, domes and vaults. Further, the most characteristic feature of those mosques is the dominance of a dome, having a semi-circular flat profile, that covered the significant part of the prayer hall within the mosque. The elegance of various Islamic elements is blended in and adapted into buildings and interior designs such as the use of tiling, geometric designs, floral motifs and murals.

In contrast to the long presence of the Ottomans in Albania and Balkans, only few significant mosques from this period have survived, scattered particularly in the center and south of Albania. One of those mosques include the [[Mirahori Mosque]] built in 1495 by [[Imrahor Ilyas Bey]] in [[Korçë]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Machiel Kiel|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania (1385–1912)|date=1990|location=Istanbul|isbn=9290633301|pages=117–120|edition=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only existing Ottoman mosque in the city and surrounding [[Korçë County|county]].&lt;ref name="Ottoman heritage in Albania"/&gt;

[[File:Berat_citadel.jpg|210px|thumb|right|[[Ottoman architecture]] within the [[Castle of Berat|Castle]] of [[Berat]].]]

The scenic [[Geography of Albania|landscapes]] of Albania are dotted with [[castle]]s, [[Fortification|fort]]s and [[citadel]]s in all shapes and sizes. Previously they was mostly defined by their practical use to repel invasions and often serve as a royal residence for noble families. Those structures constitute treasures and legacy of the [[History of Albania|historic past]] of Albania. The first castles in the Albanian lands were built by [[Illyrians]] and [[Romans]] and later by [[Venetian Republic|Venetians]] and [[Ottomans]]. The majority have been renovated throughout history and different epoches with changing rule and adaptations to war technology development.

[[File:Muzeum Skanderbega w Kruji 2.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The medieval [[Krujë Castle|Castle of Krujë]].]]

The [[Castle of Berat]] has a long history, which can be traced back to the 4th century.&lt;ref name="UNESCOberat"&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastra|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/569|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being burned down by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], the walls were strengthened again in the 5th century under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s and later in the 15th century by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].&lt;ref name="UNESCOberat"/&gt; The fortress was often damaged, particularly during the [[Communism in Albania]], and reconstructed. It possesses several [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] churches dotted with impressive [[fresco]]es, [[mural]]s and [[icon]]s, whereas the [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman heritage]] is demonstrated in forms of mosques and traditional houses.

The [[Krujë Castle|Castle of Krujë]] is a typical [[Medieval castle|medieval fortress]] built upon a rocky hill in [[Krujë]] that resisted the advance of the Ottomans several times under the reign of [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu]]. It was constructed during the 5th and 6th centuries and the surrounding walls are reinforced by nine towers, which served as an observation and signaling post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baki Dollma|title=Vende dhe ngjarje historike të Krujës e Kurbinit|date=2006|publisher=Dajti 2000|location=Tirana|isbn=9994381563|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can still be found the remains of houses and mansions.

The [[Fortress of Bashtovë]] was built over an existing former structure by the [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]]s in the Middle Ages. It stands in a very strategic point near the mouth of [[Shkumbin|Shkumbin River]] close to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The castle is a typical Venetian structure that combined the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] lancet arch with Byzantine and Ottoman influences.

[[Petrelë Castle]] is a medieval castle located on a hilltop overlooking [[Petrelë]] and [[Erzen river|Erzen Valley]]. The castle has a triangular structure with two observation towers. The early fortifications probably dates from the 3rd century, while in the 9th century it was expanded and served as a base for [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu]] during its revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[[File:Rozafa Castle from Tarabosh.jpg|210px|thumb|left|Scenic view of [[Rozafa Castle]] in [[Shkodër]].]]

[[Rozafa Castle]] is an ancient castle in [[Shkodër]]. The castle is associated with a famous legend about a woman who was buried in the foundation of the castle. It stretches on a rocky hill and is trapped on three sides by the rivers of [[Bojana (river)|Buna]], Kir and [[Drin (river)|Drin]]. Its current name, Rozafa, appeared for the first time in the early [[Middle Ages]]. Later when the [[Ottomans]] conquered the [[Balkans]] the castle than was turned into a mosque.

The [[Gjirokastër Fortress|Citadel of Gjirokastër]], a hilltop fortress, dominates the cityscape of [[Gjirokastër]] and overlooks the strategically important route along the [[Drino river]] valley.

[[Ali Pasha Castle]] was built on a small island along the mouth of the [[Vivari Channel]] in [[Butrint National Park|Butrint]]. The castle is named after the Albanian [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]], who ruled over the [[Pashalik of Yanina]] and even attempted to rival the [[Dey of Algiers]] in the seas. It is a small rectangular structure with battered walls, while along the corners, there are two battered round towers with cannons on its seaward side and two irregularly sized battered square towers equipped with firing loops or windows.

The [[Rodoni Castle]] stand within the [[Cape of Rodon]] with a proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Its name is derived from the [[Illyrian Gods|Illyrian god]] of Rodon. After the [[First Siege of Krujë]] and [[League of Lezhë]], the [[Kastrioti family|Kastrioti]]s decided to increase the fortifications for the use against the Ottomans. Skanderbeg chose the Cape of Rodon as the location of the castle and construction began in 1450.

=== Kullas ===

[[File:Old Albanian house.JPG|thumb|210px|A model of an Albanian house.]][[File:Gjirokastër – Zekate House 01 – front.jpg|thumb|210px|Zekate House in [[Gjirokastër]].]][[File:LockInTower.jpg|thumb|210px|So-called "locked tower" in [[Theth]] within the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north of [[Albania]].]]

[[Tower houses in the Balkans|Kulla]] were fortified tower houses that flourished between the 17th and 19th centuries as a result of resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]], [[Albanian Renaissance|national renaissance]] and emergence of [[capitalism]]. In most cases, they take the form of an extended family house. However, a house for two brothers can also be found.
 
According to their spatial and planning composition, Albanian houses are classified and separated into four major groups:&lt;ref&gt;http://acp.al/post.php?id=56&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Houses with vater zjarri, or fireplace/hearth: These type of houses are primarily found in [[Tirana County]] and characterized by the house of fire (''Shtëpia e Zjarrit''), which takes up the height of two floors, with surrounding areas interacting around it. 
* Houses with hajat, or porch: A distinguishing feature of this style is the relationship of the house with the backyard and natural [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Oftentimes, these houses are built on flat grounds, with the ground floor used by inhabitants for agricultural purposes. For example, the Shijaku House in [[Tirana]] is surrounded by adobe walls with a large gate entrance, and almost always covered with a simple roof.
* Houses with ''çardak'', a type of balcony found on the top floor reserved for guests or relaxation: They are mostly found in [[Berat]], and less so in [[Kruje]] and [[Lezha]]. The cardak is a dominant element of the building's outer composition being on the main facade of the house, originally designed to be open. The cardak is extensively used by dwellers in the warm season by exploiting the natural sunlight. It also serves as liaison with other areas of the house. These houses are divided into several sub types: houses with cardak on the front area, on one side, or at the center. An example of such structures is Hajdar Sejdini House in [[Elbasan]]. 
* Urban or civic ''kulla'': They are found in [[Gjirokaster]] (see [[Zekate House]]), Berat, Kruje, and [[Shkoder]] used for defensive and warehouse purposes. The interior showed the extent of family's wealth, while the ground floor served as a safe place for cattle in the winter, and to keep water reserves for the dry summer months.

The southern urban or civic Kullas are found in the cities and surroundings of [[Berat]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Himara]] and [[Këlcyrë]].&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs-Makaš 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=goCJx26btm0C&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq=kule+tower+houses p. 392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=LF-vT_KkIsfR8gOhnpDECQ&amp;hl=el&amp;id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22tower+houses%22+paramythia&amp;q=%22tower+houses%22#search_anchor Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization.] p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Tower-houses in Gjirokastër were built in the 13th century predating Ottoman conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=d1yvT4PxDci48gO_7YnGCQ&amp;hl=el&amp;id=89ZKAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=byzantine+%22tower+houses%22&amp;q=%22cityscape+characterised+by+undulating+terrain+and+fortified+tower+houses%2C+imposing+fortifications+dating+from+the%22#search_anchor Internationale Tourismusattraktionen in Mittel- und Südosteuropa]. Österreichisches Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut, 1999, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Kullas are a heavily fortified residential building built in the north of Albania and [[Metohija|Dukagjin]] region of [[Kosovo]]. They contain small windows and shooting holes because their main purpose was to offer security from attack. Further they have been initially built from wood and stone and eventually only from stone.

The first Kullas were built in the 17th century, a time when there was continuous fighting in the Dukagjini region, although most of the ones that still remain are from the 18th or 19th century. They have been almost always built within a complex of buildings with various functions but Kullas in villages exists mostly as standalone structures. They are also positioned within the complex of buildings so that the inhabitants can look out over the surrounding area. Kullas in towns are usually built as standalone structures, while in villages they are more commonly found as a part of a larger ensemble of Kullas and stone houses, usually grouped together for the family clan they belonged to.

Certain Kullas were used as places of isolation and safe havens or "locked towers" (Kulla Ngujimi) intended for the use of persons targeted by [[gjakmarrja|blood feud]]s; an example can be found in [[Theth]].&lt;ref name="McAdamArcy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marika McAdam|author2=Jayne d' Arcy|author3=Chris Deliso|author4=Peter Dragicevic|title=Western Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PSBrPoGf-8C&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=11 May 2012|date=2 May 2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-729-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Kullas are three-story buildings. A characteristic unit of its architectural structure in "Oda e Burrave" (Chamber of Men or Gathering Room of Men), which was usually placed in the second floor of the Kulla, called Divanhane, while the ground floor served as a barn for cattle and the first floor was where the family quarters were located. The material from which the Divanhane is constructed, either wood or stone, is sometimes used to classify Kullas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kulla of Mazrekaj family in Dranoc|date = |last = Limani|first = Jeta|url = http://www.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/alumni/papers/CMHB_2007/Kosova___Jeta_Limani_-_Kulla_of_Mazrekaj_Family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arkitektura Vernakulare në Kosovë|last = Doli|first = Flamur|publisher = Association for the Preservation of Architectonic Heritage - SHRTA|year = 2009|isbn = 9789951878609|location = Prishtinë|pages = 93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peja.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Main square of the city of [[Peć]]]]

The '''architecture of Peć''', [[Kosovo]], describes a large mixture of architectural structures which are a reflection of the influential foreign rule all across the city. The architecture of the city consists of buildings, structures and constructions which were built with an architectural influence of the [[Byzantine architecture]], [[Serbo-Byzantine architecture]], [[Ottoman architecture]], [[Stalinist architecture]] (former Yugoslavia), and Modern cultures/architectures. Because of this there are many churches, mosques, buildings which are attraction points in the city and were built by the aforementioned influences. The rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] empires and the historical influence of former [[Yugoslavia]] (Communist era) have shaped the architectural landscape of the city to become a conglomerate of cultures.

[[File:Patriarchate of Peć 09 2010 1.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Main church of Patriarchate of Peć]]

=== Patriarchate of Peć ===
The [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchate of Peć]] is a Serbian-Orthodox Monastery and serves as the seat of the Serbian archbishopric and patriarchs. It is believed that the Patriarchate was found when Saint Sava around 1235 was still alive and the site became a metoh (land owned and governed by a monastery).

The Patriarchate of Peć consists of four main structures (churches). Its main churches are the Holy Apostles church (1266), the Church of Saint Demetrius (1320), the Church of the Holy Virgin Hodegetria (1330), the church of Saint Nicholas. The decoration of the Church of Saint Demetrius was decorated with frescoes around 1345.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5NyQEh8qFIQC], A Short History of Russia and the Balkan States, Donald Mackenzie Wallace, (The Encyclopædia Britannica Company, ltd., Jan 1, 1999 - 204 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; Paint decoration was used for the exterior walls instead of creating a relief from stone and brick.&lt;ref&gt;Slobodan Maldini, Srpska arhitektura u XX veku (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Patriarchate of Peć was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 2004 as an extension to the [[Dečani Monastery]], these structures can be found under the category of ''[[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/], UNESCO (2006). "List of World Heritage in Danger". Retrieved 24 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century the Church of the Holy Apostles was decorated since small modifications were made to it.

The Serbo-Byzantine architecture has been influenced by the Byzantine architecture and art traditions. Churches built with a Serbo-Byzantine architecture have a rectangular foundation, they have a central main dome with other smaller domes surrounding the main dome. A typical Serbo-Byzantine church has a rectangular foundation, with a major dome in the center with smaller domes around the center one. Usually Serbo-Byzantine monasteries/churches are decorated with frescoes that depict biblical stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.znanje.org/i/i19/99iv04/99iv0416m/broj3.htm], Srpsko-vizantijski stil - opste osobine (Serbian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slobodan Maldini, Srpska arhitektura u XX veku&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Patriarchate of Peć has built a high wall in its outskirts and has a military/police post block at its entrance which is guarded by local police or KFOR as a security measure for the Serb minority live in the facilities.

''See also: [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] and [[Bazaar]]''
[[File:Çarshia e gjatë e Pejës.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Bazaar of Peć serves as the main market for Gold shops]]

=== Bazaar of Peć ===
The [[Bazaar]] of Peć is located ({{coord|42.659701|20.292903|type:landmark|display=inline}}) in the center
of the city located near the river between parallel residence zones and is a remnant of the Ottoman rule there. The earliest mention of the Bazaar of Peć according to some sources is around the 14th century. The market historically housed blacksmiths and carpenters but also facilitated the agricultural market.&lt;ref&gt;Instituti per Mbrojtjen e Monumenteve te Kultures:Monumentet kulturo-historike. Peje: Litografia, 2006. (Albanian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bazaar of Peć or Pazar (Albanian) has mainly an Ottoman architecture on the buildings, which mainly serve as stores today.

The Bazaar of Peć was completely destroyed at least twice, once during the Italian occupation in 1943, and once during the 1999 war in Kosovo. Today the Bazaar of Peć, or locally known as Çarshia e Gjatë, is fully rebuilt (after the 1999 war) and still keeps the Ottoman architecture, and is the main market in the city of Peć, and is one of the many monuments which are under protection by the law.&lt;ref&gt;CHwB-Trashegimia Kulturore pa Kufij:Konservimi i Integruar.

=== Bajrakli Mosque (Çarshi Xhamia) ===
Is the main mosque situated in the center of the Bazaar of Peć({{coord|42.660143|20.293633|type:landmark|display=inline}}). It was built in 1471 by Sultan Fatih Mehmet Hani and is an Ottoman style mosque with the oldest and highest dome in the city. The Bajrakli Xhamia is a single domed mosque which is one of the main three architectural types of mosques in Ottoman architecture. This style dates from the early Ottoman period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EhIjXjCVQyYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+oxford+history+of+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQUSU8HxNqf8ywPe7ILACA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20oxford%20history%20of%20islam&amp;f=false], Sultanates and Gunpowder Empires, Ira M.

({{coord|42.65877|20.296487|type:landmark|display=inline}})The Hammam is built similarly to [[Turkish bath]]s with Ottoman architecture. It was built under Ottoman rule and belonged to the Dukagjini Sandzak (1462–1485).&lt;ref&gt;CHwB-Trashegimia Kulturore pa Kufij:Konservimi i Integruar. Prishtine:2011.(Albanian)&lt;/ref&gt; The building has an asymmetric “double” bath. According to some sources the bath was reconstructed in 1861 because of unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uSaH1bKAb8QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=150&amp;f=false] Gail Warrander and Venera Knaus:Kosovo.USA:Bradt Travel Guide, 2008 p.159&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Östermalm, Stockholm, Sweden - panoramio (66).jpg|thumb|upright|''Flygarmonumentet'']]

The '''Aviator Monument''' ({{lang-sv|'Flygarmonumentet'}}) is a [[statue]] that stands at [[Karlaplan]] in central [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The statue was a gift from the [[Royal Swedish Aero Club|Swedish Aeronautical Society]] in memory of different Swedish aviation pioneers who fell in both the North Pole expedition and in the first time of the Swedish aviator era in 1917. The task to build the [[monument]] was given to the famous sculptor [[Carl Milles]]. The Aviator Monument was finished in 1931.

==The statue==
The monument is a sculpture of a large [[eagle]] with outstretched wings about to lift. Height 185&amp;nbsp;cm, width 750&amp;nbsp;cm and depth 185&amp;nbsp;cm. On the plinth which the statue is standing on are reliefs of [[Icarus]], balloonists and early warplanes. Milles thought that an eagle would be an excellent [[symbol]]. Inside the shallow monument there is an urn, which contains medals for each fallen Swedish pilot.

==History==
Some may think that the Aviator Monument is Carl Milles admiration for Nazism. The [[eagle]] with its outstretched wings is often associated with the [[Nazi]] symbol, The Nazi Eagle. In the 1940s, young Swedish Nazis used the monument as a meeting point, and a place for gathering and commemoration. At this meeting point they commemorated. During this time young socialists sabotaged the statue with [[graffiti]] in protests against Nazis. The Swedish Air Force used it as a monument for a wreath-laying ceremony. The original purpose of this statue is to honour fallen pilots such as [[Salomon August Andrée]], Nils Strindberg and Knut Fraenkel who died in the North Pole expedition in 1898. The monument was taken down during the construction of the [[Karlaplan metro station]] and re-erected again in 1967.

'''''The Balloon''''' (in Hungarian: '''''Léghajó''''') is a work of art by Hungarian artist [[Pál Szinyei Merse]] from 1878.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063625/HU_280_007.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The picture is oil on canvas and has dimensions of 42 x 39.3&amp;nbsp;cm. 
The picture is part of the collection of the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mng.hu/kepkereso/oldal:2/608&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The work was inspired by a balloon trip taken by the brother-in-law of the artist after leaving [[Munich]] in May 1873, when he returned to his birthplace in Hungary. Like many of his countrymen, he travelled to [[France]] to study contemporary arts. After returning to Hungary, he married due to family care fails to implement many of their creative thinking. In 1878 he began to paint pictures full of optimism, a symbol of boldness and youth. Many of his works included themes of technological progress and innovation. His painting "bubble" symbolizes progress, as the air one forgets about all your petty problems and develop your imagination. In his painting overcome gravity marked human thought as flight and creative freedom.

The '''Center for Puppetry Arts''', located in [[Atlanta]], is the United States' largest organization dedicated to the art form of [[puppetry]]. The center focuses on three areas: performance, education and museum. It is one of the few puppet museums in the world. The center is located in [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]], the city's arts district. It was founded in 1978 by Vincent Anthony.

==History==
The Center for Puppetry Arts opened to the public on September 23, 1978, when [[Kermit the Frog]] and his creator [[Jim Henson]] cut the [[wiktionary:ceremonial|ceremonial]] ribbon.

A young puppeteer from [[Florida]], Vincent Anthony, began touring with Nicolo [[Marionettes]] under the tutelage of Nicholas Coppola-based out of [[New York City]]. By 1966, he was ready for a smaller community where he could be an active partner and make a difference. Together with Mitchell Edmonds, with whom he'd worked at Nicolo, they decided to move to Atlanta to create their own company - The Vagabond Marionettes.  Vince's vision was to create a center that would promote puppetry and become a vital part of the community. They created a successful touring company that  traveled around the southeast and presented several seasons at Atlanta's [[Woodruff Arts Center]]. In 1978, Anthony found a permanent home in the former Spring Street Elementary School and the Center was born. That first season, the Center mounted an [[wiktionary:exhibition|exhibition]] of puppets, presented shows for adults and families, and hosted community-based workshops and activities that continue to this day.

Since its inception, the Center has worked to serve the diverse populations of Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and the country at large. The Center reaches the community through its focus on core programming: performance, museum and education.

On July 25, 2007 the Center announced the opening of a new Jim Henson Wing, which houses anywhere from 500 to 700 retired Muppets, including those from [[Fraggle Rock]], [[The Muppet Show]], and [[Sesame Street]]. The new wing also includes films, sketches, and other materials from the [[Jim Henson Company]] archives. The wing, which is a part of the Center's new building, opened November 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puppet.org/ Center for Puppetry Arts] official website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Leopold, "[http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/entertainment/muppets-henson-museum-puppetry-arts-feat/index.html Muppets, Henson celebrated at new museum]", ''[[CNN]]'' (November 12, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances==
Each year the Center for Puppetry Arts presents the Family Series, a collection of adapted classic [[wiktionary:stories|stories]] and new works performed in a variety of puppetry styles by the Center company. Past shows have included an adaptation of [http://puppet.org/perform/shoemaker.shtml The Shoemaker &amp; The Elves] set in 1940s Manhattan, Jon Ludwig's [http://puppet.org/perform/dinosaurs.shtml Dinosaurs], and [http://www.puppet.org/perform/ghastly.shtml The Ghastly Dreadfuls' Compendium of Graveyard Tales and Other Curiosities], a Halloween-themed variety show. Family Performances are made up of shows that the Center's company creates/performs, as well as other artists from around the world. National traveling puppetry troupes set up shop at the Center during SummerFest and perform a variety of works for families. Included with many Family Performances is a Create-A-Puppet workshop that relates to the show.

The Center for Puppetry Arts also has the New Directions Series which features teen and adult-oriented shows by Atlanta artists and visiting companies. The New Directions Series are known for being more thought-provoking and visually appealing. Each show has a recommended age limit for those attending.

Film Series consists of "classic movies, hidden gems, and contemporary productions." While they are not performances they are productions related to puppetry.

==Education==
In addition to presenting productions, the Center offers a variety of classes and workshops for adults and children alike. Create-A-Puppet Workshops, offered in conjunction with Family Series performances, encourage children to build a puppet of their own that is related to the show.

[[Image:Thechildrenoflirduncan1914.jpg|thumb|''The Children of Lir'' (1914) by [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] ]]

The '''''Children of Lir''''' ({{lang-ga|Oidheadh chloinne Lir}}) is a legend from [[Irish mythology]]. It is a tale from the post-Christianisation period that mixes magical elements such as druidic wands and spells with a Christian message of faith bringing freedom from suffering.

==Naming and manuscripts==
Named in Irish as ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir'', the tale is today often known simply as "The Children of Lir" but the title has also been rendered as ''The Tragic Story of the Children of Lir'' or ''The Fate of the Children of Lir'', or, from the earlier title ''Aided Chlainne Lir'', as ''The Violent Death of the Children of Lir''.{{sfn|MacKillop|2004|loc = Entry for ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir''}}

In post 18th-century scholarship the tale has often been grouped with the ''Oidheadh chloinne Uisnigh'' ("The Fate of the Children of Uisnigh") and ''Oidheadh chloinne Tuireann'' ("The Fate of the Children of Tuireann") as the ''Trí truagha na sgéalaigheachta'', i.e. "The three sorrows of storytelling," also known as "The Three Sorrowful Tales of Erin."&lt;ref name="van1"&gt;{{citation| title = Oidheadh chloinne Lir| url =http://vanhamel.nl/codecs/Oidheadh_chloinne_Lir | work = vanhamel.nl }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|MacKillop|2004|loc =Entries for ''Oidheadh Chlainne Lir'', ''Trí Truagha na Sgéalaigheachta''}}  Scholar and folklorist [[Robin Flower]] has suggested that all three tales may have had a common author sometime in the 14th century, by someone in the circle of the [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]]s in north-west [[Connacht]].{{sfn|Breatnach|1999|p=1}}

Manuscripts containing early versions of the tales include MS 72.1.38 and MS 72.2.6 at the [[National Library of Scotland]], MS Egerton 164 at the [[British Library]], and MS 24 A 13, and MS E vi 4 at the library of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="van1"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Ler swans Millar.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Lêr and the Swans'' by [[H. R. Millar|H.R. Millar]]'s (1905)]]
:''Based on {{harv|Duffy|1883|}} ; a point summary is given in {{harvnb|Duffy|1883|pp=xv-xvi}} Numerals refer to those in the point summary and in Duffy's text itself.''

The legendary historical setting of the story is the end of the dominion of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] in Ireland, and the corresponding rise of the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].{{sfn|Duffy|1883|p=vii}}

[2-9] [[Bodb Derg]] was elected king of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], to the annoyance of Lir, who felt himself should have been chosen; Lir did not swear obedience to the new King, to the annoyance of those that elected him, causing strife, though Bodb sought to appease them. After some time Lir's wife died - to appease Lir, Bodb gave one of his daughters, Aoibh, to him in marriage - Lir agreed that he would yield the lordship, and form an alliance - ending the strike.

[10-13] Aoibh bore Lir four children: one girl, [[Fionnuala|Fionnghuala]], and three sons, [[Aed (god)|Aodh]] and twins, Fiachra and Conn. After the birth of the twins Aoibh died, causing great grief to Lir, though he was bolstered by his love for the four children. Bodb then sent another of his daughters, Aoife, to marry Lir, which he accepted happily. The children were a joy both to Lir and to Bodb.

[14-18] After a short while Aoife became jealous of the affection given to the four step children. Initially she feigned illness for around a year. One day she set out in her chariot with the four children, with design to kill them, and called her entourage to slay them, stating that because of them she had lost Lir's love, and promising them rich rewards. However they would not help, so she drew a sword, but was not able to follow through with the act. Next she took them to Loch Dairbhreach, and made to bathe - once in the water she cast a spell of metamorphosis to transform them in to four white swans.

[19-23] Fionnghuala rebuked her, stating that her magic power was not as great as that of their friends to undo the spell, and warned her of the revenge she would face - he asked her to set a limit on the time of the spell. She set a period of three hundred years as swan on ''Loch Dairbhreach'';&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Lake of the Oaks, [[Lough Derravaragh|Loch Derryvaragh]].{{harv|Duffy|1883|loc=note 29, p.84}}&lt;/ref&gt; three hundred more on ''Sruth na Maoilé'';&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Sruth na Maoilé'' aka ''Sruthar na Maoilé Chinntiré'', the strong current near the [[Mull of Kintyre|Mull of Cantire]], see [[Straits of Moyle]].{{harv|Duffy|1883|loc=note 33 pp.84-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three hundred at ''Iorrus Domnann'' and ''Inis Gluairé''.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''Iorrus Domnann'', now known as [[Erris]] in County Mayo; ''Inis Gluairé'', "Glory Island", in the Bay of Erris, County Mayo. {{harv|Duffy|1883|loc = note 34, 35, 36 p.85}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also foretold that by expiration of the period of the spell Lairgenn (the great-grandson of the King of Connacht), and Deoch (the great-granddaughter of the King of Munster) would be wed. Aoife relented a little and allowed the children to retain the power of speech, stating they would sing plaintive songs without equal, and that they would not be distressed by being in the forms of birds. Aoife the returned to court of Bodb -when he asked why the children were not with her she claimed Lir did not trust him with them, but Bodb was suspicious and sent messengers to Lir.

[24-32] On receiving the messenger Lir became sad, realising Aoifé had done some harmful act. He then set out, and at the shores of ''Loch Dairbhreach'' he encountered the swans singing with human voices. They told him of Aoife's evil act, and Lir and his people lamented, though that night they stayed and listened to the swan's song. Lir reached Bodb, and told him of Aoifé's treachery. Bodb cursed her, saying her suffering would be greater than the children's, and asked what the worst form of being was that she could imagine - Aoifé stated a Demon of the air was the worst, and on this Bodh struck her with a druid's wand, metamorphosing her into such a demon - she flew off and remained that way.

[33-45] Bodb and the people of the De Danann went to Loch Dairbhreach and listened to the swan's singing. Milesians came too, and the music calmed and delighted all who heard it. After three hundred years the time came for the swans to go north to the cold Sruth na Maoilé. At this time it was proclaimed that no swan should be killed in Erin. At the Maoilé a cruel storm separated them, and though they eventually re-united their time there was wretched, with extremes of cold and weather to contend with, but they could not leave, as it was their lot to stay in the waters there.

[46-52] Eventually the swans came across a company of the De Danann and of the Milesians who had been seeking them, led by Aodh and Fergus sons of Bodb - near the mouth of the Banna.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[River Bann]], {{harv|Duffy|1883|loc = note 51 p.87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swans enquired and received good news about the De Danann, Lir, and Bodb. After the allotted time the swans then left for Iorrus Domhnann. There they encountered a young man who took an account of their adventures.

[53-55] One night at Iorrus the cold and weather became so intense that the waters froze, and their feet froze to the ice. Because of their suffering they pleaded to the "King of Heaven" to ease the plight of birds, and having and professing faith in a "true God, perfect, truly intelligent" their pleading was heard, and from then they were protected from storms and bad weather. Eventually the time allotted to Iorrus Domhnann passed and they decided to go to ''Sioth Fionnachaidh'', where Lir lived.

[56-61] However once there, they found it deserted, derelict, and overgrown. The next day they set off for ''Inis Gluairé'' - there many birds congregated around them at the lake. Eventually Saint Patrick and Christianity came to Ireland, and one day the holy man ''Mochaomhóg'' arrive at ''Inis Gluairé'' - the swans heard him ringing a bell calling matins, and became frightened at the sound. However Fionnghuala declared the sound of the bell would liberate them from the curse of the spell, and so they listened to it. When it finished they sang a song. The holy man heard their song, and discovered that it was swans that sang it. Speaking to them he asked if they were the Children of Lir, stating that he had travelled to that place for their sake.

[62-66] The swans put their trust in the holy man, and allowed him to bind them with silver chains. The birds felt no fatigue or distress in their situation in the company of the monk. Eventually the account of the swans reached Deoch, the wife of Lairgnen, the King of Connacht - she asked him to get the swans for her. He sent messenger's immediately but the monk Mochaomhóg refused, making Lairgnen angry. He went to Mochaimhóg himself, and attempted to grasp the swans, but on his touch the swan's feathers fell off revealing three very old men, and an old woman, all lean, and very bony. On this Lairgnen left.

[67-70] Fionnghuala asked the monk to baptise them and to bury each, stating he sensed they were close to death. They were baptised, then died, and were buried. Mochaomhóg was sad for them. That was the fate of the children of Lir.

'''Sonnet X''', also known by its opening words as "'''Death Be Not Proud'''", is a fourteen-line poem, or [[sonnet]], by English poet [[John Donne]] (1572–1631), one of the leading figures in the [[metaphysical poets]] of seventeenth-century [[English literature]]. Written between February and August 1609, it was not published during Donne's lifetime; it was first published posthumously in 1633.

It is included as one of the nineteen sonnets that comprise Donne's ''[[Holy Sonnets]]'' or ''Divine Meditations'', among his most well-known works. Most editions number the poem as the tenth in the [[sonnet cycle|sonnet sequence]], which follows the order of poems in the Westmoreland Manuscript (circa 1620), the most complete arrangement of the cycle, discovered in the late nineteenth century. However, two editions published shortly after Donne's death include the sonnets in a different order, where this poem appears as eleventh in the ''Songs and Sonnets'' (published 1633) and sixth in ''Divine Meditations'' (published 1635).

"Death Be Not Proud" presents an argument against the power of death. Addressing Death as a person, the speaker warns Death against pride in his power. Such power is merely an illusion, and the end Death thinks it brings to men and women is in fact a rest from world-weariness for its alleged “victims.” The poet criticizes Death as a slave to other forces: fate, chance, kings, and desperate men. Death is not in control, for a variety of other powers exercise their volition in taking lives. Even in the rest it brings, Death is inferior to drugs. Finally, the speaker predicts the end of Death itself, stating “Death, thou shalt die.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slideshare.net/F2016119046/analysis-of-john-donnes-death-be-not-proud|title= Analysis of John Donne's Death Be Not Proud |website=Slideshare.net |accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Death be not proud, though some have called thee	
Mighty and dreadful, for, thou art not so,	
For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,	
Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.	
From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee,
Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,	
And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,	
Rest of their bones, and souls deliverie.	
Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,	
And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,
And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,	
And better than thy stroake; why swell'st thou then;	
One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally,	
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.
&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
Donne suffered a major illness that brought him close to death during his eighth year as an [[Church of England|Anglican]] minister. The illness may have been [[typhoid fever]], but in recent years it has been shown that he may have had a relapsing [[fever]] in combination with other illnesses.

The sonnet has an ABBA ABBA CDDC EE [[rhyme scheme]].

The last line alludes to [[1 Corinthians 15|1 Corinthians 15:26]]: "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death".

The poem's opening words are echoed in a contemporary poem, "Death be not proud, thy hand gave not this blow", sometimes attributed to Donne, but more likely by his patron [[Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford|Lucy Harington Russell, Countess of Bedford]].

== Notable use in pop culture ==

"Death Be Not Proud" was partially recited by [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]] as Patient X in the film ''[[The Exorcist III]]''.

The first two and last two lines of "Death Be Not Proud" are recited by [[Paladin]] in ''The Prophet'' (Episode 16, Season 3 of [[Have Gun - Will Travel]]).

The poem was set for voice and piano by [[Benjamin Britten]] as the concluding song in his [[song cycle]] ''[[The Holy Sonnets of John Donne]]''.

[[Emma Thompson]]'s character, Vivian Bearing, recites the poem in [[Wit (film)|''Wit'']], where John Donne plays a central role.

The first two lines are recited at the beginning of the title track to [[Children of Bodom]]'s third album ''[[Follow the Reaper]]''.

The poem is recited in its entirety by [[Kenneth Branagh]] at the end of Episode 4 of the 1987 BBC series ''[[Fortunes of War (TV series)|Fortunes of War]]'', following the death of one the main characters.

'''Design methods''' are procedures, techniques, aids, or tools for designing. They offer a number of different kinds of activities that the designer might use within an overall design process. Conventional procedures of design, such as drawing, can be regarded as design methods, but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together under the name of 'Design Methods’. What these new methods have in common is that they "are attempts to make public the hitherto private thinking of designers; to externalise the design process".&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=J. Christopher |title=Design Methods |date=1980 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Design methodology'' is the broader study of method in design: the study of the principles, practices and procedures of designing.&lt;ref name="Cross Methodology"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Developments in Design Methodology |date=1984 |publisher=Wiley |location=UK |isbn=0471102482}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==
Social, political and economic developments of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century put into motion modern benefits and constraints for living and working. Industrial and technological breakthroughs associated with this period created social and economic complexities for people and their environment. Disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, engineering and product development began to tackle new types of problem-solving past traditional artifact making. More informed and methodical approaches to designing were required.

From 1958 to 1963 [[Horst Rittel]] was a pioneer in articulating the relationship between science and design, specifically the limitations of design processes based on the 19th century rational view of science, in his courses at [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name=Ulm1&gt;[http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/ ''Ulm School of Design | HfG Ulm Archive'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2&gt;Lindinger, H., (1991), ''Ulm Design: The Morality of Objects'', Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel proposed principles for dealing with these limitations through his seminal HfG design methods courses: [[cybernetics]], [[operational analysis]] and [[communication theory]].&lt;ref name=Ulm1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rit1&gt;Rith, C and Dubberly, H, 'Why Horst W J Rittel Matters', Design Issues, Vol 23, No 1, pp. 72-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he was recruited to Berkeley to teach design methods courses and helped found the Design Methods Group (DMG) and the DMG Journal.&lt;ref name=Rit1 /&gt;

Design methods in England originally drew from a 1962 conference&lt;ref&gt;John Christopher Jones and Denis Thornley (eds). The Conference on Design Methods: papers presented at the conference on systematic and intuitive methods in engineering, industrial design, architecture and communications, London, September 1962, Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; called "The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and [[Communication studies|Communications]]." This event was organized by [[John Christopher Jones|John Chris Jones]], and Peter Slann who, with conference invitees, were driven by concerns about how their modern industrialized world was being manifested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/dmconference1962.html 1962 conference participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conference participants countered the craftsman model of design which was rooted in turning raw materials through tried and true craft-based knowledge into finished products. They believed that a single craft-based designer producing design solutions was not compatible with addressing the evolving complexity of post-industrial societies. They stressed that designers needed to work in cross-disciplinary teams where each participant brings his/her specific body of skills, language and experiences to defining and solving problems in whatever context.

The &lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/theory_of_designing.html John Chris Jones lists key design questions]&lt;/ref&gt; key benefit was to find a method that suits a particular design situation. [[Christopher Alexander]] went on to write his seminal books ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' and ''[[A Timeless Way of Building]]''.

=== Emergence of design research and design studies ===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, graduates of the [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968).&lt;ref name="Ulm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulm2"/&gt; began to spread Horst Rittel's approach of design methodology across Europe and the United States in context of their professional work and teaching what became known as the 'Ulm Model'.&lt;ref name=Ulm2 /&gt;

Likewise, after the 1962 conference in England, many of the participants began to publish and to define an area of research that focused on design. Three "camps" seemed to emerge to develop different directions in the initial work in Design Methods:

:* Behaviorism interpreted Design Methods as a way to describe [[human behavior]] in relation to the built environment. Its clinical approach tended to rely on human behavior processes ([[Categorization|taxonomic]] activities).
:* Reductivism broke Design Methods down into small constituent parts. This scientific approach tended to rely on rationalism and objectified processes such as [[epistemological]] activities.
:* Phenomenology approached design methods from an experiential approach (human experience and [[perception]].)

The [[Design Research Society]] was founded in 1966 by several participants from the Conference on Design Methods. The purpose of the Society is  to promote "the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields" and is an interdisciplinary group with many professions represented, but all bound by the conviction of the benefits of [[design research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/early_days1.0.html John Chris Jones thoughts on design research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environmental Design Research Association]] is one of the best-known entities that strive to integrate designers and [[social science]] professionals for better built environments. EDRA was founded by Henry Sanoff in 1969. Both [[John Chris Jones]] and [[Christopher Alexander]] interacted with EDRA and other camps; both seemed at a certain point to reject their interpretations. Jones and Alexander also questioned their original theses about design methods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

An interesting shift that affected design methods and design studies was a series of 1968 lectures by [[Herbert A. Simon]], the Nobel laureate, on "The Sciences of the Artificial".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, H. A. (1969) ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed using [[scientific methods]] to explore the world of man-made things (hence artificial). He discussed the role of [[wiktionary:analysis|analysis]] ([[observation]]) and [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] (making) as a process of creating man-made responses to the world he/she interacted with. Important to Simon's contribution were his notions of "[[bounded rationality]]" and "[[satisficing]]." Simon's concept had a profound impact on the discourse in both design methods, and the newly emerging design studies communities in two ways. It provided an entry to using scientific ideas to overlay on design, and it also created an internal debate whether design could/should be expressed and practiced as a type of [[science]] with the reduction of emphasis on [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

[[Nigel Cross]] has been prolific in articulating the issues of design methods and design research. The discussion of the ongoing debate of what is design research and design science was, and continues to be articulated by Cross. His thesis is that design is not a science, but is an area that is searching for "intellectual independence." He views the original design methods discussions of the 1960s as a way to integrate objective and rational methods in practicing design. Scientific method was borrowed as one framework, and the term [[design science]] was coined in 1966 at the conference on The Design Method focusing on a systematic approach to practicing design.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, S. A (1966), Design Science. In S. A Gregory (ed.) The Design Method. London, Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross defined the "science of design" as a way to create a body of work to improve the understanding of design methods&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1993) 'A History of Design Methodology', in M. de Vries, N. Cross and D. Grant (eds.), ''Design Methodology and Relationships with Science'', Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; — and more importantly that design does not need to be a binary choice between [[science]] and [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (1982) 'Designerly Ways of Knowing', ''Design Studies'', '''3''', 221-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigan Bayazit published an overview of the historical development of design methods. She stated that "Design methods people were looking at rational methods of incorporating scientific techniques and knowledge into the design process to make rational decisions to adapt to the prevailing values, something that was not always easy to achieve."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/074793604772933739 Bayazit, Nigan. "Investigating Design: A Review of Forty Years of Design Research."] Design Issues: Vol 20, No 1. Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional design practice===
Conversations about design methods and a more systematic approach to design was not isolated to Europe. America was also a magnet for practicing design professionals to codify their successes in design practice and backing into larger theories about the dynamics of design methods.

American designers were much more pragmatic at articulating design methods and creating an underlying language about the practice of industrial and graphic design. They were tied to economic systems that supported design practice and therefore focused on the way design could be managed as an extension of business, rather than the European approach to design methods based on transforming engineering by design.

Industrial design was the first area that made inroads into systematizing [[knowledge]] through practice. [[Raymond Loewy]] was instrumental at elevating the visibility of industrial design through cult of personality (appearing three times on front cover of ''Time Magazine''). [[Henry Dreyfuss]] had a profound impact on the practice of industrial design by developing a systematic process used to shape environments, [[transportation]], [[Product (business)|products]] and [[packaging]]. His focus on the needs of the average consumer was most celebrated in his book ''Designing for People'', an extensive exploration of [[ergonomics]].

[[Jay Doblin]] one of America's foremost industrial designers, worked for Raymond Loewy and was later an employee of [[Unimark International]], the world’s largest global design firm during the 1960s with offices in seven countries. In 1972, Doblin formed Chicago-based Jay Doblin &amp; Associates, a firm which managed innovative programs for Xerox Corporation and General Electric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin AIGA Overview of Jay Doblin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103135028/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?contentalias=JayDoblin |date=2005-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doblin was prolific at developing a language to describe design. One of his best articles was "A Short, Grandiose Theory of Design", published in the 1987 Society of Typographic Arts Design Journal. In seven pages, Doblin presents a straightforward and persuasive argument for design as a systematic process. He described the emerging landscape of systematic design:

:* For large complex projects, it "would be irresponsible to attempt them without analytical methods" and rallied against an "adolescent reliance on overly intuitive practices."
:* He separated "direct design" in which a craftsperson works on the artifact to "indirect design" in which a design first creates a representation of the artifact, separating design from production in more complex situations.

Doblin and others were responding to the increased [[Inheritance (computer science)|specialization]] of design and the complexity of managing large design programs for corporations. It was a natural process to begin to discuss how design should move upstream to be involved with the specifications of problems, not only in the traditional mode of production which design had been practiced. Particularly since 2000, design methods and its intersection with business development have been visibly championed by numerous consultancies within design industry.

The continuity of approaches to design projects by such representative firms is the generation of inputs incited by the human condition in varied contexts. These approaches utilize a sustainable methods-based mode of making that takes into account critical analytic and [[Synthetic proposition|synthetic]] skills toward more informed and inspired specifications grounded in:

:* Direct investigation of human circumstances to draw out impressions
:* Engagement by client-side and end-user participants in design process
:* Open articulation by practitioners of multiple disciplines facilitated by design

====Significance of role of professional design practice====
Practitioners approached design methods from a different angle than John Christopher Jones and the group of engineers and designers who convened in 1962. Many practitioners, through actual design opportunities, began to confront the complexities of the market and clients. They began to address issues of specifications, [[wiktionary:user|users]], distribution and [[innovation]]. Since there were no established methods, each practitioner began to develop frameworks and languages to describe a new way to design. Like any market-based model, there were many competing ideas about these new methods and their basis. Many of these designers may have been aware of the design methods movement, but many were not. Yet all their ideas were aligned to many of the basic tenets of the 1962 conference which advocated a more rigorous way of doing design. However, the social perspectives and criticisms of mediocre products of 1962 participants may not have been shared or agreed with.

==Current state of design methods==
There is no one way to practice design methods. John Chris Jones recognized this by stating:

:"Methodology should not be a fixed track to a fixed destination, but a conversation about everything that could be made to happen. The language of the conversation must bridge the logical gap between past and future, but in doing so it should not limit the variety of possible futures that are discussed nor should it force the choice  of a future that is unfree."&lt;ref name="Jones Design Methods"/&gt;

The focus of most post-1962 enhancements to design methods has been on developing a series of relevant, sound, humanistic problem-solving procedures and techniques to reduce avoidable errors and oversights that can adversely affect design solutions. The key benefit is to find a method that suits a particular design situation.

The benefits of their original work has been abstracted many times over; but in today's design environment, several of their main ideas have been integrated into contemporary design methods:
:* Emphasis on the user
:* Use of basic research methods to validate convictions with fact
:* Use of [[brainstorming]] and other related means to break mental patterns and precedent
:* Increased [[collaboration|collaborative]] nature of design with other disciplines

A large challenge for design as a discipline, its use of methods and an endeavor to create shared values, is its inherent synthetic nature as an area of study and action. This allows design to be extremely malleable in nature, borrowing ideas and concepts from a wide variety of professions to  suit the ends of individual practitioners. It also makes design vulnerable since these very activities make design a discipline unextensible as a shared body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicwriting.net/2.2/designmethodsforeveryone.html John Chris Jones perspective about "Design Methods for Everyone"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Donald Schon]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published ''The Reflective Practitioner''.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, Donald A. The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action.  1983. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-06878-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw traditional professions with stable knowledge bases, such as [[law]] and [[medicine]], becoming unstable due to outdated notions of 'technical-rationality' as the grounding of professional knowledge. Practitioners were able to describe how they 'think on their feet', and how they make use of a standard set of frameworks and techniques. Schon foresaw the increasing instability of traditional knowledge and how to achieve it. This is in line with the original founders of design methods who wanted to break with an unimaginative and static technical society and unify [[exploration]], [[collaboration]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

Design methods has influenced design practice and [[design education]]. It has benefited the design community by helping to create introductions that would never have happened if traditional professions remained ''stable'', which did not necessarily allow collaboration due to gate keeping of areas of knowledge and [[expertise]]. Design has been by nature an interloper activity, with individuals that have crossed disciplines to question and innovate.

The challenge is to transform individual [[experiences]], frameworks and [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]] into a shared, understandable, and, most importantly, a transmittable area of knowledge. Victor Margolin {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} states three reasons why this will prove difficult:

:* Domain knowledge is a mixture of [[vocation]] (discipline) and avocation (interest) creating hybrid definitions that degrade shared knowledge
:* [[Intellectual capital]] of design and wider scholarly pluralism has diluted focus and shared language which has led to ungovernable [[laissez-faire]] values
:* Individual explorations of design discourse focuses too much on individual narratives leading to personal point of view rather than a critical mass of shared values

In the end, ''design methods'' is a term that is widely used. Though conducive to interpretations, it is a shared belief in an exploratory and rigorous method to solve problems through design, an act which is part and parcel of what designers aim to accomplish in today's complex world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36161">'''Design thinking''' refers to the cognitive, strategic and practical processes by which design concepts (proposals for new products, buildings, machines, etc.) are developed by designers and/or design teams. Many of the key concepts and aspects of design thinking have been identified through studies, across different design domains, of design cognition and design activity in both laboratory and natural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Visser, W. 2006, The cognitive artifacts of designing, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Design Cognition: Results from Protocol and other Empirical Studies of Design Activity |date=2001 |pages=79–103 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978008043868950005X |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design thinking is also associated with prescriptions for the innovation of products and services within business and social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brown. Design Thinking. Harvard Business Review, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorst Frame Innovation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorst|first1=Kees|title=Frame Innovation: Create new thinking by design|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-32431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these prescriptions have been criticized for oversimplifying the design process and trivializing the role of technical knowledge and skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Design-Thinking-Is-a/243472|title=Design Thinking Is a Boondoggle|date=2018-05-21|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==As a process for designing==
Design thinking encompasses processes such as context analysis, problem finding and framing, ideation and solution generating, creative thinking, sketching and drawing, modelling and prototyping, testing and evaluating.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Design thinking : understanding how designers think and work |publisher=Berg |date=2011 |isbn=9781847886361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core features of design thinking include abilities to:
* resolve ill-defined or 'wicked' problems
* adopt solution-focused strategies
* use abductive/productive reasoning
* employ non-verbal, graphic/spatial modelling media.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. "The Nature and Nurture of Design Ability", ''Design Studies'', '''11''' (1990) 127–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicked problems===
Design thinking is especially useful when addressing what [[Horst Rittel]] and [[Melvin Webber]] referred to as ''[[wicked problems]]'', which are ill-defined or tricky (as opposed to wicked in the sense of [[:wikt:malice|malicious]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rittel|first1=Horst|first2=Melvin|last2=Webber|title=Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning. ''Policy Sciences'' 4.2 (1973): 155–69|url=http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas for "tame" or "well-defined" problems the problem is clear, and the solution is available through applying rules or technical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Beinecke, Richard. "Leadership for Wicked Problems." ''The Innovation Journal'' 14.1 (2009): 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem framing===
Rather than accept the problem as given, designers explore the given problem and its context and may re-interpret or restructure the given problem in order to reach a particular framing of the problem that suggests a route to a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, Donald A. ''The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action.'' New York: Basic, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorst, K. (2011) "The Core of Design Thinking and its Application", ''Design Studies'', '''32''', 521-532.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solution-focused thinking===
In empirical studies of three-dimensional problem solving, Bryan Lawson found architects employed solution-focused cognitive strategies, distinct from the problem-focused strategies of scientists.&lt;ref name="lawson_1979"&gt;Lawson, Bryan. 1979. "Cognitive Strategies in Architectural Design". ''Ergonomics'', 22, 59–68 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel Cross]] suggests that 'Designers tend to use solution conjectures as the means of developing their understanding of the problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cross |first1=Nigel |title=Expertise in Design: an overview |journal=Design Studies |date=2004 |volume=25 |pages=427-441}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Abductive reasoning===
The creative mode of reasoning in design thinking is [[abductive reasoning]], rather than the more familiar forms of inductive and deductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;March, L.J. (1984) "The Logic of Design" in ''The Architecture of Form'', Cambridge University Press, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, J. (2010) "Abductive Thinking and Sensemaking: Drivers of Design Synthesis", ''Design Issues'', vol. 26, 15–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|Co-evolution of problem-solution}}Co-evolution of problem–solution===
In the process of designing the designer's attention typically oscillates between their understanding of the problematic context and their ideas for a solution in a process of co-evolution of problem and solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorst |first1=Kees |last2=Cross |first2=Nigel |title=Creativity in the design process: co-evolution of problem–solution |journal=Design Studies |date=2001 |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=425–437 |doi=10.1016/S0142-694X(01)00009-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiltschnig |first1=Stefan |last2=Christensen |first2=Bo |last3=Ball |first3=Linden |title=Collaborative problem–solution co-evolution in creative design |journal=Design Studies |date=2013 |volume=34 |pages=515 - 542}}&lt;/ref&gt; New solution ideas can lead to a deeper or alternative understanding of the problematic context, which in turn triggers more solution ideas.

===Representations and modelling===
Conventionally, designers communicate mostly in [[visual language|visual or object languages]] to translate abstract requirements into concrete objects.&lt;ref name="cross_1982"&gt;Cross, Nigel. "Designerly Ways of Knowing." ''Design Studies'' 3.4 (1982): 221–27.&lt;/ref&gt; These 'languages' include traditional sketches and drawings but also extend to computer models and physical prototypes. The use of representations and models is closely associated with features of design thinking such as the generation and exploration of tentative solution concepts, the identification of what needs to be known about the developing concept, and the recognition of emergent features and properties within the representations. &lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. 1999. "Natural Intelligence in Design", ''Design Studies'', '''20''', 25-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suwa, M., Gero, J. and Purcell, T. 2000. "Unexpected discoveries and S-invention of design requirements: Important vehicles for a design process". ''Design Studies'', '''21''', 539-567.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a process for innovation==
[[File:DesignThinking.ogv|thumb|Design thinking example video that presents design thinking for innovation in business and society as a process of "Learn from People, Find Patterns, Design Principles, Make Tangible and Iterate Relentlessly"]]

An alternative five-phase description of design process is described by Plattner, Meinel and Leifer as: ''(re)defining the problem, needfinding and benchmarking, ideating, building, testing''.&lt;ref name="Plattneretal"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Plattner |editor1-first=Hasso |editor1-link=Hasso Plattner |editor2-last=Meinel |editor2-first=Christoph |editor3-last=Leifer |editor3-first=Larry J. |date=2011 |title=Design thinking: understand, improve, apply |series=Understanding innovation |location=Berlin; Heidelberg |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LAbIwOwHz1MC&amp;pg=PR14 xiv–xvi] |isbn=3-642-13756-3 |oclc=898322632 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13757-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plattner, Meinel and Leifer state: "While the stages are simple enough, the adaptive expertise required to choose the right inflection points and appropriate next stage is a high order intellectual activity that requires practice and is learnable."

The process may also be thought of as a system of overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps: inspiration, ideation, and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T. 2008. Design Thinking. Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt; Projects may loop back through inspiration, ideation, and implementation more than once as the team refines its ideas and explores new directions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Brown, T. Wyatt, J. 2010.  Design thinking for social innovation. Stanford social innovation review.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspiration===
Generally, the design process starts with the inspiration phase: understanding the problem or the opportunity. This understanding can be documented in a brief which includes constraints that gives the project team a framework from which to begin, benchmarks by which they can measure progress, and a set of objectives to be realized—such as price point, available technology, and market segment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

====Empathy====
Both Tom and David Kelley have stated that design thinking begins with empathy.&lt;ref&gt;http://cultureofempathy.com/References/Experts/David-Kelley.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Designers should approach users with the goal of understanding their wants and needs, what might make their life easier and more enjoyable and how technology can be useful for them. Empathic design transcends physical ergonomics to include understanding the psychological and emotional needs of people—the way they do things, why and how they think and feel about the world, and what is meaningful to them.

===Ideation: Divergent and convergent thinking===
[[Ideation (creative process)|Ideation]] is idea generation. The process is characterized by the alternation of divergent and convergent thinking, typical of design thinking process. 

To achieve divergent thinking, it may be important to have a diverse group of people involved in the process. Design teams typically begin with a structured [[brainstorming]] process of "thinking outside the box". Convergent thinking, on the other hand, aims for zooming and focusing on the different proposals to select the best choice, which permits continuation of the design thinking process to achieve the final goals.

After collecting and sorting lots of ideas, a team goes through a process of synthesis in which it has to translate ideas into insights that can lead to solutions or opportunities for change. These might be either visions of new product offerings, or choices among various ways of creating new experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Implementation and prototyping===
The third space of the design thinking innovation process is implementation, when the best ideas generated during ideation are turned into something concrete.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

At the core of the implementation process is prototyping: turning ideas into actual products and services that are then tested, iterated, and refined. A prototype helps to gather feedback and improve the idea. Prototypes speed up the process of innovation because they allow one to understand strengths and weaknesses of new solutions.

== Application ==

===In business===
Historically, designers tended to be involved only in the later parts of the process of [[new product development]], focusing their attention on the aesthetics and functionality of products. Many businesses and other organisations now realise the utility of embedding design as a productive asset throughout organisational policies and practices, and design thinking has been used to help many different types of business and social organisations to be more constructive and innovative.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim, and Barry Kātz. ''Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation.'' New York: Harper Business, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorst Frame Innovation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorst|first1=Kees|title=Frame Innovation: Create new thinking by design|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-262-32431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s there was a significant growth of interest in design thinking as a catalyst for gaining competitive advantage within business,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim. "Design Thinking"." ''Harvard Business Review'', June 2008, pp. 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt; but doubts around design thinking as a panacea for success have also been expressed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kolko, J. "The divisiveness of design thinking." ''ACM Interactions'', May-June, 2018: http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2018/the-divisiveness-of-design-thinking&lt;/ref&gt; Designers bring their methods into business either by taking part themselves from the earliest stages of product and service development processes&lt;ref&gt;Myerson, Jeremy. ''IDEO: Masters of Innovation.'' New York: teNneues, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; or by training others to use design methods and to build innovative thinking capabilities within organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people=Brown, Tim | title=Tim Brown urges designers to think big | medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAinLaT42xY |publisher=TED | date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer science===
Design thinking has been central to [[user-centered design]] and [[human-centered design]]—the dominant methods of designing human-computer interfaces—for over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Norman |first1=Donald A. |title=User Centered System Design |journal=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=1 January 1986 |doi=10.1201/b15703 |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780898598728 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design thinking is also central to recent conceptions of software development in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ralph |first1=Paul |title=The Sensemaking-Coevolution-Implementation Theory of software design |journal=Science of Computer Programming |date=April 2015 |volume=101 |pages=21–41 |doi=10.1016/j.scico.2014.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===
All forms of professional design education can be assumed to be developing design thinking in students, even if only implicitly, but design thinking is also now explicitly taught in general as well as professional education, across all sectors of education. Design as a subject was introduced into secondary schools' educational curricula in the UK in the 1970s, gradually replacing and/or developing from some of the traditional art and craft subjects, and increasingly linked with technology studies. This development sparked related research studies in both education and design.&lt;ref&gt;Archer L. B. et al. (1979) "Design in General Education". London: The Royal College of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cross_1982" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen-Jackson, G. (ed.) (2002) "Teaching Design and Technology in Secondary Schools", London: Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the K-12 sector, design thinking is used to promote creative thinking, teamwork, and student responsibility for learning.&lt;ref&gt;Razzouk, R. and Shute, V. (2012) "What Is Design Thinking and Why Is It Important?" ''Review of Educational Research'', 82, 330–348&lt;/ref&gt; New courses in design thinking have also been introduced at university level, especially where linked with business and innovation studies. A notable early course of this type was introduced at [[Stanford University]] in 2003, the [[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]], known as the d.school.

==History==
Developing [[creativity]] techniques in the 1950s and new [[design methods]] in the 1960s led to the idea of design thinking as a particular approach to creatively solving problems. Among the first authors to write about design thinking were [[John E. Arnold]] in "Creative Engineering" (1959) and [[L. Bruce Archer]] in "Systematic Method for Designers" (1965).&lt;ref name="Arnold_1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, L. Bruce 1965"/&gt;

[[John E. Arnold]] was one of the first authors to use the term 'design thinking'. In "Creative Engineering" (1959) he distinguishes four areas of design thinking.&lt;ref name="Arnold_1959"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=J.E.|title=Creative Engineering: Promoting Innovation by Thinking Differently. Edited With an Introduction and Biographical Essay by William J. Clancey|publisher=Stanford Digital Repository|year=2016|orig-year=1959|url=https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:jb100vs5745/Creative%20Engineering%20-%20John%20E.%20Arnold.pdf |accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arnold, design thinking can yield (1) novel functionality, i.e. solutions that satisfy a novel need or solutions that satisfy an old need in an entirely new way, (2) higher performance levels of a solution, (3) lower production costs or (4) increased salability. Thus, according to this early concept, 'design thinking' covers all forms of product innovation, including especially incremental innovation ("higher performance") and radical innovation ("novel functionality").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=von Thienen|first=J.P.A.|last2=Clancey|first2=W.J.|last3=Corazza|first3=G.E.|last4=Meinel|first4=C.|title=Design thinking research. Making distinctions: Collaboration versus cooperation|place=Cham|publisher=Springer|series=Understanding Innovation|year=2017|chapter=Theoretical foundations of design thinking. Part I: John E. Arnold's creative thinking theories|editor-last=Plattner|editor-first=H.|editor2-last=Meinel|editor2-first=C.|editor3-last=Leifer|editor3-first=L.|pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold recommends a balanced approach: Product developers should seek opportunities in all four areas of design thinking. 

{{quote|It is rather interesting to look over the developmental history of any product or family of products and try to classify the changes into one of the four areas&amp;nbsp;... Your group, too, might have gotten into a rut and is inadvertently doing all of your ''design thinking'' in one area and is missing good bets in other areas.|J.E. Arnold|1959/2016|p. 119&lt;ref name="Arnold_1959" /&gt;}}

Although [[L. Bruce Archer]]'s "Systematic Method for Designers" (1965)&lt;ref name="Archer, L. Bruce 1965" /&gt; was concerned primarily with a systematic process of designing, it also expressed a need to broaden the scope of conventional design: "Ways have had to be found to incorporate knowledge of ergonomics, cybernetics, marketing and management science into ''design thinking''". Archer was also developing the relationship of design thinking with management: "The time is rapidly approaching when design decision making and management decision making techniques will have so much in common that the one will become no more than the extension of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Archer, L. Bruce. "Design Management" ''Management Decision'' 1.4 (1967): 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The notion of design as a "way of thinking" in [[science|the sciences]] can be traced to [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s 1969 book ''The Sciences of the Artificial'',&lt;ref name="simon_1969"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sciences of the Artificial|last=Simon|first=Herbert|publisher=MIT Press|year=1969|location=Cambridge|authorlink=Herbert A. Simon|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[design engineering]] to Robert McKim's 1973 book ''Experiences in Visual Thinking''.&lt;ref name="mckim_1973"&gt;{{cite book|title=Experiences in Visual Thinking|last=McKim|first=Robert|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Co|year=1973|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Lawson's 1980 book ''How Designers Think'', primarily addressing design in architecture, began a process of generalising the concept of design thinking.&lt;ref name="lawson_1980"&gt;Lawson, Bryan. ''How Designers Think: The Design Process Demystified.'' London: Architectural, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; A 1982 article by [[Nigel Cross]] on ''Designerly ways of knowing'' established some of the intrinsic qualities and abilities of design thinking that also made it relevant in general education and thus for wider audiences.&lt;ref name="cross_1982" /&gt; Peter Rowe's 1987 book ''Design Thinking'', which described methods and approaches used by architects and urban planners, was a significant early usage of the term in the design research literature.&lt;ref name="rowe_1987"&gt;{{cite book|title=Design Thinking|last=Rowe|first=G. Peter|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-262-68067-7|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international series of research symposia in design thinking began at [[Delft University of Technology]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N., Dorst, K. and N., Roozenburg (eds.) (1992) Research in Design Thinking, Delft University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (2018) A Brief History of the Design Thinking Research Symposium Series, ''Design Studies'' vol 57, 160–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilde, [http://fastefoundation.org/publications/integrating_creativity_into_the_ME_curriculum.pdf "Integrating Creativity into the Mechanical Engineering Curriculum"], Cary A.

"...&amp;nbsp;design thinking is any process that applies the methods of industrial designers to problems beyond how a product should look. My mentor at Stanford, Rolf Faste, did more than anyone to define the term and express the unique role that designers could play in making pretty much everything."&lt;/ref&gt; Design thinking was adapted for business purposes by Faste's Stanford colleague [[David M. Kelley]], who founded the design consultancy [[IDEO]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim. "The Making of a Design Thinker." ''Metropolis'' Oct. 2009: 60–62. p. 60: "David Kelley&amp;nbsp;... said that every time someone came to ask him about design, he found himself inserting the word thinking to explain what it is that designers do. The term design thinking stuck."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]'s 1992 article "Wicked Problems in Design Thinking" expressed a broader view of design thinking as addressing intractable human concerns through design.&lt;ref name="buchanan_1992"&gt;Buchanan, Richard, "Wicked Problems in Design Thinking," ''Design Issues'', vol. 8, no. 2, Spring 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1091">The '''''Encuentro Internacional de Escultura en Madera-Piedra-Hierro de Rosario''''' ("International Meeting of Wood-Stone-Iron Sculpture in Rosario") is an artistic event celebrated every year, since 1993, in [[Rosario]], [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]]. It is organized by the Sculptors Association of Rosario.

This event is attended by sculptors from Argentina and a number of other countries, and lasts about a week. It is always celebrated outdoors and before the eyes of the public. The artists must work on a roughly 180&amp;times;50 cm trunk, or an irregular-shaped stone over 0.25 m³, or pieces of [[iron]], in order to create a sculpture. Stone and iron works are then placed in public places of the city.

'''Environmental sculpture''' is sculpture that creates or alters the environment for the viewer, as opposed to presenting itself figurally or monumentally before the viewer. A frequent trait of larger environmental sculptures is that one can actually enter or pass through the sculpture and be partially or completely surrounded by it. Also, in the same spirit, it may be designed to generate shadows or reflections, or to color the light in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Britannica]] Online: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9032735/environmental-sculpture]  '''"20th-century art form intended to involve or encompass the spectators rather than merely to face them; the form developed as part of a larger artistic current that sought to break down the historical dichotomy between life and art."'''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture as environment ==
[[File:Eberhard Bosslet Intervention Bauzeichnung La Restinga II voll El Hierro 1983.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eberhard Bosslet]] construction drawing ''La Restinga II, El Hierro'', 1983]]

Julia M. Bush emphasizes the nonfigurative aspect of such works: "Environmental sculpture is never made to work at exactly human scale, but is sufficiently larger or smaller than scale to avoid confusion with the human image in the eyes of the viewer."&lt;ref&gt;(Busch, p.&amp;nbsp;27)."A Decade of Sculpture: the New Media in the 1960s" (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian-born [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Louise Nevelson]] is a pioneer of environmental sculpture in this sense. Busch (p.&amp;nbsp;27) also places the sculptures of [[Jane Frank]], as well as some works by [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]] and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], in this category. Some environmental sculpture so encompasses the observer that it verges on architecture.

[[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Duane Hanson]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Christo]], and [[Michael Heizer]] are well known practitioners of the genre, although Segal and Hanson's work is figural. Many figurative works of George Segal, for example, do qualify as environmental, in that—instead of being displayed on a pedestal as presentations to be gazed upon—they occupy and perturb the setting in which they are placed. A well known instance of this is the pair of Segal figures that sit on and stand next to one of the public benches in [[New York City]]'s Sheridan Square; anyone can sit amongst them.

A less known but more appropriate example is [[Athena Tacha]]'s {{convert|2|acre|m2|sing=on}} park ''Connections'' in downtown Philadelphia (between 18th St. and 19th St. two blocks north of Vine St.), created as a landscape art environment after her winning a competition in 1980 (where Segal was actually one of the finalists).  It was the first park designed entirely by an artist "sculpting the land" with planted terraces, rock clusters and paths (completed in 1992).

[[File:Lumen Poem 1985.jpg|thumb|''Lumen Poem'', by [[Jean-Max Albert]], 1985]]
A second sense of the term "environmental sculpture", with a somewhat different emphasis, is sculpture ''created for'' a particular set of surroundings. Thus, contemporary sculptor Beth Galston writes: "An environmental sculptor plans a piece from the very beginning in relationship to its surroundings. The site is a catalyst, becoming part of the creative process."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethgalston.com/AboutEnvSculpt.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is quite different from a Nevelson sculpture, which can usually be moved from place to place, like a conventional sculpture, without losing its meaning and effectiveness.

By Galston's definition, an environmental sculpture is not merely [[site-specific art]] as many conventional, figurative, marble monuments were created for specific sites.  Galston stresses that environmental sculpture entails the idea that the piece also functions to alter or permeate the existing environment or even to create a new environment in which the viewer is invited to participate: "The finished sculpture and site become one integrated unit, working together to create a unified mood or atmosphere," she writes. Many of the large, site-specific, [[minimalist]] sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] also qualify as environmental sculpture, in both senses described here. Much of what is called "[[land art]]" or "[[earth art]]" could also be termed environmental sculpture under this definition. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]] and [[Alan Sonfist]] (which see) are among notable current practitioners of [[land art]].

Since the mid-seventies, French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]] worked with [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] structures, deconstructing and re-arranging the elements of surrounding architecture or including the site into the sculpture&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Suner,''Les sculptures de visées du Parc de La Villette'', Urbanisme no 215, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sculptures Bachelard]].

Since 1983 German artist [[Eberhard Bosslet]] makes interventions on ruins, so-called "Re/formations and side effects"; he refers to the conditions of industrial and residential buildings by white painted lines or black painted color fields. In 1999 the artist Elena Paroucheva created her concept for pylons, integrating energy networks with sculptures.http://www.art-elena.com/

==Site-specific art and environmental art==
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|right|''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' by [[Robert Smithson]] from atop Rozel Point, in mid-April 2005]]
The term "[[site-specific art]]" is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[environmental art]]".  [[Louise Nevelson]], for instance is a pioneer American environmental artist with sources disagreeing on classifying her work as "environmental sculpture". The terms "environment sculpture", "site-specific art", and "environmental art" have not yet completely stabilized in their meanings.

A reason for blurred definitions is that much of site-specific and environmental art was created from 1970 on for public spaces all over the United States, sponsored by federal (GSA and NEA) or state and city [[Percent for Art]] competitions, and many of the artists were women trying to succeed outside the established art-gallery world.  Younger art historians will have to sort out the development of this marginalized "movement" and the importance of artists such as [[Olga Kisseleva]], [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Athena Tacha]], Mary Miss, [[Alice Adams (artist)|Alice Adams]], [[Elyn Zimmerman]], [[Merle Temkin]] and others who, from the early 1970s on, won and executed large outdoor public art commissions with new formal, kinesthetic and social underpinnings. Many of these artists were also ecologically conscious and created works that could offer a further definition of "environmental sculpture": art that is environmentally friendly and cares for the natural environment.

==Origin==
Flower Power originated in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], as a symbolic action of protest against the Vietnam War. In a November 1965 essay titled ''How to Make a March/Spectacle'', Ginsberg advocated that protesters should be provided with "masses of flowers" to hand out to policemen, press, politicians and spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Allen, "Demonstration or Spectacle as Example, As Communication, or How to Make a March/Spectacle", ''Berkeley Barb'', November 19, 1965, republished in ''The Portable Sixties Reader'', Ann Charles (Ed.), Penguin Classic, 2002, p.208-212 {{ISBN|978-0-14-200194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of props like flowers, toys, flags, candy and music were meant to turn anti-war rallies into a form of [[street theater]] thereby reducing the fear, anger and threat that is inherent within protests.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Shepard,[http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html "Absurd Responses vs. Earnest Politics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703163847/http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/BenShepard/shepard2.html |date=2008-07-03 }}, ''Journal of Aesthetics and Protest'', Volume 1, Issue 2, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Ginsberg wanted to counter the "specter" of the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang who supported the war, equated war protesters with communists and had threatened to violently disrupt planned anti-war demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Lewis |last=Hyde | title=On the poetry of Allen Ginsberg | publisher=University of Michigan Press | date=January 1, 1985 | page=264 | ISBN=0-472-06353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Allen | last=Ginsberg | title=Family Business: Selected Letters Between a Father and Son | chapter= |page=241 | publisher=Bloomsbury | date=September 7, 2002 | ISBN=1-58234-216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Barry | last=Miles | title=Hippie | page=50 | publisher=Sterling  | date=August 28, 2005 | ISBN=1-4027-2873-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Ginsberg's methods, the protest received positive attention and the use of "flower power" became an integral symbol in the counterculture movement.&lt;ref&gt;William Lawlor, ''Beat culture: lifestyles, icons, and impact'', ABC-CLIO (2005), p.126  {{ISBN|1-85109-400-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1966, the Flower Power method of [[guerilla theater]] had spread from California to other parts of the United States. The [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] in New York City staged numerous protests which included handing out balloons and flowers with their anti-war literature.&lt;ref name="Jezer"&gt;{{cite book | first=Marty | last=Jezer | title=Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel | publisher=Rutgers University Press | ISBN=978-0813520179 | page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Workshop in Nonviolence'' (WIN), a magazine published by New York activists, encouraged the use of Flower Power. In May 1967, [[Abbie Hoffman]] organized the Flower Brigade as an official contingent of a New York City parade honoring the soldiers in Vietnam. News coverage captured Flower Brigade participants, who carried flowers, flags and pink posters imprinted with LOVE, being attacked and beaten by bystanders.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt; In response to the violence, Hoffman wrote in WIN magazine, "Plans are being made to mine the East River with daffodils. Dandelion chains are being wrapped around induction centers.... The cry of 'Flower Power' echoes through the land. We shall not wilt."&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;

On the following Sunday in May 1967, WIN activists declared the [[Armed Forces Day]] as "Flower Power Day" and held a rally in [[Central Park]] to counter the traditional parade. Turnout was low and, according to Hoffman, the rally was ineffective because guerilla theater needed to be more confrontational.&lt;ref name="Jezer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Freid, ''The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!: Pageantry and Patriotism in Cold-War America'', Oxford University Press, (1999), p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-513417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1967, Hoffman and [[Jerry Rubin]] helped organize the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|March on the Pentagon]] using Flower Power concepts to create a theatrical spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Farrell, ''The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism'', Routledge, 1997, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; The idea included a call for marchers to attempt to levitate the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. When the marchers faced off against more than 2500 Army national guard troops forming a human barricade in front of the Pentagon, demonstrators held flowers and some placed flowers in the soldier's [[rifle barrel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carlito Rivera, "The 1967 March on the Pentagon and lessons for today" , ''Socialism and Liberation Magazine'', March 2007, retrieved 26-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs of flower-wielding protesters at the Pentagon March became seminal images of the 1960s anti-war protests. [[The Ultimate Confrontation: The Flower and the Bayonet|An image]] by French photojournalist [[Marc Riboud]] that was printed throughout the world was of seventeen-year-old high school student [[Jan Rose Kasmir]] clasping a daisy and gazing at bayonet-wielding soldiers. [[Smithsonian Magazine]] later called it "a gauzy juxtaposition of armed force and flower child innocence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Andrew | last=Curry | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Flower_Child.html | title=Flower Child | journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One photo, titled ''[[Flower Power (photograph)|Flower Power]]'' by Washington Star photographer [[Bernie Boston]], was nominated for the 1967 [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref name="Bernie"&gt;Bernie Boston, [https://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/photo/2007/03/17/PH2007031701303.html "Flower Power"], ''The Washington Evening Star'', October 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  The photo, taken on October 21, 1967, shows a young, long-haired man in a [[turtleneck sweater]], placing [[carnation]]s into the rifle barrels of [[military police|military policemen]]. (The young man in the photo is most commonly identified as George Edgerly Harris III, an 18-year-old actor from New York who later performed in San Francisco under the stage name of [[Hibiscus (entertainer)|Hibiscus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031701300.html | first=Davis | last=Montgomery | title=Flowers, Guns and an Iconic Snapshot | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=March 18, 2007 | page=D04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/magazine/karma-chameleon.html|title=Karma Chameleon|last=Silva|first=Hoaracio|date=August 17, 2003|work=New York Times Magazine|publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young man also has been identified by [[Paul Krassner]] as [[Youth International Party]] organizer, "Super-Joel" Tornabene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Paul | last=Krassner | authorlink=Paul Krassner | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-krassner/tom-waits-meets-superjoel_b_84035.html | title=Tom Waits Meets Super-Joel | date=January 30, 2008 | work=The Huffington Post | accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Cultural legacy==
The iconic center of the Flower Power movement was the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Ashbolt, [http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/2_07/Ashbolt.pdf "Go Ask Alice: Remembering the Summer of Love"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913113150/http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/2_07/Ashbolt.pdf |date=2009-09-13 }}, ''Australasian Journal of American Studies'', December 2007, p.35-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;Mandalit del Barco, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11650213 "Haight-Ashbury a Flower-Power Holdover"], ''Morning Edition'', National Public Radio, July 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1960s, the area, marked by the intersection of Haight and Ashbury streets, had become a focal point for psychedelic rock music.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perry, ''The Haight Ashbury: A History'', Wenner Books; Reprint edition (30 Mar 2007), 320pp , {{ISBN|1-932958-55-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians and bands like [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Janis Joplin]] all lived a short distance from the famous intersection. During the 1967 [[Summer of Love]], thousands of hippies gathered there, popularized by [[chart hit|hit]] songs such as "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]". A July 7, 1967, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story on "The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture" and an August [[CBS News]] television report on "The Hippie Temptation",&lt;ref&gt;Harry Reasoner, [http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm "The Hippie Temptation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319070344/http://www.sfsu.edu/~avitv/avcatalog/88444.htm |date=2006-03-19 }}, ''CBS News'', August 22, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other major media interest, exposed the hippie subculture to national attention and popularized the Flower Power movement across the country and around the world. That same summer, [[the Beatles]]' hit single "[[All You Need Is Love]]" served as an anthem for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiener|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Wiener|title=Come Together: John Lennon in His Time|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, Ill.|isbn=978-0-252-06131-8|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, the Beatles performed the song on the ''[[Our World (TV special)|Our World]]'' international satellite broadcast, ensuring that the pacifist message reached an audience estimated at 400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-beatles-make-history-with-all-you-need-is-love-a-minute-by-minute-breakdown-20140828 |title=The Beatles Make History With 'All You Need Is Love': A Minute-by-Minute Breakdown |last=Edwards |first=Gavin|date=28 August 2014|publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]]|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[avant-garde]] art of [[Milton Glaser]], [[Heinz Edelmann]], and [[Peter Max]] became synonymous with the flower power generation. Edelman's illustration style was best known in his art designs for the Beatles' 1968 animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Glaser, the founder of [[Push Pin Studios]], also developed the loose psychedelic graphic design, seen for example in his seminal 1966 poster illustration of [[Bob Dylan]] with paisley hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cooperhewitt.org/NDA/WINNERS/2004/LIFETIMEACHIEVEMENT/index.shtml | title=2004 Lifetime Achievement Award | series=National Design Awards | work=Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum | accessdate=2011-03-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215182403/http://cooperhewitt.org/NDA/WINNERS/2004/LIFETIMEACHIEVEMENT/index.shtml | archivedate=2010-12-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the posters by pop artist [[Peter Max]], with their vivid fluid designs painted in [[Day-Glo]] colors, which became visual icons of flower power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Arts &amp; Entertainment Fads | first1=Frank W. | last1=Hoffman | first2=William G. | last2=Bailey | pages= 163–164 | publisher=Haworth Press |date=August 1990 | ISBN=0-86656-881-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max's cover story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine (September 1969) as well as appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', further established "flower power" style art into mainstream culture.&lt;ref name='ArtofPeterMax'&gt;{{cite book | last = Riley II | first = Charles A. | coauthors = | title = The Art of Peter Max | publisher = Abrams, New York | year = 2002 |edition= 1st | location = | pages = 228–235 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8109-3270-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederic Richard "Dickie" Sullivan'''&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 2.  Although Sullivan was sometimes credited as "Frederick" or "Fred", his birthname, as shown on his birth certificate was "Frederic Richard Sullivan".  See General Record Office index of births for the third quarter of 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes credited as "Frederick"; 18 July 1872 &amp;ndash; 24 July 1937), was an English-born American [[film director]] and actor of the [[silent film|silent era]]. He directed 34 films between 1913 and 1923. He also appeared in 29 films between 1913 and 1935.  He also acted on stage.  He was a nephew of the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].

==Early life==
Sullivan was born in [[Pimlico]] in London, England, the son of [[Fred Sullivan]] and Charlotte Louisa Lacy (1841–1885). His uncle was composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].  He had seven brothers and sisters: Amy Sophie (1863–1947), Florence Louise (1865–1891), Edith Mary (1866–1877), [[Herbert Sullivan|Herbert "Bertie" Thomas]] (1868–1928), Maud "Cissie" Helen (1870–1940), George Arthur (1874–1919) and William Lacy (1877–1902). Sullivan's father died in 1877, leaving his pregnant mother with seven children under the age of 14.  After his father's death, Sullivan's uncle Arthur visited the family often and became guardian to all of the children. In 1881, Charlotte married Captain Benjamin Hutchinson, a man 13 years her junior.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1883, at the urging of Charlotte's brother, William Lacy, the family emigrated to [[Los Angeles, California]], in the United States, except for Sullivan's eldest brother, Bertie, who stayed with their uncle Arthur in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlotte died in January 1885, barely a year after the move to the U.S. Sullivan's stepfather, Hutchinson, unable to cope with this loss and his responsibilities, soon returned to England, leaving the six surviving children (Edith had died) to be brought up mostly by their uncle William, with the financial support of their uncle Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, the family went on a sightseeing trip of the American West with their visiting uncle Arthur, who continued to support the family until his death in 1900 and in his will.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 14-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career, marriage and children==
Sullivan directed at least 34 films, during the [[silent film|silent era]], between [[1913 in film|1913]] and [[1923 in film|1923]]. He also acted in at least 29 films between 1913 and [[1935 in film|1935]], including the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', and he appeared on stage, including in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, from 1905 to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=100612 "Frederick Sullivan"] at the IBDB database, accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan married Kate Webb in 1902, and the couple had two daughters, Helen Mary (1906–1966) and Sheila (born 1919). Kate died in 1921, and Sullivan died in [[Los Angeles, California]] at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/genealogy/fred_r.pdf Genealogy record for Frederic Richard Sullivan], 1998, accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Half Price Books, Records, Magazines, Incorporated''' is the largest family-owned chain of new and used [[bookstore]]s in the [[United States]]. The company’s original motto is "We buy and sell anything printed or recorded except yesterday's newspaper", and many of the used books, music, and movies for sale in each location are purchased from local residents. The corporate office is located in the flagship [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Northwest Highway]] location in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Half Price Books now operates more than 127 stores (including outlets) in 17 states.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Stores|url=https://www.hpb.com/stores/|publisher=Half Price Books|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:HPB Dallas NWH 20100329.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Half Price Books Northwest Highway, the corporate headquarters, on E. Northwest Highway in [[Dallas, Texas]]]]
[[File:Half Price Books, Berkeley.JPG|thumb|Half Price Books in [[Berkeley, California]]]]

Founders Ken Gjemre and Pat Anderson opened the first store in 1972 in a former [[laundromat]] in Dallas, Texas, filling the shelves with 2,000 books out of their personal libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Passings Ken Gjemre, 81; Left Corporate Career to Found Bookstore Chain|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/01/local/me-passing1.3|accessdate=25 July 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat Anderson’s daughter, Sharon Anderson Wright, is the company’s current President and [[CEO]]. In 2009, Sharon's sister Ellen O'Neal stepped up to the position of Chairperson of the Board in order to become more involved with the family business.

==Philanthropy==
The Half Price Books original mission statement includes the promise to "promote [[literacy]] and be kind to the environment."&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lasica|first1=JD|title=Where to Find Nonprofit, Independent &amp; Progressive Booksellers|url=http://www.socialbrite.org/tag/half-price-books/|accessdate=July 25, 2017|publisher=SocialBrite}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers and librarians, for example, are offered a year-round 10% discount on purchases.&lt;ref name=Social /&gt; Each year, every Half Price Books store holds a book drive to collect new or gently used children's books, building "Half Pint Libraries" at non-profit organizations and schools in the communities it serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Half Pint Library|url=http://b.hpb.com/half-pint-library-book-drive/|publisher=Half Price Books|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has promoted [[recycling]] and reusing, and the sound management of paper, energy and water resources. In 2008, Half Price Books launched a formal environmental education initiative called “B(eco)me Green” to help spread knowledge about the health of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.becomegreen.org|website=b(eco)me green|title=Become Green|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the chain donates millions of books and its overstock inventory to non-profit organizations around the world such as [[Feed the Children]] and [[American Red Cross]]. It also gives some of its books to [[Better World Books]], a for-profit on-line bookseller.

==Publishing==
Half Price Books publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. Half Price Books reprints these titles under its publishing arm, Hackberry Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/hackberry-press-75664818.html|title=Hackberry Press {{en dash}} Trademark|publisher=Trademarkia|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Hackberry Press titles is the Half Price Books children's storybook series ''[[Say Good Night to Illiteracy]]'', with 13 editions in print. All proceeds from the series benefit family [[literacy]] organizations such as Reach Out and Read and the National Center for Family Literacy.

The company is a strong proponent of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] freedom of speech and Americans’ right to knowledge and the expression of ideas.  Its website “deletecensorship.org” supports imaginative and courageous books, including those that address controversial topics and have been censored or banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deletecensorship.org|website=DeleteCensorship|title=Delete Censorship|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wholesale==
The wholesale division of Half Price Books is Texas Bookman, also headquartered in Dallas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manta.com/c/mmj4mfz/texas-bookman|title=Texas Bookman|accessdate=February 21, 2018|publisher=Manta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas Bookman sells trade and scholarly remainders at discount prices to wholesale buyers around the world.

[[File:Venereum in the House of Sallust.jpg|thumb|A [[venereum]] in the House of Sallust]] 
The '''House of Sallust''' is a [[domus]] or elite residence in the ancient Roman city of [[Pompeii]]. The oldest parts of the house have been dated to the 4th century BC, but the main expansions were built in the 2nd century BC. The long history of this structure provides important evidence about the development of elite residences in Pompeii. The house is located on the east side of the Via Consolare. It received its modern name from an election notice placed on the facade, recommending Gaius Sallustius for office. An alternative name is the House of A. Cossus Libanus, from a seal found in the ruins.

It was first excavated between 1805 and 1809, was damaged by a bomb in [[World War II]], and was restored in 1970.

==History==
[[File:Plan of House of Sallust.JPG|thumb|A rough plan of the House of Sallust.]]
The House of Sallust was originally a single [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] house from the Samnite Period, and was made of Tufa blocks. It had six shops on its west side and an entrance corridor in the middle. This went through into the atrium with [[compluvium]] and impluvium. The atrium contained two alae, four cubicula, a [[tablinum]], four other rooms and a garden.

Over time, we can see the addition of new features, such as the [[peristyle]] (a colonnaded garden) which was imported from Greece in the 2nd century BC, and the second atrium, which also became popular around this time. It eventually expanded to use almost all the garden space, but its development was cut short due to the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].

'''''How Music Works''''' is a non-fiction book by [[David Byrne]], a musician, writer, and public figure best known for his work with the group [[Talking Heads]]. He discusses the form and influence of music in a non-linear narrative fashion, using a variety of experiences from his career to create something part [[autobiography]] and part [[music theory]]. The book was published through [[McSweeney's]] on September 12, 2012, and was named as one of [[Amazon.com]]'s "Best Books of the Month" in that same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000829021|title=Best Books of the Month: September 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; It has received mainly positive reviews.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt;&lt;ref name=club/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:Talking Heads band3.jpg|thumb|Talking Heads performing at [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in [[Toronto]] in 1978.]]

The book, despite being non-fiction, has a highly non-linear structure with manual-like information, elements of Byrne's [[autobiography]], and anthropological data on [[music theory]] all intermixed, each chapter able to stand alone. Byrne looks at the influence of music, even in such subtle forms as birdsongs, from a rational perspective that eschews [[romanticism]].&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Overall, he writes that no music "is aimed exclusively at either the body or the head", with complex human beings interacting with it on different levels.&lt;ref name=club/&gt;

He discusses his career with [[Talking Heads]], detailing many points of background for their music. He describes how the lyrics to the 1980 song "[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" drew inspiration from a recording of a preacher as well as how the oversize suits worn in their [[concert film]] ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' drew inspiration from ancient Japanese theatre.&lt;ref name=keens/&gt; Byrne avoids bringing back up the personality conflicts leading to the band's demise, and he instead goes through their history, [[Talking Heads discography|album by album]], to detail his views on performances versus recordings as well as the effects of money and fame. In particular, he spends a chapter on the [[CBGB]] [[nightclub]] and the underlying conditions that supported the development of new, avant-garde artists such as [[Patti Smith]], [[the Ramones]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and others besides his own band.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-byrne/how-music-works/|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|accessdate=November 3, 2012|title=HOW MUSIC WORKS|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne writes,
{{quote|"I’ve made money, and I’ve been ripped off... I’ve had creative freedom, and I’ve been pressured to make hits. I have dealt with diva behavior from crazy musicians, and I have seen genius records by wonderful artists get completely ignored... If you think success in the world of music is determined by the number of records sold, or the size of your house or bank account, then I’m not the expert for you. I am more interested in how people can manage a whole lifetime in music."&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinion/how-music-works-by-david-byrne/2012/09/22/341d210e-fb73-11e1-b2af-1f7d12fe907a_story.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|title="How Music Works" by David Byrne|date=September 22, 2012|author=[[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]]|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reviews==
A supportive review ran in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', with Oliver Keens stating that "David Byrne deserves great praise". Keens referred to the book as "as accessible as pop yet able to posit deep and startlingly original thoughts and discoveries in almost every paragraph", and he added that "this book will make you hear music in a different way." He remarked as well that "Talking Heads fans will find much to savour" and that "Byrne shows not just how music works, but how music publishing should work too."&lt;ref name=keens&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/artsandentertainmentbooksreview/9573776/How-Music-Works-by-David-Byrne-review.html|title=How Music Works by David Byrne: review|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012|first=Oliver|last=Keens|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also published a positive review. Critic Jason Heller remarked that "joy—of singing and playing, of thinking and dancing, of listening and wondering—renders almost every page a song." In addition, he wrote, "Byrne’s knack for paradox and passion carries his erratic narrative."&lt;ref name=club&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/david-byrne-how-music-works,84993/|first=Jason|last=Heller|date=September 17, 2012|accessdate=November 3, 2012|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|title=David Byrne: How Music Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' critic [[Tim Page (critic)|Tim Page]] commented, "This is a decidedly generous book—welcoming, informal, digressive, full of ideas and intelligence—and one has the pleasant sense that Byrne is speaking directly to the reader, sharing a few confidences he has picked up over the years." Stating that "Byrne has plenty of smart things to say about pop music", Page lauded the "ambitious" work.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book as "a supremely intelligent, superbly written dissection of music as an art form and way of life." The magazine stated in addition that "anyone at all interested in music will learn a lot from this book."&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;

On the other hand, for ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]], the book is "a roll of mental wallpaper, a textbook for a survey course you didn’t mean to sign up for. It drifts between music history, sonic anthropology, mild biographical asides, broad pop theory and grandfatherly financial and artistic advice. It’s all the things Mr. Byrne’s twitchy and alienated music with Talking Heads never was: genial, well-meaning, as forgettable as a real estate agent’s handshake." &lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/books/how-music-works-by-david-byrne.html?_r=0|first=Dwight|last=Garner|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2013|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=A Talking Head Has Something to Say. ‘How Music Works,’ by David Byrne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">This is a '''list of aesthetic principles of music'''.  It enumerates the various qualities by which music is judged aesthetically.

*''[[Blues]]'', an [[African American]] musical genre and quality of music that reflects an emotionally genuine soul and expresses melancholy, loneliness and tragedy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mariza lifts fado to higher level|work=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0608030290aug04,1,5455261.story?coll=chi-entertainment-utl|accessdate=October 13, 2006|author=Reich, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Conyach'', a musical quality that provokes the venting of emotions in listeners, associated with the music of Scottish Travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Dor'', a "pleasant feeling of melancholy" especially evoked by the [[doina]] music &lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Simon, "Taraf Traditions" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 237 - 247&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[duende (art)|Duende]]'', a complex emotional quality of Spanish music, especially [[flamenco]] &lt;ref&gt;Fairley, Jan, "A Wild, Savage Feeling in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 279 - 291&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Spice mix#Masala|Masala]]'', a term borrowed from Indian cookery to intend a Mumbai spicy musical mixture and the local production of movies and music (see also [[Masala film]])
*''[[Sakit Hati]]'' (lit. Indonesian for ''sick liver''), an Indonesian term, associated with the [[degung]] genre denoting a sense of wistful long and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Colin, "No Risk - No Fun!", in the ''Rough Guides to World Music'', pg. 131 - 142&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mehna]]'', a term associated with Algeria [[raï]] music and is said to be similar to ''duende'' &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Andy, "Music Under Fire" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pg. 413–424&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Salsa music|Salsa]]'', closely associated with the salsa genre, the term ''salsa'' denoting a "wild" and "frenzied" musical experience, being used as a vocal interjection to acknowledge the musical excitement of a performance.  This usage can also express a sense of pan-Latin cultural identity, based around the "hotness" and "spiciness" of Latin culture.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, pg. 46; Morales, pp 56 - 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Saudade]]'', a Portuguese term, referring to an important element of [[fado]]; ''saudade'' is a mood, described as "a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably can not exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness, but an indolent dreaming wistfulness", with roots in "Islamic [[fatalism]], sailors' loneliness, and the unrequited love which was the perennial theme of [[troubadour]] poetry" &lt;ref&gt;Manuel, ''Popular Musics'', pg. 119: Manuel is the source of the "Islamic fatalism... troubadour poetry", and he sources "a vague and constant... indolent dreaming wistfulness" to Aubrey Bell, in Gallop, ''Portugal'', 262&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[soul music|Soul]]'', is a music genre, and also a quality of music or of performance which evokes an emotional state and is reflective of African American performance techniques &lt;ref name="Friedman pg. 46"&gt;Singer and Friedman, cited in Manuel, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Swing (genre)|Swing]]'', [[Swing (dance)|swing dance]] and swing jazz, a genre of popular dance music, and a quality of emotionally and culturally genuine music in the African American community &lt;ref name="Friedman pg. 46"/&gt;
*''[[Tezeta]]'', an [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian musical]] term, evocative of melancholy, nostalgia and bittersweet longing, being originally a traditional song, then a genre, a [[musical mode]] and a marker of cultural identity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/music/planet/stories/s604793.htm|title=Ethiopian Blues &amp; Ballads|work=The Planet|accessdate=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[hip hop]] group [[Beastie Boys]] recorded many songs during their career. Between 1982 and 2012, the group [[Beastie Boys discography|released]] eight [[studio album]]s, four [[compilation album]]s, seven [[extended play]]s, and forty [[Single (music)|singles]]. Beginning in 1981 as a four-piece [[hardcore punk]] group, Beastie Boys consisted of [[Mike D|Michael "Mike D" Diamond]], [[Adam Yauch|Adam "MCA" Yauch]], [[Kate Schellenbach]], and John Berry.{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|p=14}} In 1982, after the release of the EP, ''[[Polly Wog Stew]]'', Berry left the group and was replaced by [[Ad-Rock|Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz]].{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=15, 16}} A year later, the group released their debut single, "[[Cooky Puss]]", which marked a change in style to a more [[hip-hop]] oriented sound.&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barshad |first1=Amos |title=Rude Boys |url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=October 22, 2017 |pages=2 |date=April 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301015036/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |archivedate=March 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single garnered the attention of New York University student [[Rick Rubin]], who, in 1984, would form [[Def Jam Recordings]] with [[Russell Simmons]] and ask Beastie Boys to join his label.{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=18, 19}} Afterwards, Schellenbach left the group and the remaining three, Ad-Rock, Mike D, and MCA, decided to focus their attention on [[Rapping|rap]].{{sfn|Zwickel|2011|pp=18, 19}}

With Rubin's assistance on writing and producing, Beastie Boys released the singles "[[Rock Hard]]" in 1984 and "[[She's on It]]" in 1985, before releasing their debut studio album, ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'', in November 1986.&lt;ref name="allmusic bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|authorlink1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Beastie Boys – Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/beastie-boys-mn0000038469/biography|website=''[[AllMusic]]''|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was a huge commercial success, and received critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="rs bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beastie Boys Bio|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/beastie-boys/biography|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|authorlink1=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Licensed to Ill'' – Beastie Boys|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/licensed-to-ill-mw0000649870|website=''[[AllMusic]]''|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to financial disagreements, Beastie Boys broke away from Def Jam and signed with [[Capitol Records]] in California.

The '''Mansudae Art Studio''' is an art studio in [[Phyongchon District|Pyeongcheon District]], [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]]. It was founded in 1959,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mansudae Art Studio - North Korean Art, Korean art, North Korea, Pyongyang, Mansudae, DPRK, woodcut, socialist realism, propaganda art, embroidery, Korean exhibition, Kim Jong Il, jewel painting, Kim Il Sung |url=http://www.mansudaeartstudio.com/ |website=www.mansudaeartstudio.com |accessdate=2015-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233912/http://www.mansudaeartstudio.com/ |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the largest centers of art production in the world, at an area of over 120,000 square meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = North Korea's Arts Scene Is Just As Mysterious As The Nation Itself|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-art-scene_55ef4c0ee4b093be51bc9a0a|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio employs around 4,000 people, 1,000 of whom are artists picked from the best academies in North Korea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behind Mansudae: Art from the Biggest Studio in North Korea {{!}} VICE {{!}} United States|url = https://www.vice.com/read/behind-mansudae-the-most-prominent-art-institution-in-north-korea|website = VICE|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Paintings by DPRK's Mansudae Art Studio debut in Shenyang[1]- Chinadaily.com.cn|url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/art/2015-02/09/content_19528623.htm|website = www.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of its artists are graduates of Pyongyang University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The artists do not receive profits from their works, however, as all proceeds go to the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The studio consists of 13 groups, including those for [[woodcut]]s, charcoal drawings, ceramics, [[embroidery]] and jewel paintings, among other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The studio has produced many of North Korea's most important monuments, such as the [[Monument to Party Founding|Monument to the Founding of the Korean Workers Party]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mansudae Art Studio, North Korea's Colossal Monument Factory|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-06-06/mansudae-art-studio-north-koreas-colossal-monument-factory|website = BloombergView|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chollima Statue]], and the [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument|Mansudae Monument]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ArtAsiaPacific: Hollow Monuments|url = http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/72/HollowMonuments|website = artasiapacific.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Controversial Senegalese Monument Built by North Korean Propaganda Artists|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2014/08/04/the_african_renaissance_monument_in_dakar_senegal.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2014-08-04|access-date = 2015-12-08|issn = 1091-2339|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its foreign commercial division is known as the [[Mansudae Overseas Projects|Mansudae Overseas Project Group of Companies]], which as of 2014 has created monuments for 18 African and Asian nations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; All images of the Kim family are produced by the Mansudae Art Studio.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before his death, the Mansudae Art Studio was under the guidance of [[Kim Jong-il]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mansudae Art Studio|url = https://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/kci-2011-public-apperances/mansudae-art-studio/|website = North Korea Leadership Watch|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, the studio has had its own space also in the 798 Art District in Beijing, China, known as the Mansudae Art Museum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Organization and management ==
[[File:Mansudae Art Studio. Pyongyang, North Korea 01.jpg|thumb|Artists working on ceramics at Mansudae Art Studio]]
The studio consists of around 4,000 workers, 1,000 of whom are artists aged from their mid-20s to mid-60s and selected from the best academies in the country, especially from Pyongyang University. The studio takes up over 120,000 square meters, 80,000 of which are indoors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The campus-like studio includes a soccer stadium, sauna, medical clinic, paper mill, kindergarten, and even a gift shop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The studio is a state-approved destination for foreign tourists, and the gift shop has enabled tourists to purchase North Korean art for years, as selling artwork is one of the North Korea state's easiest means of gaining foreign currency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The studio is made up of thirteen groups that manufacture different types of artwork (ranging from oil paintings to ceramics and bronze statues), manufacturing plants, and more than 50 supply departments that produce and test art materials such as paint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to the studio's official website, the studio is not a school or a Chinese-style chain factory, but rather a high quality production center that employs over half of the nation's artists who have received the two highest artistic awards available in North Korea. The manager of the studio's website, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has also claimed that the Mansudae Art Studio receives profits from the website's sales directly, as it has economic autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mansudae Art Studio has a sports team in the annual [[Paektusan Prize Games of Civil Servants]].&lt;ref name="naen_TheP"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Civil servants show skills in annual games  | author = Ri Sung-ik | work = The Pyongyang Times | date = 2017-01-31 | accessdate = 2017-05-16 | url = http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/order/pytimes/?page=Sports&amp;no=23641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Mansudae Art Studio was established in the [[Pyongyang]], the capital of the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK, or North Korea), on November 17, 1959, six years after the end of the [[Korean War]]. Before his death in 2011, the studio operated under Kim Jong-il's "special guidance."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ties with Italy ==
The Mansudae Art Studio's affiliation with Italy began in 2005 with Pier Luigi Cecioni, whose position as president of an orchestra in [[Florence|Florence, Italy]], allowed him to come into contact with the studio. Cecioni's orchestra was invited to perform at the Spring Friendship Festival held in Pyongyang. While in Pyongyang, Cecioni inquired as to whether North Korea had "any art center or gallery to show [him],"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and was taken to Mansudae Art Studio which at the time was little known outside of North Korea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cecioni offered to help the studio "do something in the West,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and in January 2006 he returned to Pyongyang with his brother, an artist, Director of the Florence [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Fine Arts Academy]] in Florence, and director of an exhibition center near Florence. The Cecioni brothers selected several Mansudae works to bring back to Europe&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and signed an agreement of exclusivity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which established Pier Luigi Cecioni as a liaison&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; between Mansudae and the West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A provision of this agreement was that Cecioni would organize exhibitions of artwork from Mansudae in the West.

Around the same time as the first of these exhibitions was organized, Cecioni began building The official web site of the Mansudae Art Studio.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cecioni facilitates the studio's international sales of small pieces of artwork, such as paintings,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; through this website, which offers a brief history of the studio, information about Mansudae exhibitions outside North Korea, a directory of Mansudae artists, and listings of paintings for sale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some artists from Mansudae have been periodically sent abroad, including to Italy. In 2012, Cecioni accompanied some Mansudae artists to the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]] and the [[Vatican Museums]], which he said the North Korean artists appreciated and recognized from their university studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Mansudae Art Museum ==
In 2009, Mansudae Art Studio's presence was made known in the [[798 Art Zone]] in [[Beijing|Beijing, China]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The studio has its own space in 798 called [[Mansudae Art Museum]], though unlike most museums many of the works in its collection are for sale and are comparable to paintings available on Mansudae's website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The museum sells both original and copied [[Socialist realism|socialist-realist]] paintings, statues, and posters as well as stamps and postcards. The stamp and postcard themes range from nature to Kim family cars, but they mostly emphasize the relationship between North Korea and China (for example, there are stamps of every Chinese politician to have ever visited North Korea).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = LONG LIVE MANSUDAE {{!}} 艺术界 LEAP|url = http://leapleapleap.com/2011/04/long-live-mansudae/|website = leapleapleap.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was the first North Korean art gallery abroad and is a North Korea-approved tourist destination.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mansudae Art Studio Gallery|url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mansudae-art-studio-gallery|website = Atlas Obscura|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's entrance is marked by a smaller version of Pyongyang's [[Chollima Statue]] sitting on top of a beige pedestal over six meters tall.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Exhibitions and products ==

=== Exhibitions ===
Mansudae had its first overseas exhibition in [[London]] in July and August 2007 at La Galaria in Pall Mall curated by David Heather The then Ambassador attended the opening and it ran for 6 weeks .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mansudae Artists to visit London from DPRK in November|url = http://londonkoreanlinks.net/2014/09/08/mansudae-artists-to-visit-london-from-dprk-in-november/|website = London Korean Links|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Philip|last = Gowman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, despite much preparation by five invited Mansudae artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=North Korean artists prepare for exhibition in Australia |publisher=AP|website=YouTube|date=July 23, 2015|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaKD_SpO6lI|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australia Accused Of Censorship Over North Korean Art|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/08/australia-accused-of-cens_n_384417.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition in [[Brisbane|Brisbane, Australia]] presented Mansudae artworks without their artists. Although only one of the fifteen pieces was socialist-realist, the Australian government denied the artists exceptions from a visa ban on North Korea because they came "from Pyongyang's propaganda machine and... are not welcome." &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; On October 10, 2013, a popular Mansudae exhibition opened at a [[Trade fair|trade exposition]] in [[Dandong|Dandong, China]]. The exhibition had no [[propaganda]] art and sold 30 pieces in its first three days.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2014, David Heather, who curated the London exhibition in 2007, decided to recreate the success of the 2007 exhibition.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The exhibition was held at the [[Embassy of North Korea, London|North Korean Embassy in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = North Korean embassy hosts art exhibition in London|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/03/north-korea-london-embassy-mansudae|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Hamish Macdonald for NK|last = News|first2 = part of the North Korea|last2 = network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mansudae artists involved with the event stayed in London for two weeks beforehand to prepare&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and were available to paint for people while in England.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Paintings ===
[[File:Mansudae Art Studio (14887504767).jpg|thumb|An artist painting at Mansudae Art Studio]]
Mansudae produces many paintings, including "all public images of [[Kim Jong-un]], [[Kim Jong-il]], and [[Kim Il-sung]]" and ''"One Can Always Lose'', a series of 10 paintings depicting North Korea's 1-0 win over Italy during round one of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Several of the paintings have a uniform style of depicting North Korea as a [[utopia]]. However, according to Klaus Klemp, the deputy director of Frankfurt’s Museum of Applied Art, Mansudae artists can "produce kitschy knockoffs of several foreign genres" that are likely sold internationally.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mansudae's official website has a gallery&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; of paintings ranging "from propaganda posters to lucid landscapes, flower bouquets, and even family portraits," as well as the occasional rare jewel painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jewel paintings are unique to North Korea and are made by grinding gems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = All official portraiture of North Korea’s reigning Kim family is made by Mansudae Art Studio. {{!}} Looking at Art {{!}} Stories {{!}} COLORS Magazine|url = http://www.colorsmagazine.com/stories/magazine/87/story/all-official-portraiture-of-north-koreas-reigning-kim-family-is-made-by-man|website = www.colorsmagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; into powders that are put on a canvas by hand and never lose their strong shine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Capitalist in North Korea: My Seven Years in the Hermit Kingdom|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MJkdBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Tuttle Publishing|date = 2014-08-12|isbn = 9781462914104|first = Felix|last = Abt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statues in North Korea ==
[[File:Chollima statue 05.JPG|thumb|[[Chollima statue]] at the foot of [[Mansu Hill]]]]
[[File:Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il statues from Flickr.jpg|thumb|Bronze statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il at [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument]]]]
Mansudae Art Studio has created statues and sculptures that have been placed all over the country, with three of the most important and famous works being the [[Chollima Statue|Chollima statue]], the [[Monument to Party Founding|Monument to the Founding of the Korean Workers Party]], and of course the bronze statues of [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]] at the [[Mansu Hill Grand Monument]]. These monuments are common tourist destinations, and the statues of the deceased Kims are on just about every North Korean travel itinerary.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mansudae Grand Monument - Lonely Planet|url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/north-korea/pyongyang/sights/landmarks-monuments/mansudae-grand-monument|website = Lonely Planet|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1961,&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; the Chollima statue, which has a replica at the Mansudae Art Museum in Beijing,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; is a depiction of a legendary winged horse that could fly a thousand ''li'' (about 300 miles) a day. The horse has a male worker and a female peasant riding on its back, "symbolizing the heroic spirit of the Korean People"&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and heading into North Korea's future.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Built in 1995 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea|North Korean Workers Party]],&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 7 Most Ostentatious Monuments in North Korea|url = http://scribol.com/art-and-design/7-most-ostentatious-monuments-in-north-korea|website = scribol.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Monument to the Founding of the Korean Workers Party is 164 feet tall and depicts three "truck-size" fists holding a hammer, a [[sickle]], and a [[calligraphy]] brush respectively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Mansu Hill Grand Monument is perhaps the most well-known image used to represent North Korea. The monument includes two bronze statues that are 20 meters tall, making them the largest statues in the country.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The monument has changed over time, as it began with just one statue of Kim Il-sung and was dedicated to him on his 60th birthday in 1972.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In 2012,&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; a statue of Kim Jong-il was added, only to be recast a few months later to change out the statue's overcoat with a parka in honor of the [[Parka|anorak]] Kim Jong-il was commonly seen wearing throughout his life, which was labeled a "witness of history" upon his death and was talked about with much emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statue Makeover: North Korea Replaces Kim Jong-Il’s Staid Overcoat With 'Revolutionary' Anorak|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/12/north-korea-bronze-statue-kim-jong-ils-anorak_n_2668136.html|website = The Huffington Post UK|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mansudae Overseas Project Group ==
{{Main|Mansudae Overseas Projects}}
Mansudae Art Studio has an international division, the [[Mansudae Overseas Projects|Mansudae Overseas Project Group]], which was established in 1970s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This division is a thriving multimillion-dollar business that has created monuments, museums, stadiums, and palaces for several countries, including Algeria, Botswana, Cambodia, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Germany, Malaysia, Mozambique, Madagascar, Senegal, Syria, Togo, and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Pier Luigi Cecioni, the success of this small [[Putting-out system|cottage industry]] is due to Mansudae's "competence and experience to realize such huge projects, and it can send large teams of artists and workers to foreign countries for a long time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Preliminary work is done at the Mansudae Art Studio, and designs are tested to determine resistance to [[natural disaster]]s. Some believe that the group has "no competition worldwide," as one Mansudae sculptor told a German publication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Fairy Tale Fountain ===
[[File:Frankfurt Untermainanlage Märchenbrunnen.20130305.jpg|thumb|Frankfurt's Fairy Tale Fountain]]
In 2004, Klaus Klemp, deputy director of [[Frankfurt]]'s Museum of Applied Art, discovered and was impressed by Mansudae's craftsmanship. Klemp convinced Frankfurt's officials to hire the Mansudae Overseas Project Group to reconstruct Frankfurt's Fairy Tale Fountain, an "[[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] relic from 1910 that had been melted down for its metal during [[World War II]]" for which the original [[blueprint]]s had gone missing. The Project Group was chosen for its early 1900s style, ability to recreate the fountain based on old photographs, and attractive prices. The fountain is the only commission that the group has won from a Western country.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== African Renaissance Monument ===

Perhaps the group's most notable monument is also one of its most controversial: [[African Renaissance Monument|Senegal's African Renaissance Monument]]. Unveiled in 2010, it stands at 50 meters, which is taller than the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and depicts a half-nude African family of three in a [[socialist realism|socialist-realist]] pose.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A former president of Senegal, [[Abdoulaye Wade]], hired the group because it was the only organization that he could afford. It took the work of around 150 Mansudae artists to complete. Senegalese unions protested the foreign labor due to the 50 percent unemployment rate at the time, the [[Muslim]] majority of the population was offended by the exposed breast of the mother figure, and Wade had to have the heads redone as they looked Korean rather than African.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Significance ==
Mansudae Art Studio may be the largest art factory in the world. The studio is extremely important in North Korea as it employs the best artists and is the only organization "officially sanctioned to portray the Kim family dynasty."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Positions at Mansudae are prestigious and desirable, especially as part of the Overseas Project Group. Mansudae workers sent overseas live under strict security, but they are fed regularly and earn better wages than most North Koreans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since its founding in 1959, Mansudae has reproduced, reflected, and shaped the country's [[Aestheticism|aesthetic]]. North Korea "spends much of its budget on Kim family [[deification]]," which likely includes and thus funds Mansudae, as the studio produces [[propaganda]] ranging from monuments to the party to the Kim pins worn by all North Koreans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mansudae's propaganda output is essential to the North Korean government. According to Pier Luigi Cecioni, the studio is so important to the country and its government that it "has the status of a ministry[ and] is not subject to the Ministry of Culture.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas''' is an award-winning visual contemporary artist, author and speaker. His work has been seen in public spaces, museums, galleries and private collections across globe. Institutional collections include the British Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Seattle Art Museum and Vancouver Art Gallery. A lot of Michael's art is inspired by the work he does with The Christensen Fund. The Christensen Fund is a private foundation that buttresses the efforts of people and institutions inspired by a bio and culturally diverse world infused with artistic expression and lives and environments that are beautiful, bountiful and resilient.

==Early life==
Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas was born in 1954 in Masset, Haida Gwaii. He is a descendant of the influential artists, [[Isabella Edenshaw]], [[Charles Edenshaw]]. Yahgulanaas was a prolific young artist who soon covered the walls and ceilings of his bedroom with drawings. When those spaces were filled he found the fingernails of schoolmates to be an interesting platte for intricate multicoloured paintings. His artistic passion was curtailed somewhat in the decades that he in elected and volunteer public work including the creation of an multicultural community endowment, the [http://www.gwaiitrust.com/aboutus/ourhistory.html Gwaii Trust].

==Art career==
Yahgulanaas's work has been seen in public spaces, museums, galleries, and private collections across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East. His visual practice encompasses a variety of different art forms including: large-scale public art projects, mixed media sculptures and canvases, re-purposed automobile parts, acrylics, watercolours, ink drawings, and illustrated publications.   Exploring themes of identity, environmentalism, and the human condition he uses art to communicate a world view that while particular to Haida Gwaii, his ancestral North Pacific archipelago, is also relevant to a contemporary and internationally engaged audience.

The original five–meter long mural that was published in 2009 as ''RED: A Haida manga'' is on a multi-year exhibit tour. Another book, ''Hachidori'' has sold over 100,000 copies in Japan with a single-day record sale of 20,000 copies. ''Flight of the Hummingbird'', first published in North America and now available in five languages, is also a bestseller and includes essays contributed by the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Nobel Peace prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]]. ''Declaration of Interdependence'' by Dr [[David Suzuki]] was illustrated by Yahgulanaas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidsuzuki.org/about/declaration/ The Declaration of Interdependence's web site], retrieved 2013-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmpibooks.com/author/michael-nicoll-yahgulanaas Author bio at his publisher's web site], {{ISBN|1553653726}}, retrieved 2013-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahgulanaas's works in metal include commissions from the [[British Museum]] (2010), The City of [[Vancouver]] (2011) and the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] organizing committee. In 2015, his sculpture of a [[sei whale]] was unveiled at the [[Vancouver International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Yahgulanaas's new art piece SEI unveiled at Vancouver airport|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/michael-yahgulanaas-s-new-art-piece-sei-unveiled-at-vancouver-airport-1.3145562|accessdate=10 July 2015|agency=[[CBC News]]|date=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, his sculpture Yelthadaas from the Coppers From the Hood series joined the permanent collection at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yelthadaas|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/682959|accessdate=3 Jan 2016|agency=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This work was put up on display in 2017. The piece hangs in Gallery 399, between the Modern and Contemporary Art wing and the Rockefeller Wing, where contemporary art borders Indigenous art.

Since 2009, Yahgulanaas has been a member of the board of the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]].

===Haida manga===
Although Yahgulanaas trained under master carvers, his brief exposure to Chinese brush techniques with Cai Ben Kwan encouraged a departure from the typical expressions of the Haida art form and the development of a new genre of narrative art called "Haida manga."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coastalartbeat.ca/2011/?p=957 "Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas Graphic Art Production", about Yahgulanaas's "Old Growth" gallery showing, at Grunt Gallery]. retrieved 2013-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haida Manga blends North Pacific Indigenous iconographies and framelines with the graphic dynamism of Asian manga.  Haida Manga is committed to hybridity as a positive force that opens a third space for critical engagement. It offers an empowering and playful way of viewing and engaging with social issues as it seeks participation, dialogue, reflection, and action.

'''Moral rights''' are [[rights]] of creators of [[copyright]]ed works generally recognized in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some [[common law]] jurisdictions. They include the right of [[attribution (copyright)|attribution]], the right to have a work published [[anonymity|anonymously]] or [[pseudonym]]ously, and the right to the integrity of the work.&lt;ref&gt;"moral, adj.". OED Online. September 2011. Oxford University Press. 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The preserving of the integrity of the work allows the author to object to alteration, distortion, or mutilation of the work that is "prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P123_20726], Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, September 9, 1886, art. 6bis, S. Treaty Doc. No. 27, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if an artist has assigned his or her copyright rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sundara Rajan, Mira T.|date=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkzKM4pvyB4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Copyright and Creative Freedom: A Study of Post-Socialist Law Reform|page= 41-42|series= Routledge Studies in International Law|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis| ISBN= 978-0-20396-776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral rights were first recognized in [[France]] and [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rigamonti, Cyrill P.|title= Deconstructing Moral Rights|journal=Harvard International Law Journal|volume= 47|issue= 2 |date=Summer 2006|page= 353-412}}&lt;/ref&gt; before they were included in the ''[[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]'' in 1928.&lt;ref name=kwall&gt;Kwall, Roberta Rosenthal (2010) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=smES_wO_NscC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=the+soul+of+creativity+kwall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YW7GYnpF9Q&amp;sig=AE0n0MnGyJmeY8gbK7z1rQcxphQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CMWmTqqrObLE0AHRy_2hDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Soul of Creativity: Forging a Moral Rights Law for the United States''], Stanford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-80475-643-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} [[Canada]] recognizes moral rights (''droits moraux'') in its ''Copyright Act'' (''Loi sur le droit d'auteur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-14.html Copyright Act] (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] became a signatory to the convention in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/results.jsp?countries=US&amp;cat_id=11 Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated a version of moral rights under its copyright law under Title 17 of the U.S. Code.

Some jurisdictions allow for the [[waiver]] of moral rights.&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|44-45}} In the United States, the ''[[Visual Artists Rights Act]] of 1990 (VARA)'' recognizes moral rights, but applies only to a narrow subset of works of [[visual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Gassaway, Laura (December 2002) "Copyright and moral rights", ''Information Outlook'', Vol. 6, No. 12, p. 40 (Copyright Corner)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions like Austria differentiate between narrow and wide moral rights. Whilst the former is about integrity of the work, the latter limits usages, which may harm the author's integrity. Some copyright timestamp services allow an author to publish allowed and disallowed usage intentions to prevent a violation of such wider moral rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.registeredcommons.org/faq/#f15 RegisteredCommons.org FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berne Convention==
Through the Rome Revision of the Berne Convention in 1928, the Berne Convention accepted two forms of moral rights; paternity and integrity. These rights are included in Article 6bis of the ''Berne Convention'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Independent of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion,  modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to the said work, which would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P123_20726], Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, September 9, 1886, art. 6bis, S. Treaty Doc. No. 27, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===

In most of Europe, it is not possible for authors to assign or even waive their moral rights. This is following a tradition in European copyright itself, which is regarded as an item of property which cannot be sold, but only licensed. Parties certainly can agree not to enforce them (and such terms are very common in contracts in Europe). There may also be a requirement for the author to 'assert' these moral rights before they can be enforced. In many books, for example, this is done on a page near the beginning, in and amongst the British Library/Library of Congress data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hoppe-Jänisch |first=Daniel |date=19 May 2015 |title=IP Assignment Clauses in International Employment Contracts |publisher=Lexology |publication-place=London |page=9 |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/document.ashx?g=365c8b4a-efe5-45c7-872f-88ca68042d7a |accessdate=3 August 2015 | quote=European copyright systems provide for a stronger connection between the copyright and the author of the protected work. This makes sense if one considers that even though the German ''Urheberrecht'' or the French ''droit d'auteur'' are often translated as ''copyright'', the literal translation is ''author’s right''. It comprises not only proprietary rights but also moral rights. In many European jurisdictions, only the proprietary rights are assignable; in others, copyrights, including the proprietary rights, cannot be assigned at all but authors may only grant others a license to exploit the protected work. Moral rights are usually not assignable and can be waived only to a limited extent. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
{{main|Moral rights in Canadian copyright law}}
Section 14.1 of [[Copyright law of Canada|Canada's Copyright Act]] protects the moral rights of authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/section-14.html Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)]&lt;/ref&gt; The moral rights cannot be assigned, but can be waived contractually. Many publishing contracts in Canada now contain a standard moral right waiver.

Moral rights in Canada were famously exercised in the case of ''[[Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Snow v. The Eaton Centre Ltd.'' (1982) 70 C.P.R. (2d) 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case [[Toronto Eaton Centre]], a large shopping mall, had commissioned the artist Michael Snow for a sculpture of Canada Geese.  Snow successfully stopped Eaton's from decorating the geese with bows at Christmas.

===In China===
Article 20 of the [[s:Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (1990)|Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (1990)]] provides unlimited term of protection of the rights of authorship, alteration, and integrity of an author. As Article 55 of the same Law provides retroactive protection of unexpired term on the date of entry into force of this Law, the Chinese perpetual moral rights are retroactive as well. The [[s:Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China (2001)|2001]] version retains this provision and the original Article 55 becomes Article 59.

===In Ghana===
Art. 18, [http://portal.unesco.org/culture/admin/file_download.php/gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf?URL_ID=30226&amp;filename=11416586343gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf&amp;filetype=application%2Fpdf&amp;filesize=526153&amp;name=gh_copyright_2005_en.pdf&amp;location=user-S/ Copyright Act, 2005]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} provides perpetual moral rights. The moral rights in Art. 6 are for proper attribution and against any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author or where the work is discredited by the act.

===In Hong Kong===
Moral Rights is specified under Copyright Ordinance (Chapter 528) Division IV, starting from section 89.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/chi/home.htm Please visit Hongkong legislation website for specified ordinance sections]&lt;/ref&gt; Author of computer program does not have Moral Rights (section 91). Moral Rights cannot be transferred unless on the death of moral rights holder (section 105 and 106).

===In India===

Moral rights are recognised under section 57 of India copyright act. Section 57 of India Copyright act refers to Author's Special rights. It states:

:(1) Independently of author's copyright, and even after the assignment either wholly or partially of the said copyright, the author of the work shall have the right to claim authorship of the work as well as the right to restrain, or claim damages in respect of 
::(a) any distortion, mutilation or other modification of the said work; or
::(b) any other action in relation to the said work which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.

The issue of moral rights was discussed in Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India &amp; Ors.(Amar Nath Sehgal V Union of India &amp; Ors CS/OS/No.2074/1992 decided on 21st Feb 2005. Court of Mr. Justice Pradeep Nandrajog). The case pertained to a mural that was commissioned in 1957 by Government of India during construction of Vigyan Bhavan at New Delhi. The mural in question was made of bronze had span of 140 feet sweep of 40 feet. The mural remained on display and was much appreciated till pulled down in 1979 and then consigned to storerooms of Union of India. Delhi High Court specifically referred to Berne Convention in delivering judgement. Court also awarded damages Rs. 500000 (half million) and also decreed in favor of the Amar Nath Sehgal that he would have an absolute right to recreate the mural at any place and right to sale the same.

The Court accepted existence of moral rights despite the work being commissioned work and copyright had passed over to union of India and suit being brought 13years after the said act(defense of limitations as pleaded by Government was rejected by the court).

===In Macao===
Article 41 of the [http://bo.io.gov.mo/bo/i/99/33/declei43_en.asp Decree-Law_n.o_43/99/M] provides inalienable, unrenounceable and imprescriptible author’s personal rights.

===In Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], the Copyright Act has provided authors' perpetual moral rights with regard of attribution and protection against alteration in bad faith, even if the works are in the [[public domain]], as follows:
*Article 25 of the Copyright Act 1928 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117617051400.htm]
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1944 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117633033100.htm]
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1948, unchanged from the 1944 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117637123100.htm] (The effective jurisdiction of the Republic of China became limited to [[Taiwan Area]] in 1949.)
*Article 21 of the Copyright Act 1964, unchanged from the 1948 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117653063000.htm]
*Article 26 of the Copyright Act 1985 [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117674062800.htm]
*Article 26 of the Copyright Act 1990, unchanged from the 1985 Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117679011100.htm]
*Section 3, Articles 15-21 of the Copyright Act 1992, with the Article unchanged in the subsequent versions of the Copyright Act [http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01176/0117681052200.htm] [http://www.tipo.gov.tw/en/AllInOne_Show.aspx?path=1485&amp;guid=26d93e21-7218-4b04-a4a8-44af93325c92&amp;lang=en-us]

===In the United States===

Moral rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.copyright.gov/title17/|title = United States Copyright Office|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; have had a less robust tradition in the United States. Copyright law in the United States emphasizes protection of financial reward over protection of creative attribution.&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|xiii}} The exclusive rights tradition in the United States is inconsistent with the notion of moral rights as it was constituted in the Civil Code tradition stemming from post-Revolutionary France. When the United States acceded to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], it stipulated that the Convention's "moral rights" provisions were addressed sufficiently by other statutes, such as laws covering [[slander and libel]].&lt;ref name=kwall/&gt;{{rp|30}}

Some individual states have moral rights laws, particularly pertaining to visual art and artists (''See'', ''e.g.'' [[California Art Preservation Act]], [[Artists Authorship Rights Act (New York)]]). However, it is unclear if these laws, or portions thereof, are preempted by federal laws, such as the Visual Artists Rights Act.

In ''[[Gilliam v. American Broadcasting]]'', the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe made a claim of "mutilation" (akin to a moral rights claim) in 1975 in [[lawsuit|legal proceedings]] against American TV network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for airing re-edited versions of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Monty Python, v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.'', 538 F.2d 14 (2d Cir 1976) [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/538/538.F2d.14.75-7693.76-7023.913.1058.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514191609/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/538/538.F2d.14.75-7693.76-7023.913.1058.html |date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was primarily decided on the basis of whether the BBC was licensed in such a way as to allow ABC to edit the videos (paragraph 20).

====Visual Artists Rights Act====
[[Visual Artists Rights Act|The Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990]] grants authors of a "work of visual art" - e.g. photographs, paintings, sculptures, etc. - the non-transferable&lt;ref&gt;At {{USCSub|17|106A|e|1}}, "The rights conferred ... may not be transferred"&lt;/ref&gt; right to

*claim authorship
*prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
*prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
*prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation
*prevent the destruction of a work of art if it is of "recognized stature"&lt;ref&gt;Gassaway, Laura (December 2002) "Copyright and moral rights", ''Information Outlook'', Vol. 6, No. 12, pp. 40-41 (Copyright Corner)&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are distinct from any rights of copyright and ownership of a copy of the work.&lt;ref&gt;At {{USCSub|17|106A|e|2}}, "Ownership of the rights ... is distinct from ownership of any copy of that work, or of a copyright or any exclusive right under a copyright in that work."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adaptation right====
Copyright holders have the right to control adaptations, or the preparation of "[[derivative works]]". This right is given under [[copyright law in the United States|copyright law]]. ''See'' 17 U.S.C. § 106.

====Lanham Act====
Section 43 of the [[Lanham Act]] governs false and misleading advertising, and can apply in some instances to attribution of protected works. However, it cannot be used to create moral rights for works outside of the Act. ''See'' ''[[Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox]]''.

====Courtesy of non-attribution====
Authors occasionally wish to distance themselves from work they've been involved with, some to the point of not wishing to be recognized as the work's author. One way they may do this is by signing the work under a pseudonym. [[Alan Smithee]] was a traditional, collective pseudonym used between 1968 and 1999 by discontented [[Hollywood]] [[film director]]s who no longer wanted to be credited. This courtesy was not always extended, however. The director of ''[[Highlander II: The Quickening|Highlander II]]'', [[Russell Mulcahy]], wanted his name removed after the completion bond company took over film production, but he was contractually obliged not to impugn the film and he was told that using a pseudonym would impugn it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

If the work was [[unfinished work|unfinished]], sometimes the original author will choose a pseudonym as permission for the copyright holder to do whatever they wish to finish and market the unwanted work, cutting ties from the product.

The '''Netherlands Architecture Institute''' (NAI) is a cultural institute for architecture and urban development, comprising a museum, an archive plus library, and a platform for lectures and debates. The NAI was established in 1988 and has been based in [[Rotterdam]] since 1993.

The NAI is a private organisation with a government brief, which is to manage the collection of archives that document the history of Dutch architecture. Moreover, as a sector institute for architecture it is also tasked with supporting the professional field. The building also houses a bookshop and a cafe.

==History==
The idea of establishing a national architecture museum came about in 1912 when the Amsterdam architects’ association Architectura et Amicitia was obliged to rent an extra room in Hotel Parkzicht in Amsterdam to store its archive of drawings and models. Architect [[J.H.W. Leliman]] was a key advocate of an architecture museum. A committee comprising J. Ingenohl, J.H. de Groot and W.A.E. van der Pluym as members was set up to look into the possibilities of such a museum. In 1915, A et A members suggested storing the collection at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam, and housing it in an independent museum at a later date. These ideas did not come to fruition, however.

In the 1980s, three cultural institutes collaborated to form the NAI. These were the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB), the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM) and Stichting Wonen foundation. Following this, a controversy ensued between Amsterdam and Rotterdam as to where an architecture museum/institute would have to be based. Minister Brinkman opted for Rotterdam. Previous plans to set up the NAI in the vacant library at Botersloot were abandoned. The NAI found temporary accommodation in a building at Westersingel before the construction of a new building started.

==The building==
In 1988, a competition was held among six architects to find an architect for a new building. These were: [[Jo Coenen]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Benthem Crouwel Architekten]], [[Wim Quist]], [[Luigi Snozzi]] and [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]]. Koolhaas’s design was the favourite among the specialist press and was also favoured by Riek Bakker, the director of Rotterdam’s Department of Urban Development. However, the NAI awarded Jo Coenen the commission, the decisive factors being the blending of the design into the surroundings and the references to the history of architecture.

After an intensive period of renovation, the NAI opened its doors on 1 July 2011. The most salient part of the renovation was moving the entrance to the pond level. The restaurant was extended. An exhibition room and additional space for educational activities were also added. At the site of the original entrance is now the DoeDek, a hands-on area where visitors can experiment with Lego, large blocks and cut-outs. As the original building’s architect, Jo Coenen was also responsible for its renovation.

==Sonneveld House Museum==
Sonneveld House Museum is a house built in the [[Nieuwe Bouwen]] style, the Dutch branch of the International School of Modernism. It was furnished with furniture and materials made by W.H. Gispen, B. van der Leck and others. The house was designed in 1933 by architects’ firm Brinkman and Van der Vlugt for the Sonneveld family. Albertus Sonneveld was one of the directors of the Van Nelle factory.

The Rotterdam Stichting Bevordering van Volkskracht (a foundation for the enhancement of popular health, welfare and culture in the city) bought the museum house in 1977. A form of collaboration has existed between Volkskracht and the NAI since February 1999. The house was restored and opened to the public in 2001. The restoration work was done by architects’ firm Molenaar &amp; Van Winden, with the NAI taking on the refurnishing work.

==The collection==
Private individuals started collecting architectural archives as early as the end of the nineteenth century. One of these was the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM). In the 1970s, the government became interested in these archives, setting up the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB) as part of the Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg, the Netherlands Department for Conservation. When the archives were transferred to the NDB, they officially became state property. The NAI’s archive collection is still a national collection.

The libraries of the Academie van Bouwkunst Amsterdam (Amsterdam Academy of Architecture), the Bond van Nederlandse Architecten BNA (the Royal Institute of Dutch Architects) and Stichting Wonen, a consumer organisation for information on sustainable living, were added to the NDB’s collection. The collection now houses some 18 kilometres of archive material. It also contains over 500 archives and collections of Dutch architects, organisations and educational institutes in the field of architecture and urban development, and comprises drawings, sketches, models, documentation, correspondence and photos. The internationally focused library contains about 60,000 volumes.

The NAI houses the Stichting BONAS foundation, (Stichting Bibliografieën en Oeuvrelijsten Nederlandse Architecten en Stedebouwkundigen, which translates as Bibliographies and Lists of Works of Dutch Architects and Urban Designers). Working on the basis of archive and literature study, this organisation reconstructs the work of Dutch designers from 1790 to the present and publishes it in book form.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The NAI organises exhibitions about the designed environment: about architecture, urban development, design and spatial planning. These are some of the exhibitions that were held in recent years: Polders (2005), China Contemporary (2006), Wijdeveld: plan the impossible (2006), From Cuypers to Coenen (2007), Le Corbusier (2007), Shape our country (2009), Disputed City (2010) and Architecture of Consequence (2011). In addition to temporary exhibitions there are two (semi)permanent exhibitions: Stad van Nederland (Dutchville) and De Schatkamer (Treasury). Dutchville is about how the city is perceived and about its beautiful and slightly less appealing aspects. Opened in September 2011, the Treasury displays masterpieces from the collection in an exhibition space designed by Rem Koolhaas, which was opened in September 2011.

==Platform==
To promote its innovation agenda ‘Architecture of Consequence’, the NAI organises platform activities such as lectures and debates both in the Netherlands and abroad. What role can architecture play in solving social problems? This concerns topics such as food production, the social climate, renewable energy, alternative use of space, social cohesion and value creation. A ‘matchmaking’ programme brings together expertise on these subjects so as to find approaches to spatial tasks such as environmental issues or housing shortages. Studying and discussing these tasks puts them onto local and international agendas. The matchmaking programme focuses primarily on India and China.

==Education==
The NAI offers programmes for primary and secondary education. It also works with various universities and universities of applied sciences on enhancing various subjects, study assignments, excursions and guided tours. Everyone can work hands-on on the DoeDek using large building blocks, Lego and cut-outs. Classes for children, supervised by architects and scientists, are to be held from February 2012.

== UAR (Urban Augmented Reality) ==
The NAI introduced UAR on 30 June 2010. UAR is an acronym for Urban Augmented Reality. It is a free-of-charge 3D architecture application that uses Augmented reality. This means that a layer of information has been added to reality. In UAR, the existing, built environment is supplemented by a historical, a future or an alternative layer using 3D models. UAR shows us what is not there, what the city used to look like, by showing us buildings that have since disappeared. The city as it could have been, using models and drawings to display alternative designs that never made it. And the city as it will become, using artist’s impressions of future projects. The collections of various institutes and heritage organisations including the NAI’s own collection are used for this. UAR users can also add information to the application themselves. At present, UAR covers the cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Utrecht, The Hague, Breda, Haarlem and Gouda.

==NAiM | Bureau Europa==
On 2 September 2006, the NAI opened an annexe in Maastricht, in the Wiebengahal, which adjoins the Bonnefanten Museum, in the Céramique district. As of April 2009, this NAiM/Bureau Europa acquired independent status. Since 2013 the new name is Bureau Europa.

==NAI Publishers==
NAI Publishers originated from the NAI’s publication department but has been an independent company for 15 years now. The company specialises in publishing books on architecture, urban development, spatial planning, visual arts, photography and design. NAI Publishers’ bookshop was located in the NAI building. July 2012 NAI Publishers merged with 010 Publishers, a similar publisher, on a new location in Rotterdam. The name of the merger is nai010 publishers.

==Merger==
State Secretary [[Halbe Zijlstra]] designated the NAI as one of the organisations that were going to form the new institute for the Creative Industry on 1 January 2013. That date the NAI merged with Stichting Premsela, the Netherlands Institute for Design and Fashion (Design sector institute) and Virtueel Platform (E-culture knowledge institute). The name of the merger is ''[[Het Nieuwe Instituut]]'', The New Institute.

==Board of Management and Supervisory Board==
The last management of the NAI comprised Ole Bouman (general director) and Peter Haasbroek (business director). The members of the Supervisory Board were: Hans Andersson (chairman), Karin Laglas (treasurer), [[Jeanne van Heeswijk]], Leon Ramakers, Dirk Sijmons, Nathalie de Vries and Joop van der Leeuw.

The '''Opera Krakowska''' ('''Kraków Opera''') active today, was founded in 1954 in postwar [[Kraków]], Poland, although the tradition of [[opera]] in the city dates back to 1628 when the first ever full [[libretto]] in [[Polish language|Polish]] was released by the local publishing house, followed by the first fully-fledged opera performance in the city in March 1782.&lt;ref name="culture.pl"/&gt; The Kraków Opera company stages 200 performances each year, including [[ballet]], [[operetta]]s and [[musical theatre|musical]]s for the young, with an audience occupancy rate of 98%. The Kraków Opera's main repertoire includes both international and Polish operatic classics, reaffirming its status as one of the country's leading [[opera]] companies.&lt;ref name="culture.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.pl/inne-instytucje/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/sh2A/content/opera-krakowska | title=Opera Krakowska | publisher=Adam Mickiewicz Institute, ''Culture.pl'' | work=Kultura polska, Polskie Centrum Informacji Muzycznej, ''Związek Kompozytorów Polskich'' | date=January 2002 | accessdate=March 5, 2013 | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The long list of names of renowned artists associated with it includes conductors such as [[Kazimierz Kord]], [[Robert Satanowski]], [[Jan Latham-Koenig]], [[Roland Bader]] and [[Aurelio Canonici]]; [[scenic design|set designers]] such as [[Tadeusz Kantor]], [[Lidia Zamkow]], [[Józef Szajna]], [[Krystyna Zachwatowicz]]; and a plethora of opera singers, many of whom began their careers there, including [[Teresa Żylis-Gara]] and [[Wiesław Ochman]].&lt;ref name="O-K"&gt;[http://www.opera.krakow.pl/english.php?id=386  The Opera Krakowska official website: "About us"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aureliocanonici.com/doc/Biography.pdf |title=Info with biography of Aurelio Canonici in English }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(91.3&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/73426,,,,zylis_gara_teresa,haslo.html  Info with biography of Teresa Żylis-Gara] at [[WIEM Encyclopedia]].

==The new venue==
For dozens of years, the Kraków Opera, now located at Lubicz 48 Street, lacked its own premises and instead used a number of concert venues in the city. The only permanent stage where the opera performances were staged for decades was the landmark [[Juliusz Słowacki Theatre]] in [[Kraków Old Town]]. The construction of the new opera house which can seat 760 people started in 2004. The new house opened in the autumn of 2008.&lt;ref name="O-K" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cracow-life.com/culture/culture_details/1240-Opera  Culture directory and reviews: Opera] at Cracow-life.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://poland.homesgofast.com/news/new-krakow-opera-house-opens-I1265/ In the news: "New Krakow Opera House Opens"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building of the new opera house was more expensive than originally thought. The ensuing dispute between the designer and the contractor who requested additional funds lasted for over two years. Among the reasons offered were the curtain walls for the office complex next door as well as the structural protection of other neighboring  buildings. Romuald Loegler, designer of the opera, wrote letters attesting to his disagreement with the general contractor – [[Hochtief]] company Poland – whose director refused to talk to the media sending questions to general manager of the company, Piotr Rozkruta. The dispute reached the Department of Education and Culture in Kraków's city government until a special consultant was appointed by the province. The building costs rose about 10%; however, the financing of the project was never in danger, as explained by Krzysztof Markiel, the head of the Department.&lt;ref name="Pelowski"&gt;Wojciech Pelowski, Tomasz Jakub Handzlik, [http://miasta.gazeta.pl/krakow/1,35796,3257937.html  Opera Krakowska, Kraków - Gazeta.pl] "Opóźnienia i większe koszty budowy krakowskiej opery", 2006-04-03. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Long before the new opera house was unveiled, the Kraków Opera utilized historical interiors and landmark architecture in Kraków, as well as other cities, for staging its own performances. Groundbreaking productions in natural settings included the [[The Haunted Manor|Straszny Dwór]] opera performance at the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] Courtyard of the [[Niepołomice Castle]] in 2002 and 2003; [[Madama Butterfly]] was staged in the depths of the centuries-old [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] in 2003, while [[Tosca]] by [[Giacomo Puccini]] and Straszny Dwór (''The Haunted Manor'') by [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] were performed against the arresting background of the [[Wawel Castle]] in 2005. The open-air performances included [[Halka]], offered at the [[Districts of Kraków#Dębniki|Zakrzówek Nature Park]] in 2004; it was recognized by the some critics as the most important event of the entire season. More than five thousand people saw that opera. In the summertime, the Kraków Opera also used the open-air stage at the [[Kraków Barbican]]. The visual significance of the location enriched the impact of operatic music not only for the regular patrons, but also for the numerous tourists.&lt;ref name="O-K" /&gt; 

World famous soloists have visited the Kraków Opera's stage, including singers from the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York City]] and [[La Scala]] in [[Milan]]. A number of noted Polish singers also performed there. The company's performers travel abroad every year to participate in special events and festivals in the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[England]], [[United States]] and as far as [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="O-K" /&gt;

'''PIPA Prize''' is an initiative of PIPA Institute in partnership with the [[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro|Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro]] – MAM/RJ to bring visibility to and encourage the production of [[contemporary art]] in Brazil.

Created in 2010, the yearly [[award]] is considered one of the most important art prizes in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/diversao-e-arte/2010/07/04/interna_diversao_arte,200762/index.shtml|title=Brasilienses indicados ao Prêmio Pipa|last=Braziliense|first=Correio|work=Correio Braziliense|access-date=2017-07-07|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.select.art.br/premio-pipa-2016/|title=Prêmio PIPA 2016 - seLecT|date=2016-07-26|work=seLecT|access-date=2017-07-07|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it supports up-and-coming artists, PIPA Prize's mission is not to discover new talents, but to recognize new Brazilian contemporary artists that already have a [[Art criticism|critical]] following and a place in the [[Art valuation|art market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artrio.art.br/pt-br/noticias/artistas-indicados-ao-pipa-2014|title=Artistas indicados ao PIPA 2014 {{!}} ArtRio|last=Artrio|website=artrio.art.br|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are no entries to run for the Prize. The artists that take part in the PIPA Prize are nominated by the Nominating Committee. Each member of the Committee selects up to three artists or [[Artist collective|art collectives]] that work in any media. During the 2010 to 2012 editions, each member could nominate up to five artists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

All of the artists selected by the Nominating Committee are showcased in a printed catalog and get a profile page in the award's website. Of these, four finalists are selected to exhibit their works at the Museum of Modern Art of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and donate a piece to their collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/diversao-e-arte/2011/04/27/interna_diversao_arte,249680/sete-artistas-de-brasilia-sao-indicados-para-o-premio-pipa-2011.shtml|title=Sete artistas de Brasília são indicados para o prêmio Pipa 2011|last=Braziliense|first=Correio|work=Correio Braziliense|access-date=2017-07-07|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners and the runner-up for the PIPA award also donate an additional work of art to the PIPA Institute.

== Structure ==

=== Board ===
The Board is the PIPA’s senior management body, composed of five to eight members, including representatives of PIPA Institute, representatives of MAM/RJ and renowned art experts invited for each edition.

The Board is responsible for selecting the four finalists from the nominated artists. The Board also nominates the members of the Nominating Committee and the Award Jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.premiopipa.com/regulamento-do-premio-pipa-2017/|title=Regulamento do Prêmio PIPA 2017|website=www.premiopipa.com|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nominating Committee ===

=== Award Jury ===
A group of five to seven members invited by the PIPA Board who will select the winner of PIPA amongst the four finalists.

First place wins a cash prize of R$10,000, the runner-up receives R$5,000. From 2014 to 2014, the winning artist would also participate in a two month long art residency at Instituto Sacatar, in Bahia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacatar.org/sacatar-media/2015/|title=Sacatar Foundation Brazil    » 2015|website=sacatar.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">'''PaperBackSwap''' (PBS) is a club co-founded in 2004 by Richard Pickering and Robert Swarthout of Suwanee and Rome, Georgia, (USA).  Swarthout later left the company to pursue other ventures.  The purpose of PaperBackSwap is to use the [[Internet]] to facilitate the parity trading of books (or "[[book swapping]]") among member [[bibliophiles]] in the [[United States]].  The club also operates sister websites Swap-a-DVD and Swap-a-CD to facilitate parity trading of [[DVD]]s and [[compact disc|CD]]s, respectively.

== Membership requirements/restrictions ==
Membership ranges from zero to $20 per year &lt;ref&gt;https://secure.paperbackswap.com/kiosk/primo_pricing.php&lt;/ref&gt; and is offered to individuals residing at addresses served by the [[United States Postal Service]], including APO and FPO ([[military mail]]) addresses.  Commercial enterprises are prohibited from membership.  Membership is restricted to adults 18 years of age or older.  Membership restrictions are covered in the site privacy statement.

In February 2015 PaperBackSwap began charging a fee for their services.

== Operation ==
A credit system is used to enable members to trade books for credits and credits for books.  Credits may either be purchased, or they may be earned by mailing books which have been requested.  Consequently, a member need not seek another member who desires a parity trade; credits are the [[medium of exchange]].  Both [[paperback]] and [[hardback]] books may be traded, as well as [[audiobook]]s.  Within the PBS system the value of any bound book is always one credit, and the value of an audio book is always two credits.

==Site Fees==
The ''Box-O-Books'' program allows paying members to exchange boxes of books (rather than one at a time) to save on postage and provide variety. PBS offers optional printing of online postage for a small fee.  PBS also sells book accessories and other items bearing the club [[logo]].
In February 2015, membership tiers were introduced. Standard membership is $20 per year, limited membership is $12 per year and the free option is called a la carte. Each tier upgrade offers more wishlist slots and other benefits.

'''Portuguese art''' includes many different styles from many different eras.

==Sculptures==
Portuguese sculptures can be best analysed by studying the many [[tomb]]s of the 12th and 13th Centuries that are found throughout [[Portugal]]. In the late 1700s, the [[Colonal Brazil|colony of Brazil]] was the main influence in Portuguese [[sculpture]]. This can be seen by the increase in [[Baroque sculpture|Baroque]] wooden sculptures during this time. [[Joaquim Machado de Castro]], a famous Portuguese artist who lived around this time, is responsible for a lot of these works.&lt;ref name="portugal-live"&gt;[http://www.portugal-live.net/UK/essential/culture-arts.html Portugal-Live.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
[[File:GraoVasco.jpg|thumbnail|The Last Supper, [[Grão Vasco]]]]
The Classical and Romantic styles of [[painting]], brought to Portugal from [[Italy]] and [[France]], had an influence on Portuguese artist [[Machado de Castro]] in the late 18th century and [[António Soares dos Reis]] in the 19th century. A school for amateur painters, led by [[Nuno Gonçalves]], was popular in the 15th century. As a result, [[Flemish]] artists added to the native style by decorating palaces and convents using their own techniques. The result gave Portugal a rich heritage of [[religious art]]. The Romantic Period in the 19th century sparked a rebirth of national art. This was followed by an era of naturalist realism, which in turn was followed by experimentation the 20th century.&lt;ref name="portugal-live" /&gt;

==Contemporary artists==
Many Portuguese contemporary artists have made their mark on the world stage. [[Maria Helena Vieira de Silva]] was a famous Portuguese abstract painter and [[Carlos Botelho (painter)|Carlos Botelho]] was known for his street scenes of [[Lisbon]]. [[Paula Rego]] is known for her "storytelling" in painting. She became famous for her works "Dog Woman" (1990’s), and "Abortion", a reaction to the referendum in Portugal which made [[abortion]] a crime (late 1990s). Her art has been shown in museums such as [[Tate Modern]] in London and Casa das Histórias Paula Rego, in [[Cascais]] (dedicated solely to her art).&lt;ref name="portugal-live" /&gt;

==Azulejos==
The Portuguese glazed tiles ([[azulejo]]s) are one of Portugal's best decorative arts. Many 16th and 17th century buildings are lined with tiles, and the rooms and halls of palaces and mansions have tilted panels following a colour motif. Some prime examples of this style of art are the [[Pátio da Carranca]] (courtyard of Carranca) of the [[Paço de Sintra]] (Palace of Sintra), the [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|São Roque]] church in Lisbon and the [[Quinta da Bacalhoa]] at [[Vila Fresca de Azeitão]] near [[Setúbal]].&lt;ref name="portugal-live" /&gt;

'''Project Bandaloop''' brings to audiences performances of [[Aerial Dance|aerial dance]]. Under the direction of Amelia Rudolph, it creates a blend of dance, sport, ritual and environmental awareness. Inspired by the possibilities of climbing and rappelling, the choreography draws on aerial, vertical and horizontal movement to craft dances, many site-specific. The work explores the relationship between movement and gravity and stimulates viewers' awareness of their natural and built environments. The dancers, climbers and riggers have enjoyed bringing their form of aerial dance to new audiences and have performed for close to half a million people at major city landmarks and outdoor sites such as [[Yosemite Falls]], California, USA.

For decades in the U.S., there have been isolated incidents of '''removal of Confederate monuments and memorials''', although generally opposed in [[#Public opinion|public opinion]] polls, and [[#Laws hindering removals|several U.S. States]] have passed laws over 115 years to hinder or prohibit further removals.

In the wake of the [[Charleston church shooting]] in June 2015, several municipalities in the United States removed monuments and memorials on public property dedicated to the [[Confederate States of America]]. The momentum accelerated in August 2017 after the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-jindal-monuments-20150814-story.html |title=Jindal seeks to block removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans |first=Natalie |last=Schachar |date=August 15, 2015 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kenning2017&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/16/us/confederate-monuments-removed.html |title=Confederate Monuments Are Coming Down Across the United States |first=Chris |last=Kenning |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-statues-idUSKCN1AV0XE |title=U.S. cities step up removal of Confederate statues, despite Virginia |date=August 16, 2017 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The removals were driven by the belief that the monuments glorify [[white supremacy]] and memorialize a [[treason|treasonous]] government whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/08/charlottesville-confederate-memorials-civil-war-racism-history/ |title=Why the U.S. Capitol Still Hosts Confederate Monuments |date=August 17, 2017 |website=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-20/what-confederate-monument-builders-were-thinking |title=What Confederate Monument Builders Were Thinking |date=August 20, 2017|agency=[[Bloomberg News]] |access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future' |website=NPR.org |access-date=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The History of Blaming 'Both Sides' and Why Language Matters |url=https://wnyc.org/story/history-blaming-both-sides-language-charlottesville-trump/ |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drum |first1=Kevin |title=The real story behind all those Confederate statues |url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/08/the-real-story-of-all-those-confederate-statues/ |accessdate=August 27, 2017|magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who object to the removals, like [[President Trump]], believe that the artifacts are part of the [[cultural heritage]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://time.com/4904510/donald-trump-twitter-confederate-statues/ |title=Trump: It's 'Sad' to See U.S. Culture 'Ripped Apart' by Removing Statues |last=Zorthian |first=Julia |website=Time |access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of these Confederate monuments were built during the era of [[Jim Crow laws]] (1877–1954) and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] (1954–1968). Detractors claim that they were not built as memorials but as a means of intimidating African Americans and reaffirming [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Why Were Confederate Monuments Built? : NPR |last=Parks |first=Miles |date=20 August 2017|publisher=[[NPR]] |language=English |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/718507/striking-graphic-reveals-construction-confederate-monuments-peaked-during-jim-crow-civil-rights-eras |title=Striking graphic reveals the construction of Confederate monuments peaked during the Jim Crow and civil rights eras |date=15 August 2017|publisher=[[The Week]] |language=English |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SAHUpton&gt;[https://www.sah.org/publications-and-research/sah-blog/sah-blog/2017/09/13/confederate-monuments-and-civic-values-in-the-wake-of-charlottesville Confederate Monuments and Civic Values in the Wake of Charlottesville]. [[Dell Upton]], [[Society of American Historians]], 13 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The monuments have thus become highly politicized; according to Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and a scholar of Civil War history: "If [[white nationalist]]s and [[neo-Nazi]]s are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again".&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

In some Southern states, [[state law (United States)|state law]] restricts or prohibits altogether the removal or alteration of public Confederate monuments. According to Stan Deaton, senior historian at the [[Georgia Historical Society]], "These laws are the [[Old South]] imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more. This is what led to the Civil War, and it still divides us as a country. We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In the South, Confederate monuments often protected, hard to remove thanks to state laws |last1=Bliss |first1=Jessica |last2=Meyer |first2=Holly |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=August 17, 2017 |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/08/17/south-confederate-monuments-often-protected-hard-remove-state-laws/573226001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Confederate monuments concerned were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when [[Jim Crow laws]] were being introduced in the late 19th century and at the start of the 20th century or during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.{{efn|Graham (2016) "Many of the treasured monuments that seem to offer a connection to the ''post-bellum'' South are actually much later, anachronistic constructions, and they tend to correlate closely with periods of fraught racial relations".&lt;ref name="graham-theatlantic-2016"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/the-stubborn-persistence-of-confederate-monuments/479751/ |title=Why Are There Still So Many Confederate Monuments? |last=Graham |first=David A. |date=April 26, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |access-date=August 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|Graham (2016) "A timeline of the genesis of the Confederate sites shows two notable spikes.

According to historian Jane Dailey from [[University of Chicago]], in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "[[white supremacy in the United States|white supremacist]] future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544266880/confederate-statues-were-built-to-further-a-white-supremacist-future |title=Confederate Statues Were Built To Further A 'White Supremacist Future' |website=npr.org |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian, Karyn Cox, from the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/16/the-whole-point-of-confederate-monuments-is-to-celebrate-white-supremacy/ |title=Analysis – The whole point of Confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy |first=Karen L. |last=Cox |date=August 16, 2017 |accessdate=September 23, 2017|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historian from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], James Leloudis, stated that "The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.heraldsun.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article167619947.html |title=Durham Confederate statue: tribute to dying veterans or political tool of Jim Crow South? |website=heraldsun.com |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at [[Washington College]], stated in ''National Geographic'': "They're 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people."&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

==Academic commentary==
In an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy, the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) said that to remove a monument "is not to erase history, but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history." The AHA noted that most monuments were erected "without anything resembling a democratic process," and recommended that it was "time to reconsider these decisions." According to the AHA, most Confederate monuments were erected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and this undertaking was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South." According to the AHA, memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction, and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life." A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the AHA "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."&lt;ref&gt;American Historical Association, [https://www.historians.org/news-and-advocacy/statements-and-resolutions-of-support-and-protest/aha-statement-on-confederate-monuments AHA Statement on Confederate Monuments] (August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Adam Goodheart, the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/16/regime-change-in-charlottesville-215500 |title=Regime Change in Charlottesville|author= |date= |website=politico.com |accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elijah Anderson]], a professor of sociology at Yale University, said the statues "really impacts the psyche of black people."&lt;ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish"/&gt; [[Harold Holzer]], the director of the [[Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College]], agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaperstoilas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stoilas |first1=Helen|last2=Stapley-Brown|first2=Victoria |title=Charlottesville riot hastens removal of Confederate monuments throughout the US |url=https://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/charlottesville-riot-hastens-removal-of-confederate-monuments-throughout-the-us/ |accessdate=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Art Newspaper |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dell Upton]], chair of the Department of Art History at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], wrote that "the monuments were not intended as public art," but rather were installed "as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity," and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent, their removal from civic spaces was a matter "of justice, equity, and civic values."&lt;ref name=SAHUpton/&gt; In a 1993 book, author Frank McKenney argued otherwise; "These monuments were communal efforts, public art, and social history," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;McKenney, Frank M., The Standing Army: History of Georgia's County Confederate Monuments, WH Wolfe Associates, Alpharetta, Georgia, 1993 p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;  Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women, the "mothers widows, and orphans, the bereaved fiancees and sisters" of the soldiers who had lost their lives.{{sfn|McKenney|1993|p=1}}  Many ladies' memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War, most of them joining the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] following its inception in 1894.  The women were advised to "remember that they were buying art, not metal and stone;"{{sfn|McKenney|1993|p=5}} The history the monuments celebrated told only one side of the story, however—one that was "openly pro-Confederate," Upton argues. Furthermore, Confederate monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African-Americans, who remembered the Civil War far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.&lt;ref name=SAHUpton/&gt; According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg, professor of history at [[Villanova University]], "White supremacy is really what these statues represent."&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;[https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0822/Confederate-monuments-What-to-do-with-them Confederate monuments: What to do with them?].

Robert Seigler in his study of Confederate monuments in South Carolina found that out of the over one hundred and seventy that he documented, only five monuments were found dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy working "on fortifications, and had served as musicians, teamsters, cooks, servants, and in other capacities," four of those were to slaves and one to a musician, Henry Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Seigler, Robert S., A Guide to Confederate Monuments in South Carolina: Passing the Cup, South Carolina Department of Archives and History, 1997 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheryl Benard, president of the Alliance for the Restoration of Cultural Heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archinternational.org/team/|title=Team - ARCH International|work=ARCH International|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued against the removal of Confederate war monuments in an op-ed for the [[The National Interest|National Interest]], writing, "From my vantage point, the idea that the way to deal with history is to destroy any relics that remind you of something you don't like, is highly alarming."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/destroying-confederate-monuments-hurts-us-all%E2%80%94-accomplishes-22142|title=Destroying Confederate Monuments Hurts Us All—and Accomplishes Nothing|last=Benard|first=Cheryl|work=The National Interest|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard compares the removal to "historic cleansing" in other countries, stating "Tour the archaeological ruins of any formerly great civilization, and you will invariably encounter inscriptions that have been chiseled away, faces that have been obliterated, heads that have been struck off the rumps of their statues. Someone overthrows or assassinates a predecessor and orders his or her name and image removed. ... What could have remained is their story, and any lessons later humans might draw from it."&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

[[Eric Foner]], a historian of the Civil War and biographer of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], argued that more statues of African-Americans like [[Nat Turner]] should be constructed.&lt;ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Munshi |first1=Neil |title=Trump says it is 'foolish' to remove Confederate symbols |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e7496854-82a1-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff |accessdate=August 17, 2017 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Brophy]], a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues "facilitates forgetting", although these statues were "re-inscribed images of white supremacy". Brophy also stated that the Lee statue in Charlottesville should be removed.&lt;ref name="ftmunshitrumpsaysitisfoolish" /&gt;

Civil War historian [[James I. Robertson Jr.]] referred to the current climate to dismantle or destroy Confederate monuments as an "age of idiocy" and motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of Americans have painfully constructed" and the monuments were not a "Jim Crow signal of defiance."&lt;ref&gt;Speech of James I. Robertson, Jr., July 28, 2018. [https://www.c-span.org/video/?448679-5/history-confederate-monuments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The removals were marked by events in Louisiana and Virginia within the span of two years. In Louisiana, after the [[Charleston church shooting]] of 2015, the city of New Orleans removed its Confederate memorials two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Darran |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/us/new-orleans-confederate-monuments/index.html |title=New Orleans removes Gen.

Other events followed across the United States. In Baltimore, for example, the city's Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15–16, 2017. Mayor [[Catherine Pugh]] said that she ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/us/baltimore-confederate-statues.html |title=Baltimore Removes Confederate Statues; Mayor Cites Public Safety |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|first1=Nicholas|last1=Fandos|first2=Russell|last2=Goldman |date=August 16, 2017 |accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confederate monuments taken down in Baltimore overnight |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-monuments-removed-20170816-story.html |date=August 16, 2017|authors=Colin Campbell, Talia Richman and Luke Broadwater}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], Mayor [[Jim Gray (American politician)|Jim Gray]] asked the city council on August 16, 2017 to approve the relocation of two statues from a courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/15/us/confederate-memorial-removal-us-trnd/index.html |title=Here are the Confederate memorials that will be removed after Charlottesville|publisher=CNN |first=Jessica |last=Suerth |date=August 16, 2017 |accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-confederate-statue-removal-20170815-story.html |title=Deadly rally accelerates ongoing removal of Confederate statues across U.S. |newspaper=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |first=Jesse J. |last=Holland |date=August 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations encouraging monument removal==
* Following the [[Unite the Right rally]] of 2017, a Twitter account named "Destroy This Statue"(@destroystatue) has been posting pictures of all the Confederate monuments identified by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], with links to a map showing their locations and a suggestion that it's "time for a road trip".&lt;ref name=Manatee/&gt;
* The [[Make It Right Project]] was founded in 2018 to encourage removal of Confederate monuments.

==Destruction of monuments==
In North Carolina and Georgia, where removal of Confederate monuments is prohibited by law, frustrated protestors have destroyed three monuments as of October, 2018.
* In [[Durham, North Carolina]], several protesters toppled and severely damaged the [[Confederate Soldiers Monument (Durham, North Carolina)|Confederate Soldiers Monument]] outside the Old Durham County Courthouse on August 15, 2017.

The removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a 2/3 vote of both houses of the legislature, as would the removal of any other Confederate monument in South Carolina.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/10/confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse |title=Confederate flag removed from South Carolina capitol in victory for activists |last=Holpuch |first=Amanda |date=2015-07-10 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2017-10-10 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate monuments are largely located in cities, which, like other American cities, in the twentieth century became more black and more liberal politically than the remainder of the states in which they are located.

In another legal impediment to removal, the Board of Trustees of the [[University of North Carolina]] prohibited for 16 years the renaming of any university memorials. This was triggered by the University's 2014 decision to rename Saunders Hall (see [[Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials#North Carolina|below]]).

==Public opinion==
A 2017 Reuters poll found that 54% of American adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure. The results were split along racial and political lines, with Republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, and Democrats and minorities preferring their removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-protests-poll/a-majority-of-americans-want-to-preserve-confederate-monuments-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1B12EG |title=A majority of Americans want to preserve Confederate monuments: Reuters/Ipsos poll |date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/reuters-ipsos-confederate-monuments-2017-08-22 |title=Reuters/Ipsos Data: Confederate Monuments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2017 poll, by HuffPost/YouGov, found that 48% of respondents favored the "remain" option, 33% favored removal, and 18% were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/confederate-statues-removal-polls_us_599de056e4b05710aa59841c |title=Polls Find Little Support For Confederate Statue Removal -- But How You Ask Matters |first=Ariel |last=Edwards-Levy |date=August 23, 2017|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPConfederateFlag20170815.pdf |title=HuffPost: Confederate Flag, August 15 - 16, 2017 - 1000 US Adults|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What to do with the plinths (pedestals)==
In the case of many monuments, after they are removed the pedestals or plinths remain. What to do with them has been the subject of some discussion. In the case of the toppled ''Silent Sam'' monument at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, two scholars propose leaving the "empty pedestal — shorn all original images and inscriptions — [which] eliminates the offending tribute while still preserving a record of what these communities did and where they did it.... The most effective way to commemorate the rise and fall of white supremacist monument-building is to preserve unoccupied pedestals as the ruins that they are — broken tributes to a morally bankrupt cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Ethan J. |last1=Kytle |first2=Blain |last2=Roberts |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 22, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/silent-sam-confederate-monument-north-carolina.html |title=Broken Tributes to a Morally Bankrupt Cause}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Baltimore, one of the four empty plinths has been used, with eventual city tolerance though not approval, for a statue of a pregnant black woman, naked from the waist up, holding a baby in a brightly-covered sling on her back, with a raised golden fist: ''Madre Luz'' (''Mother Light''). The statue was first placed in front of the monument before its removal, then raised to the pedestal. According to the artist [[Pablo Machioli]], "his original idea was to construct a statue of [[Harriet Tubman]] throwing a brick, but he rejected that as too violent and chose instead a pregnant mother as a symbol of life. 'I feel like people would understand and respect that'". (The statue has been vandalized several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

This wooden female ancestor figure by an unknown [[Senufo people|Senufo]] artisan is part of the [[Africa]]n collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Carved in the first half of the 20th century, it displays the artist's skill with form and respect for the powerful female half of the primordial couple.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Romare Bearden]] once declared of this statue that "It’s the rhythms . . . that are so beautiful: the head and the two breasts, the length of the arms coming down to her waist." The figure is beautifully balanced and proportioned, with an arched back leading down from her delicate head to the weighty fists on her hips. This combination of strength and grace is fitting for the Mother Ancestor of the Senufo. She is heavily ornamented, with a helmetlike hairstyle, armlets, [[lip plug]], and body markings across her torso, breasts, and temples. She has sharply conical breasts to signify her ideal womanhood and long arms to show that she is a caretaker.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
As half of the ancestral couple of the Senufo people, this statue would have been kept with her mate in a shrine. The pair would only be taken out for special occasions such as funeral processions, when the newly dead were initiated into the spirit world. During these processions, the statue would be alternately swung from side to side and struck against the ground to serve as percussion.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

===Acquisition===
This work entered the IMA's collection in 1999 thanks to the Mr. and Mrs. Richard Crane Fund, the Anonymous Art Fund, the Mary V. Black Art Endowment Fund, the Lucille Stewart Endowed Art Fund, the Mrs. Pierre F. Goodrich Endowed Art Fund, and the General Endowed Art Fund. It now has the accession number 1999.31 and is on display in the Eiteljorg Suite of African and Oceanic Art.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=female ancestor figure|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/female-ancestor-figure|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was heralded as a highlight of the collection when the gallery first opened in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eiteljorg Gallery of African Art Opens Tomorrow|url=http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2000/08/18/27343.html|publisher=Indepth Art News|accessdate=6 June 2013|date=19 Aug 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
The figure's lower legs, feet, and a probable circular wooden base have eroded away due to a combination of water and insect damage, which also left the legs discolored. Its surface has been darkened by extensive handling and the tropical conditions of [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">'''Shanghai-style papercutting''' is a variety of [[papercutting]] practiced in south China, and in particular in [[Shanghai]].

The making of papercuts is a popular [[folk art]] in China. In the hands of an artisan, and with the help of a knife or a pair of scissors, a piece of paper can be turned into any of a wide variety of patterns &amp;ndash; landscapes, flowers, birds, animals and human figures. These simple works of art may be displayed in wall frames or pressed under glass and displayed to decorate a room.

Traditional North Chinese papercut works are mostly patterns of auspicious symbols, patterns, with strong traditional features. While Shanghai-style papercutting, based on applied arts such as [[Chuanghua]] (papercut for window decoration, Chinese: 窗花), or embroidery, does not adhere to the traditional symbols. Its subjects and designs are relatively more simple and modern. More uniquely, Shanghai-style papercuts, regardless of their size and complexity, are all cut at one time and the cut flowers, grasses and animals, are all attached together.

Different from the traditional red papercut, the most obvious feature of Shanghai-style papercut is its colors and patterns. Waste paper such as flyer paper, newspapers, envelopes are all used as the materials for creating these works. Shanghai-style artists make use of the original colors of the paper to conceive the design, the colors and patterns of their works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godpp.gov.cn/wmzh/2008-02/01/content_12375150.htm 海派剪纸艺术传承父子( Transmitters of Shanghai-style papercutting )], 解放日报, 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shanghai culture and arts]] is an important part of [[Chinese arts and craft]]. It has a tradition of excellence, substantial accumulation, excellent artists and craftsmen, a brilliant memory. Let us review it: Shanghai since its inception in 1843,
Started from the closed Wuyue regional smallholder city to become a coastal modern cities, called
"The Jianghai Tongjin, southeast of the city". It is in such an open and emerging cities, breeding and the formation of
The Shanghai Arts and Crafts, the Beijing School of Arts and Crafts Arts and Crafts of Guangdong faction formed with distinct regional characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artjcb.com/gmsc/gymslt/images/96.pdf 对申博成功后海派工艺美术的思考与预测], 上海电台王琪森&lt;/ref&gt;

''Smith Journal'' is published by Frankie Press,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frankiepress.com.au/|title=frankie press // frankie magazine // smith journal // Slow|website=www.frankiepress.com.au|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; creators of popular Australian magazine '''''[[Frankie (magazine)|frankie]]'''.'' The magazine is lauded for sharing the same "inquisitive nature, intelligent copy and compelling stories"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/meet-frankies-mens-spinoff-smith-journal/|title=Meet Frankie's Men's Spinoff "Smith Journal" – Pedestrian TV|date=9 August 2011|work=Pedestrian TV|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''frankie''.

== History and profile ==
''Smith Journal'' was founded by frankie press editors-at-large Rick Bannister and Louise Bannister as a men’s magazine in the same vein as ''frankie.'' It was designed to attract readers interested in “real people doing real things, guys that are making stuff, creative thinkers, adventurers, whatever.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The magazine was initially planned to be published on a bi-annual schedule,&lt;ref name="adnews.com.au"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adnews.com.au/adnews/frankie-launches-smith-journal-in-a-leap-of-faith|title=Frankie launches Smith Journal in a leap of faith – AdNews|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but adopted a quarterly publishing schedule following its positive reception.

Similar to ''frankie,'' the magazine is printed on premium matte paper stock, and marketed as a "bespoke"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/why-the-saturday-papers-design-breeds-disappointment-24198|title=Why The Saturday Paper's design breeds disappointment|last=Sadokierski|first=Zoe|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; title suitable as both a casual read and coffee table magazine.

''Smith Journal'' is owned and published by niche publisher Morrison Media, parent owners of Frankie Press who also publish ''frankie'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Morrison Media moved production of its titles to [[Melbourne]] in February 2014 when it closed its [[Queensland]] based offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-press-co-founders-depart-204965|title=Frankie Press co-founders depart as Morrison Media moves sales hub to Melbourne  – Mumbrella|date=7 February 2014|work=Mumbrella|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Morrison Media was acquired by Pacific Star Network in November 2014 for $10m AUD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-publisher-morrison-media-bought-10m-deal-262164|title=Frankie publisher Morrison Media bought out in $10m deal – Mumbrella|date=12 November 2014|work=Mumbrella|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Smith Journal's'' name is derived from the titles used for professional [[Writer|wordsmiths]] or [[blacksmith]]s; traditional artisans and craftsmen that embody the down-to-earth quality the magazine attempts to emulate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scout.com.au/Blog/Smith-Journal---a-smart-new-publication-from-Frankie-Magazine|title=Smith Journal:  a smart new publication from Frankie Magazine|work=Scout|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Content ==
The magazine's somewhat niche content and minimalistic approach to topics is a direct response to the salacious "lad mags" of the magazine industry such as ''[[FHM]]'' and ''[[Zoo Weekly]].'' At the time of ''Smith Journal's'' launch, the men's magazine market largely consisted of [[Popular culture|populist]] focused titles with a very broad target audience such as ''[[Men's Health]]'', or hobby-specific titles dedicated to a singular topic. Instead of attempting to engage as many readers as possible through glossy pages filled with current events topics, the editors of ''Smith Journal'' felt that there was a "gap in the market for guys who felt that their magazines hadn't grown or changed with them."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/from-zoo-to-smith-journal-are-men-finally-choosing-brains-over-boobs-20140619-zsf9r.html|title=From Zoo to Smith Journal: Are men finally choosing brains over boobs?|last=Watson|first=Meg|date=28 June 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the founding editor Nadia Saccardo, the magazine was not created with an emphasis on a specific gender, but was instead focused on "unexpected, accessible storytelling coupled with great photography and illustration."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Many of the articles focus on topics and individuals related to history, photography, art and design. Volume 25 profiles photographer Daniel George, whose portfolio consists of household items used for [[target practice]]; an article discussing the cultural re-evaluation of [[Glam metal|1980s hair metal]] music; and an interview with former [[NASA]] scientist Robert Lang who now designs [[origami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/this-volume|title=Volume 25|date=30 January 2018|access-date=2018-01-30|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130074538/http://www.smithjournal.com.au/this-volume|archivedate=30 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous issues have also included interviews with American musician [[Henry Rollins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2686-smith-journal-volume-20|title=Volume 20|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professional safe-cracker [[Jeff Sitar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2489-smith-journal-volume-17|title=Volume Seventeen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; an historical article on Soviet rocket architect [[Galina Balashova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2701-volume-nineteen|title=Volume Nineteen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil's illegal [[hot air balloon]] subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2385-volume-sixteen|title=Volume Sixteen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stylistic design of the magazine makes use of a large amount of white space and very [[Minimalism (disambiguation)|minimalistic]] photographs and illustrations with text pairings. Many articles are presented on a stark white background, some without a headline or photo to accompany it. A number of photographs are presented on a [[two-page spread]]. All of the photographs adhere to a similar [[Image editing|editing]] style which includes faded blacks to complement the matte paper they are printed on.

Issues will often include tear-out posters of illustrations or diagrams. For example, Volume 25 features an illustrated diagram of the [[Lunar calendar|2018 lunar calendar]], and Volume 18 included a twenty-sided [[icosahedron]] globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2468-smith-journal-volume-18|title=Volume Eighteen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These content and design choices are intentionally similar in style to ''[[Frankie (magazine)|frankie]],'' another Frankie Press publication. Editor-at-Large Louise Bannister stated that "they're from the same family – lots of white space…but the treatment of pictures and text is a little different."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/art-and-design/article/frankies-mens-spin-smith-journal-hits-stands|title=Frankie's Men's Spin-Off, Smith Journal, Hits The Stands|work=Broadsheet|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its initial creation, ''Smith Journal'' was designed by ''frankie'' magazine's Creative Director, Lara Burke, with additional input from ''frankie's'' editor, Jo Walker and Senior Contributor, Benjamin Walker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Bannister was quick to point out that despite the similarities, "Smith is its own thing."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Launch ==
The first issue of ''Smith Journal'' was published in Australia on 5 September 2011. Frankie Press circulated 20,000 copies&lt;ref name="adnews.com.au"/&gt; of the first issue which contained 140 pages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When the magazine first launched in September 2011, it was during a period when a significantly large number of men's magazines were declining in sales and reader numbers. For example, ''FHM'' had posted a 20 percent drop from 2010 to 2011 to reach a record low of 40,000 circulated copies in Australia, and ''Zoo Weekly'' had dropped 18 percent to 83,000 circulated copies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/size-doesnt-matter-in-a-shrinking-market-mens-magazines-try-new-models-to-stay-on-top-20110813-1is6i.html|title=Size doesn't matter. In a shrinking market, men's magazines try new models to stay on top|last=Lallo|first=Michael|date=14 August 2011|work=The Age|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other men's titles such as ''Alpha, Sport &amp; Style,'' and ''Ralph'' all folded in the same span of time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;'' ''

In response to the decision to launch a new men's magazine when a large number of others were closing, then editorial director Louise Bannister suggested ''Smith Journal''  was not intended to appeal to a mass audience, but instead to a smaller group of people interested in "something they can't get on the internet."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Readership ==
''Smith Journal's'' readers are predominantly male, however, the magazine also holds a fairly sizable female reader base (70% male, 30% female).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/media-kit|title=Media Kit|work=smithjournal.com.au|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's media kit states that 58% of its readers are between 25–44 years old, and that 70% are university educated or are currently studying.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Former editor Nadia Saccardo described the magazine's reader as curious and open-minded and that the content was designed to attract readers "who feel like they have been ignored, or would not traditionally pick up magazines."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Editor-at-Large Rick Bannister elaborated on this statement by describing the magazine's average reader as someone who is creative and interested in reviving old traditions such as "brewing, or making furniture, or restoring bikes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Besides the quarterly issue, the magazine also features an online presence through its website ''smithjournal.com.au.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smithjournal.com.au/|title=Australian Magazine in Blog Form {{!}} Smith Journal|website=smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website includes original articles and weekly blog posts not found in the magazine that cover a wider range of subjects and topics than the magazine usually focuses on. The website receives an average number of 19,900 unique visitors (six-month average), and 41,150+ average page views per month (media kit). ''Smith Journal'' also has an online shop where visitors can purchase individual copies (for domestic or international shipping), issues of the digital magazine, as well as past copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frankiepress.com.au/shop/|title=buy frankie magazine &amp; Smith Journal magazine {{!}} frankie press|website=www.frankiepress.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue of [[John of Nepomuk|St. John of Nepomuk]] in [[Divina]] is the National Cultural Monument of [[Slovakia]]. Divina is a [[village]] and [[municipality]] in [[Žilina District]] in the [[Žilina Region]] of northern Slovakia. In [[History|historical records]] the [[village]] was first mentioned in 1325. The Statue of St. John of Nepomuk is registered in the Central List of the Slovak Memorial Fund under the number 1334/2.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pamiatky.sk/po/po/Details?id=9364|title=Pamiatkový objekt - podrobnosti|website=www.pamiatky.sk|language=sk|access-date=2017-06-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806221237/http://www.pamiatky.sk/po/po/Details?id=9364|archivedate=2017-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sandstone sculpture from 1796 standing on a stone base. The statue has a good artistic elaboration of the saint’s face and drapery. The saint does not have a traditional [[biretta]] on his head. The statue is a remembrance of the last male descendant of the [[Aristocratic family|aristocratic]] Szunyogh family – John Nepomuk Szunyogh, who is credited with the construction of the Divina church and rectory. In Slovakia, there are only few preserved architectural and artistic monuments that belonged to the count branch of the Szunyog family of [[Budatín Castle|Budatín]]. In 1588, the branch was promoted to [[baron]]s, later [[count]]s. The last male descendant was John Nepomuk Szunyogh, who died in 1798, leaving only one daughter Josephine. St. John of Nepomuk was his personal patron, to whom he had a special reverence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Image:Okres zilina.png|thumb|right|300px|Location of [[Žilina District]] in the [[Zilina Region]]]]

== St. John of Nepomuk ==
St. John of Nepomuk, Czech saint, died as a [[martyr]]. His tortured body was bound and thrown in the [[Vltava]] river. St. John of Nepomuk is one of the most frequently illustrated saints in the territory of the former [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg monarchy]] and there are monuments (mostly statues) of him in almost every village in Slovak and [[Czech Republic|Czechia]]. His statues and other monuments are all over the world. The fact that we can find St. John of Nepomuk also in less expected locations only confirms his universal respect. St. John is the patron of confessors, priests, sailors, rafters, millers and protector from drowning or tongue diseases. He is co-patron of the Czech Republic and [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-07-18|title=John of Nepomuk|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_of_Nepomuk&amp;oldid=791145027|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many churches and chapels have been consecrated to him in Central and Western Europe. St. John of Nepomuk churches and chapels can be found in [[Germany]], Czechia, [[Poland]], [[Italy]], Slovakia, [[Slovenia]], [[Austria]], [[Serbia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His is also worshipped in [[Spain]]. Since 16 May 1758, St. John of Nepomuk has been the patron saint of the Spanish Marine Forces (''Infantería de Marina'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/Armadaespannola/conocenos_organizacion/prefLang_es/03_Flota--04_Flota-Fuerza-Infanteria-Marina--03_patronazgo-cuerpo-infanteria-marina_es|title=Patronazgo del Cuerpo de Infantería de Marina|last=Fuerza de Infantería de Marina|first=|date=|website=www.armada.mde.es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530050704/http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenos_organizacion/prefLang_es/03_Flota--04_Flota-Fuerza-Infanteria-Marina--03_patronazgo-cuerpo-infanteria-marina_es|archive-date=2016-05-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside [[Europe]], there churches and chapels consecrated to him especially in [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Philippines]] and the [[United States|USA]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also names of many municipalities in [[Latin America]] were given in respect of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-22|title=San Juan Nepomuceno, Bolívar|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno,_Bol%C3%ADvar&amp;oldid=776621206|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanjuannepomuceno-bolivar.gov.co/index.shtml#8|title=Sitio web del municipio San Juan Nepomuceno en Bolívar|last=http://www.iprc.org.co|first=Equipo de Internet para la Rendición de Cuentas -|website=www.sanjuannepomuceno-bolivar.gov.co|language=es|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-24|title=San Juan Nepomuceno (Paraguay)|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno_(Paraguay)&amp;oldid=99355169|journal=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paraguay.cz/mesto-san-juan-nepomuceno/|title=Město San Juan Nepomuceno|website=www.paraguay.cz|access-date=2017-07-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522003046/http://www.paraguay.cz/mesto-san-juan-nepomuceno/|archivedate=2015-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno_(Paraguay)|title=San Juan Nepomuceno (Paraguay) - Heraldry of the World|website=www.ngw.nl|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901041126/http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=San_Juan_Nepomuceno_%28Paraguay%29|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Interesting information about the statue was found in the recently discovered [[Canonical visitation]] of Divina from 1828: ''"On the territory of the parish, there is also on stone statue of St. John Nepomuk, which used to be located at the entrance to the Divina village near the stream along the road in 1796. It was built by the count John Szunyogh. After the fatal massive [[flood]] in 1822 that wrecked the entire village from the ground, the statue was swept away. It was found head-less. Later, thanks to the willingness of the count Stephen Csáky, the current patron of the church, it was repaired and placed in front of the rectory on the brick column."''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canonica visitatio, Nagy Divina|last=Vurum|first=Joseph|publisher=The Diocese of Nitra, manuscript|year=1828|isbn=|location=Nitra|pages=14|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blessing ceremony ===
The statue was uncovered on its new stand on Friday 2 June 2017 by Joachim Bleicker, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany in Slovakia together with Emil Molko, Mayor of Divina and Marek Sobola, author of the project. Subsequently, it was blessed by Mons. [[Tomáš Galis]], [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|Bishop]] of Žilina. It happened more than 190 years since it was restored after being damaged by a flood. Besides the Bishop, Ambassador of Germany and the Head of the Bishop Office, the ceremony was attended also by invited partners. The uncovering and blessing of the statue were followed by a vernissage presenting all partners of the monument restoration on panels.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tkkbs.sk/view.php?cisloclanku=20170605024|title=Biskup Galis požehnal obnovenú sochu sv.

'''Steven Shaviro''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|v|ɪr|oʊ}}; born April 3, 1954) is an American academic, [[philosopher]] and [[cultural critic]] whose areas of interest include [[film theory]], [[time]], [[science fiction]], [[panpsychism]], [[capitalism]], [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[subjectivity]]. He earned a PhD from Yale in 1981. 

==Work==
His most widely read book is ''Doom Patrols'', a "theoretical fiction" that outlines the state of [[postmodernism]] during the early 1990s, using poetic language, personal anecdotes, and creative prose. He has also written extensively about [[music videos]] as an artform.

Additionally, Shaviro has written a book about film theory, ''The Cinematic Body'', which examines the dominance of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in contemporary academic film theory. According to Shaviro, the use of [[psychoanalysis]] has mirrored the actions of a [[cult]], with its own religious texts (essays by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and Lacan).

Shaviro's book ''Connected, Or, What It Means to Live in the Network Society'', appeared in 2003. A later book, ''Without Criteria: Kant, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Aesthetics'' was published in May 2009.

'''Theatre of Estonia''' dates to 1784 when [[August von Kotzebue]] founded an amateur theatre company in [[Tallinn]]. Most of the plays at the time were comedies for the amusement for local [[Baltic German]] nobility. In 1809 a professional theatre company was established, with its own building in Tallinn, the [[Tallinna saksa teater]]. The repertoire was mostly in German but plays in Estonian and Russian were also performed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&amp;dq Culture And Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt;

After centuries of serfdom that was abolished in Estonia in 1816, the first native Estonian musical society, [[Vanemuine]], was established in 1865. The Vanemuine society's staging of [[Lydia Koidula]]'s ''The Cousin from Saaremaa'' in 1870 marks the birth of Estonian theatre.

The Vanemuine Music and Theatre Society was headed by [[August Wiera]] from 1878 to 1903. In 1906 a new building was erected for the society and the theatre company turned professional under the directorship of [[Karl Menning]]. Plays by Western writers such as [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], Russian [[Maksim Gorky]] and Estonian [[August Kitzberg]], [[Oskar Luts]] and [[Eduard Vilde]] were staged.

Also in 1906 the Estonia Music and Theatre Society in Tallinn turned professional under the leadership of [[Theodor Altermann]] and [[Paul Pinna]]. This company later became the [[Estonian National Opera]].

{{wikisourcelang|ta|திருக்குறள்|Tirukkural}}
The '''Tirukkural''' ({{lang-ta|திருக்குறள்}}, literally ''Sacred Verses''), or shortly '''the Kural''', is a classic [[Tamil language|Tamil]] text consisting of 1,330 couplets or [[Kural (poetic form)|Kural]]s, dealing with the everyday virtues of an individual.{{sfn|C. Blackburn, 2000|pp=449–482}}{{sfn|Pillai, 1994|p=}} It is one of the two oldest works now extant in [[Tamil Literature]] in their entirety, the other being the [[Tolkappiyam]].{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} Considered one of the greatest works ever written on ethics and morality, chiefly [[secular ethics]], it is known for its universality and non-denominational nature.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} It was authored by [[Thiruvalluvar|Valluvar]], also known in full as Thiruvalluvar. The text has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. The traditional accounts describe it as the last work of the third [[Sangam literature|Sangam]], but linguistic analysis suggests a later date of 450 to 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}}

Traditionally praised as "the Universal Veda" and "the Universal Code of Conduct,"{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=155–156}} the Kural emphasizes on the vital principles of [[non-violence]], [[moral vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]],{{Ref label|A|a|none}} human brotherhood, absence of desires, path of righteousness and truth, and so forth, besides covering a wide range of subjects such as moral codes of rulers, friendship, agriculture, knowledge and wisdom, sobriety, love, and domestic life.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} The work is commonly quoted in vegetarian conferences, both in [[India]] and abroad.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=10–16}} Considered as chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature,{{sfn|Pyatigorsky, n.d.|p=515}} the Kural is one of the most important works in the [[Tamil language]] and is often called "the masterpiece of Tamil Literature."{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=24}} This is reflected in some of the other names by which the text is given by, such as the Work of Three Books, Modern Veda, Divine Work, Faultless Word, and Tamil Veda.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Cutler, 1992|pp=}}

The Kural has influenced several scholars across the ethical, social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and spiritual spheres.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=7–13}}{{sfn|Sundaramurthi, 2000|p=624}} Authors influenced by the Kural include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Constantius Joseph Beschi]], [[Karl Graul]], [[George Uglow Pope]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], and [[Yu Hsi]], many of whom have translated the work into their languages. Translated into at least 40 languages as of 2014, the Kural is one of the [[List of literary works by number of translations|most widely translated works]] in the world.{{sfn|Ashraf, n.d.}} Because the life, culture and ethics of the [[Tamil people|Tamils]] are considered to be solely defined in terms of the values set by the Kural, the government and the people of [[Tamil Nadu]] alike uphold the text with utmost reverence.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} Along with the [[Gita]], the Kural is a prime candidate nominated to be the national book of India, for which a declaration was passed at the [[Tamil Nadu Assembly]] in 2006.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=63–80}}

==Etymology==
{{main|Glossary of names for the Tirukkural}}
The term ''Tirukkural'' is a compound word made of two individual terms, ''tiru'' and ''kural''. ''Tiru'' is an honorific Tamil term that corresponds to the universally Indian, Sanskrit term ''sri'' meaning "holy, sacred, excellent, honorable, and beautiful."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} The term ''tiru'' has as many as 19 different meanings.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=vii}} ''Kural'' means something that is "short, concise, and abridged."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} Etymologically, ''kural'' is the shortened form of ''kural paattu'', which is derived from ''kuruvenpaattu'', one of the two Tamil poetic forms explained by [[Tolkappiyam]], the other one being ''neduvenpaattu''.{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012a|pp=iv–vi}} According to Winslow, ''kural'' is used as a literary term to indicate "a metrical line of 2 feet, or a distich or couplet of short lines, the first of 4 and the second of 3 feet." Thus, ''Tirukkural'' literally comes to mean "sacred couplets."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}}

The Kural is unique among ancient works that it did not have a name nor did it have any mention of the author's name in it at the time of its release at the ruler's court at the city of [[Madurai]], the seat of the [[Third Sangam|Third Tamil Sangam]].{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} The author used the title ''Muppāl'', meaning "three divisions," to present it to the King,{{sfn|Pillai, 1972|p=3}} since the work was written about the first three of the four ancient Indian aims in life, known as ''[[Puruṣārtha|purushaarthas]]'', viz., virtue, wealth and love,{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}}{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333, 4341}} with the fourth aim, namely, salvation (''moksha''), implicitly said in the last five chapters of Book I.{{sfn|Pillai, 1972|pp=5–7}} Remaining nameless for several years after its writing, the work came to be referred to by various names in the centuries that followed. Nine traditional names had already been in use to refer to the book during the time of writing of the ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]'', a eulogy written on the Kural by various poets between the 1st and 11th centuries CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=155–156}} Nevertheless, the title ''Muppāl'' remained the work's primary name until the 13th century CE.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=105}} It is estimated that the Kural has historically been known by as many as 44 names given at various periods over the millennia, making it one of the numerously titled works.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}}

==Organization of the work==
The Kural is structured into 133 chapters, each containing 10 couplets (or kurals), for a total of 1,330 couplets.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} The 133 chapters are grouped into three parts, or "books":{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}{{sfn|Mukherjee, 1999|pp=392–393}}
* Book I – Aṟattuppāl (அறத்துப்பால்): [[Aram (Kural book)|Book of Virtue]] ([[Dharma]]), dealing with virtues independent of the surroundings (Chapters 1-38)
* Book II – Poruṭpāl (பொருட்பால்): [[Porul (Kural book)|Book of Polity]] ([[Artha]]), dealing with virtues with respect to the surroundings (Chapters 39-108)
* Book III – Kāmattuppāl (காமத்துப்பால்): [[Inbam (Kural book)|Book of Love]] ([[Kama]]), dealing with virtues involved in conjugal human love (Chapters 109-133)

Each ''kural'' or couplet contains exactly seven words, known as ''cir''s, with four ''cir''s on the first line and three on the second, following the [[Kural (poetic form)|kural]] [[Poetic metre|metre]]. A ''cir'' is a single or a combination of more than one Tamil word. For example, the term ''Thirukkural'' is a ''cir'' formed by combining the two words ''thiru'' and ''kuṛaḷ''. The book on ''Aṟam'' (virtue) contains 380 verses, that of ''Poruḷ'' (wealth) has 700 and that of ''Inbam'' (love) has 250.{{sfn|Kumar, 1999|pp=91–92}}

The overall organisation of the Kural text is based on seven ideals prescribed for a commoner besides observations of love.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} This includes 40 couplets on God, rain, ascetics, and virtue; 200 on domestic virtue; 140 on higher yet most fundamental virtue based on grace, benevolence and compassion; 250 on royalty; 100 on ministers of state; 220 on essential requirements of administration; 130 on morality, both positive and negative; and 250 on human love and passion.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

== Date ==
{{main| Dating the Tirukkural}}
The Kural has been dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]], and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed). The scholars who believe this tradition, such as Somasundara Bharathiar and M Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}}

Linguist [[Kamil Zvelebil]] is certain that ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' does not belong to the [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] period, and dates it to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} His estimate is based on the language of the text, its allusions to the earlier works, and its borrowing from some Sanskrit treatises.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=156}} Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations, that are absent in the older Sangam literature. The text also features a higher number of [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s compared to these older texts.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}} According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the "one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition," as a few of his verses seem to be translations of the verses in Sanskrit texts such as ''[[Dharmaśāstra|Mānavadharmaśāstra]]'' and [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthaśāstra]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}

[[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] assigned the work to c. 650 CE, believing that it borrowed from some Sanskrit works of 6th century CE.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1975|p=124}} Zvelebil disagrees with this assessment, pointing out that some of the words that Pillai believed to be Sanskrit loan words have now been proved to be of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin by [[Thomas Burrow]] and [[Murray Barnson Emeneau]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=171}}

In the face of incessant debate on the precise date, taking the latest of the estimated dates, the [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu government]] officially declared 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar, as suggested by [[Maraimalai Adigal]], on 18 January 1935, adding Valluvar Year to the calendar.{{sfn|''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935|p=117}}{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

Very little is known about Valluvar, the author of the Kural. In his work ''The Smile of Murugan'', [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Scholar [[Kamil Zvelebil]] cites a tradition suggesting he was an outcaste by birth, the issue of a union between a Brahmin man and a Pariah woman. Some think that he was a weaver by caste.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} He is believed to have been born in the temple town of [[Mylapore]], a locality within the present-day [[Chennai]], and is said to be a simple weaver by profession who wrote the kurals with divine inspiration. He was married to [[Vasuki (wife of Valluvar)|Vasuki]]. The first instance of the author's name mentioned as "Valluvar" is found to be several centuries later in a song of praise called the ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]''.{{sfn|Acharya.iitm.ac.in, n.d.}} Just as the book remained unnamed at the time of its presentation at the court of the ruler, the author too did not name himself in the writing of the book. Over the centuries that followed, people started calling the work "Tirukkural" and its author as "Thiruvalluvar". [[Monsieur Ariel]], who translated the Kural text into French, thus praised it as "the book without a name by an author without a name."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} There are also claims and counter-claims as to the authorship of the book and to the exact number of couplets written by Valluvar.

Valluvar is thought to have belonged to either [[Jainism]] or [[Hinduism]]. This can be observed in his treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept of both the religions. Valluvar's treatment of the chapters on [[moral vegetarianism]] (or [[veganism]]){{Ref label|A|a|none}} and [[non-killing]] reflects the Jain precepts, where these are stringently enforced.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} The three parts that the Kural is divided into, namely, ''aram'' (virtue), ''porul'' (wealth) and ''inbam'' (love), aiming at attaining ''veedu'' (ultimate salvation), follow, respectively, the four foundations of Hinduism, namely, [[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]].{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} His mentioning of God [[Vishnu]] in couplets 610 and 1103 and [[Goddess Lakshmi]] in couplets 167, 408, 519, 565, 568, 616, and 617 suggests the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] beliefs of Valluvar. Other eastern beliefs of Valluvar found in the book include previous birth and rebirth, seven births, and some ancient Indian astrological concepts, among others.{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|pp=1–6}} Despite using these contemporary religious concepts of his time, Valluvar has limited the usage of these terms to a metaphorical sense to explicate the fundamental virtues and ethics, without enforcing any of these religious beliefs in practice. This, chiefly, has made the treatise earn the title ''Ulaga Podhu Marai'' (the universal scripture).{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|pp=1–6}}

There is also the recent claim by Kanyakumari Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) that Valluvar was a king who ruled Valluvanadu in the hilly tracts of the [[Kanyakumari district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} The only other book that is attributted to Valluvar other than the Kural text is ''Gnanavetti'', a text that deals with spiritual aspects, due to which the author is also known as "Gnanavettiyan."{{sfn|Aranga Ramalingam, 1994|pp=}}

==Structural plan of the work==
[[File:Thiruvalluvar Statue at Kanyakumari 02.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=2|The statue of Valluvar, the author of the Kural text, at [[Kanyakumari]]]]
Having written by a single author, the Kural literature reveals a single structural plan.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=160}} The Kural is not an anthology for there is not any later additions to the text.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–160}} According to [[Kamil Zvelebil]], the content of the Kural text is "undoubtedly patterned."{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=163}} The entire work has been structured very carefully without an allowance for any structural gaps in the text such that every couplet remains indispensable for the structured whole. Thus, one can find two distinct meanings for every couplet in the Kural literature, namely, a structural one and a proverbial one. In their isolated form, that is, when removed from the content-structure, the couplets lose their structural meaning, the most important of the two, with the isolated distiches still remaining charming and interesting in themselves. This simply makes the isolated couplet a wise saying or a moral maxim, "a 'literary proverb' in perfect form, possessing, in varying degree, the prosodic and rhetoric qualities of gnomic poetry."{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–163}} On the other hand, within the content-structure, the couplets acquire their structural meaning in relation to other couplets, forming higher patterns, and finally, in relation to the entire work, they acquire perfection in the totality of their structure.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=158–163}}

According to [[Perunchithiranar (Tamil nationalist)|Pavalareru Perunchithiranar]], Valluvar has employed 28 different methods of conveying thoughts in the Kural text.{{sfn|Perunchithiranar, 1933}}

==Substance of the work==
Written with the contemporary society in view{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}} and marked by [[pragmatic idealism]],{{sfn|Top 12 Economists of India}} the Kural text is unique among the ancient literature in terms of both its poetic and its intellectual accomplishments.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|p=4333}} In poetic terms, it fuses verse and aphoristic form in diction in a "pithy, vigorous, forceful and terse" manner. In intellectual terms, it is written on the basis of [[secular ethics]], expounding a universal, moral and practical attitude towards life. Unlike religious scriptures, the Kural refrains from talking of hopes and promises of the other-worldly life. Rather it speaks of the ways of cultivating one's mind to achieve the other-worldly bliss in the present life itself. By occasionally referring to bliss beyond the worldly life, Valluvar equates what can be achieved in humanly life with what may be attained thereafter.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} Only in a couple of introductory chapters (Chapters 1 and 3) does Valluvar sound religious. Even here, he maintains a tone that could be acceptable to people of all faiths.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=36–37}}

It is believed that Valluvar composed every chapter in response to a request to produce ten best couplets on a particular subject. Nevertheless, he seldom shows any concern as to what [[similes]] and [[superlatives]] he used earlier while writing on other subjects, purposely allowing for some repetition and mild contradictions in ideas one can find in the Kural text. Despite knowing its seemingly contradictory nature from a purist point of view, Valluvar employs this method to emphasise the importance of the given code of ethic. Following are some of the instances where Valluvar employs contradictions to expound the virtues.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

* While in Chapter 93 Valluvar writes on the evils of intoxication, in Chapter 109 he uses the same to show the sweetness of love by saying love is sweeter than wine.
* To the question "What is wealth of all wealth?" Valluvar points out to two different things, namely, grace (Kural 241) and hearing (Kural 411).
* In regard to the virtues one should follow dearly even at the expense of other virtues, Valluvar points to veracity (Kural 297), not coveting another's wife (Kural 150), and not being called a slanderer (Kural 181). In essence, however, in Chapter 33 he crowns non-killing as the foremost of all virtues, pushing even the virtue of veracity to the second place (Kural 323).
* Whereas he says that one can eject what is natural or inborn in him (Kural 376), he indicates that one can overcome the inherent natural flaws by getting rid of laziness (Kural 609).
* While in Chapter 7 he asserts that the greatest gain men can obtain is by their learned children (Kural 61), in Chapter 13 he says that it is that which is obtained by self-control (Kural 122).

Nevertheless, the basic ideas of Valluvar is found in the introductory section of the Kural, which includes the first four chapters of the text. Valluvar begins this portion with the invocation of God and continues to praise the rain for being the vitalizer of all life forms on earth and describe the qualities of a righteous person, before concluding the introduction by emphasizing the value of ''aṟam'' or virtue.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}} Valluvar extols rain next only to God for it provides food and serves as the basis of a stable economic life by aiding in agriculture, which Valluvar asserts as the most important economic activity later in Book II of the Kural text.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}

{{Quote box|width=300px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote="Alone, first of good things, is 'not to slay';&lt;br&gt;The second is, no untrue word to say."|salign=right|source=(Kural 323; Pope, 1886).{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=44}}}}
The entire writing of all the three books of the Kural text bases ''aṟam'' or [[dharma]] as its cornerstone, which resulted in the Kural being referred to simply as ''Aṟam''.{{sfn|Alathur Kilar|pp=Verse 34}}{{sfn|Kowmareeshwari, 2012b|pp=46–47}}{{sfn| Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|p=55}} Contrary to what the [[Manusmriti]] says, Valluvar holds that ''aṟam'' is common for all, irrespective of whether the person is a bearer of [[palanquin]] or the rider in it.{{sfn|Valluvar|pp=Verse 37}}{{sfn|Visveswaran, 2016|pp=ix–xi}} The greatest of virtues according to Valluvar is [[non-killing]], followed by [[veracity (ethics)|veracity]],{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4341–4342}}{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34–36}} which he plainly indicates in couplet 323,{{sfn|Valluvar|pp=Verse 323}} and the two greatest sins that Valluvar feels very strongly are ingratitude and [[meat-eating]].{{sfn|Sethupillai, 1956|pp=34–36}}{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=13}}{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963|pp=162–163}} As observed by [[P. S. Sundaram]] in the introduction to his work, while "all other sins may be redeemed, but never ingratitude," Valluvar couldn't understand "how anyone could wish to fatten himself by feeding on the fat of others."{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|p=13}} The Kural differs from every other work on morality in that it follows ethics, surprisingly a divine one, even in its Book of Love.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=26}} In the words of [[Gopalkrishna Gandhi]], Valluvar maintains his views on personal morality even in the Book of Love, where one can normally expect greater poetic leniency, by describing the hero as "a one-woman man" without concubines.{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}}

==Comparison with other ancient literature==
[[File:Tirukkural manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Palm leaf manuscript of the Tirukkural]]
Unlike the mystic philosopher of [[Lao Tzu]] or the law-giving prophets of the [[Judaeo-Christian tradition]], Valluvar remained a philosopher concerning with the day-to-day conduct of a common individual.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}} Scholars compares the codes of virtue, nobility, propriety, just governance, conduct, social obligations, self-control, education and knowledge with other ancient thoughts such as the Confucian sayings in [[Lun Yu]], [[Hitopadesa]], [[Panchatantra]], [[Manusmriti]], [[Tirumandiram]], [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible, sayings of the [[Buddha]] in [[Dhammapada]], and the ethical works of Persian origin such as [[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]] and [[Bustan (book)|Bustan]], in addition to the holy books of various religions.{{sfn|SSP, 2012|pp=vii–xvi}}

===Similarities with ancient Indian literature===
Several ancient Indian literature such as [[Manusmriti]], [[Kautilya]]'s [[Arthashastra]], [[Kamandaka]]'s [[Nitisara]] bear likeness with the second book (''Porul''), the book on wealth, of the Kural text, while [[Vatsyayana]]'s [[Kamasutra]] shares similarities with ''Inbam'', the third book of the Kural text (the book on love).{{sfn|Sundaram, 1990|pp=7–16}} However, the attitude and approach of Valluvar in expounding the virtues remain entirely different from any of these contemporary works. While the Artha Shastra is based on subtle statecraft, the ''Porul'' of the Kural text bases morality and benevolence as its cornerstones.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=901–902}} The social hierarchies and discrimination found in Manusmriti are contrasted with Valluvar's concept of universal brotherhood and oneness of humanity. Unlike Kamasutra, which is all about eros and techniques of sexual fulfillment, the Kural text of ''Inbam'' remains a poetic appreciation of flowering human love as explicated by the Sangam period's concept of intimacy, known as ''aham'' in the Tamil literary tradition.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}

===Similarities with Confucian thoughts===
The Kural text and the [[Confucianism|Confucian sayings]] recorded in the classic [[Analects|Analects of Chinese]] (called ''Lun Yu'', meaning "Sacred Sayings") resemble each other in many ways. Both Valluvar and [[Confucius]] focused on the behaviors and moral conducts of a common person. Similar to Valluvar, Confucius advocated legal justice embracing human principles, courtesy, and [[filial piety]], besides the virtues of [[wiktionary:benevolence|benevolence]], [[righteousness]], [[loyalty]] and [[trustworthiness]] as foundations of life.{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|pp=104-111}} Incidentally, Valluvar differed from Confucius in two respects. Firstly, unlike Confucius, Valluvar was also a poet. Secondly, Confucius did not deal with the subject of [[conjugal love]], for which Valluvar devoted an entire division in his work.{{sfn|Anonymous|1999|p=vii}}

==Publication of the work==
[[File:Thirukkural Madras 1812.JPG|thumb|150px|First known edition of the Kural, published in Tamil, in 1812.]]

Save for the highly educated circle of scholars and elites outside the Tamil land, the Kural remained largely unknown to the outside world for close to one-and-a-half millennia. It had been passed on as word of mouth from parents to their children and from preceptors to their students for generations within the Tamil-speaking regions of [[South India]]. It was not until 1595 when the first translation of the work appeared in [[Malayalam]] that the work became known to the wider circle outside the Tamil-speaking communities.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The work first came to print in 1812, with the Kural text getting published in Tamil, chiefly by the efforts of the then Collector of Madras [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], who established the "Chennai Kalvi Sangam."{{sfn|S. Blackburn, 2006|pp=92–95}} It was published by Thanjai Gyanaprakash.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It was only in 1835 that Indians were permitted to establish printing press. Thus, the Kural became the first book to be published in Tamil.{{sfn|Madhavan, ''The Hindu'', 21 June 2010}} Soon, Mahalinga Iyer published the first 24 chapters of the Kural with commentaries for the first time. In 1850, the complete work of the Kural was published with commentaries by [[Vedagiri Mudaliar]], who published a revised version later in 1853. This publication was later used by [[Ramalinga Adigal|'Vallalar' Ramalinga Adigal]] to teach the Kural to the masses.{{sfn|Kolappan, ''The Hindu'', 3 October 2018}}

==Commentaries and translations==
{{main|Translations of Tirukkural|List of Tirukkural translations by language|Tirukkural translations into English}}

===Commentaries===
The Kural is arguably the most reviewed of all works in [[Tamil literature]], and almost every notable scholar has written commentaries (explanation in prose or verse) on it.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{Ref label|D|d|none}} According to R. Ilankumaran, there are four requisites necessary to write commentaries to the Kural text:{{sfn|Ilankumaran, 2018|p=xi}}
# The awareness that the meaning of everything that is written in the Kural text is available in the work itself
# A workable knowledge of the [[Tolkappiam]]
# A thorough knowledge of the [[Sangam literature]] and [[Sangam landscape|landscape]]
# A practical knowledge of how things work in their nature.

There have been several commentaries written on the Kural over the centuries. Many poets of the first few centuries of the [[common era]] used various Kural couplets to illustrate their works. These include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Seethalai Satthanar]], [[Sekkilar]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]].{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} These can be considered the first commentaries to the Kural text, albeit in verse form and incomplete.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} In the centuries that followed, numerous commentators of various other works employed Kural couplets to elaborate their ideas, providing explanations to the couplets in the process, both in verse and in prose forms.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}} These include Adiyarkku Nallar, Nacchinaarkiniyar, Mayilainathar, and Shankara Namacchivayar.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=338}}

Exclusive commentaries on the Kural text started appearing much later. There were at least ten medieval commentaries written by pioneer poets of which only six are available today. The [[Ten Medieval Commentators|ten canonical medieval commentators]] include [[Manakkudavar]], [[Dharumar]], [[Dhamatthar]], [[Nacchar]], [[Paridhi|Paridhiyar]], [[Thirumalaiyar]], [[Mallar (poet)|Mallar]], Kaliperumal or [[Pari Perumal]], [[Kaalingar]], and [[Parimelazhagar]], all of whom lived between the 10th and the 13th centuries CE. Of these, only the works of Manakkudavar, Paridhi, Kaalingar, Pari Perumal, and Parimelazhagar are available today. The works of Dharumar, Dhaamatthar, and Nacchar are only partially available. The commentaries by Thirumalaiyar and Mallar are lost. The pioneer among these commentators are Parimelazhagar and Manakkudavar.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=337}}{{sfn|Natarajan, 2008|p=2}} Besides these, there are three more medieval commentaries written by unknown authors.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} One of them was published under the title "Palaiya Urai" (meaning ancient commentary), while the second one was based on Paridhiyar's commentary.{{sfn|Aravindan, 1968|p=339}} The third one was published in 1991 under the title "Jaina Urai" (meaning Jaina commentary) by [[Saraswathi Mahal Library]] in [[Thanjavur]].{{sfn|Balasubramanian, 2016|p=129}} Following these medieval commentaries, there are at least 21 [[venba]] commentaries to the Kural, including Somesar Mudumoli Venba, Murugesar Muduneri Venba, Sivasiva Venba, Irangesa Venba, and Vadamalai Venba, all of which are considered commentaries in verse form.{{sfn|Nedunchezhiyan, 1991|p=ix}}

Several modern commentaries started appearing in the 19th and the 20th centuries. Some of the commentaries of the 20th century include those by [[Iyothee Thass]], [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]], [[Thiru Vi Ka]], [[Bharathidasan]], [[M. Varadarajan]], [[Namakkal kavignar]], [[Thirukkuralar V. Munusamy]], [[Devaneya Pavanar]], [[Karunanidhi|M. Karunanithi]], and [[Solomon Pappaiah]].

===Translations===
[[File:Tirukkural.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas-relief]] inscriptions of the Kural couplets at [[Valluvar Kottam]]]]
The first translation known of the Kural text is a Malayalam translation that appeared in about 1595. However, the manuscript remained unpublished and was first reported by the Annual Report of the Cochin Archeological Department for the year 1933 to 1934.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The [[Christian missionaries]] who came to [[India]] during the [[colonial era]], inspired by the similarities of the [[Christian ideal]]s found in the Kural, started translating the text into various [[European languages]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=28–47}} The [[Latin]] translation of the Kural, the first of the translations into European languages, was made by [[Constanzo Beschi|Constantius Joseph Beschi]] in 1730. However, he translated only the first two parts, viz., virtue and wealth, leaving out the section on love assuming that it would be inappropriate for a Christian missionary to do so. The first French translation was brought about by an unknown author by about 1767 that went unnoticed. The first available French version was by Monsieur Ariel in 1848. Again, he did not translate the whole work but only parts of it. The first [[German language|German]] translation was made by [[Karl Graul|Dr. Karl Graul]], who published it in 1856 both at [[London]] and [[Leipzig]]. Graul's translation was unfortunately incomplete due to his premature death.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|pp=30–31}} The first, and incomplete, [[English language|English]] translations were made by N. E. Kindersley in 1794 and then by [[Francis Whyte Ellis]] in 1812. While Kindersley translated a selection of the Kural text, Ellis translated 120 couplets in all—69 of them in verse and 51 in prose.{{sfn|S. Blackburn, 2006|pp=92–95}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1992|pp=}} [[William Henry Drew (Christian missionary)|W. H. Drew]] translated the first two parts in prose in 1840 and 1852, respectively. It contained the original Tamil text of the Kural, Parimelazhagar's commentary, Ramanuja Kavirayar's amplification of the commentary and Drew's English prose translation. However, Drew was able to translate only 630 couplets, and the remaining were made by [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]], a native missionary. Like Beschi, Drew did not translate the part on love.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=31}} The first complete English translation of the Kural was the one by [[George Uglow Pope]] in 1886, which brought the Kural to the western world.{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=32}}

By the end of the 20th century, there were about 24 translations of the Kural in English alone, by both native and non-native scholars, including those by [[V. V. S. Aiyar]], [[K. M. Balasubramaniam]], [[Shuddhananda Bharati]], [[A. Chakravarti]], [[M. S. Purnalingam Pillai]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[P. S. Sundaram]], [[V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar]], [[G. Vanmikanathan]], [[Kasturi Srinivasan]], [[S. N. Sriramadesikan]], and [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar]].{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=36}} At present, the Kural has been translated into 37 languages.{{sfn|Ashraf, n.d.}} It is also said that the work has also been translated into [[Vaagri Booli language|Vaagri Booli]], the language of the [[Narikurava|Narikuravas]], a tribal community in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 25 March 2013}} It is the most translated Tamil literature and also the most translated non-religious text of India.

===Translational difficulties===
With a highly compressed prosodic form, the Kural text employs the intricately complex ''[[Kural (poetic form)|Kural venba]]'' [[Poetic metre|metre]], known for its eminent suitability to gnomic poetry.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=166}} This form, which Zvelebil calls "a marvel of brevity and condensation," is closely connected with the structural properties of the Tamil language and has historically presented extreme difficulties to its translators.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=167}} Talking about translating the Kural into other languages, [[Herbert Arthur Popley]] observes, "it is impossible in any translation to do justice to the beauty and force of the original."{{sfn|Popley, 1931|p=x}} Zvelebil claims that it is impossible to truly appreciate the maxims found in the Kural couplets through a translation but rather that the Kural has to be read and understood in its original Tamil form.{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|p=169}}

Besides these inherent difficulties in translating the Kural, some scholars have attempted to either read their own ideas into the Kural couplets or deliberately misinterpret the message to make it conform to their preconceived notions. The Latin translation by [[Constantius Joseph Beschi|Father Beshi]], for instance, contains several such mistranslations noticed by modern scholars. According to V. Ramasamy, "Beschi is purposely distorting the message of the original when he renders பிறவாழி as ‘the sea of miserable life’ and the phrase பிறவிப்பெருங்கடல் as ‘sea of this birth’ which has been translated by others as ‘the sea of many births’. Beschi means thus ‘those who swim the vast sea of miseries’. The concept of rebirth or many births for the same soul is contrary to Christian principle and belief."{{sfn|Ramasamy, 2001|p=33}}

==Memorials==
[[File:இலண்டன் திருவள்ளுவர்.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Valluvar at SOAS, [[University of London]].]]
The Kural text and its author have been highly venerated over the centuries. In the early 16th century, a [[Thiruvalluvar Temple|temple]] was constructed in [[Mylapore]], [[Chennai]], in honor of Valluvar. It was extensively renovated in the 1970s.{{sfn|Chakravarthy and Ramachandran, 2009}} There are also temples for Valluvar at [[Periya Kalayamputhur (Dindigul district)|Periya Kalayamputhur]], [[Thondi]], [[Kanjoor|Kanjoor Thattanpady]], [[Senapathy village (Idukki district)|Senapathy]], and [[Vilvarani (Tiruvannamalai district)|Vilvarani]].{{sfn|Vedanayagam, 2017|p=113}}

In 1976, [[Valluvar Kottam]], a monument to honor the Kural literature and its author, was constructed in [[Chennai]]. The chief element of the monument includes a 39-m-high chariot, a replica of the chariot in the temple town of [[Thiruvarur]], and it contains a life-size statue of Valluvar. All the 1,330 verses of the Kural text are inscribed on bas-relief in the corridors in the main hall.

Statues of Valluvar have been erected across the globe, including the ones at [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]], Chennai, [[Bengaluru]], [[Haridwar]], [[Puttalam]], [[Singapore]], and [[London]].{{sfn|Vedanayagam, 2017|pp=110–111}} The tallest of these is the 133-feet (40.6&amp;nbsp;m) stone [[Thiruvalluvar Statue|statue of Valluvar]] erected in 2000 atop a small island in the town of Kanyakumari on the southernmost tip of the [[Indian peninsula]], at the confluence of the [[Bay of Bengal]], the [[Arabian Sea]], and the [[Indian Ocean]].{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 2 January 2000}} This statue is currently India's 25th tallest.

==Reception==
{{main|Praise of Tirukkural}}
[[File:Valluva-nayanar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|right|An ancient portrait of Valluvar]]
While it has been widely acknowledged that Valluvar was of [[Jain]] origin{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}}{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} and the Kural to its most part was inspired from [[Jain philosophy|Jain]], [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu]] and other [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient Indian philosophies]],{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}}{{sfn|Venkataramanan, ''The Hindu'', 12 January 2018}} owing to its universality and non-denominational nature, almost every religious group in [[India]] and across the world, including [[Christianity]], has claimed the work for itself. For example, [[G. U. Pope]] speaks of the book as an "echo of the 'Sermon on the Mount.'" In the Introduction to his English translation of the Kural, Pope even claims, "I cannot feel any hesitation in saying that the Christian Scriptures were among the sources from which the poet derived his inspiration." However, the chapters on the ethics of [[moral vegetarianism]] (Chapter 26) and [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33), which the Kural emphasizes emphatically unlike the [[Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|14:3–14:29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Abrahamic]] religious texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|5|1|end=5|style=ns|t=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the ethics of the Kural is rather a reflection of the [[Jain philosophy|Jaina moral code]] than of [[Christian ethics]].{{sfn|Zvelebil, 1973|pp=156-171}} J. M. Nallaswamy Pillai dismisses Pope’s statement as “an absurd literary anachronism,” citing the Kural text as “a stumbling block which can browbeat the most sublime ideas of Christian morality.”{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|pp=26–27}}

The Kural is praised for its universality across the globe. The ancient Tamil poet [[Avvaiyar]] observed, "Valluvar pierced an atom and injected seven seas into it and compressed it into what we have today as Kural."{{sfn|Avvaiyar|pp=Verse 55}}{{sfn| Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} The [[Russia]]n philosopher [[Alexander Piatigorsky]] called it chef d'oeuvre of both Indian and world literature "due not only to the great artistic merits of the work but also to the lofty humane ideas permeating it which are equally precious to the people all over the world, of all periods and countries."{{sfn|Pyatigorsky, n.d.|p=515}} [[G. U. Pope]] called its author "a bard of universal man."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2015|p=vi}} According to [[Albert Schweitzer]], "there hardly exists in the literature of the world a collection of maxims in which we find so much of lofty wisdom."{{sfn| Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Leo Tolstoy]] called it "the Hindu Kural,"{{sfn|Tolstoy, 1908}} and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] called it "a textbook of indispensable authority on moral life" and went on to say, "The maxims of Valluvar have touched my soul. There is none who has given such a treasure of wisdom like him."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Sir A. Grant]] said, "Humility, charity and forgiveness of injuries, being Christian qualities, are not described by Aristotle. Now these three are everywhere forcibly inculcated by the Tamil Moralist."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=xii (Introduction)}} [[Edward Jewitt Robinson]] said that the Kural contains all things and there is nothing which it does not contain.{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} Rev. [[John Lazarus (Christian missionary)|John Lazarus]] said, "No Tamil work can ever approach the purity of the Kural. It is a standing repute to modern Tamil."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} According to [[K. M. Munshi]], "Thirukkural is a treatise par excellence on the art of living."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Sri Aurobindo]] stated, "Thirukkural is gnomic poetry, the greatest in planned conception and force of execution ever written in this kind."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Monsieur Ariel]], who translated and published the third part of the Kural to French in 1848, called it "a masterpiece of Tamil literature, one of the highest and purest expressions of human thought."{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i (Introduction)}} According to Rev. [[Emmons E. White]], "Thirukkural is a synthesis of the best moral teachings of the world."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Rajaji]] commented, "It is the gospel of love and a code of soul-luminous life. The whole of human aspiration is epitomized in this immortal book, a book for all ages."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}} [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]], former [[President of India]], said, "Thirukkural is a treasure house of worldly knowledge, ethical guidance and spiritual wisdom."{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}}

Along with [[Nalatiyar]], another work on ethics and morality from the Sangam period, the Kural is praised for its veracity. An age-old Tamil maxim has it that "[[banyan]] and [[neem]] maintain oral health; Four and Two maintain moral health," where "Four" and "Two" refer to the [[quatrains]] and [[couplets]] of Nalatiyar and the Kural, respectively.

==In popular culture==
With the rediscovery of the image of Valluvar in 1959, the portrait of the author with matted hair and a flowing beard, as drawn by artist K. R. Venugopal Sharma in 1960,{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}} was accepted by the state and central governments as the standardised version. It soon became a popular and the standard portrait of the poet.{{sfn|Parthasarathy, ''The Hindu'', 12 December 2015}} In 1964, the image was unveiled in the [[Indian Parliament]] by the then President of India [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]]. In 1967, the Tamil Nadu government passed an order stating that the image of Valluvar should be present in all government offices across the state of Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Sharma, 2018|pp=41–42}}{{Ref label|E|e|none}}

The Kural does not appear to have been set in music by Valluvar. However, a number of musicians have set it to tune and several singers have rendered it in their concerts. Modern composers who have tuned the Kural couplets include [[Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri]] and [[Ramani Bharadwaj]]. Singers who have performed full-fledged Tirukkural concerts include [[M. M. Dandapani Desikar]] and [[Chidambaram C. S. Jayaraman]].{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}} [[Madurai Somasundaram]] and [[Sanjay Subramanian]] are other people who have given musical rendering of the Kural. Mayuram Vishwanatha Shastri set all the verses to music in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Music Academy Conference lectures, 2017|pp=}} In January 2016, [[Chitravina N. Ravikiran]] set the entire 1330 verses to music in a record time of 16 hours.{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}}{{sfn|''Deccan Herald'', 31 March 2018}} It can be said that it was [[Tamil cinema|cinema]] that made the general public hear Tirukkural being sung. For instance, [[K. Balachander]]'s [[Kavithalayaa Productions]] opened its films with the very first couplet of the Kural sung in the background.{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}}

Several Tirukkural conferences were conducted in the twentieth century, most famously by [[Tirukkural V. Munusamy]] in 1941{{sfn|Periyannan, 2013|p=}} and by [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] in 1949. The 1949 conference, headed by [[Thiru. V. Kalyanasundaram|Thiru. Vi. Ka]], [[T. P. Meenakshisundaram]], and [[A. Chakravarti]], was held for two days on 15 and 16 January, with several scholars and celebrities participating in it, including S.

In 1818, the then Collector of Madras [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], who had a high regard for Valluvar and his work, issued a gold coin bearing Valluvar's image when he was made in charge of the Madras treasury and mint.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}}{{Ref label|F|f|none}}{{Ref label|G|g|none}} In the late 19th century, the South Indian saint [[Vallalar]] launched a movement in [[Vadalur]] to teach Tirukkural to the masses.{{sfn|Kolappan, ''The Hindu'', 3 October 2018}}{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}} In 1968, the Tamil Nadu government made it mandatory to display a Kural couplet in all government buses.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=54–55}} The train running a distance of 2,921&amp;nbsp;kilometers between Kanyakumari and [[New Delhi]] is named by the Indian Railways as the ''[[Thirukural Express]]''.{{sfn|IndianRailInfo, n.d.}} Kural also remains an integral part of the lifestyle of Tamil-speaking populations that it is propagated through various means such as music,{{sfn|Rangan, ''The Hindu'', 19 March 2016}} dance,{{sfn|Venkatasubramanian, ''The Hindu'', 26 April 2018}} street shows,{{sfn|Venkataramanan, ''The Hindu'', 22 April 2010}} recitals,{{sfn|Madhavan, ''The Hindu'', 26 August 2016}} activities,{{sfn|Ramakrishnan, ''The Hindu'', 4 September 2006}} and puzzles and riddles.{{sfn|Sujatha, ''The Hindu'', 11 July 2016}}&lt;!--Dear Fellow Editors: Add these after finding citations: drama, art, theatre, lectures, discourses, movies, media, personal chats--&gt;

[[File:Thiruvalluvar Statue Kanyakumari.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Valluvar at Kanyakumari.]]
The Kural remains one of the most influential texts of ancient India and the chief text of the Tamil language, influencing generations of scholars at a pan-Indian expanse.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} The work had influenced people from all walks of lives, which can be inferred from the parallels found in the literatures of various languages within the Indian Subcontinent.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=50–55}} Although translations of the work into other Indian languages were not available until at least the 16th century, the work had been studied by other language scholars for centuries before the foreign invasion of India.{{sfn|Sanjeevi, 1973|pp=44–49}} With its translations into European languages starting from the early 18th century, Kural began to have a global influence. Besides numerous poets of the [[Sangam era]] including [[Avvaiyar I]] and [[Kapilar]], authors influenced by the Kural include [[Ilango Adigal]], [[Seethalai Satthanar]], [[Sekkilar]], [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Vallalar]], [[Monsieur Ariel]], [[Constantius Joseph Beschi]], [[Karl Graul]], [[August Friedrich Caemmerer]], [[Nathaniel Edward Kindersley]], [[Francis Whyte Ellis]], [[Charles E. Gover]], [[George Uglow Pope]], [[Vinoba Bhave]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]], and [[Yu Hsi]]. Many of these authors have translated the work into their languages.{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}}{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334, 4341–4342}}

Historically, the Kural experienced a few centuries of hiatus soon after its writing, dubbed the "Dark Age," following which it enjoyed a revival period when the teachings of the Kural started to influence people greatly.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|pp=894–895}} A notable example was from the period of [[Karikalan]] during the 1st century CE, when the [[Chola dynasty|Chola ruler]] was influenced by the Kural to undertake several historically significant agricultural reforms, including reclaiming lands and building dams.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=899}} Another example was during the [[Pallava Dynasty]] when the people had to face the [[Kalabhra dynasty|Kalabhra invasion]] around 250 CE.{{sfn|Hajela, 2008|p=895}}

Kural remains the only work that was honored with an exclusive work of compiled paeans in the [[Sangam literature]], authored by 55 different poets, including legendary ones.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} Kural also remains the most cited work during the [[Sangam era]] and the most quoted Tamil work ever since. Classical works such as the [[Purananuru]], [[Manimekalai]], [[Silappathikaram]], [[Periya Puranam]], and [[Kamba Ramayanam]] all cite the Kural by various names, bestowing numerous titles to the work that was originally untitled by its author.{{sfn|Jagannathan, 1963|pp=16–30}} In Kamba Ramayanam, poet [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] has used as many as 1100 couplets of the Kural.{{sfn|Desikar, 1975|pp=}}

The Kural text was first included in the school syllabus by the then [[British Raj|British government]].{{sfn|TNN, ''The Times of India'', 26 July 2017}} However, only select 275 couplets have been taught to the schoolchildren between III to XII Standards.{{sfn|Ashok, ''Live Law.in'', 1 May 2016}} Attempts to include the Kural literature as a compulsory subject in schools were ineffective in the decades following [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Independence]].{{sfn|Saravanan, ''The Times of India'', 27 April 2016}} On 26 April 2016, the [[Madras High Court]] directed the state government to include all the 108 chapters of the [[Book of Aram|Books of Aram]] and [[Book of Porul|Porul]] of the Kural text in school syllabus for classes VI through XII from the academic year 2017–2018 "to build a nation with moral values."{{sfn|Saravanan, ''The Times of India'', 27 April 2016}} The court observed, "No other philosophical or religious work has such moral and intellectual approach to problems of life."{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 27 April 2016}}

The Kural has inspired many to pursue the path of ahimsa or non-violence. [[Leo Tolstoy]] was inspired by the concept of [[non-violence]] found in the Kural when he read a [[German language|German]] version of the book, who in turn instilled the concept in [[Mahatma Gandhi]] through his [[A Letter to a Hindu]] when young Gandhi sought his guidance.{{sfn|Rajaram, 2009|pp=xviii–xxi}}{{sfn|Tolstoy, 1908}} Gandhi then took to studying the Kural in prison, which eventually culminated in his starting the non-violence movement to fight against the British.{{sfn|Lal, 1992|pp=4333–4334}} It is said that Gandhi had learnt Tamil only to read the original text of the Kural.{{sfn|''The Hindu'', 27 April 2016}} [[Vallalar]] was inspired by the Kural at a young age and spent his whole life promoting compassion and non-violence, emphasizing on a compassionate, non-killing, and meatless way of life.{{sfn|Subbaraman, 2015|pp=39–42}}{{sfn|Sivagnanam, 1974|p=96}}

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} The Kural insists on "[[moral vegetarianism]]", the doctrine that humans are morally obligated to refrain from [[Ethics of eating meat|eating meat]] or harming [[Sentience|sentient beings]],{{sfn|Parimelalhagar, 2009|pp=256–266, 314–336}} known as "veganism" since the 20th century, as described by [[Mylan Engel]] in his "The Immorality of Eating Meat" (2000).{{sfn|Engel, 2000|pp=856–889}} The concept of [[ahimsa]] or இன்னா செய்யாமை, which remains the moral foundation of veganism,{{sfn|Dinshah, 2010}} is described in the chapter on [[non-violence]] (Chapter 32).{{sfn|Parimelalhagar, 2009|pp=314–324}}

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} The couplets are generally numbered in a linear fashion across the three books, covering all the 1,330 couplets. They can also be denoted by their chapter number and couplet number within the chapter. Thus, the third couplet in Chapter 104 ([[Agriculture]]), for instance, can be numbered either as 1033 or, less commonly, as 104:3.

'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} The Valluvar Year is obtained by adding 31 years to the present [[Gregorian year]].{{sfn|''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935|p=117}}

'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} ''Commentary'' refers to prosaic interpretations written by various scholars for the original verse form of the Kural couplets. These commentaries are chiefly written in Tamil by pioneer writers over the millennia. In highly canonical literary works and works of poetry, such as the [[Silappathikaram]] and [[Kamba Ramayanam]], commentary can also appear in verse form, often blending with the work inseparably. ''Translation'', on the other hand, refers to any interpretation, either in prose or in verse, verbatim or otherwise, of the Kural couplets in other languages. Thus, any commentary written in a language other than Tamil is considered a prose translation of the Tamil original in that particular language.

'''e.''' {{Note label|E|e|none}} [[Government of Tamil Nadu]], G. O. Ms. 1193, dated 1967.{{sfn|Sharma, 2018|pp=41–42}}

'''f.''' {{Note label|F|f|none}} A stone inscription found on the walls of a well at the Periya Palayathamman temple at [[Royapettah|Royapettai]] indicates Ellis' regard for Valluvar. It is one of the 27 wells dug on the orders of Ellis in 1818, when Madras suffered a severe drinking water shortage. In the long inscription Ellis praises Valluvar and uses a couplet from the Tirukkural to explain his actions during the drought. When he was in charge of the Madras treasury and mint, he also issued a gold coin bearing Valluvar's image. The Tamil inscription on his grave makes note of his commentary of Tirukkural.{{sfn|Mahadevan, n.d.}}

'''g.''' {{Note label|G|g|none}} The original inscription in Tamil written in the ''asiriyapa'' [[Poetic metre|metre]] and first-person perspective: (The Kural he quotes is in italics) &lt;br /&gt; சயங்கொண்ட தொண்டிய சாணுறு நாடெனும் | ஆழியில் இழைத்த வழகுறு மாமணி | குணகடன் முதலாக குட கடலளவு | நெடுநிலம் தாழ நிமிர்ந்திடு சென்னப் | பட்டணத்து எல்லீசன் என்பவன் யானே | பண்டாரகாரிய பாரம் சுமக்கையில் | புலவர்கள் பெருமான் மயிலையம் பதியான் | தெய்வப் புலமைத் திருவள்ளுவனார் | திருக்குறள் தன்னில் திருவுளம் பற்றிய் | ''இருபுனலும் வாய்த்த மலையும் வருபுனலும்'' | ''வல்லரணும் நாட்டிற் குறுப்பு'' | என்பதின் பொருளை என்னுள் ஆய்ந்து | ஸ்வஸ்திஸ்ரீ சாலிவாகன சகாப்த வரு | ..றாச் செல்லா நின்ற | இங்கிலிசு வரு 1818ம் ஆண்டில் | பிரபவாதி வருக்கு மேற் செல்லா நின்ற | பஹுதான்ய வரு த்தில் வார திதி | நக்ஷத்திர யோக கரணம் பார்த்து | சுப திநத்தி லிதனோ டிருபத்தேழு | துரவு கண்டு புண்ணியாஹவாசநம் | பண்ணுவித்தேன்.

The '''Winchester Hoard''' is a [[hoard]] of [[Iron Age]] gold found in a field in the [[Winchester]] area of [[Hampshire]], [[England]], in 2000, by a retired [[florist]]&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1156472.ece|title=Golden hoard of Winchester gives up its secret|author=Alberge, Dalya|date=8 September 2003|publisher=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/nov/17/heritage.highereducation|title=There's gold in them there hills|author=Gilchrist, Andrew|date=17 November 2003|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amateur [[metal detector]]ist, Kevan Halls. It was declared [[treasure trove|treasure]] and valued at £350,000—the highest reward granted under the [[Treasure Act 1996]] up to the time.

The hoard consists of two sets of jewellery of a very high purity of [[gold]] dating from 75–25 BCE. Although, the items pre-date the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in 43 CE, the manufacturing technology was Roman rather than Celtic. The total weight of the items is nearly {{convert|1160|g|oz|abbr=on}}.

The find was described as "the most important discovery of Iron Age gold objects" for fifty years;&lt;ref name="tar2000"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncmd.co.uk/docs/treasurereport2000.pdf|title=Treasure Annual Report 2000|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|pages=16–18;133|year=2001|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the items were probably an "expensive", "[[diplomatic gift]]".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; The brooches alone were "the third discovery of its kind from [[Great Britain|Britain]]".

The Winchester Hoard is now housed at the [[British Museum]] in London.

==Discovery and valuation==
The hoard was discovered near Winchester over a series of trips to a farmer's ploughed field in September, October, and December, 2000&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; by retired florist&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt; and amateur metal detectorist Kevan Halls.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_winchester_hoard.aspx|title=The Winchester hoard|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first discovery, which was of the brooches,&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/has/ps/past/past38.html|title=Prehistoric Society - Past No. 38|date=August 2001|publisher=[[The Prehistoric Society]]|work=Newsletter Number 38|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="club"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fieldclub.hants.org.uk/publications/news43/arch43d.html|title=Conference report - Hampshire in the Iron Age: A Special Place?|author=Ainsworth, Kay|year=2005|publisher=Hampshire Field Club &amp; Archaeological Society|work=Newsletter 43 - Spring 2005|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was reported to the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]], and archaeologists attached to the British Museum were able to excavate the find site to ascertain the historical context of the find.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; No evidence of a settlement or temple, by way of architectural remnants, was found.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; It was more likely that the hoard was buried "on top of a small hill... covered with trees".&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

The hoard was declared [[treasure trove|treasure]] following a [[Inquests in England and Wales|coroner's inquest]], and later valued at £350,000,&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/8057/winchester-hoard|title=Winchester Hoard by Iron Age|publisher=[[The Art Fund]]|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was shared between finder and landowner under the [[Treasure Act 1996]] – the highest reward granted under that Act at that time.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; It was also the first time the context of a find was investigated by the British Museum in conjunction with said Act.&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt;

==Items discovered==
The hoard contains two sets of gold jewellery;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; each includes a [[torc]], a pair of [[brooch]]es, or [[fibula]]e,&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; linked by a chain (of which only one chain was found), and a [[bracelet]] (of which one was broken in half). They were all made with a very high gold content – between 91% and 99% – determined by [[X-ray fluorescence]] tests at the British Museum.&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; The total weight of the hoard is {{convert|1158.8|g| oz|abbr=on}} (37.25 [[troy]] ounces).&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; It is dated from 75–25 BC,&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; which places it in the Late [[British Iron Age]].

All of the brooches are of a bow type, with two being further classified as ''Knotenfibeln'' ("interlace fibulas"),&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; typical of [[La Tène style]]&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; The chain is of gold wire, interlinked, with a hook at either end to attach to each pair of brooches. The bracelets are, or were in the case of the broken one, [[penannular|ring shaped]]. The ends of the torcs exhibit some ornamentation ([[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]]), and in the case of the smaller one, [[filigree]]. Both granulation and filigree had been attached by diffusion [[solder]]ing.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/archaeology/excavations_techniques/fact_files_02.shtml|title=Hidden Treasure Fact Files|author=Faulkner, Dr Neil|date=11 May 2009|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the torcs is larger than the other, so it is assumed that each was intended for different sexes,&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; and that the items had been worn.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;

==Significance==
The find was called "the most important discovery of Iron Age gold objects"&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; since the [[Snettisham Hoard]], over fifty years previously.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The objects were also described as "unique", "very unusual"&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; and even "iconic".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Given that gold brooches from the Iron Age are more rare than silver ones—in fact, this was only the third discovery of its kind from Britain, and one of "less than a dozen" from Northern Europe&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;—it was possible to date the hoard more accurately by these.&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; However, the torcs were unusual in that no others of this type had been found from Iron Age Britain,&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt; indeed Europe, up until then. The design was close to typical Iron Age torcs, but were made "using [[Roman empire|Roman]] or [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Greek]] technology",&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt; although this was several years before the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD – in other words, the execution was beyond the manufacturing knowledge of the [[Celts]],&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and a link between Britain, Rome and Greece before such historical events.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt; Moreover, social changes in Hampshire and [[West Sussex]] in the first century BC were highlighted.&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt;

The dichotomy of Roman craftmanship against "[[Barbarian]] taste"&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; was further reinforced by Dr Jeremy Hills, who compiled both the British Museum and Treasure Annual Report for the hoard,&lt;ref name="tar2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; by stating, "I would have liked them to have been made in Britain, but they weren't... They're massive, chunky and showy. No self-respecting Greek or Roman would have worn anything as gaudy".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

It was determined that the hoard was not associated with [[grave goods]], and was not part of a hoard associated with a settlement or religious location. It may, instead, have been a personal collection or [[votive offering]].&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; Hills further conjectured that "[t]hey were a very expensive gift, a major diplomatic gift",&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; and that in doing so the Romans were "winning friends and influencing them", ultimately "conquering them that way".&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; Ingratiating themselves with pro-Roman tribal kings, the Romans would have found it easier to quell internal unrest, thus making the recipients "puppet rulers beholden to the superpower of their age".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

Who the recipient, or indeed the giver, of the "gift" was is still unknown. However, it could have a link to the [[Gaul]] [[turncoat]], [[Commius]], who eventually became king of the [[Atrebates]] after fleeing a position as aide to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] which he took up in 56 BC.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

==Display==
The hoard is now housed in Room 50&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; of the British Museum in London and was part of the ''Buried Treasure: Finding Our Past'' exhibition (November 2003 — November 2005).&lt;ref&gt;The exhibition travelled from London to  the [[National Museum Cardiff]], the [[Manchester Museum]], the [[Hancock Museum]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and the [[Norwich Castle]] Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other items in the exhibition were the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], the [[Lewis chessmen]], and the [[Ringlemere Cup]].&lt;ref name="buried"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/museum_in_london/london_exhibition_archive/archive_buried_treasure.aspx|title=Buried Treasure: Finding Our Past|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, [[BBC Two]] screened a documentary on the discovery of the hoard.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;
