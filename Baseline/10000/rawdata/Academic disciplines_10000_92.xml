Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed as pertaining to this date. A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or [[spiritual transformation]], and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt; Others suggested that the date marked the [[End time|end of the world]] or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], an interaction between [[Earth]] and the [[Sagittarius A*|black hole at the center of the galaxy]],&lt;ref name="NASA1" /&gt; or [[Nibiru cataclysm|Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru]].

Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of concomitant cataclysmic events as they arose. Professional [[Mayanist]] scholars stated that no extant [[Maya codices|classic Maya accounts]] forecast impending doom, and that the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented [[Maya civilization#History|Maya history]] and culture,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster" /&gt; while astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref name="Brown 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=SI do not ♥ pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.&lt;ref name="NASA2" /&gt;

== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],&lt;ref name="delara2006" /&gt; it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Population structure of the classic period Maya" /&gt; The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt; meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|European conquest]].

Unlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}&lt;ref name="The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0" /&gt;

=== Apocalypse ===
[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]

There is a strong tradition of "world ages" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429–430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's "zero date"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}&lt;ref name=yucalandia/&gt; This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya."&lt;ref name="makemson1957" /&gt; In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that "there is a suggestion&amp;nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b'ak'tun]. Thus&amp;nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion."{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}

=== Objections ===
Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="carrasco1990" /&gt; In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; it did not mark the end of the calendar.&lt;ref name="milbrath1999" /&gt; "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya "did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," and, "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."&lt;ref name="Milbrath" /&gt; "There will be another cycle," said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this."&lt;ref name="The Sky Is Not Falling" /&gt; Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xultún]], one archaeologist said "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&amp;nbsp;– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset."&lt;ref name="NG120510" /&gt;

Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b'ak'tun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Indígenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle "supposes changes in human consciousness". Martín Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuraduría de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.&lt;ref name="prensalibre" /&gt;

=== Prior associations ===
The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profecías]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the "Maia" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hoopes 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of "most distant" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst Förstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b'ak'tun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann 1906: 264&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],&lt;ref&gt;Morley 1915: 32&lt;/ref&gt; who directly paraphrased Förstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, "Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&amp;nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Maya references to b'ak'tun 13 ==
It is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b'ak'tun.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.&lt;ref name="Houston1996" /&gt; Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b'ak'tun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.

=== Tortuguero ===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ajaw. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

&lt;div style="width: 500px"&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
: ''tzuhtzjo:m uy-u:xlaju:n pik''
: ''chan ajaw u:x uni:w''
: ''uhto:m il[?]''
: ''ye'ni/ye:n bolon yokte'''
: ''ta chak joyaj''
{{col-2}}
: It will be completed the 13th ''b'ak'tun''.
: It is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K'ank'in''
: and it will happen a 'seeing'[?].
: It is the display of ''B'olon-Yokte'''
: in a great "investiture".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}
{{col-end}}
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of B'olon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]

Very little is known about the god B'olon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.&lt;ref name="eberl2005" /&gt; He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.&lt;ref name="hieroglyphic" /&gt;

Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36–37}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.&lt;ref name="What Will Not Happen in 2012" /&gt;

=== La Corona ===
In April–May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.&lt;ref name="Stuart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13 ===
Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&amp;nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&amp;nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&amp;nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93–95}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}

Another example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b'ak'tun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent "the starting point of a huge odometer of time", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81–82, 430–431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;×13×360 days,&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt; or roughly 2.687×10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Maya Creation Myths and Cosmography|author=Wagner, Elizabeth|editor=Grube, Nikolai|title=Maya: Divine Kings of the Rainforest|page=283|year=2000|publisher=Konemann|isbn=978-3-8290-4150-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=49}}

In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in [[Xultún]], Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b'ak'tuns.&lt;ref name="NG120510"&gt;{{cite web | last = Vance | first = Eric | title = Unprecedented Maya Mural Found, Contradicts 2012 "Doomsday" Myth |work=National Geographic |date=10 May 2012 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/05/120510-maya-2012-doomsday-calendar-end-of-world-science/ |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saturno et al. 11 May 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 11 May 2012 | volume = 336 | issue = 6082 | pages = 714–717 | doi = 10.1126/science.1221444 | title = Ancient Maya Astronomical Tables from Xultun, Guatemala |author1=William A.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}

=== Origins ===
In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global "transformation of consciousness". In ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],&lt;ref name="particular" /&gt; while both [[José Argüelles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')&lt;ref name="elles1975" /&gt; and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mckenna1993" /&gt; discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day.

In 1983, with the publication of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,''{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.&lt;ref name="Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elles1987" /&gt; He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a "galactic synchronization beam" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in "total synchronization" and "galactic entrainment" of individuals "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17–27}}

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].&lt;ref name="Pinchbeck 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The End of the World As They Know It" /&gt; Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&amp;nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic".&lt;ref name="anasatas" /&gt;

=== Galactic alignment ===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].&lt;ref name="Hoopes2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoopes2012" /&gt; Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a "galactic alignment".

==== Precession ====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.&lt;ref name="prec" /&gt; In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115–127}}

Similarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center" /&gt; Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.&lt;ref name="What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?" /&gt; In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;

==== Mysticism ====
[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]

Mystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975). 

Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or "Black Road".&lt;ref name="Xibalba or Xibalbe" /&gt; John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2012" /&gt; Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.&lt;ref name="The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness" /&gt; New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.&lt;ref name="pinchbeck2006" /&gt; Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].&lt;ref name="jenkins1998" /&gt; Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}

==== Criticism ====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.&lt;ref name="scare" /&gt; Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.&lt;ref name="jenk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The True Alignment Zone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meeus1997" /&gt;

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,&lt;ref name="grofe2011" /&gt; Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,&lt;ref name="jenkins2009" /&gt; have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt; There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices,{{refn|{{harvnb|Aveni|2009|pp=54–55}}, citing {{harvnb|Aveni|Hartung|2000}}.}} but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists.&lt;ref name="van" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aimers, J. J., and Rice, P. M. 2006 79–96" /&gt; There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=57}}

=== Timewave zero and the ''I Ching'' ===
{{Main|Terence McKenna#Novelty theory and Timewave Zero}}
[[File:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the "Timewave Zero" software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt; [[Terence McKenna]] claimed that the universe has a [[teleological]] [[attractor]] at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].&lt;ref name="TMobAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt; The [[scientific community]] considers novelty theory to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=A. |year=2009 |title=2012: Science Or Superstition (the Definitive Guide to the Doomsday Phenomenon) |publisher=The Disinformation Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-rVUCO4YyYC&amp;pg=PA261|isbn=978-1-934708-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=normark&gt;{{cite web |title=2012: Prophet of nonsense #8: Terence McKenna – Novelty theory and timewave zero |last=Normark |first=Johan |url=http://haecceities.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/2012-prophet-of-nonsense-8-terence-mckenna%E2%80%93-novelty-theory-and-timewave-zero/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as "timewave zero" or the "timewave". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'', an ancient Chinese book on [[divination]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012.&lt;ref name="Dynamics of Hyperspace" /&gt; When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;

The 1975 first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date{{ref label|E|Note e|e}} of 21 December 2012 throughout.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitesides2012" /&gt;

Novelty theory has been criticized for "rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community", depending "solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic", and encompassing "no suitable indication of truth", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Smith II D.

The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of [[human civilization]], became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the [[Internet]], particularly on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; [[The Discovery Channel]] was criticized for its "quasi-documentaries" about the subject that "sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment".&lt;ref name="PressSunBulletin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20121210/NEWS01/312110007/Cornell-Maya-expert-World-probably-won-t-end-Dec-21?odyssey=nav%7Chead|title=Cornell Maya expert: World probably won't end Dec. 21 |last=D.W.

=== Other alignments ===
Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), creating havoc on Earth.&lt;ref name="krupp" /&gt; Apart from the "galactic alignment" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it.&lt;ref name="starry" /&gt; Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 [[light year]]s from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System.&lt;ref name="Questions answered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What would happen if a supermassive black hole came close to the Earth?" /&gt; This reading of the alignment was included on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''Decoding the Past''. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as "45&amp;nbsp;minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".&lt;ref name="How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary" /&gt;

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; According to the [[Shiva Hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25&amp;nbsp;million years—it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.&lt;ref name="Perturbing the Oort Cloud" /&gt; However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.&lt;ref name="Galactic Plane" /&gt; Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.&lt;ref name="The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane" /&gt;

A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.&lt;ref name="Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers" /&gt; Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.&lt;ref name="Planetary Alignment" /&gt; [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above ≈300&amp;nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]], the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.&lt;ref name="Plait-alignment" /&gt;

=== Geomagnetic reversal ===
Another idea tied to 2012 involved a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[atomic bombs]].&lt;ref name="2012: No Killer Solar Flare" /&gt; This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] was weakening,&lt;ref name="Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core" /&gt; which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic poles]], and the arrival of the next [[solar maximum]], which was expected sometime around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storm Warning|publisher=NASA|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/10mar_stormwarning/|year=2006|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete,&lt;ref name="Merrill"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Merrill | first1 = Ronald T. | last2 = McElhinny | first2 = Michael W. | last3 = McFadden | first3 = Philip L. | title = The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]] | year = 1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not start on any particular date.&lt;ref name="Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Furthermore, the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of [[sunspots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Maximum: Three Solar Flares And A Coronal Mass Ejection As The Sun Reaches Peak Solar Activity|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/solar-maximum-three-solar-flares-coronal-mass-ejection-sun-reaches-peak-solar-activity-1442608|year=2013|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth.&lt;ref name="2012: No Geomagnetic Reversal" /&gt; Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications.&lt;ref name="goemag" /&gt; David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer [[Michio Kaku]], who claimed in an interview with [[Fox News]] that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt;

=== Planet X/Nibiru ===
{{main|Nibiru cataclysm}}

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet&amp;nbsp;X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt; The idea originated from claims of channeling [[grey aliens|alien beings]] and is widely ridiculed.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;{{sfn|Schilling|2008|p=111}} Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.&lt;ref name="morrison" /&gt;

=== Other catastrophes ===
[[File:Pleiades large.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pleiades]], a [[star cluster]] with supposed influence sometimes tied to the 2012 event|alt=The Pleiades star cluster]]

Author [[Graham Hancock]], in his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''{{sfn|Coe|1992|pp=275–276}} as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.&lt;ref name="hancock" /&gt; Filmmaker [[Roland Emmerich]] later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 [[disaster film]] ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''.&lt;ref name="chicagoscifi credits"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscifi.com/movies/0011/presskit_pages/credits.pdf | title = 2012 (2009)&amp;nbsp;– Credit List |accessdate=25 November 2009 |publisher=chicagoscifi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.&lt;ref name="'Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse" /&gt;

The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].&lt;ref name="morris2" /&gt; Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.&lt;ref name="Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?" /&gt;

Some media outlets tied the fact that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] would undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Connelly 19 January 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |title=Tatooine's twin suns&amp;nbsp;– coming to a planet near you just as soon as Betelgeuse explodes |last=Connelly |first=Claire |work=News.com.au |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922083805/http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247 |archivedate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Betelgeuse and 2012" /&gt; To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth.&lt;ref name="Is Betelgeuse about to blow?" /&gt; In December 2011, NASA's [[Francis Reddy]] issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.&lt;ref name="Reddy 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012: Fear No Supernova | publisher = NASA | last = Reddy | first = Francis | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-supernova.html | year = 2011 | accessdate = 23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claim involved [[alien invasion]]. In December 2010, an article, first published in [[examiner.com]] and later referenced in the English-language edition of ''[[Pravda]]''&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt; claimed, citing a Second [[Digitized Sky Survey]] photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; Astronomer and debunker [[Phil Plait]] noted that by using the [[small-angle formula]], one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.&lt;ref name="philp" /&gt; In January 2011, [[Seth Shostak]], chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.&lt;ref name="NO Spaceships Headed for Earth" /&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"—mystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean-Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army.&lt;ref name="For End of the World, a French Peak Holds Allure" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel 2010" /&gt; "We've seen a huge rise in visitors", Delord told ''[[The Independent]]'' in March 2012. "Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage à ovnis' [a garage for [[UFO]]s]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal."&lt;ref name=hippies /&gt; In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayan Doomsday: French Police Block Access to Survivors' Refuge Pic de Bugarach|author=Hanna Osborne|publisher=International Business Times|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|accessdate=13 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129090241/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/407669/20121122/mayan-prophecy-doomsday-pic-de-bugarach-aliens.htm|archivedate=29 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the "event".

== Cultural influence ==
The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event.

The [[UFO conspiracy]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'' cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the [[Mayan calendar]] "stopping" on this date.&lt;ref name="skepsis" /&gt; The [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]] aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005–2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2009), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).&lt;ref name="Armageddon series" /&gt; The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storms]], [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012.&lt;ref name="2012 Apocalypse" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] launched a show called ''[[Doomsday Preppers]]'', a documentary series about [[survivalism|survivalists]] preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic Doomsday Preppers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Doomsday Preppers | work = National Geographic | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/doomsday-preppers/ | accessdate = 6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of books were published on the topic.&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; The bestselling book of 2009,&lt;ref name="Best-Selling Books of 2009" /&gt; [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Lost Symbol]]'', featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the [[Julian date]] for 21 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secrets of The Lost Symbol|author1=Dan Bernstein |author2=Arne de Kiuzer |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qgqfqUjF_38C&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=2456282.5+julian+date+%22lost+symbol%22|accessdate=19 December 2012|isbn=978-0-297-86060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema, the 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic.&lt;ref name="sony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Relax, the end isn't nigh" /&gt; Although the campaign was heavily criticized,&lt;ref name="foratv" /&gt; the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="2009 Worldwide Grosses" /&gt; An article in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building "survival arks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China fears end of the world is nigh|author=Malcolm Moore|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9729270/China-fears-end-of-the-world-is-nigh.html| accessdate=11 December 2012|location=London|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Sunny Kirsten Dunst is picture perfect at the Cannes photocall for her provocative new film Melancholia" /&gt; Announcing his company's purchase of the film, the head of [[Magnolia Pictures]] said in a press release, "As the 2012 apocalypse is upon us, it is time to prepare for a cinematic last supper".&lt;ref name="Magnolia Picks Up North American Rights to Lars von Trier's 'Melancholia'" /&gt;

The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, "[[A Certain Shade of Green]]" by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include "[[2012 (It Ain't the End)]]" (2010) performed by [[Jay Sean]] and "[[Till the World Ends]]" (2011) performed by [[Britney Spears]]. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet [[hoax]] related to South Korean singer [[Psy]] being one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's "[[Gangnam Style]]" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |title=Much ado about apocalypse |first=Chok |last=Suat Ling |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104174754/http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/much-ado-about-apocalypse-1.188870 |archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian composer [[A.

A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at [[Boston University]], questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Vanessa |title=Brands Capitalize on 'Impending Apocalypse' |publisher=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-19/brands-capitalizing-on-the-impending-apocalypse|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
{{Refbegin|30em}}
* {{note label|A|a|a}} The [[13 (number)|number 13]] plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}&lt;ref name="The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya" /&gt;
* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.&lt;ref name="joyce" /&gt;
* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than "0.0.0.0.0", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as "13.0.0.0.0"&lt;ref name=wagner/&gt;
* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&amp;nbsp;BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at 21 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Who's Who in the Maya World" /&gt; This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.&lt;ref name="Questions and comments" /&gt;
* {{note label|E|e|e}} Coe's initial date was "24 December 2011". He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,{{sfn|Coe|1980|p=151}} not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.{{refn|{{harvnb|Coe|1984}}. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book.}} The correlation of b'ak'tun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book ''The Ancient Maya'' {{harv|Morley|1983|p=603|loc=Table B2}}.

These three orders form a single [[clade]] within the [[Rosids]], which is a sister taxon to the other major nitrogen-fixing order, the [[Fabales]]. All actinorhizal species are trees or shrubs, except for the genus ''[[Datisca]]''.

Many are common plants in temperate regions like [[alder]], [[Myrica|bayberry]], [[Comptonia (plant)|sweetfern]], [[Dryas (plant)|Avens]], [[mountain misery]] and ''[[Coriaria]]''. Some ''[[Elaeagnus]]'' species and [[Sea-buckthorn]]s produce edible fruit. In tropical regions, ''[[Casuarina]]s'' are widely cultivated.

==Distribution and ecology==
[[File:Actinorhizal Plant Distribution.svg|thumb|right|The distribution of actinorhizal plants.]]
Actinorhizal plants are found on all continents except for [[Antarctica]]. Their ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules confers a selective advantage in poor soils. Most actinorhizal plants are therefore [[pioneer species]] that colonize young soils where available [[nitrogen]] is scarce like [[moraine]]s, volcanic flows or sand dunes.&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwintzer|Tjepkema|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being among the first species to colonize these disturbed environments, actinorhizal shrubs and trees play a critical role, enriching the soil and enabling the establishment of other species in an [[ecological succession]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"/&gt; Actinorhizal plants like alders are also common in the [[riparian forest]].&lt;ref name="Schwintzer 1990"/&gt;

Actinorhizal plants are the major contributors to nitrogen fixation in broad areas of the world, and are particularly important in [[temperate forest]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Wall|2000"/&gt; The nitrogen fixation rate measured for some [[alder]] species is as high as 300&amp;nbsp;kg of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ha/year, close to the highest rate reported in [[legumes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zavitovski|Newton|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary origin==

No fossil records are available concerning nodules, but fossil pollen of plants similar to modern actinorhizal species has been found in sediments deposited 87 million years ago. The origin of the symbiotic association remains uncertain. The ability to associate with ''Frankia'' is a [[polyphyletic]] character and has probably evolved independently in different [[clade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benson|Clawson|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, actinorhizal plants and Legumes, the two major nitrogen-fixing groups of plants share a relatively close ancestor, as they are all part of a [[clade]] within the [[rosid]]s which is often called the ''nitrogen-fixing clade''. This ancestor may have developed a "predisposition" to enter into symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria and this led to the independent acquisition of symbiotic abilities by ancestors of the actinorhizal and Legume species. The genetic program used to establish the symbiosis has probably recruited elements of the arbuscular [[mycorrhiza]]l symbioses, a much older and widely distributed symbiotic association between plants and fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kistner|Parniske|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The symbiotic nodules==

As in legumes, [[root nodule|nodulation]] is favored by nitrogen deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending on the plant species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in  casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a [[root hair]] and is followed by the formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Laplaze|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in ''Discaria'' species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on ''Frankia'' becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the pericycle and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called [[actinorhizae]]. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by ''Frankia'' filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.

Little information is available concerning the mechanisms leading to nodulation. No equivalent of the rhizobial [[Nod factor]]s have been found, but several genes known to participate in the formation and functioning of Legume nodules (coding for heamoglobin and other nodulins)  are also found in actinorhizal plants where they are supposed to play similar roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vessey|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of genetic tools in ''Frankia'' and in actinorhizal species was the main factor explaining such a poor understating of this symbiosis,  but  the recent sequencing of 3 ''Frankia'' genomes &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Normand|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of [[RNAi]] and [[genomic]] tools in actinorhizal species &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hocher|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gherbi|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; should help to a far better understanding in the following years.

'''Antioch University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[non-profit]] [[university system]] in the United States with five campuses located in four states, as well as an online campus and the Graduate School of Leadership and Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/gslc/|title=Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All campuses of the university are regionally accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antioch.edu/our-accreditation/ Antioch University - Our Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt; Campuses are located in [[Los Angeles, California]]; [[Santa Barbara, California]]; [[Keene, New Hampshire]]; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]; and [[Seattle, Washington]]. Antioch University uses the system of [[narrative evaluation]] as a substitute to the conventional grading system of A-F letter grades. Additionally, Antioch University houses two institution-wide programs, the PhD in Leadership and Change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antioch.edu/gslc/degrees-programs/business-management-leadership/phd-leadership-change/|title=PhD in Leadership &amp; Change {{!}} Antioch University {{!}} Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antioch Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/auonline/|title=Antioch University Online {{!}} A University in Pursuit of a Better World|website=www.antioch.edu/auonline|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it originated from the historic college, Antioch University should not be confused with [[Antioch College]] in Yellow Springs, Ohio, which gained its independence from the University in 2009, and has since had no affiliation with the University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/07/01/antioch Jaschik, Scott (July 1, 2009) "A Deal to Revive Antioch" Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Antioch University serves more than 4,000 adult students around the world and across the country, online and from its five campuses in four states. The [[Los Angeles]] campus offers an MFA in creative writing; the [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] campus offers an MA in education with an emphasis in social justice; the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] campus offers a program in conflict analysis; the [[Seattle]] campus offers integrative drama and art therapy programs; and the online campus offers a BA in Human Services Administration as well as a BA in [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] with various concentrations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
Antioch University grew out of Antioch College.  Antioch College was founded in 1852 as the result of American educator [[Horace Mann]]'s dream to establish a college comparable to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] but with some notable differences. Antioch College was to be completely nonsectarian and [[co-educational]], and with a curriculum that would include the traditional treatment of the classics, but would emphasize science and the scientific method, history, and modern literature. Students would not compete for grades but would be encouraged to pursue issues of interest to them, read what they considered worthwhile and present papers on topics of their own choosing. Horace Mann became the first president in 1853.

Antioch College began a period of rapid expansion in 1964 with the acquisition of the Putney School of Education in Vermont.  That campus has evolved and moved several times to become Antioch University New England now situated in Keene, NH. By 1972, another 23 centers had been opened, and the College By-Laws were revised to define Antioch as a "network", not a college. Even as centers began to close, new centers continued to open; 38 centers would be opened by the end of 1979, including the ABA-accredited Antioch School of Law located in Washington, D.C. In 1977, the Antioch College Board of Trustees voted to change its name to Antioch University, and in 1978, Antioch University Corporation replaced Antioch College Corporation as owner of all institutional assets, tangible and intangible.

In 1986, the University decided to close 32 of its units around the country, including the School of Law. The law school now operates as the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law. By 1989, the University consolidated to 6 campuses including 1) its original campus, Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio; 2) Antioch University New England in Keene New Hampshire; 3) Antioch University Los Angeles; 4) Antioch University Santa Barbara; 5) Antioch University Seattle; and 6) Antioch University McGregor, an adult, graduate degree program in Yellow Springs, Ohio, now known as Antioch University Midwest.

In 2008, citing financial exigency, Antioch University closed the Antioch College campus in Yellow Springs.  Antioch College alumni came together to found the Antioch College Continuation Corporation and purchased the College name and campus back from the University. The newly independent Antioch College reopened in 2011 and purchased its remaining assets back from the University in 2012.  Since then, Antioch University and Antioch College have operated as wholly separate, non-affiliated institutions, although the University continues to retain the transcripts of all College alumni who entered prior to the 2008 closure.

From its inception, racial and gender equality, independent study and independent thinking were integral parts of Antioch College. Six students were accepted for the first quarter: four men and two women who came to share the same college classrooms for the first time in the U.S. The notion of [[gender equality]] extended also to the faculty. Antioch College was the first U.S. college to designate a woman as full professor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/02/nation/na-hometown-antioch2|title=Antioch College alumni plan to save their school|author=P.J. Huffstutter | work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original faculty included seven men and two women. Then, in 1863, the college instituted the policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race.

In the early 1850s, [[Rebecca Pennell]] offered a course on teaching methods which was the first of its kind, while [[John Burns Weston]], class of 1857, established a long-standing precedent by being both student and faculty simultaneously. He taught Greek language and literature for 20 years and remained a lifelong student.

While Antioch College never diverged from the philosophy of Horace Mann, the final form of an Antioch education traced its roots from the election of [[Arthur Ernest Morgan|Arthur Morgan]] as President of the college in 1920. Morgan, like Mann, believed in the development of the individual as a whole. Having seen the difficulty encountered by [[ivory-tower]] academicians attempting to participate in the business world, he resolved to change the cloistered educational experience by providing students with work experience in their field. He wrote “The Plan for the New Antioch” which was his vision for the future of the school. This was the beginning of Antioch's unique program of work and study, what Morgan termed, “industrial education.”

Morgan initiated the practice of [[student government]]. He also changed the nature of the admissions procedure. Rather than relying on [[entrance examination]]s, Morgan opted for more personal information on prospective students. In addition, senior exams were graded "honors" or "pass", and students who failed could retake the exam. Morgan remained at Antioch until 1933, when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] requested that he assume directorship of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Project.

==College expansion and university founding==
In 1964, Antioch College took over the Putney School of Education in [[Vermont]] (now [[Antioch University New England]] in Keene, New Hampshire). During the next decade, other adult learning programs were instituted: among them, Antioch Seattle; Antioch Southern California with campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara; and the Antioch Education Abroad Program (with centers in [[London]], Germany and other locations).

In 1978, Antioch College became a university system. From 1978 to 1994 the President of Antioch College also served as the Chancellor of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;http://antiochiana.edu/PresidentsList.htm{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Antioch University's Ph.D. in Leadership and Change Program was founded. The program is designed to educate professionals from a wide range of fields to understand and lead organizational change. The program's low-residency model offers students interdisciplinary study with a practitioner focus that teaches and encourages applied research.

In 2009 Antioch College became entirely independent of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ysnews.com/news/2009/09/antioch-college-alive-and-independent-again|title=Antioch College alive and independent again|author=Diane Chiddister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

===Antioch University New England===
Founded in 1964, [[Antioch University New England]] is located in Keene, New Hampshire, a small city with a strong tradition of civic, cultural, and environmental activism, in the heart of the state's [[Monadnock Region]]. It is Antioch University's largest branch, with over 1,200 graduate-level students.  Master's degrees are awarded in areas of [[Mental Health Counselor|Clinical Mental Health Counseling]] (with specializations in Addictions Counseling &amp; Dance/Movement Therapy), [[Family Therapy|Marriage and Family Therapy]], [[Environmental Studies]], Organization &amp; Management ("Green MBA"), and Education.  Doctoral degrees are awarded in the areas of [[Clinical Psychology]] ([[Psy.D]]), Marriage and Family Therapy (Ph. D), and Environmental Studies (Ph. D).  Antioch-New England is one of only three schools in the United States to offer [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] teacher training and has gained critical acclaim for its annually published environmental literary journal ''[[Whole Terrain]]''.

===Antioch University Los Angeles===
{{advert|date=August 2018}}
Established in 1972 and with more than 8,000 alumni, [[Antioch University Los Angeles]] serves the diverse communities of the greater [[Los Angeles]] area. The core values of [[social justice]], service to community, and [[lifelong learning]] comprise the heart of the BA degree completion program and master's degree programs in organizational management, education and teacher credentialing, psychology, and creative writing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.antioch.edu/los-angeles&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships with community organizations provide students with unique experiential learning opportunities. The low-residency MFA in creative writing was named among the top five programs in the nation by ''[[The Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/08/the-best-of-the-best/6049/&lt;/ref&gt; and the graduate clinical psychology specialization in [[LGBT]] studies is the first of its kind.  The MA in [[urban sustainability]] was developed in response to the growing awareness of the interconnections among environmental, economic, and social issues. The interdisciplinary program prepares well-trained, well-informed scholars, community leaders, and activists to advocate for sustainable urban policy and social change in the face of the growing global environmental crisis. The current student body consists of approximately 1000 learners, and supports a collection of faculty who are arguably in the top echelon of their fields.

==Antioch College separation and reorganization==
In June 2007, the Antioch University Board of Trustees announced that they would suspend operations of [[Antioch College]] the following year and that they intended to re-open the college in four years. It was their belief that four years would give the university the necessary time to develop and execute a plan for re-building Antioch College in a manner that would both honor its legacy and secure its future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618232943/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |archive-date=2010-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable controversy among members of the Antioch College alumni group and the administration, suggesting that the university should not close the college. During this time – 2007-2009 – two different organizations (the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] [NCA] and the [[American Association of University Professors]] [AAUP]) conducted audits and investigations into the university's actions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916125129/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |archive-date=2009-09-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a response from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antioch.edu/AAUP.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917070006/http://antioch.edu/AAUP.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a group of Antioch College alumni, headed by the Antioch College Alumni Board, expressed interest in purchasing the college from the university and re-opening the college as an independent institution. The alumni group formed the Antioch College Continuation Corporation as the vehicle for negotiating and owning the college. After two years of negotiations, the parties agreed to terms and, on September 4, 2009, the parties conducted a signing ceremony that ratified their agreement. [[Mark Roosevelt]], a well-known senior education administrator, previously the superintendent of [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]], was appointed President. A reopened and separate Antioch College welcomed its first class of students in the fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/reopening-antioch-college-would-set-historic-precedent-1074650.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">The '''''ars dictaminis''''' was the medieval description of the art of prose composition, and more specifically of the writing of letters (''dictamen''). It is closely linked to the '''''ars dictandi''''', covering the composition of documents other than letters. The standing assumption was that these writings would be composed in [[Latin]], and according to well worked-out models. This made the arts of composition a subfield of [[rhetoric]].

In business letters, it called for some form of address (e.g., “Worshipful master”); salutation (“I greet you well”); notification (“May it please you to know”); exposition (“the wool was shipped”); disposition (“and I want my money”); and valediction (“May God keep you well, at least until my bill is paid”). Clerks and scribes wrote the letters based on those rules.

Important figures in the development of Latin letter writing and document composition include [[Albericus Cassinensis]], his critic Adalbert of Samaria (''Praecepta Dictaminum'', c. 1120), and [[Lawrence of Aquilegia]].

'''Chemical safety assessment''' ('''CSA''') "has to be performed by registrants for substances manufactured and imported in quantities starting at 10 tonnes per year and by downstream users if their uses are not addressed by their supplier," according to REACH ([[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]]) legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/chemical_safety_en.htm|title=Chemical Safety Assessment and Report|accessdate=2010-01-08|publisher=guidance.echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSA includes the evaluation of all available relevant information in order to assess risks arising from the manufacture and/or use of a substance. The process needs to be documented adequately and the results have to be documented in a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR), which is to be submitted to the [[European Chemicals Agency]] as part of the respective registration dossier.
The purpose is to ensure that the risks related to the substance are controlled.

The [[chemical safety]] assessment of a substance comprises the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dguv.de/ifa/en/fac/reach/sbericht/index.jsp|title=Chemical safety report – chemical safety assessment|accessdate=2012-03-02|publisher=www.dguv.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229125021/http://www.dguv.de/ifa/en/fac/reach/sbericht/index.jsp|archivedate=2012-02-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chicana feminism''', also called '''Xicanisma''',&lt;ref&gt;IRL
From Chicano to Xicanx: A brief history of a political and cultural identity&lt;/ref&gt; is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women that identify as [[Chicano|Chicana]]. Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement, theory and praxis that helps women reclaim their existence between and among the [[Chicano Movement]] and [[Feminism in the United States|American feminist movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1997|isbn=9780415918015|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Emerging out of the identity movements of the 1960s, Chicana feminists created a distinctive trajectory and mapping of feminist political thought and practice that centered their unique experiences with gender, race, class and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;"The Research Context", by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since many feminist methodologies are similar in practice, Chicana feminists distinguished themselves from other feminists by centering their unique lived experiences with gender, race, class, sexuality and nationalism – offering critiques and responses to their exclusion from both the mainstream Chicano nationalist movement and the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist movement]]. One important way they were able to do this was through the inclusion of different varieties of the Spanish language, a vital component to the preservation of Chicano/a culture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurtado|first=Aída|title=Sitios y lenguas: Chicanas theorize feminisms|journal=Hypatia|volume=13|issue=2|pages=134–161|doi=10.2979/HYP.1998.13.2.134|issn=0887-5367|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminism maintains that throughout history, women have been oppressed, and sometimes even abused, in many different societies. In Latin America, just as in Europe, Asia and Africa, many women were, for centuries, treated by their fathers, brothers and husbands with discrimination. Women in Latin America, Mexico included, were seen as child-bearers, homemakers, and caregivers. These women had to watch their children, perform household chores, and cook for their husbands. Many men did not consider women to be capable of working outside the home, which is part of the reason why the term "weaker sex" was coined.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In Latin America, women at those times had to act according to some social standards. In many Latin American cities, for example, women were not seen with good eyes if they spoke to men they did not know. Meanwhile, [[prostitution]], for example, was legal in many Latin American areas, and men were not criticized, but rather seen as heroic, if they had several girlfriends, even if the man was married.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1848, with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the US: Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and part of Colorado and Wyoming.  Former citizens of Mexico living in those territories became US citizens.

During the twentieth century, Hispanic [[immigration]] to the United States began to slowly but steadily change American demographics. By 1940, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] was one of the cities with the largest group of Chicanos in the United States.

Euro-American women also had their own problems: they were also stereotyped as homemakers, caregivers, and child-bearers. Unlike women of minority races, however, white women largely evaded dealing with [[racism]], unless they or their husbands befriended people of Black or Hispanic background. Euro-American women combated this with the emergence of waves of feminism, the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] addressed suffrage while the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] discussed issues of sexuality, private vs. the public sphere, reproductive rights, and marital rape.

=== Origin ===
Chicana feminists challenged their prescribed role in ''la familia'', and demanded to have the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] experiences that they faced recognized. Chicanas identify as being consciously aware, self-determined, proud of their roots, heritage, and experience while prioritizing [[La Raza]]. With the emergence of the Chicano Movement, the structure of Chicano families saw dramatic changes. Specifically, women began to question the role that they were assigned within the family and where their place was within the Chicano national struggle.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238"&gt;Garcia, A. M. (June 1, 1989). The Development of Chicana Feminist Discourse, 1970-1980. Gender and Society, 3, 2, 217-238.&lt;/ref&gt; In the seminal text, La Chicana by Elizabeth Martinez, Martinez writes: “She [La Chicana]  is oppressed by the forces of racism, [[imperialism]], and sexism. This can be said of all non-white women in the United States. Her oppression by the forces of racism and imperialism is similar to that endured by our men. Oppression by sexism, however, is hers alone.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=32–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women  also sought out to battle the internalized struggles of self-hatred rooted in the colonization of their people. This included breaking the mujer buena/mujer mala myth, in which the domestic Spanish Woman is viewed as good and the Indigenous Woman that is a part of the community is viewed as bad. Chicana feminist thought emerged as a response to patriarchy, racism, classism, and colonialism as well as a response to all the ways that these legacies of oppression have become internalized.&lt;ref&gt;'''''Review of Part I: Implications for Feminist Theorizing''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What are the issues happening in Chicana feminism now and then?'''

Chicana feminism have many different movements within the culture and ethnicities, according to Garcia (1989) the Chicana feminist movement was created to adhere to the specific issues which have had on Chicana women of colour which has originated from the Chicano movement because women desired to be treated equally and have the acceptance and motivation to what the Chicanos were doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=A. M|date=1989|title=The development of Chicana feminist discourse|url=|journal=Gender and Society|volume=1|pages=217–238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicana feminist movement has certainly influenced many Chicana women to be more active and to defend their rights not just as single women but women in solidarity who come together forming a society with equal contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=A.N|date=1997|title=Garcia, Chicana feminist thought: the basic historical writings|url=|journal=Chicana feminism|volume=1|pages=52–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminist Garcia (1989) has noted that awareness is only the start such awareness becomes the catalyst for change which is what Chicana feminism is about Chicana feminism is also about creating intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzales|first=S|date=1980|title=Toward a feminist pedagogy|url=|journal=A Journal of Women Studies|volume=5|pages=48–51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political organization (1940s – 1970s)  ===
Beginning in the 1940s, Mexican-Americans led a civil rights movement with a goal of achieving Mexican-American empowerment. By the 1960s, the [[Chicano Movement]], also known as ''El Movimiento'', became a prominent campaign in the lives of many Mexican-American workers and youth.&lt;ref&gt;Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, The [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW) organization was founded by [[Cesar Chavez|César Chávez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = UFW Chronology|url =http://ufw.org/research/history/ufw-chronology/|publisher=United Farm Workers|accessdate = 2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dolores Huerta]], and [[Philip Vera Cruz]].

Between the late 1960s through the 1970s, The Chicano Student Movement began in which students fought and organized for better quality education.&lt;ref name="What is the Chicana Movement"&gt;{{cite web|title = What is the Chicana Movement?|url = http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|website = umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts of organizing the Chicana Feminist Movement began in the later part of the 1960s. During the Chicano Movement,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, O. C. (2002, Fall). [http://postcolonialstudies.emory.edu/chicanafeminism/ Chicana Feminism]. Retrieved May 11, 2014, from Emory University website.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicana women formed committees within Chicano organizations. Similar to the organization of other groups in the Women's Movement, the Chicana feminists organized consciousness-raising groups and held conferences specific to the issues that Chicana women faced.&lt;ref name="segura69-92"&gt;Segura, D. A., and Pesquera, B. M. (January 1, 1992). Beyond Indifference and Antipathy: The Chicana Movement and Chicana Feminist Discourse. Aztlan: a Journal of Chicano Studies, 19, 2, 69-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although community organizers were working toward empowering the Mexican-American community, the narrative of the Chicano Movement largely ignored the women that were involved with organizing during this time of civil disobedience.

Chicana Feminism serves to highlight a much greater movement than generally perceived; a variety of minority groups are given a platform to confront their oppressors whether that be racism, homophobia, and multiple other forms of social injustice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects05/cf/|title=Chicana Feminism|website=www.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana liberation unshackles individuals, as well as the broader group as a whole, allowing them to live lives as they desire – commanding cultural respect and equality.&lt;ref&gt;Blea, Irene I. 1992. La Chicana and the Intersection of Race, Class, and Gender. New York , NY : Praeger Publishers. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicana feminists collectively realized the importance of connecting the issues of gender with need for improvement with respect to other civil liberties such as socioeconomic background, heritage, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Benita. 2004. Separate Roads to Feminism. New York , NY : Cambridge University Press. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chicanas in the Brown Berets ====
The [[Brown Berets]] were a youth group that took on a more militant approach to organizing for the Mexican-American community formed in California in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="kcet.org"&gt;{{cite web|title = ¡La Lucha Continua! Gloria Arellanes and Women in the Chicano Movement|url = http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/east-of-east/gloria-arellanes-and-women-in-the-chicano-movement.html|website = KCET|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chicana feminist organization ====
The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the Chicano Movement and eventually, [[MEChA]]. At the conference women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement|url=http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|publisher=The University of Michigan|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first [[Conferencia de Mujeres por la Raza|National Chicana Conference]] held in Houston, Texas in May 1971, over 600 women organized to discuss issues surrounding regarding equal access to education, reproductive justice, formation of childcare centers, and more (Smith, 2002).  While the event was the first major gathering of its kind, the conference itself was fraught with discord as Chicanas from geographically and ideologically divergent positions sparred over the role of feminism within the Chicano movement. These conflicts led to a walkout on the final day of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=¡Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=1477312668|location=Austin, TX|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary chicanas during this time period while critiquing the inability of the mainstream Chicano nationalist movements to address sexism and misogyny, simultaneously renounced the mainstream Second Wave feminist movement for its inability to include racism and classism in their politics. Chicanas during this time felt excluded from mainstream feminist movements because they had different needs, concerns and demands. Through persistent objections to their exclusions women have gone from being called Chicano women to Chicanas to introducing the adoption of a/o or o/a as a way of acknowledging both genders when discussing the community. Chicanas demanded free day-care centers and a reform of the welfare system, they sought to fight against all three structures of oppression they faced, including sexism, but also prioritizing racism and imperialism.

One of the First Chicana organizations was the [[Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] (CFMN), founded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yo Soy Chicana: A Chicana Feminist Movement|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/departures/yo-soy-chicana-a-chicana-feminist-movement|publisher=KCET|accessdate=24 March 2018|language=en|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for the CFMN originated during the National Chicano Issues Conference when a group of attending Chicanas noticed that their concerns were not adequately addressed at the Chicano conference. The women met outside of the conference and drafted a framework for the CFMN that established them as active and knowledgeable community leaders of a people's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Leon, K. (2013).

=== Female archetypes ===
Central to much of Chicana feminism is a reclaiming of the female archetypes [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]], [[La Llorona]], and [[La Malinche]].&lt;ref&gt;'''''The Research Context''''', by Aída Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by Aída Hurtado&lt;/ref&gt; These archetypes have prevented Chicanas from achieving sexual and bodily agency due to the ways they have been historically constructed as negative categories through the lenses of patriarchy and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Women in Early Mexico|last=Schroeder|first=Susan|last2=Wood|first2=Stephanie|last3=Haskett|first3=Robert|publisher=Norman : University of Oklahoma Press|year=1997|isbn=9780806129709|location=|pages=292–312|chapter=14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting the discourse from a traditional (patriarchal) representation of these archetypes to a de-colonial feminist understanding of them is a crucial element of contemporary Chicana feminism, and represents the starting point for a reclamation of Chicana female power, sexuality, and spirituality.

[[La Virgin de Guadalupe|La Virgen de Guadalupe]] and [[La Malinche]] have become symbolic means of suppressing Chicana women's sexuality through the patriarchal dichotomy of puta/virgin, the positive role model and the negative one, historically and continuously held up before Mexican women as icons and mirrors in which to examine their own self-image and define their self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gloria Anzaldúa's canonical text addresses the subversive power of reclaiming indigenous spirituality to unlearn colonial and patriarchal constructions and restrictions on women, their sexuality, and understandings of motherhood. Anzaldúa writes, "I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; La Malinche is a victim of centuries of patriarchal myths that permeate the Mexican woman's consciousness, often without her awareness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Malintzin (also known as Doña Marina by the Spaniards or "La Malinche" post-Mexican independence from Spain) was born around 1505 to noble Indigenous parents in rural Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marina
MEXICAN NATIVE AMERICAN PRINCESS&lt;/ref&gt; Since Indigenous women were often used as pawns for political alliances at this time, she was betrayed by her parents and sold into slavery between the ages of 12–14, traded to Hernan Cortés as a concubine, and because of her intelligence and fluency in multiple languages, was promoted to his "wife" and diplomat. She served as Cortés's translator, playing a key role in the Spaniard's conquest of Tenochtitlan and, by extension, the conquest of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexican history : a primary source reader|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Jaffary|editor-first=Nora E.|location=|pages=72|chapter=12. The Nahua Interpreter Malintzin Translates for Hernan Cortés and Moteucçoma (1580)|quote=|editor-last2=Osowski|editor-first2=Edward W.|editor-last3=Porter|editor-first3=Susie S.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bore Cortés a son, Martín, who is considered to be the first mestizo and the beginning of the "Mexican" race.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, a scapegoat was needed to justify centuries of colonial rule. Because of Malintzin's relationship with Cortés and her role as translator and informant in Spain's conquest of Mexico, she was seen as a traitor to her race. By contrast, Chicana feminism calls for a different understanding. Since nationalism was a concept unknown to Indigenous people in the 16th century, Malintzin had no sense of herself as "Indian", making it impossible for her to show ethnic loyalty or  conscientiously act as a traitor. Malintzin was one of millions of women who were traded and sold in Mexico pre-colonization. With no way to escape a group of men, and inevitably rape, Malintzin showed loyalty to Cortés to ensure her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

La Malinche has become the representative of a female sexuality that is passive, "rape-able", and always guilty of betrayal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rather than a traitor or a "whore", Chicana feminism calls for an understanding of her as an agent within her limited means, resisting rape and torture (as was common among her peers) by becoming a partner and translator to Cortés. Placing the blame for Mexico's conquest on Malintzin creates a foundation for placing upon women the responsibility to be the moral compasses of society and blames them for their sexuality, which is counterintuitive. It is important to understand Malintzin as a victim not of Cortés, but of myth. Chicana feminism calls for an understanding in which she should be praised for the adaptive resistance she exhibited that ultimately led to her survival.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By challenging patriarchal and colonial representations, Chicana writers re-construct their relationship to the figure of La Malinche and these other powerful archetypes, and reclaim them in order to re-frame a spirituality and identity that is both decolonizing and empowering.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Cristina.

===Criticism===
One critique of Chicana feminism was that it was a separatist movement that would divide the Chicano Movement. Loyalist Chicanas felt that the creation of a separate Chicana feminist movement was a dangerous and divisive political tactic, influenced too heavily by the Anglo women's movement. Loyalists believed that racism was the most important issue Chicanos and Chicanas were facing. They felt that the sexual oppression Chicanas faced from Chicanos was the fault of the system rather than the men, and breaking down the racial oppression affecting both Chicanos and Chicanas would resolve the sexual inequality the women experienced.

Similarly, Chicana feminists have been blamed for tearing at the values of Chicano culture. The first reason for this is that loyalists believed Chicana feminists were anti-family, anti-culture, and anti-man, thus pitting them against the Chicano movement. Furthermore, feminism itself was viewed by many as individualistic and as something that was taking away from other issues, such as racism.&lt;ref name="garcia217-238" /&gt;

However, following the contributions of Chicana feminist writers, including [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]], Chicana feminism has gained the support of feminists of diverse backgrounds. The emergence of queer theory and intersectionality in feminist movements has challenged the misogyny of the Chicano movement and has broadened and strengthened the Chicana/o movement to be in solidarity with other people of color in the United States.

== Cultural identities and spirituality ==
The term "Chicano" originates from Aztec indigenous peoples who pronounced it "meshicano" in the native Nahuatl language. However, historically the Spaniards had no "sh" in their vocabulary and pronounced it "mexicano" (spelled mexicano), a pronunciation that has been carried into the present. Historically, the term Chicano has not always been positive and empowering. The term Chicano was for a long time used in a demeaning manner, and was associated with newly arrived Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century until it was later reclaimed by Chicana feminists with the emergence of the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Nationalist Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/20/chicana-feminism/|title=Postcolonial Studies {{!}} Chicana Feminism|website=scholarblogs.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many white Americans used the word Chicano to describe Mexican immigrants as poor, unskilled, and ignorant people. Later, the term was used to distinguish first-generation, American-born Mexican-Americans from the older generations of Mexican immigrants; two groups that were often separated by a language barrier. Most first-generation American Chicanos adopted English as their first language, with some Chicanos blending both English and Spanish to create a hybrid dialect or slang argot called [[Caló (Chicano)|caló]] (also called pachuco). The U.S. media, not being able to fully understand these emerging American identities, stigmatized Chicanos and Mexican in propagating the notion that came from a country of corruption, and that they were criminals, thieves, and immoral people.

The definitions of Chicana/o in the United States are contested. Because many Chicana/os are born to parents who are immigrants from Mexico, one definition of Chicana/o is rooted in the idea that this identity straddles two different worlds. The first world is that of the country of origin from which their families descended from, such as Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador. Many Chicanos today, for example, continue to practice the religion, language, and culture of their respective family's countries of origin. Another definition of Chicano is rooted in the identity being completely embedded within the "American" culture. Many Chicana/os have assimilated into "American" culture and use English as their primary language. Despite these two distinctions in definition, some might argue that Chicanos are stigmatized by both cultures because they don't fit into either one completely. For this reason, one view of Chicano identity is that a new culture is created in order to resist oppression and navigate both worlds.

Contemporary renditions of the word Chicano have been to replace the “C-H” beginning with the letter X, making the word Xicano. This is significant because it recenters the Nahua language and pronunciation of the sound “ch”, tying the Xicana/o to indigenous roots and decentering Eurocentric ties to identity.

Chicana feminism has also created another linguistic change, there is another “x” at the end of Xicanx, and it is being used to be inclusive of others gender identities and move away from a colonial imposed binary and gendered language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodríguez|first=Richard T|date=October 2017|title=X marks the spot|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.nau.edu/10.1177/0921374017727880|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume= 29| issue = 3, 2017|pages=203–212|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been resistance to this change in language and there is discussions of whether or not this is useful from academics and community members, Feminists and queer folk are fighting for this change in language be inclusive as well as creating a new formation of history. The usage of Xicanx is powerful due to trying to move back to indigenous roots as well as trying to create more space for Queer folk who have been marginalized by previous Chicano/a movements.  

=== Duality and "The New Mestiza" ===
The concept of "The New Mestiza" comes from feminist author, Gloria Anzaldúa. In her book, ''Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza'', she writes: "In a constant state of mental nepantilism, an Aztec word meaning torn between ways, la mestiza is a product of the transfer of the cultural and spiritual values of one group to another. Being tricultural, monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, speaking a patois, and in a state of perpetual transition, the mestiza faces the dilemma of the mixed breed: which collectivity does the daughter of a dark-skinned mother listen to? [...] Within us and within la Cultura Chicana, commonly held beliefs of the white culture attack commonly held beliefs of the Mexican culture, and both attack commonly held beliefs of the indigenous culture. Subconsciously, we see an attack on ourselves and our beliefs as a treat and we attempt to block with a counterstance."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|last=Anzaldúa|first=Gloria|publisher=|year=1987|isbn=9781879960749|location=|pages=40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anzaldua presents a mode of being for Chicanas, that honors their unique standpoint and lived experience. This theory of embodiment offers a mode of being for Chicanas who are constantly negotiating hybridity and cultural collision, and the ways that inform the way they are continuously making new knowledge and understandings of self, often time in relation to intersecting and various forms of oppression. This theory discloses how a counter-stance cannot be a way of life because it depends on hegemonic constructions of domination, in terms of race, nationality, and culture. A counter-stance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked in mortal combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to a common denominator of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anzaldua|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlans/La frontera|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-12-1|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being solely reactionary means nothing is being created, revived or renewed in place of the dominant culture and that the dominant culture must remain dominant for counterstance to exist. For Anzaldua and this theory of embodiment, there must be space to create something new. The “new mestiza” was a canonical text that redefined what it meant to be Chicana. In this theory, being Chicana entails hybridity, contradictions, tolerance for ambiguity and plurality, nothing is rejected or excluded from histories and legacies of oppression. Further, this theory of embodiment calls for synthesizing all aspects of identity and creating new meanings, not simply balancing or coming together of different aspects of identity.

=== Mujerista ===
Mujerista was largely influenced by the African American women's "Womanist" approach proposed by Alice Walker. Mujerista was defined by Ada María Isasi-Díaz in 1996. This Latina feminist identity draws from the main ideas of womanism by combating inequality and oppression through participation in social justice movements within the Latina/o community.&lt;ref&gt;Tijerina-Revilla, A. (2009). Are all raza womyn queer? an exploration of sexual identity in a Chicana/Latina student organization. NWSA Journal, 21(3), 46-62.

New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to redefine the Latina/o identity.

=== Nepantla spirituality ===
[[Nepantla]] is a [[Nahuatl|Nahua]] word which translates to "in the middle of it" or "middle". Nepantla can be described as a concept or spirituality in which multiple realities are experienced at the same time (Duality). As a Chicana, understanding and having indigenous ancestral knowledge of spirituality plays an instrumental role in the path to healing, decolonization, cultural appreciation, self-understanding, and self-love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nepantla Spirituality: My Path to the Source(s) of Healing|last = Medina|first = Lara|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |page = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is often associated with author Chicana feminist Gloria Anzaldúa, who coined the term, "Nepantlera". "Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20IV%20Special/AnaLouiseKeating-FM.pdf|title = From Borderlands and New Mestizas to Nepantlas and Nepantleras Anzaldúan Theories for Social Change|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Keating|first = AnaLouise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepantla is a mode of being for the Chicana and informs the way she experiences the world and various systems of oppression.

=== Body Politics ===
Suzanne Bost discuss in ''Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature,'' about how body politics has shifted in the way it used to be looked at by Chicana feminism. It has moved beyond just looking at identity politics, it now looks at how “[...]the intersections between particular bodies, cultural contexts, and political needs”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature|last=Bost|first=Suzanne|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780823230846|location=|pages=193–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now looking beyond just looking at race, but incorporating intersectionality and how mobility, accessibility, mental and physical abilities, caregivers and their roles in lives, work with the body of Chicana's. Examples of Frida Kahlo and her abilities are discussed, as well as Gloria Anzaldua’s diabetes, to illustrated how abilities must be discussed when talking about identities. “Since there is no single or constant locus of identification, our analyses must adapt to different cultural frameworks, shifting feelings, and matter that is fluid.[...] our thinking about bodies, identities, and politics must keep moving.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chicana feminism needs to move beyond just looking at singular aspects of identities, but using all of them and contextualizing it’s effects on what is going on in time. Identifying as Chicana/o/x means to be political and the body that you inhabit will be politicized as well, to understand how it is being politicized along with your identities is to look at how it is done. Bost uses examples of contemporary Chicana artists and literature to illustrate this, Chicana feminism hasn’t ended it is just manifesting in different ways now.

=== Queer Interventions ===
Chicana feminist theory evolved as a theory of embodiment and a theory of flesh due to the canonical works of Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, both of whom identify as queer. Queer interventions in Chicana feminist thought called for an inclusion and honoring of the cultures’ joteria. In La conciencia de la mestiza, Gloria Anzaldua wrote, “the mestizo and the queer exist at this time and point on the evolutionary continuum for a purpose. We are blending that proves that all blood is intricately woven together and that we are spawned out of similar souls”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands La Frontera The New Mestiza, 4th Edition|last=Anzaldua|first=Gloria|publisher=aunt lute|year=1987|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=99–114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This intervention centers queerness as a focal part of liberation, a lived experience that cannot be ignored or excluded.

In Queer Aztlan: the Reformation of Chicano Tribe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Latino/a Thought : Culture, Politics, and Society|last=Vázquez|first=Francisco H|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2009|isbn=9780742563544|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherrie Moraga interrogates the construction of Chicano identity in relation with queerness. Offering a critique of the exclusion of people of color from mainstream gay movements as well as the homophobia rampant in Chicano nationalist movements. Moraga also discusses Aztlan, the metaphysical land and nation that belongs to Chicano ideologies, how this communidad and ideas need to move forward into making new forms of culture and community in order to survive. "Feminist critics are committed to the preservation of Chicano culture, but we know that our culture will not survive marital rape, battering, incest, drug and alcohol abuse, AIDS, and the marginalization of lesbian daughters and gay sons".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Moraga brings up criticisms of the Chicano movement and how it has been ignoring the issues within the movement itself, and that need to be addressed in order for the culture to be preserved rightfully.

In "Chicana Lesbians: Fear and Loathing in the Chicano Community," &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Carla Trujillo discusses how being a Chicana lesbian is incredibly difficult due to their culture's expectations on family and heterosexuality. Chicana lesbians who do become mothers break this expectation and become liberated from the social norms of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maythee|first1=Rojas|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Carla Trujillo edited and compiled, the anthology ''Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About|last=Trujillo|first=Carla|publisher=Third Woman Press|year=1991|isbn=9780943219066|location=|pages=186–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1991) was published by Third Woman Press. This anthology was controversial and banned because of its cover art which was a piece by Ester Hernandez titled ''La Ofrenda''. Since its original publication, the book has been re-published however, the cover art has changed. This anthology includes poetry and essays by Chicana women creating new understandings of self through their sexuality and race. This book brings visibility to Lesbian Chicana writers and artists whose work hasn't been as mainstream as other feminist artists. The contributions pages gives information about the writers and their histories, this also makes the book transparent about who is writing and bringing visibility to various different names.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''ECOFEMINISM IN CHICANA FEMINIST MOVEMENT'''

Chicana environmentalism combines the notion of ecofeminism and environmental justice whilst also providing a critique on the westernised view of ecofeminism and the toxicity caused by disregarding a certain race and the knowledge and history that they possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=C.M|date=2010|title=Chicana Environmentalisms: Deterritorialization as a Practice of Decolonization|url=|journal=The Ohio State University Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest terms, Ecofeminism can be defined as the significant connection between the oppression of women and nature, and the ways in which the two can coincide harmoniously.

After the term ‘ecofeminism’ was derived in the 70’s, there has been a significant increase in the amount of recognition women have received regarding creating positive alternatives for sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckingham|first=S|date=2004|title=Ecofeminism in the twenty-first century|url=|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=170|pages=146–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to environmental sustainability being predominately of a western, patriarchal mindset its important for women, specifically indigenous women, to reject these premises and follow more nurturing, traditional practices. Environmental conservation in Chicana culture can be interpreted in many different ways. Firstly, it can be seen as empowerment of ones’ culture, i.e. rejecting Eurocentric ideologies and believing in the “womanness” of curandera. Curandera in Mexican American culture is believed to have healing powers. Unpacking the notion of spirituality, the practise of curandera are often observed from the view point of the patriarchal spirituality as being the creation of witchcraft. Derived from European Christianity, curandera’s "earth-based healing and nature-based spirituality" was something to be feared by those who disregarded its importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng-Levine|first=J|date=1997|title=Neocolonialism, postcolonial ecology, and ecofeminism in the works of Native American, Chicano/a, and international writers|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco feminism is not just a birth right in Chicana history, but it is also strategic. Eco feminism allows for the empowerment of women and provides an authority position for women in society.  This power comes from an association of being nature goddesses and creates a sense of privilege that would otherwise cease to exist.

Some of the ways in which Chicana women take back their ecological and ontological power can be seen through the use of literature and art. For example, murals in the San Francisco Bay area. Juana Alicia’s La Llorona’s Sacred Waters (2004) and MaestraPeace (1994), a collaboration among Juana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edith Boone, Susan Kelk Cervantes, Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton, and Irene Pérez. La Llorana’s Sacred Waters murals exhibits many aspects of ecofeminism in the ways in which it draws to the devastation of colonialism and the ways in which it destroyed both the natural environment and the people that inhabited it. The mural also signifies the clear links between the relationship of women and nature. Chalchiuhtlicue is an indigenous goddess of the lakes and rivers, whilst also being associated with strong fertility. She served as having the power to both give life and take it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=H|date=2003|title=The Handbook of Mesoamerican Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs of Mexico and Central America|url=|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=14|pages=365–366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murals in the San Francisco bay area serve as a political statement of the duty of women’s social justice struggle and the constant resistance against colonialism and environmental depredation. In La llorana’s mural, Chalchiuhtlicue has a scroll rendering from her mouth with the message that she is speaking out against the horrid social conditions of her peoples.

Ecofeminism has always been a dominant part of the Chicana history, although very poorly documented. The diversity in the movement accounts for pushing towards an epistemological and ontological form of decolonization. The movement has been amplified through the reorienting of representation and by unpacking the way individuals absorbs the relationships between nature and spiritual relations.

=== Chicana art ===
Through different art mediums both past and contemporary, Chicana artists have continued to push the boundaries traditional Mexican-American values.

=== Chicana literature ===
{{See also|Xicana literature}}
Since the 1970s, many Chicana writers (such as [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Ana Castillo]]) have expressed their own definitions of Chicana feminism through their books. Moraga and Anzaldúa edited an anthology of writing by [[women of color]] titled ''[[This Bridge Called My Back]]'' (published by [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]]) in the early 1980s. Cherríe Moraga, along with [[Ana Castillo]] and [[Norma Alarcón]], adapted this anthology into a Spanish-language text titled ''Esta Puente, Mi Espalda: Voces de Mujeres Tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos''. Anzaldúa also published the [[bilingual]] (Spanish/English) anthology, ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]''. Mariana Roma-Carmona, Alma Gómez, and Cherríe Moraga published a collection of stories titled ''Cuentos: Stories by Latinas'', also published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.

The first Chicana Feminist Journal was published in 1973, called the Encuentro Feminil: The First Chicana Feminist Journal, which was published by Anna Nieto Gomez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Massacre of the Dreamers : Essays on Xicanisma. 20th Anniversary Updated Edition.|last=Castillo|first=Anna|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2014|isbn=9780826353580|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juanita Ramos and the [[Latina Lesbian History Project]] compiled an anthology including [[tatiana de la tierra]]'s first published poem, "De ambiente",&lt;ref&gt;De La Tierra, Tatiana. "Activist Latina Lesbian Publishing: esto no tiene nombre and conmoción." ''I am Aztldn: The Personal Essay in Chicano Studies, ed. Chon A. Noriega and Wendy Belcher (Los Angeles: UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center Press, 2004)'' 172.&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[oral history|oral histories]] of Latina lesbians called ''Compañeras: Latina Lesbians'' (1987).

Chicana lesbian-feminist poet Gloria Anzaldua points out that labeling a writer based on their [[social position]] allows for readers to understand the writers' location in society. However, while it is important to recognize that identity characteristics situate the writer, they do not necessarily reflect their writing. Anzaldua notes that this type of labeling has the potential to marginalize those writers who do not conform to the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anzaldua, Gloria. (1994).

=== Chicana music ===
Continually left absent from Chicano music history, many Chicana musical artists, such as [[Rita Vidaurri]] and María de Luz Flores Aceves, more commonly known as [[Lucha Reyes (Mexican singer)|Lucha Reyes]], from the 1940s and 50s, can be credited with many of strides that Chicana Feminist movements have made in the past century. For example, Vidaurri and Aceves were among the first [[Mexican people|mexicana]] women to wear [[charro]] pants while performing rancheras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=vii|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By challenging their own conflicting backgrounds and ideologies, Chicana musicians have continually broken the gender norms of their culture, and therefore created a space for conversation and change in the Latino communities.

There are many important figures in Chicana music history, each one giving a new social identity to Chicanas through their music. An important example of a Chicana musician is [[Rosita Fernández]], an artist from San Antonio, Texas. Popular in the mid 20th century, she was called "San Antonio's First Lady of Song" by [[Lady Bird Johnson]], the [[Tejano]] singer is a symbol of Chicana feminism for many Mexican Americans still today. She was described as "larger than life", repeatedly performing in [[china poblana]] dresses, throughout her career, which last more than 60 years. However, she never received a great deal of fame outside of the San Antonio, despite her long reign as one of the most active Mexican American woman public performers of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas|first1=Deborah|title=Dissonant Divas in Chicana Music: The Limits of la Onda|date=2012|publisher=The University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7316-2|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Qx00pQIkclMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=chicana+feminist+music+artists+girl+in+a+coma&amp;ots=oq8eGGUewA&amp;sig=ccwFFqLmIqTLyiM40FGZT1qlHio#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer ethics''' is a part of [[practical philosophy]] concerned with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/resources/research/introduction/bynum_shrt_hist.html#maner|title=A Very Short History of Computer Ethics |last= Bynum |first=Terrell Ward |publisher=Southern Connecticut Wein University|accessdate=2011-01-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418122849/http://www.southernct.edu/organizations/rccs/resources/research/introduction/bynum_shrt_hist.html|archivedate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Margaret Anne Pierce, a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computers at Georgia Southern University has categorized the ethical decisions related to computer technology and usage into three primary influences:
# The individual's own personal code.
# Any informal code of ethical conduct that exists in the work place.
# Exposure to formal codes of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierce |first1=Margaret Anne |last2=Henry |first2=John W. |title=Computer ethics: The role of personal, informal, and formal codes |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=April 1996 |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=425–437 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m3201253822641r0/ |doi=10.1007/BF00380363 }} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The term computer ethics was first coined by Walter Maner,&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; a professor at [[Bowling Green State University]]. The conceptual foundations of computer ethics are investigated by [[information ethics]], a branch of philosophical [[ethics]] promoted, among others, by [[Luciano Floridi]].&lt;ref name=InformationEthics&gt;

==History==
The concept of computer ethics originated in the 1940s with MIT professor [[Norbert Wiener]], the American mathematician and philosopher. While working on anti-aircraft artillery during [[World War II]], Wiener and his fellow engineers developed a system of communication between the part of a cannon that tracked a warplane, the part that performed calculations to estimate a trajectory, and the part responsible for firing.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; Wiener termed the science of such information feedback systems "[[cybernetics]]," and he discussed this new field with its related ethical concerns in his 1948 book, ''Cybernetics''.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;&lt;ref name=BynumSEP&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bynum |first1=Terrell |title=Computer Ethics: Basic Concepts and Historical Overview |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/ethics-computer/ |date=21 December 2014 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Wiener's second book, ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]'', delved deeper into the ethical issues surrounding information technology and laid out the basic foundations of computer ethics.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

A bit later during the same year the world's first [[computer crime]] was committed. A programmer was able to use a bit of computer code to stop his banking account from being flagged as overdrawn. However, there were no laws in place at that time to stop him, and as a result he was not charged.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Computer Ethics |url=http://www.comphist.org/computing_history/new_page_5.htm |website=Learning Computing History |date=5 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}} To make sure another person did not follow suit, an ethics code for computers was needed.

In 1973, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) adopted its first code of ethics.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; [[SRI International]]'s [[Donn B. Parker|Donn Parker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2002#Parker|title=Alumni Hall of Fame: Donn Parker|publisher=SRI International|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; an author on computer crimes, led the committee that developed the code.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

In 1976, medical teacher and researcher Walter Maner noticed that ethical decisions are much harder to make when computers are added. He noticed a need for a different branch of ethics for when it came to dealing with computers. The term "computer ethics" was thus invented.&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1976 [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] made his second significant addition to the field of computer ethics. He published a book titled ''[[Computer Power and Human Reason]]'',&lt;ref name=ObituaryWeizenbaum&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Joseph Weizenbaum |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N12/weizenbaum.html |newspaper=The Tech |edition=Online |volume=128 |issue=12 |date=14 March 2008 |publisher=MIT News office |location=Cambridge, MA |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which talked about how [[artificial intelligence]] is good for the world; however it should never be allowed to make the most important decisions as it does not have human qualities such as wisdom. By far the most important point he makes in the book is the distinction between choosing and deciding. He argued that deciding is a computational activity while making choices is not and thus the ability to make choices is what makes us humans.

At a later time during the same year [[Abbe Mowshowitz]], a professor of Computer Science at the City College of New York, published an article titled "On approaches to the study of social issues in computing." This article identified and analyzed technical and non-technical biases in research on social issues present in computing.

During 1978, the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] was adopted by the United States Congress, drastically limiting the government's ability to search bank records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Right to Financial Privacy Act |website=Electronic Privacy Information Center |url=https://epic.org/privacy/rfpa/ |accessdate=29 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year [[Terrell Ward Bynum]], the professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University as well as Director of the Research Center on Computing and Society there, developed the first ever curriculum for a university course on computer ethics.{{Citation needed |date=April 2015}} Bynum was also editor of the journal ''[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]].''&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt; In 1983 the journal held an essay contest on the topic of computer ethics and published the winning essays in its best-selling 1985 special issue, “Computers and Ethics.”&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

In 1984, the United States Congress passed the Small Business Computer Security and Education Act, which created a [[Small Business Administration]] advisory council to focus on computer security related to small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|98|HR|3075|pipe=Small Business Computer Security and Education Act of 1984|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1985, [[James Moor]], Professor of Philosophy at DartMouth College in New Hampshire, published an essay called "What is Computer Ethics?"&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt; In this essay Moor states the computer ethics includes the following: "(1) identification of computer-generated policy vacuums, (2) clarification of conceptual muddles, (3) formulation of policies for the use of computer technology, and (4) ethical justification of such policies."&lt;ref name=BynumVeryShort/&gt;

During the same year, Deborah Johnson, Professor of Applied Ethics and Chair of the Department of Science, Technology, and Society in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of the University of Virginia, got the first major computer ethics textbook published.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt; Johnson's textbook identified major issues for research in computer ethics for more than 10 years after publication of the first edition.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1988, Robert Hauptman, a librarian at St. Cloud University, came up with "[[information ethics]]", a term that was used to describe the storage, production, access and dissemination of information.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}} Near the same time, the [[Privacy Act of 1974#Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act|Computer Matching and Privacy Act]] was adopted and this act restricted United States government programs identifying debtors.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|100|S|496|pipe=Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988|site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1992, ACM adopted a new set of ethical rules called "ACM code of Ethics and Professional Conduct"&lt;ref name=ACMethics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics|title=ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |date=16 October 1992 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of 24 statements of personal responsibility.

Three years later, in 1995, Krystyna Górniak-Kocikowska, a Professor of Philosophy at Southern Connecticut State University, Coordinator of the Religious Studies Program, as well as a Senior Research Associate in the Research Center on Computing and Society, came up with the idea that computer ethics will eventually become a global ethical system and soon after, computer ethics would replace ethics altogether as it would become the standard ethics of the information age.&lt;ref name=BynumSEP/&gt;

In 1999, Deborah Johnson revealed her view, which was quite contrary to Górniak-Kocikowska's belief, and stated that computer ethics will not evolve but rather be our old ethics with a slight twist.&lt;ref name=BriefHistory/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Many grammatical errors. No references.|date=April 2015}}

Post 20th century, as a result to much debate of ethical guidelines, many organizations such as ABET&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abet.org/about-abet/|title=About ABET {{!}} ABET|website=www.abet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer ethical accreditation to University or College applications such as "Applied and Natural Science, Computing, Engineering and Engineering Technology at the associate, bachelor, and master levels" to try and promote quality works that follow sound ethical and moral guidelines.

==Internet privacy==
{{main|internet privacy}}
[[Privacy]] is one of the major issues that has emerged since the internet has become part of many aspects of daily life. Internet users hand over [[personal information]] in order to sign up or register for services without realizing that they are potentially setting themselves up for invasions of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;CSC300 Lecture Notes @ University of Toronto, 2011. For more information on this topic, please visit the [http://epic.org Electronic Privacy Information Center] website.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=April 2015}}

Another example of [[privacy issues]], with concern to [[Google]], is [[Website visitor tracking|tracking]] [[web search|searches]]. There is a feature within searching that allows Google to keep track of searches so that advertisements will match your search criteria, which in turn means using people as products.

There is an ongoing discussion about what privacy and privacy enforcement measures imply. With the increase in [[social networking]] sites, more and more people are allowing their private information to be shared publicly. On the surface, this may be seen as someone listing private information about them on a social networking site, but below the surface, it is the site that could be sharing the information (not the individual). This is the idea of an [[opt-in]] versus [[opt-out]] situation. There are many privacy statements that state whether there is an opt-in or an opt-out policy. Typically an opt-in [[privacy policy]] means that the individual has to tell the company issuing the privacy policy if they want their information shared or not. Opt-out means that their information will be shared unless the individual tells the company not to share it.

==Identifying issues==
Identifying ''ethical'' issues as they arise, as well as defining how to deal with them, has traditionally been problematic. In solving problems relating to ethical issues, [[Michael Davis (philosopher)|Michael Davis]] proposed a unique problem-solving method. In Davis's model, the ethical problem is stated, facts are checked, and a list of options is generated by considering relevant factors relating to the problem.  The actual action taken is influenced by specific ethical standards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Ethical standards==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="689">In [[telecommunication]], '''continuous operation''' is an operation in which certain components, such as nodes, [[telecommunications facility|facilities]], [[telecommunications circuit|circuits]], or equipment, are in an operational state at all times. Continuous operation usually requires that there be fully redundant configuration, or at least a sufficient ''X'' out of ''Y'' degree of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] for compatible equipment, where ''X'' is the number of [[Spare part|spare]] components and ''Y'' is the number of operational components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7890">'''David Louis Mearns''', O.A.M., M.Sc., (born 10 August 1958), is an [[United States|American]]-born [[United Kingdom]] based marine scientist and [[Oceanography|Oceanographer]], who specializes in deep water search and recovery operations, and the discovery of the location of historic ship wrecks.

==Early life==
Mearns was raised in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Weehawken High School]], graduating in 1976. He subsequently graduated [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in Marine Biology from [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] in 1980, and obtained a [[Master of Science|Masters]] degree in Marine Geology from the [[University of South Florida]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Hague|Hague, Jim]]. [http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2376595/article-Weehawken-native-finds-HMS-Hood-on-ocean-s-floor-Mearns--six-year-journey-ends-with-mixed-emotions--leads-to-documentary--book?instance-search_results "Weehawken native finds HMS Hood on ocean's floor Mearns' six-year journey ends with mixed emotions; leads to documentary, book"], ''[[The Hudson Reporter]]'', November 9, 2001. Accessed December 29, 2016. "When David Mearns was a youngster growing up in Weehawken, he was always fascinated by water.... Upon graduating from Weehawken High School in 1976, Mearns headed to Fairleigh Dickinson University to major in marine biology. He graduated in 1980 after studying in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands for a semester, then headed to graduate school at the University of South Florida in Tampa."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanographic career==
From 1986 to 1995 Mearns was employed in the commercial undersea surveying industry in a managerial capacity. In 1990 he worked on the criminal investigation into the foundering of the [[cargo ship|freighter]] ''[[Lucona]]'', and in 1994 located the wreck of the [[ore-bulk-oil carrier]] {{MV|Derbyshire}}. Relocating to [[England]] in the mid 1990s, he established ''Blue Water Recoveries, Limited'', a commercial company that locates and researches historic deep-sea shipwrecks across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Entry (dated 2017) for Mearns on the Linkedin professional profile website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] high seas confrontation between the naval forces of the [[British Empire]] and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], Mearns successfully led an expedition funded by [[Channel 4 Television]] to locate and film on the seabed of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] the wrecks of the Royal Navy flagship [[HMS Hood|H.M.S ''Hood'']], and its nemesis, [[German battleship Bismarck]]. An extended television documentary entitled ''The Hunt for the Hood'' was produced from the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;IMDb entry for 'The Hunt for the Hood'. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318884/&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Blue Water Recoveries Ltd. holds three [[Guinness World Records]], including one for the deepest shipwreck ever found, the German [[blockade runner]] ''Rio Grande'', which was located at a depth of {{Convert|5762|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;A.B.C. (Australia) Report, 'The Hunt for H.M.A.S. Sydney', April 2008. http://www.abc.net.au/tv/hmassydney/whosinvd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Mearns [[Search for HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|led a search team to find]] the [[Australia]]n cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|6}} and the German auxiliary cruiser [[German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|''Kormoran'']], which both sank following a [[Battle between HMAS Sydney and German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran|engagement]] off of [[Western Australia]] in 1941 during World War 2. Prior to finding H.M.A.S. ''Sydney'', Mearns said that it was, in some ways, "bigger than the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''" because of what it meant to Australia. "Nothing comes close to the ''Sydney''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20741311-2,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905153042/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20741311-2,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title='I'll find HMAS Sydney' |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2008-09-01 |publisher=Sunday Telegraph |work=news.com.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of 2010, he successfully led the search for another missing Australian shipwreck, the Hospital Ship [[AHS Centaur|''Centaur'']], which was torpedoed off [[Queensland]] by a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] submarine in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/discovery-proves-maligned-navigator-gordon-rippon-got-it-right/story-e6frg6nf-1225812246120 |title=Discovery proves maligned navigator got it right |last=Fraser |first=Andrew |date=21 December 2009 |work=The Australian |page=3 |accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 November 2010, Mearns was awarded an honorary [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in recognition of his work in locating and analyzing the wrecks of H.M.A.S. ''Sydney'' and A.H.S. ''Centaur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/shipwreck-finder-gets-honorary-order-of-australia.htm |title=Shipwreck finder gets honorary OAM |last=Smith |first=Aaron |date=4 November 2010 |work=Australian Geographic |accessdate=5 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106075341/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/shipwreck-finder-gets-honorary-order-of-australia.htm |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 2015 Mearns was part of a team led by [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] which located the wreck of the Japanese battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Musashi|Musashi]]'' in the [[Sibuyan Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-sunken-japan-wwii-warship-musashi-paul-allen-research-team/|title=Live video feed of sunken Japan WWII warship Musashi by Paul Allen research team|date=13 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2015, Mearns jointly announced with the Ministry of Heritage &amp; Culture of the Government of [[Oman]] the discovery of a shipwreck from [[Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama's]] 1502-1503 Armada to India. The wreck is believed to be the Portuguese ''nau Esmeralda'' that was commanded by Vicente Sodré the maternal uncle of Vasco da Gama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esmeraldashipwreck.com|title=Vasco da Gama shipwreck Esmeralda near Oman from Vasco da Gama fleet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having sunk in May 1503, the ''Esmeralda'' is believed to be the earliest ship from Europe's Age of Discovery ever to be found and excavated by archaeologists.

Frohlich, on the discovery in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mearns|first1=David|title=A Portuguese East Indiaman from the 1502–1503 Fleet of Vasco da Gama off Al Hallaniyah Island, Oman: an interim report|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=14 March 2016|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/1095-9270.12175|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1095-9270.12175/full|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death and the Maiden''''' (''Der Tod und das Mädchen'' in German) was a common [[motif (narrative)|motif]] in [[Renaissance art]], especially painting and prints in Germany. The usual form shows just two figures, with a young woman being seized by [[Death (personification)|a personification of Death]], often shown as a skeleton. Variants may include other figures.  It developed from the [[Danse Macabre]] with an added [[eroticism|erotic]] subtext. The German artist [[Hans Baldung]] depicted it several times.&lt;ref&gt;Le Mort dans l'Art&lt;/ref&gt; 

The motif was revived during the [[Romanticism|romantic era in the arts]], a notable example being [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[lied|song]] "[[Der Tod und das Mädchen]]", setting a poem by the German poet [[Matthias Claudius]].  Part of the piano part was re-used in Schubert's famous [[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|String Quartet No. 14]], which is therefore also known by this title, in either English or German.&lt;ref&gt;Le Mort dans l'Art&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Archaeology''' at the [[University of York]], England, is a [[academic department|department]] which provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in [[archaeology]] and its sub-disciplines and conducts associated research. It was founded in 1978 and has grown from a small department based at Micklegate House to more than a hundred undergraduate students based at [[King's Manor]] and with scientific facilities at the '''BioArCh''' centre on the main campus.

==Hosted organisations, research specialities and fieldwork==
The archaeology department hosts several specialist organisations:
*[[Archaeology Data Service]] - an open access digital archive for archaeological research outputs
*[[Internet Archaeology]] - a fully peer-reviewed electronic journal for archaeology
*BioArCh - a specialist centre using scientific and molecular techniques for archaeology
*Centre for Digital Heritage - an interdisciplinary centre studying computer-based approaches to heritage. Working with the universities of [[Aarhus University|Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Leiden University|Leiden]] (Netherlands), [[Lund University|Lund]] (Sweden), [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] (Sweden).
*The ''Post Hole'' -  is an archaeology journal run by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theposthole.org/about |title=The Post Hole |accessdate=11 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department's faculty has led significant archaeological investigations across [[Great Britain]] and occasionally further afield

The department opened in 1978, 15 years after the [[University of York#History|university]] itself. The first head of department, [[Philip Rahtz]] built a thematic undergraduate programme specialising in the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|British Middle Ages]]. The programme included a 12-week field course in [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt; The department expanded under [[Martin Carver]] after his appointment in 1986. A [[postgraduate]] programme was added and the department moved to [[King's Manor]]. Subsequently, the department has grown in numbers of students, staff and the diversity of its specialisms: adding [[environmental archaeology]], [[prehistory]], [[computational archaeology]], [[archaeological science]] and [[cultural heritage management]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27742">In [[physics]] and [[cosmology]], '''digital physics''' is a collection of theoretical perspectives based on the premise that the [[universe]] is describable by [[information]]. It is a form of [[digital ontology]] about the physical reality. According to this theory, the universe can be conceived of as either the output of a deterministic or probabilistic computer program, a vast, digital computation device, or mathematically [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to such a device.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;

==History==
The operations of [[computer]]s must be compatible with the principles of [[information theory]], [[statistical thermodynamics]], and [[quantum mechanics]]. In 1957, a link among these fields was proposed by [[Edwin Jaynes]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1957, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics,]" ''Phys. Rev.'' 106: 620. &lt;br&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1957, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.2.pdf Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics II,]" ''Phys. Rev.'' 108: 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated an interpretation of [[probability theory]] as generalized Aristotelian [[logic]], a view linking fundamental physics with [[digital computers]], because these are designed to implement the [[logical operations|operations]] of [[classical logic]] and, equivalently, of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E. T., 1990, "[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prob.as.logic.pdf Probability Theory as Logic,]" in Fougere, P.F., ed., ''Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods''. Boston: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis that the [[universe]] is a [[digital computer]] was proposed by [[Konrad Zuse]] in his book ''Rechnender Raum'' (translated into English as ''[[Calculating Space]]''). The term ''digital physics'' was{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} employed by [[Edward Fredkin]], who later came to prefer the term ''[[digital philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Fredkin's [http://www.digitalphilosophy.org Digital Philosophy web site.]&lt;/ref&gt; Others who have modeled the universe as a giant computer include [[Stephen Wolfram]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[A New Kind of Science]]'' [http://www.wolframscience.com website.] [http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_reviews.html Reviews of ANKS.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juergen Schmidhuber]],&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.,"&gt;Schmidhuber, J., "[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html Computer Universes and an Algorithmic Theory of Everything]"; [ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/everything.pdf A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the Universe, and Everything].&lt;/ref&gt; and Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]].&lt;ref&gt;G. 't Hooft, 1999, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9903084 Quantum Gravity as a Dissipative Deterministic System,]" ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' '''16''': 3263–79.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors hold that the [[probabilistic]] nature of [[quantum physics]] is not necessarily incompatible with the notion of computability. Quantum versions of digital physics have recently been proposed by [[Seth Lloyd]]&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, S., "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501135 The Computational Universe: Quantum gravity from quantum computation.]"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paola Zizzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0304032 Spacetime at the Planck Scale: The Quantum Computer View.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s binary theory of ur-alternatives, pancomputationalism, computational universe theory, [[John Archibald Wheeler]]'s "It from bit", and [[Max Tegmark]]'s [[ultimate ensemble]].

===Overview===
Digital physics suggests that there exists, at least in principle, a [[computer program|program]] for a [[universal computer]] that computes the evolution of the [[universe]]. The computer could be, for example, a huge [[cellular automaton]] (Zuse 1967&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuse, Konrad, 1967, Elektronische Datenverarbeitung vol 8., pages 336–344&lt;/ref&gt;), or a universal [[Turing machine]], as suggested by Schmidhuber (1997&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt;), who pointed out that there exists a short program that can compute all possible computable universes in an [[asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] way.

[[Loop quantum gravity]] could lend support to digital physics, in that it assumes space-time is quantized.&lt;ref name="Schmidhuber, J.," /&gt; [[Paola Zizzi]] has formulated a realization of this concept in what has come to be called "computational loop quantum gravity", or CLQG.&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0406069 A Minimal Model for Quantum Gravity.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zizzi, Paola, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0412076 Computability at the Planck Scale.]"&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories that combine aspects of digital physics with loop quantum gravity are those of Marzuoli and Rasetti&lt;ref&gt;Marzuoli, A. and Rasetti, M., 2002, "[https://arxiv.org/quant-ph/0209016 Spin Network Quantum Simulator,]" ''Phys. Lett.'' A306, 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marzuoli, A. and Rasetti, M., 2005, "[https://arxiv.org/quant-ph/0410105 Computing Spin Networks,]" ''Annals of Physics'' 318: 345–407.&lt;/ref&gt; and Girelli and Livine.&lt;ref&gt;Girelli, F.; Livine, E. R., 2005, "[https://arxiv.org/gr-qc/0501075]" ''Class. Quantum Grav.'' 22: 3295–3314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weizsäcker's ur-alternatives===
Physicist [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s [[theory of ur-alternatives]] (theory of archetypal objects), first publicized in his book ''The Unity of Nature'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Weizsäcker |first1= Carl Friedrich |title= Die Einheit der Natur |date=1971 |publisher= Hanser |location=München |isbn= 978-3-446-11479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiz71&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker |first= Carl Friedrich |authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker |year= 1980 |title= The Unity of Nature |location= New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; further developed through the 1990s,&lt;ref name=Weiz85&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1985 | title= Aufbau der Physik | location= [[Munich]] | isbn= 978-3-446-14142-1 | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Weizsäcker|first1=Carl Friedrich |title=The Structure of Physics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-1-4020-5234-7|pages=XXX, 360|edition=Görnitz, Thomas; Lyre, Holger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiz92&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1992 | title= Zeit und Wissen | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of digital physics as it [[axiom]]atically constructs quantum physics from the distinction between empirically observable, binary alternatives. Weizsäcker used his theory to derive the 3-dimensionality of space and to estimate the [[entropy]] of a [[proton]]. In 1988 Görnitz has shown that Weizsäcker's assumption can be connected with the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Görnitz|first1=Thomas|title=Abstract Quantum Theory and Space-Time Structure  I. Ur Theory and Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=1988|volume=27|issue=5|pages=527–542|bibcode=1988IJTP...27..527G|doi=10.1007/BF00668835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pancomputationalism&lt;!--'Pancomputationalism' 'and 'Naturalist computationalism' redirect here--&gt;===
{{also|Metaphysical naturalism|Mathematicism}}
'''Pancomputationalism''' (also known as '''naturalist computationalism''')&lt;ref&gt;Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic, [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.301.4845 "Info‐Computational Philosophy Of Nature: An Informational Universe With Computational Dynamics"] (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; is a view that the universe is a computational machine, or rather a network of computational processes which, following fundamental physical laws, computes (dynamically develops) its own next state from the current one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/browse/pancomputationalism Papers on pancomputationalism on philpapers.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

A computational universe is proposed by [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in a paper based on Zuse's 1967 thesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/digitalphysics.html Zuse's Thesis]&lt;/ref&gt;. He pointed out that a simple explanation of the universe would be a [[Turing machine]] programmed to execute all possible programs computing all possible histories for all types of computable physical laws. He also pointed out that there is an optimally efficient way of computing all computable universes based on [[Leonid Levin]]'s universal search algorithm (published in 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Leonid|title = Universal search problems (Russian: Универсальные задачи перебора, Universal'nye perebornye zadachi)|journal = Problems of Information Transmission (Russian: Проблемы передачи информации, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii)|volume = 9|issue = 3|pages = 115–116|year = 1973}} [http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=914&amp;volume=9&amp;year=1973&amp;issue=3&amp;fpage=115&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2000, he expanded this work by combining Ray Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference with the assumption that quickly computable universes are more likely than others. This work on digital physics also led to limit-computable generalizations of algorithmic information or [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and the concept of Super Omegas, which are limit-computable numbers that are even more random (in a certain sense) than [[Gregory Chaitin]]'s number of wisdom [[Chaitin's constant|Omega]].

===Wheeler's "it from bit"===

Following Jaynes and Weizsäcker, the physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler]] proposed an "it from bit" doctrine: information sits at the core of physics, and every "it", whether a particle or field, derives its existence from observations.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John Archibald; Ford, Kenneth (1998).

The toughest nut to crack in Wheeler's research program of a digital dissolution of physical being in a unified physics, Wheeler says, is time. In a 1986 eulogy to the mathematician [[Hermann Weyl]], Wheeler proclaimed: "Time, among all concepts in the world of physics, puts up the greatest resistance to being dethroned from ideal continuum to the world of the discrete, of information, of bits. ... Of all obstacles to a thoroughly penetrating account of existence, none looms up more dismayingly than 'time.' Explain time? Not without explaining existence. Explain existence? Not without explaining time. To uncover the deep and hidden connection between time and existence ... is a task for the future."&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, John Archibald, 1986, "[http://www.weylmann.com/wheeler.pdf Hermann Weyl and the Unity of Knowledge]", ''[[American Scientist]]'', 74: 366-375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, 2009, '[http://www.arte-fact.org/dgtlon_e.html#ps2 Postscript 2: On quantum physics' assault on time]'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, 2009, [http://www.arte-fact.org/dgtlcast.html ''The Digital Cast of Being: Metaphysics, Mathematics, Cartesianism, Cybernetics, Capitalism, Communication''] ontos, Frankfurt 2009 137 pp. {{ISBN|978-3-86838-045-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital vs. informational physics===
Not every informational approach to physics (or [[ontology]]) is necessarily [[Ontology (computer science)|digital]]. According to [[Luciano Floridi]],&lt;ref&gt;Floridi, L., 2004, "[http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV37Floridi.pdf Informational Realism,]" in Weckert, J., and Al-Saggaf, Y, eds., ''Computing and Philosophy Conference'', vol. 37."&lt;/ref&gt; "informational structural realism" is a variant of [[structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structural]] [[scientific realism|realism]] that supports an ontological commitment to a world consisting of the totality of informational objects dynamically interacting with each other. Such informational objects are to be understood as constraining affordances.

Pancomputationalists like Lloyd (2006), who models the universe as a [[quantum computer]], can still maintain an analogue or hybrid ontology; and informational ontologists like [[Kenneth M. Sayre|Kenneth Sayre]] and Floridi embrace neither a digital ontology nor a pancomputationalist position.&lt;ref&gt;See Floridi talk on Informational Nature of Reality, abstract at the E-CAP conference 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational foundations==

===Turing machines===
{{Main|Turing machine}}

===The Church–Turing–Deutsch thesis===
The classic [[Church–Turing thesis]] claims that any computer as powerful as a [[Turing machine]] can, in principle, calculate anything that a human can calculate, given enough time. Turing moreover showed that there exist [[universal Turing machine]]s which can compute anything any other Turing machine can compute—that they are generalizable Turing machines. &lt;!-- A stronger version, not attributable to Church or Turing,&lt;ref&gt;[[B. Jack Copeland]], ''Computation'' in Luciano Floridi (ed.), ''The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, ISBN 0-631-22919-1, pp. 10–15&lt;/ref&gt; claims that [Surely not that universal Turing machines exist! That isn't even a "claim", let alone a stronger one]. --&gt; But the limits of practical computation are set by [[physics]], not by theoretical computer science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Turing did not show that his machines can solve any problem that can be solved 'by instructions, explicitly stated rules, or procedures', nor did he prove that the universal Turing machine 'can compute any function that any computer, with any architecture, can compute'. He proved that his universal machine can compute any function that any Turing machine can compute; and he put forward, and advanced philosophical arguments in support of, the thesis here called Turing's thesis. But a thesis concerning the extent of effective methods—which is to say, concerning the extent of procedures of a certain sort that a human being unaided by machinery is capable of carrying out—carries no implication concerning the extent of the procedures that machines are capable of carrying out, even machines acting in accordance with 'explicitly stated rules.' For among a machine's repertoire of atomic operations there may be those that no human being unaided by machinery can perform."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: "[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/church-turing/#Bloopers The Church–Turing thesis]" – by [[B. Jack Copeland]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, a modification of Turing's assumptions ''does'' bring practical computation within Turing's limits; as [[David Deutsch]] puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I can now state the physical version of the Church–Turing principle: 'Every ''finitely'' realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by ''finite'' means.' This formulation is both better defined and more physical than Turing's own way of expressing it."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Deutsch]], "Quantum Theory, the Church–Turing Principle and the Universal Quantum Computer."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Emphasis added)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This compound conjecture is sometimes called the "strong Church–Turing thesis" or the [[Church–Turing–Deutsch principle]]. It is stronger because a human or Turing machine computing with pencil and paper (under Turing's conditions) is a finitely realizable physical system.

==Experimental confirmation==

So far there is no experimental confirmation of either binary or quantized nature of the universe, which are basic for digital physics.
The few attempts made in this direction would include the experiment with [[holometer]] designed by [[Craig Hogan]], which among others would detect a bit structure of space-time.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Salles, "Do we live in a 2-D hologram? New Fermilab experiment will test the nature of the universe", Fermilab Office of Communication, August 26, 2014
[http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/2014/2-D-Hologram-20140826.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The experiment started collecting data in August 2014.

A new result of the experiment released on December 3, 2015, after a year of data collection, has ruled out Hogan's theory of a pixelated universe to a high degree of statistical significance (4.6 sigma). The study found that [[space-time]] is not [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] at the scale being measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.fnal.gov/2015/12/holometer-rules-out-first-theory-of-space-time-correlations/|title=Holometer rules out first theory of space-time correlations {{!}} News|website=news.fnal.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Physical symmetries are continuous===
One objection is that extant models of digital physics are incompatible {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} with the existence of several continuous characters of physical [[symmetry in physics|symmetries]], e.g., [[rotational symmetry]], [[translational symmetry]], [[Lorentz symmetry]], and the [[Lie group]] gauge invariance of [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]], all central to current physical theory.

Proponents of digital physics claim that such continuous symmetries are only convenient (and very good) approximations of a discrete reality. For example, the reasoning leading to systems of [[natural units]] and the conclusion that the [[Planck length]] is a minimum meaningful unit of distance suggests that at some level, space itself is quantized.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, computers can manipulate and solve formulas describing real numbers using [[symbolic computation]], thus avoiding the need to approximate real numbers by using an infinite number of digits.

A number—in particular a [[real number]], one with an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of digits—was defined by [[Turing]] to be [[computable real|computable]] if a [[Turing machine]] will continue to spit out digits endlessly. In other words, there is no "last digit". But this sits uncomfortably with any proposal that the universe is the output of a virtual-reality exercise carried out in real time (or any plausible kind of time). Known physical laws (including [[quantum mechanics]] and its [[continuous spectrum|continuous spectra]]) are very much infused with [[real number]]s and the mathematics of the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"So ordinary computational descriptions do not have a cardinality of states and state space trajectories that is sufficient for them to map onto ordinary mathematical descriptions of natural systems. Thus, from the point of view of strict mathematical description, the thesis that everything is a computing system in this second sense cannot be supported".&lt;ref name="Piccinini"&gt;[[Gualtiero Piccinini|Piccinini, Gualtiero]], 2007, "Computational Modelling vs. Computational Explanation:  Is Everything a Turing Machine, and Does It Matter to the Philosophy of Mind?" ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' 85(1): 93–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For his part, [[David Deutsch]] generally takes a "[[multiverse]]" view to the question of continuous vs. discrete. In short, he thinks that “within each universe all observable quantities are discrete, but the multiverse as a whole is a continuum. When the equations of quantum theory describe a continuous but not-directly-observable transition between two values of a discrete quantity, what they are telling us is that the transition does not take place entirely within one universe. So perhaps the price of continuous motion is not an infinity of consecutive actions, but an infinity of concurrent actions taking place across the multiverse.”  January, 2001 The Discrete and the Continuous, an abridged version of which appeared in The Times Higher Education Supplement.

===Locality===
Some argue that extant models of digital physics violate various postulates of [[quantum physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review on ''A New Kind of Science'' by Stephen Wolfram|journal=Quantum Information and Computation (QIC)|date=September 2002|arxiv=quant-ph/0206089}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if these models are not grounded in [[Hilbert space]]s and probabilities, they belong to the class of theories with local [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] that have so far been ruled out experimentally using [[Bell's theorem]]. This criticism has two possible answers. First, any notion of locality in the digital model does not necessarily have to correspond to locality formulated in the usual way in the emergent [[spacetime]]. A concrete example of this case was given by [[Lee Smolin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=September 2012}} Another possibility is a well-known loophole in [[Bell's theorem]] known as [[superdeterminism]] (sometimes referred to as predeterminism).&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Bell, 1981, "Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality," ''Journal de Physique'' '''42''' C2: 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In a completely deterministic model, the experimenter's decision to measure certain components of the spins is predetermined. Thus, the assumption that the experimenter could have decided to measure different components of the spins than he actually did is, strictly speaking, not true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5332">[[File:Stash pic jason crouch.jpg|thumb|300px|Glassware and pottery found in an old dump in [[Meaford, Ontario]].]]
'''Dump digging''' is the practice of locating and excavating old garbage dumps with the intent of discovering objects which have potential value as collectibles or antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dumps are a window into history |quote=Campbell and the others call themselves "dumpdiggers," shoveling for signs of the past – pottery, bottles, buttons, cutlery, moustache cups – wherever people once tossed garbage. |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These dumps are sometimes centuries old but often date to the late 19th century or early part of the 20th century. Among other things, the practice of dump digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting and glassmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-07-15 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

It is a form of [[historical digging]] which involves long hours working with a shovel, pick and other hand tools.  Finding evidence of potential antique bottle dumps or middens is done by searching areas where it is likely that older garbage was deposited.  Diggers generally look for clues of pre1920s junk piles in the woods or down embankments, places where old houses or businesses stand or once stood.  Hiking along waterways and swampy areas, particularly during droughts, can also produce important clues and lead to good discoveries.  

Additionally, many coastal cities are surrounded by landfills or “tips”, places where enormous quantities of trash were deposited in the past intended to create additional acres of viable real estate.  It can take many months of searching each of these locations for a decent dig to be surface.

==Background and controversies==
Dump digging for potentially valuable collectibles is at least as old as the Pharaohs. For practical reasons dump diggers often use a much less forensic style than academic archeologists or museum curators would on their projects. Not unlike the privies, cisterns and wells that other historical diggers explore and salvage in, dumps are typically fleeting sources. They are often located on properties which are in the process of being permanently altered by major development and other factors.

==Items found and locations==
[[File:1870 tobacco pipe, EastEndDumpDiggers.jpg|thumb|250px|A clay pipe discovered while excavating an old bottle dump (ca. 1870).]]
Dump digging can yield different items and artifacts in each location. A town dump can be somewhat different than a farm dump or a railroad dump but in each case there could be industrial age pottery, [[stoneware]], china, tobacco pipes, military relics like bayonets and gun barrels, musket balls, uniform buttons and other buttons, marbles and an assortment of other things.  A high percentage of these dump discoveries are routinely found in severe states of decay, damaged or broken altogether.  In many cases even the things which have stood the test of time remarkably well have little if any monetary value.  There are many exceptions to this general rule that keep dump diggers busy searching and occasionally they are surprised by what they unearth working their sites.          

Through the common process known as tipping, vast amounts of refuse generated by towns and cities were dumped into harbors, along marshy shorelines and other areas while forming viable real estate cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= B.|last= Miller |title=Fat of the Land: Garbage in New York: The Last Two Hundred Years |place=New York |publisher= Four Walls Eight Windows |year=2000|isbn= 1-56858-172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excavating in these areas is also a form of dump digging.  Elusive and often deep, small portions of these ashy [[landfill]] dumps are sometimes rediscovered during major development projects.  Enormous quantities of a given locations everyday trash were deposited into these often difficult to reach locales.  

The bulk of this garbage has never been investigated and at present much of it is still undiscovered.  Through researching and active searching occasionally the opportunity arises to dig into small portions and find old bottles and other objects which survive remarkably well as curiosities, collectibles or antiques. For centuries active waterways were also frequently converted into major dumping spots for household and industrial refuse but they are generally impossible to reach without expensive equipment.  Along with the existing information generated from the efforts of dump diggers and others, a wealth of additional information is waiting among these widely distributed landfills and other dumping spots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15439">'''Early long-term potentiation''' (E-LTP) is the first phase of [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP), a well-studied form of [[synaptic plasticity]], and consists of an increase in synaptic strength.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; LTP could be produced by repetitive stimulation of the presynaptic terminals, and it is believed to play a role in memory function in the hippocampus, amygdala and other cortical brain structures in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huerta P.T., Tonegawa S., Tsien J.Z.|date=1996|title=The essential role of hippocampal CA1 NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in spatial memory.|url=|journal=Cell|volume=87|pages=1327–1338|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeDoux J.E., Rogan M.T., Staubli U.V.|date=1997|title=Fear conditioning induces associative long-term potentiation in the amygdala.|url=|journal=Nature|volume=390|pages=604–607|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term potentiation occurs when synaptic transmission becomes more effective as a result of recent activity. The neuronal changes can be temporary and wear off after some hours (early LTP) or much more stable and long-lasting (late LTP).

== Early and late phase&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-05-07|title=Synaptic plasticity: Going through phases with LTP|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982298702192|journal=Current Biology|language=en|volume=8|issue=10|pages=R350–R352|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(98)70219-2|issn=0960-9822|last1=Huang|first1=Emily P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
It has been proposed that long-term potentiation is composed of at least two different phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frey|date=1993|title=Effects of cAMP simulate a late stage of LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons.|url=|journal=Science|volume=260|pages=1661–1664|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; protein synthesis-independent E-LTP (early LTP) and protein synthesis-dependent L-LTP (late LTP). A single train of high-frequency stimuli is needed to trigger E-LTP that begins right after the stimulation, lasting a few hours or less, and depending primarily on short-term [[kinase]] activity. Contrarily stronger stimulation protocols are needed to recruit L-LTP that begins after a few hours, lasts for at least eight hours, and depends on the activation of de novo gene transcription. These different characteristics suggest a relationship between E-LTP and [[short-term memory]] phase, as well as L-LTP and [[long-term memory]] phase.

=== LTP and memory phases ===
A comparison &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kandel E.R., Mansuy I.M., Osman M., Moallem T.M., Winder D.G|date=1998|title=Genetic and pharmacological evidence for a novel, intermediate phase of long-term potentiation suppressed by calcineurin.|url=|journal=Cell|volume=92|issue=1|pages=25–37|via=|pmid=9489697}}&lt;/ref&gt; between LTP induced by two spaced trains of stimuli and LTP induced by four trains in wild-type mice showed that LTP induced by two trains decays faster than the one induced by one train and slower than the one induced by four trains.  Moreover, the LTP induced by two trains is only partially impaired by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition and not by protein synthesis inhibition. These findings &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggested that there is a PKA-dependent phase of LTP intermediate to E-LTP and L-LTP, which was called intermediate LTP (I-LTP).

In the transgenic mice, on the other hand, LTP induced by two trains decayed faster than in wild-type mice, implying that excessive [[calcineurin]] activity suppresses both I-LTP and L-LTP. This calcineurin-overexpression could be associated to memory-related behavioral deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bach M.E., Jacob B., Kandel E.R., Mayford M., Mansuy I.M.|date=1998|title=Restricted and regulated overexpression reveals calcineurin as a key component in the transition from short-term to long-term memory.|url=|journal=Cell|volume=92|issue=1|pages=39–49|via=|pmid=9489698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transgenic mice performed poorly in [[spatial memory]] tasks compared to wild-type mice, indicating a deficit. However when trained more intensively their performance deficit with respect to wild-type mice disappears. Moreover the transgenic mice performed normally on memory tasks 30 minutes after training, but were considerably impaired 24 hours after training. This led to the conclusion that calcineurin-overexpressing mice have a deficit in long-term memory consolidation, which reflects their deficit in late phase LTP.

== Biological processes&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ==
Training of simple reflexes in [[Aplysia]] has shown a strengthening between sensory and motor neurons responsible for those reflexes; on a cellular level, for short-term memory (and thus, early LTP) potentiation leads to an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter by means of modifications of proteins through cAMP-dependent PKA and PKC. The long-term process requires new protein synthesis and CAMP-mediated gene expression, and results in the growth of new synaptic connections.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

These findings have led to the question whether there is a similar process in mammals. Input to the [[hippocampus]] comes from the neurons of the entorhinal cortex by means of the perforant pathway, which synapses on the [[granule cell]]s of the [[dentate gyrus]]. The granule cells in turn send their axons, the mossy fibre pathway (CA3), to synapse on the [[pyramidal cell]]s of the CA3 region. Finally, the axons of the pyramidal cells in the CA3 regions, the Schaffer collateral pathway (CA1), terminate on the pyramidal cells of the CA1 region. Damage to any of these hippocampal pathways is sufficient to cause some memory disturbance in humans.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-10-07|title=cAMP contributes to mossy fiber LTP by initiating both a covalently mediated early phase and macromolecular synthesis-dependent late phase|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867494904014|journal=Cell|language=en|volume=79|issue=1|pages=69–79|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90401-4|pmid=7923379|issn=0092-8674|last1=Huang|first1=Yan-You|last2=Li|first2=Xiao-Ching|last3=Kandel|first3=Eric R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the perforant and Schaffer pathways, LTP is induced by activating a postsynaptic NMDA receptor, causing an influx of calcium. In the mossy fibres pathway on the other hand, LTP is induced presynaptically through an influx of glutamate.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|last=A.|first=Gluck, Mark|date=2008|publisher=Worth Publishers|others=Mercado, Eduardo., Myers, Catherine E.|isbn=978-0716786542|location=New York|oclc=190772862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early LTP is best studied in the context of [[classical conditioning]]. As the signal of an [[unconditioned stimulus]] enters the [[pontine nuclei]] in the brainstem, the signal travels through the mossy fibres to the [[interpositus nucleus]] and the parallel fibres in the cerebellum. The parallel fibres synapse on so called [[Purkinje cells]], which simultaneously receive input of the unconditioned stimulus via the inferior olives and climbing fibres.

The parallel fibres release [[glutamate]], which activates inhibitory [[metabotropic]] and excitatory [[ionotropic]] AMPA receptors. The metabotropic receptors activate an enzyme cascade via [[G protein]], which leads to the activation of protein [[kinase]] C (PKC). This PKC phosphorylates the active ionotropic receptors.

At another place of the cell, the climbing fibres carry the neurotransmitter [[aspartate]] to the [[Purkinje cell]], and that leads to the opening of calcium channels, which in turn causes an increased influx of calcium to the cell. The calcium activates PKC once again, and the phosphorylised ionotropic receptors are internalised. Thus, the surplus of metabotropic receptors [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarises]] the cell, and the interpositus nucleus [[Depolarization|depolarises]] the inferior olives, which causes a decrease in expectation of the unconditioned stimulus and therefore causing an inhibition in early LTP or a period of [[long-term depression]].

== Clinical perspectives ==

=== LTP in Alzheimer's disease ===
It is known that [[Alzheimer's disease]] is characterized by extracellular deposits of neurotoxic amyloid peptides (Aβ), intracellular aggregation of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein, and neuronal death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi, R.E., Bertram, L.|date=2005|title=Twenty years of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid hypothesis, a genetic perspective.|url=|journal=Cell|volume=120|pages=545–555|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[chronic stress]] is characterized by its negative impacts on the effect of learning and memory and furthermore can exacerbate a number of disorders, including [[Alzheimer dementia|Alzheimer's disease]] (AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivareerat, M., Tran, T.T., Alzoubi, K.H., Alkadhi, K.A.|date=2009|title=Chronic psychosocial stress exacerbates impairment of cognition and long-term potentiation in beta-amyloid rat model of Alzheimer's disease.|url=|journal=Biol. Psychiatry|volume=65|pages=918–926|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsatali, M., Papaliagkas, V., Damigos, D., Mavreas, V., Gouva, M., Tsolaki, M.|date=2014|title=Depression and anxiety levels increase chronic musculoskeletal pain in patients with Alzheimer's disease.|url=|journal=Curr. Alzheimer Res.|volume=11|issue=6|pages=574–579|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous studies have shown that the combination of chronic psychosocial stress and chronic infusion of a pathogenic dose of Aβ peptides impairs learning and memory and severely diminishes early phase long-term potentiation (E-LTP) in the hippocampal area CA1 of anesthetized rat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tran, T.T., Srivareerat, M., Alkadhi, K.A.|date=2010|title=Chronic psychosocial stress triggers cognitive impairment in a novel at-risk model of Alzheimer's disease.|url=|journal=Neurobiol. Dis.|volume=37|pages=756–763|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tran, T.T., Srivareerat, M., Alkadhi, K.A.|date=2011|title=Chronic psychosocial stress accelerates impairment of long-term memory and late-phase long-term potentiation in an at-risk model of Alzheimer's disease.|url=|journal=Hippocampus|volume=21|pages=724–732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tran, T.T., Srivareerat, M., Alhaider, I.A., Alkadhi, K.A.|date=2011|title=Chronic psychosocial stress enhances long-term depression in a subthreshold amyloid-beta rat model of Alzheimer's disease.|url=|journal=J. Neurochem.|volume=119|pages=408–416|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chronic psychosocial stress was produced using a rat intruder model and the at-risk rat model of Alzheimer's disease was created by osmotic pump infusion of sub-pathological dose of Aβ (subAβ). Electrophysiological methods were used to evoke and record early and late phase LTP in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats, and immunoblotting was used to measure levels of memory-related signaling molecules in the same region. These Electrophysiological and molecular tests in the dentate gyrus showed that subAβ rats or stressed rats were not different from control rats. However, the present findings conclude that when stress and subAβ are combined, signiﬁcant suppression of E-LTP magnitude results.

In summary, although the CA1 and DG regions are closely related physically and functionally, they react differently to insults. While the area CA1 is vulnerable to stress and the combination stress/subAβ, the DG is remarkably resistant to the offending combination of subAβ and chronic stress.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== LTP in drug use ===
Another use of LTP is in drug abuse. As can be seen in many drug victims, conditioning plays a vital role in building up a tolerance. In reconditioning recovering addicts to the place in which they used to take drugs with a different stimulus, the craving they feel could be counteracted. A rather successful experimental study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blakey|first=Richard|last2=Baker|first2=Roger|date=1980|title=An exposure approach to alcohol abuse|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=319–325|doi=10.1016/0005-7967(80)90090-x|issn=0005-7967}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that this paradigm lowers the danger of relapsing and works as [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poulos|first=Constantine X.|last2=Hinson|first2=Riley E.|last3=Siegel|first3=Shepard|date=1981|title=The role of Pavlovian processes in drug tolerance and dependence: Implications for treatment|journal=Addictive Behaviors|volume=6|issue=3|pages=205–211|doi=10.1016/0306-4603(81)90018-6|issn=0306-4603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbas, A.|date=2015|title=Re-evaluation of the hypothesis that LTP has two temporal phases and that the late phase is protein synthesis dependent.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The hypothesis that the stabilisation of synaptic plasticity depends on de novo protein synthesis is popular in literature. The temporal differentiation between early and late LTP is also based on this. Early LTP is associated with short-term memory and late LTP with long-term memory. Behavioural studies raised evidence against this differentiation.

Studies with protein synthesis inhibitors showed that blocking protein synthesis did not block memory retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanton, P.K. and Sarvey, J.M.|date=1984|title=Blockade of long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal CA1 region by inhibitors of protein synthesis.|url=|journal=J. Neurosci.|volume=4|pages=3080–3088|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stable LTP were found in slice preparation of the hippocampus under a state of global protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Villers, A., Godaux, E. and Ris, L.|date=2012|title=Long-lasting LTP requires neither repeated trains for  its induction nor protein synthesis for its development|url=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=7|pages=e40823|via=|pmid=22792408|pmc=3394721|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0040823}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those studies show that LTP stabilization can happen independently from protein synthesis. This shows that the association between protein synthesis and stabilization is insufficient to determine the difference between early and late LTP.

Instead of the differentiation into early and late LTP and protein synthesis as the driving force for LTP and memory stabilization, an alternative model was proposed''':''' in addition to the protein synthesis, the [[protein degradation]] also determines the stabilization, so the turn-over rate of proteins is said to underlie LTP stabilization. According to the model, the differentiation into temporal phases of LTP is inappropriate and even hindering to future research about LTP. Mechanisms can be overlooked due to the closed temporalization of function and processes.

'''Ecophenotypic variation''' ("ecophenotype") refers to [[Phenotype|phenotypical variation]] as a function of life station. In wide-ranging species, the contributions of [[heredity]] and environment are not always certain, but their interplay can sometimes be determined by experiment.

==Plants==
Plants display the most obvious examples of ecophenotypic variation. One example are trees growing in the woods developing long straight trunks, with branching crowns high in the canopy, while the same species growing alone in the open develops a spreading form, branching much lower to the ground. [[Genotype]]s often have much flexibility in the modification and expression of [[phenotype]]s; in many organisms these phenotypes are very different under varying environmental conditions. The plant ''[[Hieracium umbellatum]]'' is found growing in two different habitats in Sweden. One habitat is rocky sea-side cliffs, where the plants are bushy with broad leaves and expanded [[inflorescence]]s; the other is among sand dunes where the plants grow prostrate with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. These habitats alternate along the coast of Sweden and the habitat that the seeds of ''H. umbellatum'' land in determines the phenotype that grows.&lt;ref name=Botanyonline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e37/37b.htm |title=Botany online: Evolution: The Modern Synthesis - Phenotypic and Genetic Variation; Ecotypes |work= |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Invasive species|Invasive plants]] such as the [[honeysuckle]] can thrive by altering their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] in response to changes in the environment,&lt;ref name="Jstor2997251"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Greater morphological plasticity of exotic honeysuckle species may make them better invaders than native species|first1=Jennifer|last1=Schweitzer|first2=Katherine|last2=Larson|journal=Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society|issue=126|volume=1|year=1999|pages=15–23|publisher=jstor.org|jstor=2997251|doi=10.2307/2997251}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives them a competitive advantage. Another example of a plants phenotypic reaction and adaptation with its environment is how [[Thlaspi caerulescens]] can absorb the metals in the soil to use to its advantage in defending against harmful microbes and bacteria in its leaves.&lt;ref&gt;"Plants 'armor up' with metals." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The more immediate responses shown by vascular plants to their environment, for instance a vine's ability to conform to the wall or tree upon which it grows, are not usually considered ecophenotypic, even though the mechanisms may be related.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J. Phil, and Terri R. Gibson. "plants and the environment." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
Since animals are far less plastic than plants, ecophenotypic variation is noteworthy. When encountered, it can cause confusion in identification if it is not anticipated. The most obvious examples are again common observations, as the dwarfing of aquarium fish living in a restricted environment.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Katherine. "evolution." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In asexual reproduction, the parent passes on the entire genome to the next generation. Mutations to the genes are the only source of genetic variation. In sexual reproduction, each parent contributes half of his or her genome to the offspring; thus the offspring contain a mixture of genetic material. Adaptations are traits that increase fitness, the driving force for natural selection. The level of fitness associated with an allele can only be ascertained by comparison with alternate alleles. Traits that increase the survival rate of a species contribute to an animal's fitness, but selection will only favor such traits insofar as survival improves the reproductive success of the organism. More interesting are examples where causation is less clear. Among [[mollusca|mollusks]], examples include the [[muricidae|muricid]] snail species ''[[Nucella lamellosa]]'', which in rough, shallow waters is generally less spiny than in deeper, quiet waters.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, R. T., 1968 Seashells of North America. Golden Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[unionidae|unionid]] [[freshwater bivalves]], there are lake, small river, and large river forms of several species.&lt;ref&gt;Burch, J. B., 1975 Freshwater unionacean clams (mollusca, Pelecypoda) of North America. Malacological Publications. p 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[vertebrate]]s, experiments on mice show reduced length of ears and tails in response to being reared in a lower temperature, a phenomenon known as [[Allen's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, William, and Charles E. Little. "Allen's rule." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humans==
In humans, environmental differences due to [[lifestyle choice]]s are a consideration, for instance the differences between someone who spends much time on the sofa before the television, beer in hand, and an individual who spends his time in the gym or the soccer field can be pronounced. [[Franz Boas]] found that [[cephalic index]] was to some degree dependent on where a child was born, independent of the child's genetic or cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Stanley A. "environmental psychology." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another way in which environmental differences can cause physical and/or behavioral alterations is in being put under great levels of [[stress (psychological)|stress]], causing a wide range of effects. Chronic Stress has been proven to cause health issues in many individuals. "Early childhood attempts to cope with fear or rejection ... set up psychological patterns of behavior for the person's later life. Those behaviors in turn affect the biochemical imbalances in the brain's neuronal systems. Those altered imbalances in turn reinforce the behaviors, and the cycle feeds upon itself." "The body reacts biochemically to excessive stress as it attempts to regain its healthy dynamic balance" ; "In psychologically stressful situations, hormones may be brought into play to remedy the imbalance the body finds itself in."&lt;ref name="Davis, J. 1984"&gt;Davis, J. (1984) Endorphins. Garden City, N.Y.: Dial Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the General Adaption Syndrome, which is the biological response to stress, there are three stages.
1.) The "Alarm Action" - heart rate increases, blood sugar levels rise, pupils dilate, and digestion slows.
2.) The "Resistance" or "Adaptive" stage - The body attempts to repair the damage which caused the emergency arousal
3.) The "Exhaustion Stage" - The body grows ill; Mentally, possibly by neurosis or even psychotic disturbances, or physically, having the possibility to trigger several kinds of cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and Quite commonly, certain forms of [[asthma]].&lt;ref name="Davis, J. 1984"/&gt;

The '''European Institute for Gender Equality''' is a [[Vilnius]]-based [[Agencies of the European Union|agency of the European Union]] inaugurated in 2007. It was established by [[European Union regulation|Council Regulation]] (EC) No 1922/2006 of 20 December 2006. Recruitment of its Director was advertised in April 2007.

Funded by the Commission, with a proposed budget of €52.5 million for the period 2007 to 2013, this new European Institute will support the EU institutions and the Member States in promoting equality between women and men and combating sex discrimination. The Institute will gather, analyse and disseminate reliable and comparable research data and information needed by policy-makers. It will have a documentation centre and a library which will be open to the public.

The Management Board of the institute consists of eighteen representatives of the EU Member States appointed by the Council and of one member representing the European Commission. An Experts' forum as further body of the institute consists of delegates designated by the Member States (28), the European Parliament (2) and the Commission (3), the latter including representatives from non-governmental, employers' and workers' organisations at EU level.

FIPEL lights are different from LED lighting, in that there is no junction.

'''An Foras Áiseanna Saothair''' ({{IPA-ga|ən̪ˠ ˈfˠɔrˠəsˠ ˈaːʃʲən̪ˠə ˈsˠiːhəɾʲ}}), referred to in English as the '''Training and Employment Authority''' and commonly known as '''FÁS''' ({{IPA-ga|faːs}}), was a [[Public service bodies of the Republic of Ireland|state agency]] in Ireland with responsibility for assisting those [[Job hunting|seeking employment]]. It was established in January 1988 under the ''Labour Services Act, 1987'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20050830142014/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987_15.html] and was run by a board appointed by the [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]], composed of employer and trade union representatives.

==Overview==
The authority, whose [[Irish language]] name literally translates as "the Labour Facilities Foundation", was the successor to An Chomhairle Oiliúna ("the training council", commonly referred to as AnCO), the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency. The Irish word ''fás'' formed by the acronym means "growth", and the authority was created in [[1980s Ireland]] during the long economic downturn of the time.

The authority ran a number of ''JobCentres'' in Ireland to facilitate those seeking employment, however it had occasionally been criticised, not least for the perception that it is simply a scheme to remove people from unemployment statistics{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} – it had also been criticised for the expense of running it at almost €1 billion per annum.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The authority ran training courses in various fields, through regional centres, although some of this work was transferred to [[Regional Technical College|institutes of technology]] – including the [[apprenticeship]]s in various fields that it regulated.

==Apprenticeships==
Apprenticeships regulated by FÁS include:

==Geoghegan controversy==
By tradition, the Director General of FÁS is a board member of [[Forfás]]. Brian Geoghegan (spouse of [[Mary Harney]], [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health and Children]]) retired as Chairman of FÁS at the end of 2005 and was replaced by Peter McLoone. There had been some controversy regarding Geoghegan's position when it emerged he was also a board member of IBEC, the employer's union of Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} IBEC have been critical of FÁS at times claiming, at various intervals, that some FÁS courses and schemes are a waste of money, taking potential employees off the live register who could otherwise be employed in mainstream positions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The fact that Geoghegan is married to Minister Mary Harney, who was formerly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, led to some claims he had a conflict of interest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Expenses scandal==
{{main|FÁS expenses scandal}}
In September 2008, the [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment]] [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]] announced that the Comptroller and Auditor General would undertake an investigation of FÁS expenditure in light of what she saw as the evident public disquiet on the issue. The annual budget for FÁS at the time was around €1 billion. In November 2008, The [[Dáil]] Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also began an investigation. However, it was information obtained under the [[Freedom of information legislation#Ireland|Freedom of Information Act]] by journalist and Senator [[Shane Ross]] which he published in the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' that brought the [[FÁS expenses scandal]] to a head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/in-the-spotlight-how-spending-saga-unfolded-1552805.html In the spotlight: How spending saga unfolded]&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents obtained by Senator Ross showed that some €643,000 had been spent over the course of four years on transatlantic travel promoting the agency's Science Challenge Programme. The expenses included items such as first class air fares, business class air fares and fares paid for by FÁS for spouses, rounds of golf as well as nail and beauty treatment. It also revealed that three Government ministers and two junior ministers had attended in that time for inconsequential reasons .

This revelation caused major controversy and pressure was brought to bear on FÁS Director General Roddy Molloy to resign, although [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] spoke in support of Molloy both publicly and in the Dáil. Molloy went so far as to appear on the [[Pat Kenny]] Show on [[RTÉ Radio 1]] to defend the expenses incurred.

However, under ever increasing pressure, Molloy resigned as Director General on 25 November 2008.

In September 2009 the board announced it would resign and the Irish Times announced that legislation to restructure the organisation was expected in the following four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report into the breakdown of internal controls in FÁS by the Comptroller and Auditor General was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audgen.gov.ie/documents/vfmreports/73_Internal__Control_in_FAS1.pdf Special Report 73: Internal Control and Governance in FÁS, January 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissolution==
In July 2011 the Minister for Education and Skills announced that FÁS would be replaced by a new agency, named SOLAS, that would have responsibility for all public funding of further education and training. The training function of FÁS was absorbed into the restructured local [[Vocational Education Committee]]s which were retitled [[Education and Training Board]]s in July 2013.

In [[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have been reused to the extent that the [[narrative]]s are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.

Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.

Genres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-[[Medieval Europe]]an setting, the [[Old West]], or [[outer space]].  Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[Faster than light|warp drives]] in [[science fiction]], or [[shootout]]s at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.

The ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable [[narrative structure]]. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.

''Formula fiction'' should not be confused with ''[[pastiche]]'' (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some [[parody]] and [[satire|satirical]] works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common [[stereotype]]s or [[caricature]]s, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly [[cliché]] or [[realism (arts)|unrealistic]] nature. Indeed, between [[parody]], [[satire]] and such [[subgenre]]s as romantic comedy, [[comedy]] as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.

Formula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early [[pulp magazine]] markets, though some works published in that medium, such as "[[The Cold Equations]]", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.

The dissection and tracking of common formulaic [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The [[Final Girl]] being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''). [[Amateur]] circles have websites such as the [[TV Tropes|TV Tropes Wiki]].

Tilman is also a professor at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]'s [[Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management]].&lt;ref name=googlescholar&gt;{{Google scholar id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Tilman (born Titman)&lt;ref name=titmanphd/&gt; was born in Aurora, Illinois in 1949. He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[zoology]] in 1971 and his [[PhD]] in ecology in 1976 at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name=PNAS/&gt;&lt;ref name=titmanphd&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=George David|last=Titman |title=Interspecific competition for resources: An experimental and theoretical study |publisher=University of Michigan |date=1968 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302806650 |website=proquest.com|oclc=68285554}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his doctoral research was published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=Titman1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Titman|first1=George David|title=Ecological Competition Between Algae: Experimental Confirmation of Resource-Based Competition Theory|journal=Science|volume=192|issue=4238|year=1976|pages=463–465|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.192.4238.463|pmid=17731084|bibcode=1976Sci...192..463T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and research==
In an August 2001 interview, Tilman states that his passion with ecology stems from his love for both math and biology, and ecology is a field that allows him to express both together along with his love for the outdoors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.in-cites.com/scientists/dr-david-tilman.html |website=in-cites |title= An Interview with Dr. David Tilman |year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work explores how both natural and managed ecosystems can be used to meet the needs of humans, whether it be for food, energy, or [[ecosystem services]].  Tilman has performed several studies to further determine the usefulness of grasslands for utilization in [[biofuel]].&lt;ref name=googlescholar/&gt;

=== Resource competition===
Tilman is best known for his work on the role of resource [[competition (biology)|competition]] in community structure and on the role of [[biodiversity]] in ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name=resource/&gt;  One of his most cited articles is the 1994 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article on the ''Biodiversity and stability in grasslands'' which provided data regarding an experiment that began in 1982 with more than 200 plots in a grassland field in the [[Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve]] in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=TilmanDowning1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=David|last2=Downing|first2=John A.|title=Biodiversity and stability in grasslands|journal=Nature|volume=367|issue=6461|year=1994|pages=363–365|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/367363a0|bibcode=1994Natur.367..363T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these plots was continuously monitored for 20 years for factors such as [[species richness]] and [[biomass]] created by the community. Tilman’s article looked at data both prior to and following a drought on the grassland plots in 1988, which provided surprising results.  The drought provided substantial [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and the biomass data showed a strong positive [[correlation]] between the plant diversity within the community and the stability of the community as a whole supporting the [[Ecological effects of biodiversity|diversity-stability hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=learner/&gt;

"The level to which the soil solution concentration of a limiting resource is reduced by an equilibrial monoculture of a species is called R*. R* is the resource concentration a species requires for it to be able to persist in a habitat. A comparable concept, that of threshold density, exists for host-microparasite inter-actions. The species with the lowest R* for a limiting soil resource is predicted to be the superior competitor for that resource."&lt;ref name=learner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman|first1=David|title=Constraints and Tradeoffs: Toward a Predictive Theory of Competition and Succession|journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]]|volume=58|issue=1|year=1990|pages=3|issn=00301299|doi=10.2307/3565355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to [[ecological succession|succession]] he focuses on resource ratios, particularly between light and nitrogen. After a big disturbance, the pattern of succession is from high light/low nitrogen towards high nitrogen/low light environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bazzaz|first=F. A.|title=Plants in Changing Environments|year=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=UK|isbn=9 780521 398435|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition and biodiversity===
Another article by Tilman that has received substantial citation{{fact|date=May 2017}} is his 1994 ''[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]'' article that encompasses the idea that large numbers of species can coexist in a small habitat even when they require the same [[limiting nutrient]] (such as nitrogen), as long as there is a tradeoff between the species.  Basically it means that they can coexist because species that are good [[competitors]] are not as good at colonizing or reproducing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1180.pdf | last1 = Tilman | first1 = David | title = Competition and Biodiversity in Spatially Structured Habitats | journal = Ecology | volume = 75 | year = 1994 | pages = 2–16 | doi=10.2307/1939377}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a related paper, Tilman used this model to demonstrate the phenomenon of "[[extinction debt]]," which refers to the time delay between habitat destruction and the extinction of species.&lt;ref name=Tilman1994&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilman | first1 = D. | last2 = May | first2 = R.

===Awards and honors===
In 2014, he received the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category, for scientifically establishing the value of biodiversity, quantifying, for the first time, how it contributes to make ecosystems more productive, more resilient to invasions, and more stable in the face of perturbations such as drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/tlfu/ing/microsites/premios/fronteras/galardonados/2014/ecologia.jsp|title=BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards|website=www.fbbva.es|access-date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a [[Guggenheim Fellow]], is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and is a member of the [[National Academy of Science]].&lt;ref name = PNAS&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=T.H. |title=Biography of David Tilman |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |year=2004 |volume=101 |number=30 |pages=10851–10853 |bibcode=2004PNAS..10110851D |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404605101 |pmid=15263082|pmc=503709}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Tilman was designated the ''Most Highly Cited Environmental Scientist of the Decade'' by Essential Science Indicators.&lt;ref name = PNAS/&gt;

'''Gene targeting''' (also, '''replacement strategy based on homologous recombination''') is a [[genetics|genetic]] technique that uses [[Genetic recombination|homologous recombination]] to modify an [[endogenous]] [[gene]]. The method can be used to delete a gene, remove [[exons]], add a gene and modify individual base pairs (introduce [[point mutations]]). Gene targeting can be permanent or conditional. Conditions can be a specific time during [[Developmental biology|development]] / life of the organism or limitation to a specific [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], for example. Gene targeting requires the creation of a specific [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] for each gene of interest. However, it can be used for any gene, regardless of transcriptional activity or gene size.

== Methods ==
In general, [[DNA]] containing part of the gene to be targeted, a [[reporter gene]], and a (dominant) [[selectable marker]] is assembled in [[bacteria]].

Gene targeting methods are established for several [[model organism]]s and may vary depending on the [[species]] used. To target genes in [[Mus musculus|mice]], the DNA is inserted into mouse [[embryonic stem cell]]s in culture. Cells with the insertion can contribute to a mouse's tissue via [[embryo]] injection. Finally, [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] mice where the modified cells make up the reproductive organs are [[Selective breeding|bred]]. After this step the entire body of the mouse is based on the selected embryonic stem cell.

== Comparison with gene trapping ==
[[Gene trapping]] is based on random insertion of a cassette, while gene targeting manipulates a specific gene. Cassettes can be used for many different things while the flanking homology regions of gene targeting cassettes need to be adapted for each gene. This makes gene trapping more easily amenable for large scale projects than targeting. On the other hand, gene targeting can be used for genes with low transcriptions that would go undetected in a trap screen.  The probability of trapping increases with [[intron]] size, while for gene targeting, small genes are just as easily altered.

== Applications==
Gene targeting has been widely used to study human genetic diseases by removing ("[[Gene knockout|knocking out]]"), or adding ("knocking in"), specific mutations of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applications of Xenografting|date=2017|publisher=Xenograft.net|access-date=15 January 2018|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli|url=http://www.xenograft.net/applications/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously used to engineer rat cell models, advances in gene targeting technologies enable a new wave of [[isogenic human disease models]]. These models are the most accurate [[in vitro]] models available to researchers and facilitate the development of personalized drugs and diagnostics, particularly in [[oncology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sur|first=Surojit|last2=Pagliarini|first2=Raymond|last3=Bunz|first3=Fred|last4=Rago|first4=Carlo|last5=Diaz|first5=Luis A.|last6=Kinzler|first6=Kenneth W.|last7=Vogelstein|first7=Bert|last8=Papadopoulos|first8=Nickolas|date=2009-03-10|title=A panel of isogenic human cancer cells suggests a therapeutic approach for cancers with inactivated p53|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0813333106|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=10|pages=3964–3969|doi=10.1073/pnas.0813333106|pmc=2656188|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.3964S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardware backdoors are intended to undermine security in [[smartcard]]s and other [[cryptoprocessor]]s unless investment is made in anti-backdoor design methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Waksman | first1 = Adam | title = Tamper Evident Microprocessors | volume = | pages = | periodical = Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy | location = Oakland, California | url = http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf | year = 2010 | issn = | doi = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been considered for [[car hacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Craig|title=The Car Hacker's Handbook: A Guide for the Penetration Tester|publisher=No Starch Press|isbn=9781593277031|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao_QCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Severity==
Hardware backdoors are considered highly problematic because:&lt;ref name=ExtremeTech1/&gt;
# They can’t be removed by conventional means such as [[antivirus software]]
# They can circumvent other types of security such as [[disk encryption]]
# They can be injected at manufacturing time where the user has no degree of control

* In June 2016 it was reported that [[University of Michigan]] Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science built a hardware backdoor that leverages "analog circuits to create a hardware attack" so that after the capacitors store up enough electricity to be fully charged, it would be switched on, to give an attacker complete access to whatever system or device − such as a PC − that contains the backdoored chip. In the study that won  the "best paper" award at the IEEE Symposium on Privacy and Security they also note that microscopic hardware backdoor wouldn't be caught by practically any modern method of hardware security analysis, and could be planted by a single employee of a chip factory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=This ‘Demonically Clever’ Backdoor Hides In a Tiny Slice of a Computer Chip|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storm|first1=Darlene|title=Researchers built devious, undetectable hardware-level backdoor in computer chips|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3079417/security/researchers-built-devious-undetectable-hardware-level-backdoor-in-computer-chips.html|publisher=Computerworld|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2016 Skorobogatov showed how he had removed a NAND chip from an [[iPhone 5C]] - the main memory storage system used on many Apple devices - and cloned it so that he can try out more incorrect combinations than allowed by the attempt-counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardware hack defeats iPhone passcode security|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37407047|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 January 2017|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York University Tandon School of Engineering]] researchers have developed a way to corroborate a chip's operation using [[verifiable computing]] whereby "manufactured for sale" chips contain an embedded verification module that proves the chip's calculations are correct and an associated external module validates the embedded verification module.&lt;ref name="techrepublic1"/&gt; Another technique developed by researchers at [[University College London]] (UCL) relies on distributing trust between multiple identical chips from disjoint supply chains.

[[File:Louxor obelisk Paris dsc00780.jpg|thumb|right|80px|The [[Luxor Obelisk]] in [[Place de la Concorde]], [[Paris, France]]]]
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians were one of the first cultures to widely divide days into generally agreed-upon equal parts, using early [[History of timekeeping devices|timekeeping devices]] such as [[sundial]]s, shadow clocks, and merkhets ([[plumb-line]]s used by early astronomers).&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |website=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2008-04-02 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060613/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |archivedate=2008-03-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o8Nb5KLBxVQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA28,M1|title=Time in History: Views of Time from Prehistory to the Present Day|page=28|last=Whitrow|first=G. J.|year=1989|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-285211-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Obelisks are used by reading the shadow that it makes. The citizens could divide the day into two parts, and then into smaller hours.

==Sundials and shadow clocks==
Despite [[Herodotus]]'s attribution of the invention of the sundial to the [[Babylonia]]ns in 430 BCE, the earliest known sundials were simple [[gnomon]]s of Egyptian origin invented around 3500 BCE. More complex devices were developed over time, the earliest surviving one is a limestone sundial that dates back to 1500 BCE, discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 2013.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily_2013_03_14&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130314085052.htm |website= [[Science Daily]] |title= One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt |date= 2013-03-14 |accessdate= 2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in a housing area of construction workers and its division of daytime into 12 parts was possibly used to measure work hours.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily_2013_03_14/&gt; Shadow clocks were modified sundials that allowed for greater precision in determining the time of day, and were first used around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt; Their major innovation was a modified, more precise gnomon that allowed for the division of [[Daytime (astronomy)|night time]] into 50 parts, with an additional two "[[twilight]] hours" in the morning and evening. The shadow clock gnomon was made up of a long stem divided into six parts, as well as an elevated crossbar that cast a shadow over the marks. This early clock was positioned eastward in the morning, while at [[noon]] it was rotated to face west to measure shadows cast by the setting sun.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt; The concept of measured shadows were adapted into larger, more public designs in the form of [[obelisk]]s. Markers around the obelisk would indicate units of time, including morning and afternoon as well as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice]]s for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;

==Merkhets==
Using plumb-lines called "''[[merkhet]]s''", the Egyptians could calculate time at night, provided the stars were visible.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"/&gt; Used since at least 600 BCE, two of these instruments were aligned with [[Polaris]], the North [[pole star]], creating a north-south [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"/&gt; By observing certain [[star]]s as they crossed the line created with the ''merkhets'', they could accurately gauge time.&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"/&gt;

'''Industrial arts''' is an educational program which features fabrication of objects in wood or metal using a variety of hand, power, or machine tools. It may include [[small engine repair]] and [[automobile maintenance]], and all programs usually cover [[technical drawing]] as part of the curricula. As an educational term, ''industrial arts'' dates from 1904 when Charles R. Richards of Teachers College, Columbia University, New York suggested it to replace ''[[manual training]]''.

In the [[U.S.A.|United States]], industrial arts classes are colloquially known as "'''[[Workshop |shop]] class'''"; these programs expose children to the basics of home repair, manual craftsmanship, and machine safety. Most industrial arts programs were established in comprehensive rather than dedicated [[vocational schools]] and focused on a broad range of skills rather than on a specific [[vocational training]]. In 1980, the name of industrial arts education in New York State was changed to "[[technology education]]" during what was called the "Figuring Project". The project goal was to increase students' [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.oswego.edu/technology/history-1/ |title= History {{!}} Department of Technology |last=|first= |date= 2017 |website= www.oswego.edu |at=sec. Technology Education |language= en |archive-url=|archive-date= |dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (VIC, Australia) industrial arts is still a key part of the high school curriculum. The term now describes a key study of [[technology]] that focuses on both engineering and industrial technologies. Additionally, [[design]] using the aforementioned technologies is now a key part of the industrial arts curriculum and has been since the mid-1980s when the subject of technics was introduced into Victorian high schools.

One of the most important aspects of industrial arts is still that while students design they ultimately realize a solution; learning the challenges involved with working with materials and also the challenges of small scale project management.

Some universities have doctoral programs in industrial arts.

==Industrial arts clubs==
An industrial arts club is an organization that promotes the use of industrial fabrication equipment by the general public. Clubs have grown out of the decline of industrial arts (aka shop class) programs in comprehensive school systems in the US.
Clubs began as student organizations in primary and secondary schools offering industrial, the [[TechShop]] and Sparqs Industrial Arts Club based in Massachusetts which grew out of campus activities at [[MIT]].

==Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
Industrial Arts (IA) is an important part of the (NSW) high school curriculum. Industrial Arts syllabi are managed, like all NSW syllabi by the [[Board of Studies]]. In some schools Industrial Arts faculties have become part of a larger Technology faculty, however many schools still have a stand-alone Industrial Arts faculty.

The primary role of Industrial Arts education is to expose students to a variety of industrial and [[engineering]] technologies that improve their understanding of the industrial and engineered world. Moreover, students learn both project management and design principles, most courses are project based with students realizing a solution to a design or engineering challenge. Two key components of the projects are '''synthesis''' of a solution and '''evaluation''' of the final product. Both of these components are the highest order objectives in [[Bloom's Taxonomy]].

===Industrial Arts Curricula in NSW===
Industrial Arts has a single compulsory course for Years 7 and 8: Technology (Mandatory). This course also has area that cover Home Economics concepts and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) content.

For Years 9 and 10 all Industrial Arts courses are electives, the three electives on offer are Design and Technology, Graphics Technology and Industrial Technology. The most popular Industrial Arts elective is Industrial Technology.

*'''Design and Technology''': this course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. Students are given a design challenge and they come up with a solution. Their passage through the design process is documented in a Design Folio. In some schools Design and Technology may not be delivered by the Industrial Arts faculty, in some schools the [[Home Economics]] faculty may run the Design and Technology course.
*'''Graphics Technology''': this course introduces students to both manual (pencil) technical drawing and [[Computer Aided Design]] (CAD). This course has a core study in Year 9 and then a variety of electives for Year 10 including: Engineering Drawing, Architectural Drawing and Computer Animation.
*'''Industrial Technology''': this course may be studied with a variety of different disciplines with the most popular ones being: [[timber]], [[metal]], [[electronics]], [[multimedia]] and [[engineering]]. All have a common theme that students are involved in designing and making projects relevant to the context being studied. For example, a student in Industrial Technology – Multimedia may be asked to design an animation or website advertising a product. The development of their project is documented in their Project Report. A key part of the project report is evaluation of the finished product.

In Years 11 and 12 Industrial Arts offers three [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) non-Vocational courses: Design and Technology, Engineering Studies and Industrial Technology.
*'''Design and Technology''' is an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on design without a prescribed context, so students may work with a variety of non-specified technologies. For their HSC students must create a Major Design Project. Students establish a need and then try to solve it and realise a solution. A key part of the project is evaluation through the design process. The Major Design project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark.
*'''Engineering Studies''' is primarily a theory course that introduces students to the engineered world. The course looks at a variety of engineering applications and fields of engineering. Students learn about engineering history and societal implications, [[engineering mechanics]], [[engineering materials]], engineering electronics and engineering communication methods. The course introduces students to many concepts that they would otherwise first encounter in undergraduate engineering programmes at university.  One of the fundamental aspects of the course is learning engineering through the investigation of real life applications. This builds greater significance and understanding in students.
*'''Industrial Technology''' is also an extension of the junior course of the same name. The course centres on students working within a prescribed technology such as: Timber Products and Furniture Industries, Multimedia Industries Automotive Industries, Electronics Industries, Graphics Industries and Metal and Engineering Industries. For their HSC students must create a Major Project. Students develop a project and document their progress through the project. Hence they learn the vital skills of project management. Similar to Design and Technology evaluation of the project is an important part of the associated documentation.  The Major Project counts for 60% of their final HSC examination mark. The fundamental difference between Industrial Technology and Design and Technology is that a student studying Industrial Technology must study theory relevant to specific technology and also study industry practices relevant to their technology.

==Professional Association for Industrial Arts in New South Wales==
In NSW the professional association for Industrial Arts teachers is the [[Institute of Industrial Arts Technology Education]] ([[IIATE]]). This organisation releases a quarterly journal (on CD) and also runs an annual conference that investigates matters relevant to Industrial Arts education. Moreover, the IIATE represents Industrial Arts teachers in a variety of situations such as syllabus development meetings and teacher training interviews.

Another important role that The IIATE fulfils is that of Professional Learning. The IIATE has run some very successful training days called ''Hands on Technology'' where teachers are able to build their skills and knowledge in a variety of areas. This ''Hands on'' concept has now been extended with the ''Hands on Engineering'' day now being developed to assist teachers in delivering the Industrial Arts' courses Industrial Technology - Engineering and Engineering Studies.

The IIATE has also successfully run training programmes for CAD software which has enable many more teachers to effectively embed CAD into their teaching.

The '''''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences''''', originally edited by [[Neil J. Smelser]] and
[[Paul B. Baltes]], is a 26-volume work published by [[Elsevier]]. It has some 4,000 signed articles (commissioned by around 50 subject editors), and includes 150 biographical entries, 122,400 entries, and an extensive hierarchical subject index. It is also available in online editions. ''Contemporary Psychology'' described the work as "the largest corpus of knowledge about the [[Social Sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]] in existence."{{Attribution needed|date=December 2013}} It was first published in 2001, with a 2nd edition published in 2015. The second edition is edited by [[James D. Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/international-encyclopedia-of-the-social-andampamp-behavioral-sciences/wright/978-0-08-097086-8 |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences 2nd Edition |website=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject Classification==
Contents include the following broad Subject Classification.

'''Overarching Topics''': [[Institutions]] and infrastructure, [[History of the social sciences]] and the behavioral sciences, Ethics of research and applications, Biographies, Integrative concepts and issues

'''Methodology''': [[Statistics]], [[Mathematics]] and [[computer science]]s, [[Inquiry|Logic of inquiry]] and [[research design]].

'''Disciplines''': [[Anthropology]], [[Demography]], [[Economics]], [[Education]], [[History]], [[Linguistics]]. [[Philosophy]], [[Political science]], [[Clinical psychology]] and [[applied psychology]], [[Cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], [[Developmental psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[personality psychology]] and motivational psychology, [[Sociology]]

==Subclassification of articles with an example==
The above Subject Classification is alphabetized with a link for each such general subject at [[ScienceDirect.Com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/referenceworks/9780080430768#ancpt0645 |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences - 9780080430768 |publisher=ScienceDirect.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each such link leads to subclassification links for that subject.   The hierarchical classification of articles for a subject can be used to locate an article.  For example, the Economics link above brings up these subclassification links: 
* Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics
* Financial Economics
* General Methods and Schools
* Industrial Organization and Law and Economics

'''''Let There Be Light: Modern Cosmology and Kabbalah, a New Conversation Between Science and Religion''''' is a book by [[Howard Alan Smith|Howard Smith]], an [[astrophysicist]]. The book, published in 2006, was written for the layperson. It discusses using simple language basic concepts in modern [[cosmology]] and [[Kabbalah]] (a form of Jewish mysticism), the creation of the universe [[Ex nihilo|from nothing]] via the [[big bang]], [[general relativity]], [[dark matter]], cosmic acceleration, [[quantum mechanics]], and [[free will]], among other topics. The book attempts to clearly explains these subjects, and uses them to try to illustrate how religion and science together can enrich one's spiritual and intellectual life.

While [[compass surveying]], the magnetic needle is sometimes disturbed from its normal position under the influence of external attractive forces. Such a disturbing influence is called as '''local attraction'''.&lt;ref&gt;surveying volume 1 by Dr B.c Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. Chapter Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt; The external forces are produced by sources of local attraction which may be current carrying wire (magnetic materials) or [[metal]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by prof. Sk Duggal available on internet from Google books&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to denote amount of deviation of the needle from its normal position. It mostly causes errors in observations while [[surveying]] and thus suitable methods are employed to neglect these errors.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher ,Principal of Mehar chand Polytechnic College, [[Jalandhar]] City, [[Punjab]]/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
The sources of local attraction may be natural or artificial. Natural sources include [[Iron ores]] or magnetic rocks while as artificial sources consist of steel structures, iron pipes, current carrying [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]]. The [[iron]] made [[surveying]] instruments such as metric chains, ranging rods and arrows should also be kept at a safe distance apart from [[compass]].&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Aftab Ahmad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
Local attraction at a place can be detected by observing bearings from both ends of the line in the area. If fore bearing and back bearing of a line differ exactly by 180°, there is no local attraction at either station. But if this difference is not equal to 180°, then local attraction exists there either at one or both ends of the line.&lt;ref&gt;surveying by Prof. Cl Kocher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==
There are two common methods of correcting observed bearings of the lines taken in the area affected by Local Attraction. The first method involves '''correcting the bearing with the help of corrected included angles''' and the second method involves correcting the '''bearing of traverse from one correct bearing''' ( in which difference between fore bearing and back bearing is exactly equal to 180°) by the process of distribution of error to other bearings.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by Dr. Bc Punmia/Compass Surveying&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MS 0735.6+7421''' is a [[galaxy cluster]] located in the [[constellation]] [[Camelopardalis]], approximately 2.6 billion light-years away. It is notable as the location of one of the [[List of most massive black holes|largest central galactic black holes]] in the known universe, which has also apparently produced the most powerful [[active galactic nucleus]] eruption ever discovered since the [[Big Bang]].

== Black hole eruption ==
Using data from the [[Chandra Space Telescope]], scientists have deduced that an eruption has been occurring for the last 100 million years at the heart of the galaxy cluster, releasing as much energy over this time as hundreds of millions of [[gamma ray burst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050106091317.htm Most Powerful Eruption In The Universe Discovered] NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (ScienceDaily) January 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; (The amount of energy released in a year is thus equivalent to several GRBs.) The remnants of the eruption are seen as two cavities on either side of a large central galaxy. If this outburst, with a total energy budget of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; [[joules|J]], was caused by a [[black hole]] accretion event, it must have consumed nearly 600 million solar masses. Work done by Brian McNamara et al. (2008) point out the striking possibility that the outburst was not the result of an accretion event, but was instead powered by the rotation of the black hole. Moreover, the scientists mentioned the possibility that the central black hole in MS 0735.6+7421 could be one of the [[List of most massive black holes|biggest black holes]] inhabiting the visible universe. This speculation is supported by the fact that the central cD Galaxy inside MS 0735.6+7421 possess the largest break radius known, as of today. With a calculated light deficit of more than 20 billion solar luminosities and an assumed light-to-mass ratio of 3, this yields a central black hole mass much above 10 billion solar masses, as far as the break radius was caused by the merger of several black holes in the past. In combination with the gargantuan energy outburst it is therefore very likely that MS 0735.6+7421 hosts a supermassive black hole in its core.
The cluster has a red shift of 64,800 ± 900&amp;nbsp;km/[[second|s]] and an apparent size of 25&amp;prime;.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Media literacy''' encompasses the practices that allow people to access, critically evaluate, and create [[Media (communication)|media]]. Media literacy is not restricted to one medium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=W. James|date=2010-11-30|title=The State of Media Literacy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08838151.2011.521462|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|volume=54|issue=4|pages=675–696|doi=10.1080/08838151.2011.521462|issn=0883-8151}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore has had several different attempts to have a specific definition over the years. Media literacy definitions have been defined based on general skills pertinent to all media or definitions relating to specific mean forms of media. The US-based [[National Association for Media Literacy Education]] defines it as a series of communication competencies with the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and communicate in a variety of forms which can be print or non-print messages. They find that media literacy allows people to be critical thinkers and creative in many messages like image, language, and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Leaning|first=Marcus|title=Integrating Media and Information Literacy|date=2017|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-100170-7.00001-9|work=Media and Information Literacy|pages=3–14|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780081001707|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are '''four''' important skills that help the viewer or reader understand the meaning of media literacy: 

* Accessing media
* Analyzing content
* Being able to evaluate messages
* Being able to create media for self-expression and communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Media literacy typically lends itself to a deeper meaning and analysis of the work, not necessarily just a direct understanding of fact represented in the work. Media Literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create media in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medialit.org/media-literacy-definition-and-more|title=https://www.medialit.org/media-literacy-definition-and-more|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy also concerns the ability to identify when there is a problem that impacts [[democracy]], thus allowing the public to generate its own opinion, which can influence society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-white/media-literacy_b_3808886.html|title=Media Literacy: Learning Not to Hate the News|last=White|first=Thomas|date=2013|website=Huff Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy education for children and youth is intended to promote awareness of media influence and create an active stance towards both consuming and creating media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/704121171|title=Digital and media literacy : connecting culture and classroom|last=Renee.|first=Hobbs,|date=2011|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn=9781412981583|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=704121171}}&lt;/ref&gt; By teaching children to have a critical eye toward media, they learn how to interpret information and communicate more efficiently, which may impact their everyday lives. Media literacy education is part of the curriculum in the United States and some European Union countries, and an interdisciplinary global community of media literacy scholars and educators engages in knowledge sharing through scholarly and professional journals and national membership associations. In some countries and locations, however, teachers lack appropriate qualifications and the application of best practices is deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Supsakova|first1=Bozena|title=Media Education of Children a Youth as a Path to Media Literacy|journal=ProQuest|date=April 2016|volume=7|issue=1 |url=https://search-proquest-com.proxyau.wrlc.org/docview/1785832718?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=8285}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=60&amp;v=GIaRw5R6Da4]

==Education==
The terms 'media literacy' and 'media education' are used synonymously in most English-speaking nations. Many scholars and educators consider media literacy to be an expanded conceptualization of literacy. In 1993, a gathering of the media literacy community in the United States developed a definition of media literacy as the ability of a citizen to access, analyze, and produce information for specific outcomes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aufderheide|first=Patricia|date=1993|title=Media Literacy|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED365294|journal=Aspen Inst.|volume=|pages=44|via=ERIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy has a long history and over the years a number of different terms have been used to capture the skills, competencies, knowledge and habits of mind that are required for full participation in media-saturated societies. In England, the term "media education" is used to define the process of teaching and learning about [[media (communication)|media]].&lt;ref name=Buckingham&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckingham|first=David|title=Media education : literacy, learning and contemporary culture|year=2007|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge [u.a]|isbn=0745628303|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is about developing people's critical and creative abilities when it comes to mass media, popular culture and digital media. Media education is the process and media literacy is the outcome, but neither term should be confused with educational technology or with educational media. When people understand media and technology, they are able to access, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a wide variety of media, genres, and forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romero-Martín|first=Rosario|last2=Castejón-Oliva|first2=Francisco-Javier|last3=López-Pastor|first3=Víctor-Manuel|last4=Fraile-Aranda|first4=Antonio|date=2017|title=Formative assessment, communication skills and ICT in Initial Teacher Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-07|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=73–82|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-07|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education for media literacy often uses an inquiry-based pedagogic model that encourages people to ask questions about what they watch, hear, and read.  Media literacy education provides tools to help people critically analyze messages, offers opportunities for learners to broaden their experience of media, and helps them develop creative skills in making their own media messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromedialiteracy.eu/ The European Charter for Media Literacy]. Euromedialiteracy.eu. Retrieved on 2011-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical analyses can include identifying author, purpose and point of view, examining construction techniques and genres, examining patterns of media representation, and detecting [[propaganda]], [[censorship]], and [[media bias|bias]] in news and public affairs programming (and the reasons for these). Media literacy education may explore how structural features—such as [[media ownership]], or its funding model&lt;ref&gt;See [[Corporate media]] and [[Public service broadcasting]]&lt;/ref&gt;—affect the information presented.

In North America and Europe, media literacy includes both empowerment and protectionist perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobbs|first1=Renee|title=Empowerment and protection: Complementary strategies for digital and media literacy in the United States|journal=Formare|date=2010|pages=1–17|url=http://works.bepress.com/reneehobbs/11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media literate people should be able to skillfully create and produce media messages, both to show understanding of the specific qualities of each medium, as well as to create [[citizen media|independent media]] and participate as active citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Citizen media|date=2018-09-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citizen_media&amp;oldid=859043031|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy can be seen as contributing to an expanded conceptualization of literacy, treating mass media, popular culture and digital media as new types of 'texts' that require analysis and evaluation. By transforming the process of [[media consumption]] into an active and critical process, people gain greater awareness of the potential for misrepresentation and manipulation (especially through [[commercials]] and [[public relations]] techniques), and understand the role of mass media and participatory media in constructing views of reality.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Media Literacy Resource Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy education is sometimes conceptualized as a way to address the negative dimensions of [[mass media]], [[Pop culture|popular culture]] and [[digital media]], including [[media violence]], [[Gender stereotypes|gender]] and [[racial stereotypes]], the [[sexualization]] of children, and concerns about [[Identity theft|loss of privacy]], [[cyberbullying]] and [[Internet predator]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By building knowledge and competencies in using media and technology, media literacy education may provide a type of protection to children and young people by helping them make good choices in their media consumption habits, and patterns of usage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Frau-Meigs, D. 2008. Media education: Crossing a mental rubicon." It will also benefit generations to come in order to function in a technological and media filled world.

Goteborg University, Sweden: The International Clearinghouse on Children, Youth and Media, Nordicom in cooperation with UNESCO, Dar Graphit and Mentor Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical concepts for media literacy education===
A variety of scholars have proposed theoretical frameworks for media literacy. Renee Hobbs identifies three frames for introducing media literacy to learners: authors and audiences (AA), messages and meanings (MM), and representation and reality (RR). In synthesizing the literature from media literacy, information literacy, visual literacy and new literacies, she identifies these core ideas that form the theoretical context for media literacy.
&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2006) Multiple visions of multimedia literacy: Emerging areas of synthesis. In Handbook of literacy and technology, Volume II. International Reading Association. Michael McKenna, Linda Labbo, Ron Kieffer and David Reinking, Editors. Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (pp. 15 -28)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Buckingham (academic)|David Buckingham]] has come up with four key concepts that "provide a theoretical framework which can be applied to the whole range of contemporary media and to 'older' media as well: Production, Language, Representation, and Audience."&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt; These concepts are defined as follows:

====Production====

Media texts are consciously made.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt; Some are made by individuals working alone, just for themselves or their family and friends, but most are produced and distributed by groups of people often for commercial profit. Economic interests and the generation of profit are often at stake in media production.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt;

====Representation====

The notion of 'representation' is one of the first established principles of media education. Media offers viewers a facilitated outlook of the world and a re-representation of reality. Media production involves selecting and combining incidents, making events into stories, and creating characters. Media representations allow viewers to see the world in some particular ways and not others. Audiences also compare media with their own experiences and make judgements about how realistic they are. Media representations can be seen as real in some ways but not in others: viewers may understand that what they are seeing is only imaginary and yet they still know it can explain reality.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt;

====Audience====

Studying audiences means looking at how demographic audiences are targeted and measured, and how media are circulated and distributed throughout. It looks at different ways in which individuals use, interpret, and respond to media. The media increasingly have had to compete for people's attention and interest because research has shown that audiences are now much more sophisticated and diverse than has been suggested in the past decades. Debating views about audiences and attempting to understand and reflect on our own and others' use of media is, therefore, a crucial element of media education.&lt;ref name="Buckingham"/&gt;

To elaborate on the concepts presented by David Buckingham, Henry Jenkins discusses the emergence of a participatory culture, in which our students are actively engaged.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Henry|title=Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century|date=2009|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of this participatory culture, schools must focus on what Jenkins calls the "new media literacies", that is a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need in the new media landscape.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt; In the new media literacies we see a shift in focus from individual expression to community involvement, involving the development of social skills through collaboration and networking.&lt;ref name=Jenkins /&gt;

Jeff Share (2002) has categorized the different approaches to media education to fit into 4 different areas. These are the protectionist approach, media arts education, media literacy movement, and critical media literacy (of which he is an advocate). The protectionist approach views audiences of mass media as dupes of the media, vulnerable to cultural, ideological or moral influences, and needing protection by education. The media arts education approach focuses on creative production of different media forms by learners. The media literacy movement is an attempt to bring traditional aspects of literacy from the educational sphere and apply it to media.

===Empowerment and protection approaches===
Empowerment and protection are complementary strategies for media literacy education and are fundamentally linked together.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2010). Empowerment and protection: Complementary strategies for digital and media literacy education in the United States. Formare, 70. 1 – 17. Rome, Italy. http://formare.erickson.it/wordpress/en/2010/empowerment-e-protezione-strategiecomplementari-per-la-digital-e-media-literacy-negli-stati-uniti/&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1930s, media literacy educators recognized the need to increase appreciation for quality media content. Edgar Dale's film appreciation movement embodies the concept of empowerment, helping a generation of students learn how to critically analyze film in the context of English education. By the 1970s, awareness of the impact of media influence on children's behavior increased the focus on building students' awareness of the impact of media violence, including concepts like desensitization, to help students recognize and resist the messages that make violence look heroic, justified and appealing. The Center for Media Literacy's MediaLit Kit (TM) embodies the values of the "empowerment through education" approach to media literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medialit.org/sites/default/files/11_CMLEducPhil.pdf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Center for Media Literacy Empowerment Through Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Common Sense Media's media literacy curriculum, which emphasizes internet safety, information literacy, cyberbullying and digital drama, creative credit and copyright, self-image and identity, privacy and security, digital footprint and reputation balances the empowerment and protection approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/scope-and-sequence Scope &amp; Sequence: Common Sense K-12 Digital Citizenship Curriculum | Common Sense Media&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media arts education===
An arts-based approach to media education falls into related but distinct traditions. A longstanding emphasis is associated with traditions of film education, which typically place a central focus on film as an art-form, on its aesthetic and cultural value, and on the creative processes of young people's film-making. A study commissioned by the [[European Commission]], led by the [[British Film Institute]], shows how these values are generally supported across European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, M, Burn, A, Wall, I (2013) Screening Literacy. London: bfi&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of such support by educators, however, the study shows that most European countries allocate few resources or curriculum emphasis to film education. More generally, a media arts approach has been developed as a cross-curricular model, most conspicuously in a group of UK schools adopting the UK government's 1997 option to specialize in media arts, an approach documented by [[Andrew Burn (professor)|Andrew Burn]] and James Durran.&lt;ref&gt;Burn, A and Durran, J (2007) ''Media Literacy in Schools''. London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; This account exemplifies how creative production work in media art forms such as comicstrip, animation, television, film and videogames promotes the cultural, critical and creative aspects of media literacy. It also models the use of the media arts beyond the literacy curriculum, in subjects such as Geography and Science.  Meanwhile, a third strand of media arts work foregrounds the digital aspect of contemporary media arts, associating creative media production with programming and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;Peppler, K (2010) 'Media Arts: Arts Education for a Digital Age' ''Teachers' College Record'', Volume 112, Number 8, August 2010, pp 2118-2153.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the classroom, students are encouraged to understand the value of the arts while using creativity to express themselves through creating their own art. Incorporating the arts into a students public education can lead to students becoming more engaged, hands-on and motivated to express themselves freely. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|last2=Share|first2=Jeff|date=January 2007|title=Critical Media Literacy: Crucial Policy Choices for a Twenty-First-Century Democracy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2304/pfie.2007.5.1.59|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=5|issue=1|pages=59–69|doi=10.2304/pfie.2007.5.1.59|issn=1478-2103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical media literacy===

Critical media literacy is defined originally by [[Douglas Kellner]] and Share in "Critical Media Literacy is Not an Option", as "an educational response that expands the notion of literacy to include different forms of mass communication, popular culture, and new technologies. It deepens the potential of literacy education to critically analyze relationships between media and audiences, information, and power. Along with this mainstream analysis, alternative media production empowers students to create their own messages that can challenge media texts and narratives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellner, Share|first1=Douglas, Jeff|title=Critical media literacy is not an option|date=2007|doi=10.1007/s11519-007-0004-2|url=https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/2007_Kellner-Share_CML-is-not-Option.pdf|volume=1|journal=Learning Inquiry|pages=59–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Critical media literacy aims to analyze and understand the power structures that lay within the media and understand the underpinnings of the politics that go into representation of gender, race, class and sexuality in the media. This approach is different than "media literacy" because it critically works to understand that there are dominant power structures that audiences work to make meaning between the dominant, oppositional and negotiated readings of media.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Within society, there are many different ideologies operating in media culture at any given time. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] argues that ideologies exist in every aspect of life and are not separate and isolated. Ideologies are understood by the individual but created collectively. Critical media literacy examines ideologies that govern social institutions, government, and lived lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=The Whites of Their Eyes, Racist Ideologies and the Media|date=1995|pages=2–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The benefit of a critical media literacy approach is that audiences engage with and analyze dominant readings and codes within media and contribute to a better understanding of the world's "social realities".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Instead of taking a mediated image at face value, the reader can understand the history and the characteristics of the image and make meaning in various ways.

People often use the skills of critical media literacy without even noticing while watching television, using social media, reading books, listening to music, etc.. Critical media literacy allows people to interpret the messages conveyed onscreen and apply them to their lives. By using this strategy, critical media literacy contribute to social change and activism. As stated by Douglas Kellner in ''Cultural Studies, Multiculturalism, and Media Culture'', "The gaining of critical media literacy is an important resource for individuals and citizens in learning how to cope with a seductive cultural environment. Learning how to read, criticize, and resist sociocultural manipulation can help one empower oneself in relation to dominant forms of media and culture."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellner|first1=Douglas|title=Cultural Studies, Multiculturalism, and Media Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple different ways that individuals can analyze, interpret, and evaluate media texts, specifically critical visual analysis and audience research. Critical visual analysis is different than visual analysis because of its interdisciplinary way of critical analyzing the frame of reference of a visual artifact and the power structures that are embedded in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schroeder|first1=Jonathan E.|title=Critical visual Analysis|date=2006|pages=303–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a great way to utilize critical media literacy in the classroom.  As for an example of audience research, Kellner says "Fandoms of all sorts, from Star Trek fans ("Trekkies"/"Trekkers") to devotees of various soap operas, reality shows, or current highly popular TV series, also form communities that enable them to relate to others who share their interests and hobbies."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Audience reception is important within critical media literacy because it offers the understanding that the audience will take in various forms of media and make meaning of them. A viewer is different than the audience because a viewer is just an individual who makes meaning, where the audience is a collective whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturken and Cartwright|title=The Practices of Looking|pages=Ch. 2: Viewers Make Meaning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences comes into play when one does research using the skills of critical media literacy. In order to understand a piece of media it is absolutely essential to make meaning of the audience and ask questions of who is this targeted at, focused on, and who is viewing it.

===Media Literacy as an intervention method===

Proponents of media literacy education argue that the inclusion of media literacy into school curriculum promotes civic engagement, increases awareness of the power structures inherent in popular media and aids students in gaining the necessary critical and inquiry skills needed in today's society. Educators have argued for decades that teaching media literacy in the classroom is crucial in shaping critical thinkers, well-informed citizens and conscientious consumers in order to be aware about the risks present in the constant use of media and Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Core principles of media literacy education in the United States|url=https://namle.net/publications/core-principles|website=National Association for Media Literacy Education|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramos-Soler|first=Irene|last2=López-Sánchez|first2=Carmen|last3=Torrecillas-Lacave|first3=Teresa|date=2018-07-01|title=Online risk perception in young people and its effects on digital behaviour|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C56-2018-07|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-07|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing body of research focusing on the impacts of media literacy on students. In an important meta-analysis of more than 50 studies published in the Journal of Communication, media literacy interventions were found to have positive effects on knowledge, criticism, perceived realism, influence, behavioral beliefs, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeong | first1 = S.-H. | last2 = Cho | first2 = H. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = Y. | year = 2012 | title = Media Literacy Interventions: A Meta-Analytic Review | url = http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01643.x | journal = The Journal of Communication | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 454–472 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01643.x| pmc = 3377317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital age has made it easy for anyone to create media. We don't always know who created something, why they made it, and whether it's credible. This makes media literacy tricky to learn and teach. Nonetheless, media literacy is an essential skill in the digital age. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/news-and-media-literacy/what-is-media-literacy-and-why-is-it-important|title=What is media literacy, and why is it important?|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====As student-health interventions====
Critical thinking skills that are the basis of media literacy education are utilized to decrease substance abuse in adolescents. A correlative study evaluated the relationship between skills commonly taught in media literacy programs. This study examined the ability to critically deconstruct media messages and adolescent's intent to use substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scull|first1=T.M.|last2=Kupersmidt|first2=J.B.|last3=Elmore|first3=K.C.|last4=Benson|first4=J.W.|title=Adolescents' media-related cognitions and substance use in the context of parental and peer influences|journal=Adolescents' media-related cognitions and substance use in the context of parental and peer influences|date=2010|volume=39|issue=9|pages=981–98|doi=10.1007/s10964-009-9455-3|pmc=3678372}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students who were better able to critically examine and decode media messages reported that they were less likely to use drugs and alcohol in the future. The findings suggest, based on youth exposure to substances in the media, that media literacy programs may be a valuable tool for preventing harmful adolescent health behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkin|first1=C.|last2=Hocking|first2=J.|last3=Block|first3=M.|title=Teenage Drinking: Does Advertising Make a Difference?|journal=Journal of Communication|date=1984|volume=34|issue=2|pages=157–67|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy education is a tool to combat [[childhood obesity]] and promote healthy consumer habits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liao|first1=L.|last2=Lai|first2=I.|last3=Chang|first3=L.|last4=Lee|first4=C.|title=Effects of a food advertising literacy intervention on Taiwanese children's food purchasing behaviors|journal=Health Education Research|date=2016|volume=31|issue=4|pages=509–520|doi=10.1093/her/cyw025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

140 fifth-grade Taiwanese students participated in a study examining the effects of a food advertising literacy program on food purchasing habits. The media literacy program introduced marketing strategies surrounding food advertisements, teaching students to evaluate the nutritional value of advertised foods and promote healthy food among their peers using learned marketing strategies. The study found that students who had completed the food literacy program showed significantly greater improvements in nutritional food knowledge, food purchasing behavior and food advertising literacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; However, after a 1-month follow up students showed a decrease in the above-mentioned categories.

====As sexual health education====
Media literacy programs can be used as a sexual health promotion. These programs allow people to be actively involved as they use media and technology as a source of information. Digital technology has become a part of millennials everyday lives. With this form of access to the internet, millennials have a larger pool of information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.craftinc.org/literacy-e-books/teaching-and-reaching-the-millennial-generation-through-media-literacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A Journal of Media Literacy Education study found that using MLE, adolescents could gather and learn information regarding sexual health as well as media literacy (e.g., how to make safe-sex decisions and how to improve media skills).&lt;ref&gt;"A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health" (Volume 6: issue 1). 2014: 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Media literacy programs apply to HIV prevention. MLE allows people to learn valuable skills to understand and detect the falsity of information found in the media about HIV, decreasing the risks and spread of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4943655/&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a violence-prevention strategy====
Media literacy programs can be a violence-prevention strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of a school-based violence prevention media literacy curriculum: http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/Injury%20Prevention%20Journal%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a major longitudinal study conducted by UCLA with more than 2,000 Southern California middle school students found that introducing a curriculum aimed at deconstructing violence in the media resulted in increased student knowledge acquisition regarding media literacy and effects of violent media on individuals and society, changed attitudes toward media violence, as well as playground behaviors and media usage. The study used a self-report survey to compare participant's knowledge and attitudes surrounding violence pre-intervention and post-intervention. The study not only evaluated the curriculum, Beyond Blame: Challenging Violence in the Media, but also the Center for Media Literacy's frameworks for addressing media-related themes and topics.

====As gender stereotype intervention====
A recent study examines the effects of a media literacy program geared at exploring gender stereotypes expressed in the media on middle school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puchner|first1=L.|last2=Markowitz|first2=L.|last3=Hedley|first3=M.|title=Critical Media Literacy and Gender: Teaching Middle School Children about Gender Stereotypes and Occupations|journal=Critical Media Literacy and Gender: Teaching Middle School Children about Gender Stereotypes and Occupations|date=2015|volume=7|issue=2|pages=23–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research measured the extent to which participants learned to be critical consumers of media, especially in regards to stereotypical portrayals of men and women. Results were gathered through student surveys administered pre-intervention and post-intervention and concluded that participants who received the intervention were more likely to believe that the media influences the way people think about men and women and that the media reinforces gender stereotypes in regards to occupation.

====Promoting positive body image====
Media literacy can be an effective tool for addressing issues surrounding women's body image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=K.L.|last2=Alexander|first2=S.M.|title=Media Literacy as an Educational Method for Addressing College Women's Body Image Issues|journal=Education|date=2007|volume=127|issue=4|pages=490–497}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted among female college students, participants were shown a 25-minute video that exposes how the advertising industry influences female body image, particularly the messages that certain media texts are sending to viewers about how an ideal woman should look. The study found that participants who watched the video reported greater satisfaction with their body, meaning the difference between their perceived body type and their ideal body type was much smaller compared to those who did not watch the video.

The above studies used self-report post-treatment surveys in order to gather their data. The limitations of this measure are that data collected about student behavior and experience is self-reported and can easily be distorted. Participants can exaggerate their responses, claiming that the media literacy lessons were more impactful than they actually were.

There is a wealth of research regarding youth exposure to media in all its forms. There are numerous articles seeking to explore the consequences of such exposure on adolescent behavior, but there are surprisingly few studies that explore the efficacy of certain tools that can be used to combat the harmful consequences of media exposure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  Media literacy education is purported to lessen the negative impacts of media exposure, but precious few studies have been conducted to prove the statement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=T.|last2=Martin|first2=K.|last3=Afifi|first3=A.A|last4=Kraus|first4=J.|title=Media Literacy as a Violence-Prevention Strategy: A Pilot Evaluation|journal=Health Promotion Practice|date=2010|volume=11|issue=5|page=2|doi=10.1177/1524839908328998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps further evidence demonstrating the benefits of media literacy as an intervention would encourage more educators to embrace the practice and incorporate programs into the classroom.

===UNESCO questionnaire===

In 2001, a media education survey by UNESCO investigated  which countries were incorporating media studies into different schools' curricula, as well as to help develop new initiatives in the field of media education. A questionnaire was sent to a total of 72 experts on media education in 52 different countries around the world. The people who received this questionnaire were people involved in academics (such as teachers), policymakers, and educational advisers. The questionnaire addressed three key areas:

# "Media education in schools: the extent, aims, and conceptual basis of current provision; the nature of assessment; and the role of production by students."&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|last=Domaille, Buckingham|first=Kate, David|title=Where Are We Going and How Can We Get there?|url=http://www.ccsonline.org.uk/mediacentre/Research_Projects/unesco_survey.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030507074850/http://www.ccsonline.org.uk/mediacentre/Research_Projects/unesco_survey.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-05-07|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Partnerships: the involvement of media industries and media regulators in media education; the role of informal youth groups; the provision of teacher education."&lt;ref name=UNESCO2&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Media Literacy|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27056&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150114214920/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27056&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-14|accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The development of media education: research and evaluation of media education provision; the main needs of educators; obstacles to future development; and the potential contribution of UNESCO."&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"/&gt;

The results from the answers to the survey were double-sided. It was noted that media education had been making a very uneven progress because while in one country there was an abundant amount of work towards media education, another country may have hardly even heard of the concept. Media education has not taken a full swing in some countries due to the lack of policymakers addressing the issue. In some developing countries, educators say that media education was only just beginning to register as a concern because they were just starting to develop basic print literacy.&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"/&gt;

In the countries where media education existed at all, it would be offered as an elective class or an optional area of the school system rather than being on its own. Many countries argued that media education should not be a separate part of the curriculum but rather should be added to a subject already established. The countries which deemed media education as a part of the curriculum included the United States, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Australia. Many countries lacked even just basic research on media education as a topic, including Russia and Sweden. Some said that popular culture is not worthy enough of study. But all of the correspondents realized the importance of media education as well as the importance of formal recognition from their government and policymakers that media education should be taught in schools.&lt;ref name="UNESCO2"/&gt;

==History==
Media literacy education is actively focused on the instructional methods and pedagogy of media literacy, integrating theoretical and critical frameworks rising from constructivist learning theory, media studies, and cultural studies scholarship. This work has arisen from a legacy of media and technology use in education throughout the 20th century and the emergence of cross-disciplinary work at the intersections of scholarly work in media studies and education. The Voices of Media Literacy was a project through the Center for Media Literacy sponsored by Tessa Jolls. It included first-person interviews with 20 media literacy pioneers active prior to the 1990s in English-speaking countries. The project provided historical context for the rise of media literacy from individuals who helped influenced the field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medialit.org/voices-media-literacy-international-pioneers-speak|title=http://www.medialit.org/voices-media-literacy-international-pioneers-speak|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Media education is developing in [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], with a growing interest in the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[India]], [[Russia]] and among many other nations.

===United Kingdom===
Education, for what is now termed media literacy, has been developing in the UK since at least the 1930s. In the 1960s, there was a [[paradigm shift]] in the field of media literacy to emphasize working within popular culture rather than trying to convince people that popular culture was primarily destructive. This was known as the popular arts paradigm.  In the 1970s, there came a recognition that the ideological power of the media was tied to the naturalization of the image. Forged messages were being passed off as natural ones.  The focus of media literacy also shifted to the consumption of images and representations, also known as the representational paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=4441&amp;4441_0=4987 Buckingham, David] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910000111/http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=4441&amp;4441_0=4987 |date=2005-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Development has gathered pace since the 1970s when the first formal courses in [[Film studies|Film Studies]] and, later, [[Media studies|Media Studies]], were established as options for young people in the 14-19 age range: over 100,000 students (about 5% of this age range) now take these courses annually. Scotland has always had a separate education system from the rest of the UK and began to develop policies for media education in the 1980s. In England, the creation of the National Curriculum in 1990 included some limited requirements for teaching about the media as part of English. In Scotland, teachers are represented by the professional association AMES (Association of Media Educators, Scotland); while in England the MEA (Media Education Association) fulfills this purpose.

The UK is widely regarded as a leader in the development of education for media literacy. Key agencies that have been involved in this development include the British Film Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/ Education]. BFI (2010-11-03).

The ‘promotion' of media literacy also became a UK Government policy under New Labour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Richard|last2=Buckingham|first2=David|date=2013-10-01|title=Arming the citizen-consumer: The invention of ‘media literacy’ within UK communications policy|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0267323113483605|journal=European Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=527–540|doi=10.1177/0267323113483605|issn=0267-3231}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and was enshrined in the [[Communications Act 2003]] as a responsibility of the new media regulator, [[Ofcom]].  After an initial burst of activity, however, Ofcom’s work in this regard was progressively reduced in scope, and from the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government]] onwards, the promotion of media literacy was reduced to a matter of market research – what Wallis &amp; Buckingham have described as an ‘undead' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Richard|last2=Buckingham|first2=David|date=2016-09-12|title=Media literacy: the UK’s undead cultural policy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10286632.2016.1229314|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|language=en|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10286632.2016.1229314|issn=1028-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eighteen key media literacy stakeholders were identified in the UK.ten of these stakeholders are categorized as ‘Civil Society’, when four are categorized as ‘Public Authorities’. Two stakeholders are categorized as ‘Academia’, when the sectors of ‘Media Regulatory Authorities’ and ‘Audiovisual Content Providers’ account for one key media literacy stakeholder each. Two main stakeholders in the UK have a duty in relation to media literacy. The development of media literacy is a duty placed on Ofcom by Section 11 of the Communications Act 2003. Also, Under its new Charter, the principal Public Service Broadcaster, the BBC, has a duty to enhance media literacy&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/media-literacy-mapping-report-en-final-pdf/1680783500&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Australia===
In Australia, media education was influenced by developments in Britain related to the inoculation, popular arts, and demystification approaches.  Key theorists who influenced Australian media education were [[Graeme Turner]] and [[John Hartley (academic)|John Hartley]] who helped develop Australian media and cultural studies.  During the 1980s and 1990s, Western Australians [[Robyn Quin]] and [[Barrie MacMahon]] wrote seminal textbooks such as ''Real Images'', translating many complex media theories into classroom appropriate learning frameworks. In most Australian states, media is one of five strands of the Arts Key Learning Area and includes "essential learnings" or "outcomes" listed for various stages of development.  At the senior level (years 11 and 12), several states offer Media Studies as an elective.  For example, many Queensland schools offer Film, Television and New Media, while Victorian schools offer VCE Media. Media education is supported by the teacher professional association [[Australian Teachers of Media]]. With the introduction of a new Australian National Curriculum, schools are beginning to implement media education as part of the arts curriculum, using media literacy as a means to educate students how to deconstruct, construct and identify themes in media.

===Africa===
In [[South Africa]], the increasing demand for Media Education has evolved from the dismantling of apartheid and the 1994 democratic elections. The first national Media Education conference in South Africa was actually held in 1990 and the new national curriculum has been in the writing stages since 1997.  Since this curriculum strives to reflect the values and principles of a democratic society there seems to be an opportunity for critical literacy and Media Education in Languages and Culture courses.

Professor Ralph A. Akinfeleye, Ph.D,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arsrc.org/downloads/sim/sexuality_in_the_media.pdf], Sexuality in the Media by Professor Ralph A. Akinfeleye, Ph.D&lt;/ref&gt; points out that there have been many strides taken to use media to educate and expose South Africans to sexuality.  This new openness has led to more sex scenes in movies, a boost in sales for the pornography industry, and an increase in sex shops. Although many newspapers are attempting to shed light on important issues related to sexuality, such as women's sexual rights, many people in South Africa are still hesitant to the media openness. One of the main issues that critics point out with the openness to sexuality in the media is the presentation of scholarly articles related to sexuality in print media next to pictures of women dressed scandalously trying to sell something, and how this sends mixed signals about sexuality to viewers. In addition, South Africa is faced with trying to balance its newfound popularity of sex with providing a safe environment that does not spread HIV/AIDS and sexual violence, two issues that South Africa has been plagued with in the past. Although there are issues that South Africa is facing in the adjustment to this new openness of sexuality in the media, the steps being taken to educate the public about issues with sexuality in South Africa is a huge move towards Media Education.

===Europe===
In areas of Europe, media education has seen many different forms. Media education was introduced into the Finnish elementary curriculum in 1970 and into high schools in 1977.  But the media education we know today did not evolve in [[Finland]] until the 1990s. Media education has been compulsory in [[Sweden]] since 1980 and in [[Denmark]] since 1970. In both these countries, media education evolved in the 1980s and 1990s as media education gradually moved away from moralizing attitudes towards an approach that is more searching and pupil-centered. In 1994, the Danish education bill gave recognition to media education but it is still not an integrated part of the school.  The focus in Denmark seems to be on information technology.

[[France]] has taught film from the inception of the medium, but it has only been recently that conferences and media courses for teachers have been organized with the inclusion of media production. [[Germany]] saw theoretical publications on media literacy in the 1970s and 1980s, with a growing interest for media education inside and outside the educational system in the 80s and 90s. In the Netherlands media literacy was placed in the agenda by the Dutch government in 2006 as an important subject for the Dutch society. In April, 2008, an official center has been created (mediawijsheid expertisecentrum = medialiteracy expertisecenter) by the Dutch government. This center is more a network organization existing out of different partners who have their own expertise with the subject of media education. The idea is that media education will become a part of the official curriculum.

The history of [[Media studies|media education]] in [[Russia]] goes back to the 1920s. The first attempts to instruct in media education (on the press and film materials, with the vigorous emphasis on the communist ideology) appeared in the 1920s but were stopped by [[Joseph Stalin]]’s repressions.  The end of the 1950s - the beginning of the 1960s was the time of the revival of media education in secondary schools, universities, after-school children centers ([[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Voronezh]], [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], [[Tver]], [[Rostov on Don]], [[Taganrog]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Ekaterinburg]], etc.), the revival of media education seminars and conferences for the teachers. During the time when the intensive rethinking of media education approaches was on the upgrade in the Western hemisphere, in Russia of the 1970s–1980s media education was still developing within the aesthetic concept. Among the important achievements of 1970s-1990s one can recall the first official programs of film and media education, published by Ministry of Education, increasing interest of Ph.D. to media education,  experimental theoretic and practical work on media education by O.Baranov (Tver), S.Penzin (Voronezh), G.Polichko, U.Rabinovich (Kurgan), Y.Usov (Moscow), [[Alexander Victorovich Fedorov|Alexander Fedorov]] (Taganrog), A.Sharikov (Moscow) and others. The important events in media education development in [[Russia]] are the registration of the new specialization (since 2002) for the pedagogical universities – ‘Media Education’ (№ 03.13.30), and the launch of a new academic journal ‘Media Education’ (since January 2005), partly sponsored by the ICOS [[UNESCO]] ‘Information for All’. Additionally, the Internet sites of Russian Association for Film and Media Education 
(English and Russian versions) were created. Taking into account the fact that UNESCO defines media education as the priority field of the cultural educational development in the 21st century, media literacy has good prospects in Russia.

Montenegro became one of the few countries in the world that have introduced media education into their curriculums, when in 2009 “media literacy” was introduced as an optional subject for 16 and 17 year old students of Gymnasium high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perovic |first1=Jelena |title=Media Literacy in Montenegro |journal=Media and Communication |volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.17645/mac.v3i4.335 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ukraine, media education has been developed according to the Conception of implementing media education Ukraine since its approval in 2010 in the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences. Nowdays its implementaton is on the second stage (2017–2020) of its gradual establishing and standardization in education. There are main centres of media education in Ukraine aimed at its development thanks to relevant scientists such as Ivan Franko University of Lviv (Boris Potyatinnik), Institute of Higher Education of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Hanna Onkovych), Institute of Social and Political Psychology of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine (Lyubov Naidyonova). Besides, there are other institutions which make a contribution to developing media education including the Academy of Ukrainian Press and some of Ukrainian universities where journalists are mostly trained. As a result of activities of these centres and organizations websites were created including the following ones: 1) http://medialiteracy.org.ua founded in 2013 on the basis of the library of the Academy of Ukrainian Press which is an online interactive platform for communication of media educators; 2)  http://mediaosvita.org.ua/pro-nas founded by the Institute of Social and Political Psychology of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine, and aimed at solving problems of media psychology and media education; 3) http://osvita.mediasapiens.ua founded in 2010 by Detector Media (a non-government organization), and  aimed at educating media consumers; 4) http://mediadriver.online is another project of Detector Media which is a multimedia manual with texts, photos, video, and even cartoons about advantages and disadvantages including non-safety of media and aimed at forming media culture of media consumers. There are also other websites devoted to the development of mass media in Ukraine (Media school of Professor Ganna Onkovych (https://www.facebook.com/groups/ 898909013519964/, http://wiki.iteach.com.ua/Тренінг_"Критичне_оцінювання_ресурсів_інтернету"_ для_вчителів_ і_учнів), but the above-mentioned ones are key websites for media educators. Perspectives for media education development are defined in the Conception of implementing media education Ukraine according to which on the third stage (2021–2025) there should be the introduction of the media educational component in the curriculum of high schools of training of specialists in humanitarian sciences and appropriate information and communication technologies &lt;ref&gt;Karpenko, Olena. (2017). Media education as a component of reforming higher education in Ukraine/ О. О. Karpenko Media4u Magazine: Proceedings of 10th International Research Electronic Conference Media and Education 2017. Special Issue, pp. 59–63. http://www.media4u.cz/mav/9788087570395.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[North America]], the beginnings of a formalized approach to media literacy as a topic of education is often attributed to the 1978 formation of the Ontario-based Association for Media Literacy (AML). Before that time, instruction in media education was usually the purview of individual teachers and practitioners. [[Canada]] was the first country in North America to require media literacy in the school curriculum. Every province has mandated media education in its curriculum. For example, the new curriculum of Quebec mandates media literacy from Grade 1 until final year of secondary school (Secondary V). The launching of media education in Canada came about for two reasons. One reason was the concern about the pervasiveness of American popular culture and the other was the education system-driven necessity of contexts for new educational paradigms. Canadian communication scholar [[Marshall McLuhan]] ignited the North American educational movement for media literacy in the 1950s and 1960s. Two of Canada's leaders in Media Literacy and Media Education are Barry Duncan and John Pungente. Duncan died on June 6, 2012. Even after he retired from classroom teaching, Barry had still been active in media education. Pungente is a Jesuit priest who has promoted media literacy since the early 1960s.

===The United States===
Media literacy education has been an interest in the United States since the early 20th century, when high school English teachers first started using film to develop students' critical thinking and communication skills. However, media literacy education is distinct from simply using media and technology in the classroom, a distinction that is exemplified by the difference between "teaching with media" and "teaching about media."&lt;ref&gt;Culver, S., Hobbs, R. &amp; Jensen, A. (2010). Media Literacy in the United States. [http://www.imlrf.org/united-states International Media Literacy Research Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207011654/http://www.imlrf.org/united-states |date=2010-02-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 60s, the ‘film grammar’ approach to media literacy education developed in the United States. Where educators began to show commercial films to children, having them learn a new terminology consisting of words such as: fade, dissolve, truck, pan, zoom, and cut. Films were connected to literature and history. To understand the constructed nature of film, students explored plot development, character, mood and tone. Then, during the 1970s and 1980s, attitudes about mass media and mass culture began to shift around the English-speaking world. Educators began to realize the need to “guard against our prejudice of thinking of print as the only real medium that the English teacher has a stake in.”&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, P. and M. Hazard. 1961. The public arts: Multi-media literacy. English Journal 50 (2): 132-133, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; A whole generation of educators began to not only acknowledge film and television as new, legitimate forms of expression and communication, but also explored practical ways to promote serious inquiry and analysis—- in higher education, in the family, in schools and in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobbs | first1 = R. | last2 = Jensen | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = The past, present and future of media literacy education | url = | journal = Journal of Media Literacy Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, U.S. media literacy education includes a focus on news, advertising, issues of representation, and media ownership. Media literacy competencies can also be cultivated in the home, through activities including co-viewing and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commonsensemedia.org/ What's Really Best for Learning?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Project Censored began using a service learning model to cultivate media literacy skills among students and faculty in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=Mickey|last2=Roth|first2=Andy Lee|title=Censored 2015: Inspiring We the People|date=October 7, 2014|publisher=Seven Stories Press|location=New York/Oakland|isbn=1609805658|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media literacy education began to appear in state English education curriculum frameworks by the early 1990s, as a result of increased awareness in the central role of visual, electronic and digital media in the context of contemporary culture. Nearly all 50 states have language that supports media literacy in state curriculum frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2005).  Media literacy and the K-12 content areas. In G. Schwarz and P. Brown (Eds.) Media literacy:  Transforming curriculum and teaching.  National Society for the Study of Education, Yearbook 104. Malden, MA: Blackwell (pp. 74 – 99).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Montana developed educational standards around media literacy that students are required to be competent in by grades 4, 8, and 12. Additionally, an increasing number of school districts have begun to develop school-wide programs, elective courses, and other after-school opportunities for media analysis and production.

There is no national data on the reach of media literacy programs in the United States.&lt;ref name="Kahne, J. 2012"&gt;Kahne, J., &amp; Middaugh, E. (2012, November). Digital media shapes youth participation in politics. Phi Delta Kappan.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of information and communication technologies has expanded the subject of media literacy to incorporate information literacy, collaboration and problem-solving skills, and emphasis on the social responsibilities of communication. Various stakeholders struggle over nuances of meaning associated with the conceptualization of the practice on media literacy education. Educational scholars may use the term ''critical media literacy'' to emphasize the exploration of power and ideology in media analysis. Other scholars may use terms like ''new media literacy'' to emphasize the application of media literacy to user-generated content or ''21st century literacy'' to emphasize the use of technology tools.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, R. (2006) Multiple visions of multimedia literacy: Emerging areas of synthesis.  In Handbook of literacy and technology, Volume II.  International Reading Association.  Michael McKenna, Linda Labbo, Ron Kieffer and David Reinking, Editors.  Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (pp. 15 -28).&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 2001, the Action Coalition for Media Education (ACME) split from the main media literacy organization as the result of debate about whether or not the media industry should support the growth of media literacy education in the United States. [[Renee Hobbs]] of Temple University in Philadelphia wrote about this general question as one of the "Seven Great Debates" in media literacy education in an influential 1998 Journal of Communication article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobbs | first1 = R | year = 1998 | title = The seven great debates in the media literacy movement | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02734.x | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 9–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media industry has supported media literacy education in the United States. Make Media Matter is one of the many blogs (an “interactive forum”) the Independent Film Channel features as a way for individuals to assess the role media plays in society and the world. The television program, The Media Project, offers a critical look at the state of news media in contemporary society. During the 1990s, the Discovery Channel supported the implementation of Assignment: Media Literacy, a statewide educational initiative for K-12 students developed in collaboration with the Maryland State Board of Education.

Because of the decentralized nature of the education system in a country with 70 million children now in public or private schools, media literacy education develops as the result of groups of advocates in school districts, states or regions who lobby for its inclusion in the curriculum.  There is no central authority making nationwide curriculum recommendations and each of the fifty states has numerous school districts, each of which operates with a great degree of independence from one another. However, most U.S. states include media literacy in health education, with an emphasis on understanding environmental influences on health decision-making. Tobacco and alcohol advertising are frequently targeted as objects for "deconstruction, " which is one of the instructional methods of media literacy education. This resulted from an emphasis on media literacy generated by the Clinton White House. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) held a series of  conferences in 1996 and 1997 which brought greater awareness of media literacy education as a promising practice in health and substance abuse prevention education. The medical and public health community now recognizes the media as a cultural environmental influence on health and sees media literacy education as a strategy to support the development of healthy behavior.

Interdisciplinary scholarship in media literacy education is emerging. In 2009, a scholarly journal was launched, the Journal of Media Literacy Education,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmle.org/ Journal of Media Literacy Education]&lt;/ref&gt; to support the work of scholars and practitioners in the field. Universities such as [[Appalachian State University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Ithaca College]], [[New York University]], [[Brooklyn College of the City,]] [[University of New York Tirana|University of New York]], the [[University of Texas-Austin]], [[The University of Rhode Island]] and the [[University of Maryland]] offer courses and summer institutes in media literacy for pre-service teachers and graduate students. [[Brigham Young University]] offers a graduate program in media education specifically for inservice teachers. The Salzburg Academy for Media and Global Change is another program that educates students and professionals from around the world the importance of being literate about the media.

In 2018 California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed a bill allowing media literacy to be taught in California &lt;ref&gt;schoolshttp://www.ksro.com/2018/09/26/governor-brown-signs-dodd-bill-to-teach-media-literacy-in-california-schools/&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Impacts of media literacy education on civic engagement====
Media literacy education appears to have a positive impact on overall youth civic engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Kahne, J. (2011). Digital Opportunities for Civic Education. In Civics 2.0: Citizenship Education for a New Generation (pp. 1–28). American Enterprise Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Youth who attend schools that offer media literacy programs are more likely to politically engage online and are more likely to report encountering diverse viewpoints online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahne | first1 = J. | last2 = Middaugh | first2 = E. | last3 = Lee | first3 = N.-J. | last4 = Feezell | first4 = J.

'''Mental rotation''' is the ability to [[rotate]] [[mental image|mental representations]] of [[dimension|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects as it is related to the visual representation of such rotation within the human mind.&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Roger N.|last2=Metzler|first2=Jacqueline|date=1971-02-19|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701|journal=Science|language=en|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Mental rotation, as a function of visual representation in the human brain, has been associated with the right [[cerebral hemisphere]]. There is a relationship between similar areas of the brain associated with [[perception]] and mental rotation. There could also be a relationship between the cognitive [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of spatial processing, general [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] and mental rotation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=A. Michael|date=1990-12-01|title=Speed of Mental Rotation as a Function of Problem-Solving Strategies|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/71/3/803|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|language=en|volume=71|issue=3|pages=803–806|doi=10.2466/pms.1990.71.3.803|issn=0031-5125|pmid=2293182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Bill|last2=Anuza|first2=Teresa|date=1982-12-01|title=Effects of Sex, Handedness, Stimulus and Visual Field on "Mental Rotation"|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001094528280049X|journal=Cortex|volume=18|issue=4|pages=501–514|doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(82)80049-X|pmid=7166038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hertzog|first=Christopher|last2=Rypma|first2=Bart|date=2013-11-08|title=Age differences in components of mental-rotation task performance|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03335237|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=209–212|doi=10.3758/BF03335237|issn=0090-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental rotation can be described as the brain moving objects in order to help understand what they are and where they belong. Mental rotation has been studied to try to figure out how the mind recognizes objects in their environment. Researchers generally call such objects [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Mental rotation is one cognitive function for the person to figure out what the altered object is.

Mental rotation can be separated into the following [[Cognition|cognitive]] stages:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Create a mental image of an object from all directions (imagining where it continues straight vs. turns)
# Rotate the object mentally until a comparison can be made (orientating the stimulus to other figure)
# Make the comparison
# Decide if the objects are the same or not
# Report the decision (reaction time is recorded when level pulled or button pushed)

==Assessment==
In a mental rotation [[Psychological assessment|test]], the participant compares two [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects (or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]]), often rotated in some axis, and states if they are the same [[image]] or if they are [[mirror image]]s ([[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]).&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"/&gt; Commonly, the test will have pairs of images each rotated a specific number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (e.g. 0°, 60°, 120° or 180°). A set number of pairs will be split between being the same image rotated, while others are mirrored. The researcher judges the participant on how [[Accuracy|accurately]] and [[Rate (mathematics)|rapidly]] they can distinguish between the mirrored and non-mirrored pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What does the Mental Rotation Test Measure?

==Notable research==

=== Shepard and Metzler (1971) ===

[[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler (1971) were some of the first to research the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. N., &amp; Metzler, J., "Mental rotation: Effects of Dimensionality of Objects and Type of Task", ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance]]'', Vol 14, Feb 1988, pp. 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment specifically tested mental rotation on three-dimensional objects. Each subject was presented with multiple pairs of three-dimensional, asymmetrical lined or cubed objects. The experiment was designed to measure how long it would take each subject to determine whether the pair of objects were indeed the same object or two different objects. Their [[research]] showed that the [[reaction time]] for participants to decide if the pair of items matched or not was [[Linear#Linear functions|linearly]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[angle]] of rotation from the original position. That is, the more an object has been rotated from the original, the longer it takes an individual to determine if the two images are of the same object or enantiomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/1120/ps/ps3/mental-rotation.pdf|journal=Science|year=1971|author1=Shepard, R. N.|author2=Metzler, J.|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|jstor=1731476|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vandenburg and Kuse (1978) ===
{{main|Mental Rotations Test}}
In 1978, [[Steven G. Vandenberg]] and Allan R. Kuse developed a test to assess mental rotation abilities that was based on Shepard and Metzler's (1971) original study. The [[Mental Rotations Test]] was constructed using India ink drawings. Each stimulus was a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object drawn by a computer. The image was then displayed on an oscilloscope. Each image was then shown at different orientations rotated around the vertical axis. Following the basic ideas of Shepard and Metzler's experiment, this study found a significant difference in the mental rotation scores between men and women, with men performing better. Correlations with other measures showed strong association with tests of spatial visualization and no association with verbal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenberg|first=Steven|date=1978|title=Mental Rotations, a Group Test of Three-Dimensional Spatial Visualization|pmid=724398|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=47|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.2466/pms.1978.47.2.599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Michael|date=2005-03-01|title=Sex differences and the factor of time in solving Vandenberg and Kuse mental rotation problems|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262604002398|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=57|issue=2|pages=176–184|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.08.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural activity ==
In 1999, a study was conducted to find out which part of the brain is activated during mental rotation. Seven volunteers (four males and three females) between the ages of twenty-nine to sixty-six participated in this experiment. For the study, the subjects were shown eight characters 4 times each (twice in normal orientation and twice reversed) and the subjects had to decide if the character was in its normal configuration or if it was the mirror image. During this task, a PET scan was performed and revealed activation in the right posterior parietal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Irina M.|last2=Egan|first2=Gary F.|last3=Sonkkila|first3=Cynon|last4=Tochon-Danguy|first4=Henri J.|last5=Paxinos|first5=George|last6=Watson|first6=John D. G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Selective right parietal lobe activation during mental rotation|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/65|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=65–73|doi=10.1093/brain/123.1.65|issn=0006-8950|pmid=10611121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]]&amp;nbsp;studies of brain activation during mental rotation reveal consistent increased activation of the parietal lobe, specifically the inter-parietal sulcus, that is dependent on the difficulty of the task. In general, the larger the angle of rotation, the more brain activity associated with the task. This increased brain activation is accompanied by longer times to complete the rotation task and higher error rates. Researchers have argued that the increased brain activation, increased time, and increased error rates indicate that task difficulty is proportional to the angle of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|title=Mental rotation of tactile stimuli|journal= Cognitive Brain Research|volume=14|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00063-0|pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogos|first=Andrea|last2=Gavrilescu|first2=Maria|last3=Davison|first3=Sonia|last4=Searle|first4=Karissa|last5=Adams|first5=Jenny|last6=Rossell|first6=Susan L.|last7=Bell|first7=Robin|last8=Davis|first8=Susan R.|last9=Egan|first9=Gary F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Greater superior than inferior parietal lobule activation with increasing rotation angle during mental rotation: An fMRI study|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393209004163|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=2|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.013|pmid=19850055}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Clock rotated depth wise 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in depth 90 degrees]][[File:Clock rotated in the picture plane 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in the picture plane 90 degrees]]

==Color==
Physical objects that people imagine rotating in everyday life have many properties, such as textures, shapes, and colors. A study at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]] was conducted to specifically test the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation. This study used several methods such as reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eye tracking. In the initial reaction time experiments, those with poor rotational ability were affected by the colors of the image, whereas those with good rotational ability were not. Overall, those with poor ability were faster and more accurate identifying images that were consistently colored. The verbal protocol analysis showed that the subjects with low [[spatial ability]] mentioned color in their mental rotation tasks more often than participants with high spatial ability. One thing that can be shown through this experiment is that those with higher rotational ability will be less likely to represent color in their mental rotation. Poor rotators will be more likely to represent color in their mental rotation using piecemeal strategies (Khooshabeh &amp; Hegarty, 2008).

==Effect on athleticism and artistic ability==
Research on how athleticism and artistic ability affect mental rotation has also been done. Pietsch, S., &amp; Jansen, P. (2012) showed that people who were athletes or musicians had faster reaction times than people who were not. They tested this by splitting people from the age of 18 and higher into three groups. Group 1 was students who were studying math, sports students and education students. It was found that through the mental rotation test students who were focused on sports did much better than those who were math or education majors. Also it was found that the male athletes in the experiment were faster than females, but male and female musicians showed no significant difference in reaction time.

Moreau, D., Clerc, et al. (2012) also investigated if athletes were more spatially aware than non-athletes. This experiment took undergraduate college students and tested them with the mental rotation test before any sport training, and then again afterward. The participants were trained in two different sports to see if this would help their spatial awareness. It was found that the participants did better on the mental rotation test after they had trained in the sports, than they did before the training. There are ways to train your spatial awareness. This experiment brought to the research that if people could find ways to train their mental rotation skills they could perform better in high context activities with greater ease.

A study investigated the effect of mental rotation on postural stability. Participants performed a MR (mental rotation) task involving either foot stimuli, hand stimuli, or non-body stimuli (a car) and then had to balance on one foot. The results suggested that MR tasks involving foot stimuli were more effective at improving balance than hand or car stimuli, even after 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=a3da1b76-fd74-4640-abfb-c61d3a4ecdeb%2540sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%253d%253d#AN=2016-29576-008&amp;db=psyh|title=Improvement of postural stability during quiet standing obtained after mental rotation of foot stimuli.|last=Kawasaki|first=Tsubasa|date=2017-07-11|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers studied the difference in mental rotation ability between gymnasts, handball, and soccer players with both in-depth and in-plane rotations. Results suggested that athletes were better at performing mental rotation tasks that were more closely related to their sport of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of the axis of rotation and primordially solicited limb of high level athletes in a mental rotation task.|journal=Human Movement Science|volume=37|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamdi_Habacha/publication/264241628_Effects_of_the_axis_of_rotation_and_primordially_solicited_limb_of_high_level_athletes_in_a_mental_rotation_task/links/5a107ee0a6fdccc2d79997bf/Effects-of-the-axis-of-rotation-and-primordially-solicited-limb-of-high-level-athletes-in-a-mental-rotation-task.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a correlation in mental rotation and motor ability in children, and this connection is especially strong in boys age 7–8. Children were known for having very connected motor and cognitive processes, and the study showed that this overlap is influenced by motor ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The role of rotational hand movements and general motor ability in children’s mental rotation performance.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mental rotation test (MRT) was carried out on gymnasts, orienteers, runners, and non athletes. Results showed that non athletes were greatly outperformed by gymnasts and orienteers, but not runners. Gymnasts (egocentric athletes) did not outperform orienteers (allocentric athletes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gymnasts and orienteers display better mental rotation performance than nonathletes.|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=37|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==
Different studies have shown that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation tasks.

In order to explain this difference, we can look at the brain activation during a mental rotation task. In 2012, a study&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; have been done on people that graduated in sciences or in liberal arts. Males and females were asked to execute a mental rotation task, and their brain activity was recorded with an fMRI. The researchers found a difference of brain activation: males present a stronger activity in the area of the brain used in a mental rotation task.

A study from 2008 showed that this difference occurs early during development. The experiment was done on 3- to 4-month-old infants using a 2D mental rotation task. They used a preference apparatus that consists of observing during how much time the infant is looking at the stimulus. They started by familiarizing the participants with the number "1" and its rotations. Then they showed them a picture of a "1" rotated and its mirror image. The study showed that males are more interested by the mirror image. Females are equally interested by the "1" rotated and its mirror image. According to the study, this may mean that males and females, at least when infants, process mental rotation differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Paul C.|last2=Liben|first2=Lynn S.|date=2008-11-01|title=A Sex Difference in Mental Rotation in Young Infants|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/11/1067|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=19|issue=11|pages=1067–1070|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02201.x|issn=0956-7976|pmid=19076474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from 2015 was focused on women and their abilities in a mental rotation task and in an emotion recognition task. In this experiment, they induced a feeling or a situation in which women feel more powerful or less powerful. They were able to conclude that women in a situation of power are better in a mental rotation task (but less performant in an emotion recognition task) than other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissan|first=Tali|last2=Shapira|first2=Oren|last3=Liberman|first3=Nira|date=2015-10-01|title=Effects of Power on Mental Rotation and Emotion Recognition in Women|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/10/1425|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1425–1437|doi=10.1177/0146167215598748|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying differences between male and female brains can have interesting applications. For example, it could help in the understanding of the [[autism spectrum disorders]].

One of the theories concerning autism is the EMB ([[extreme male brain]]). This theory considers that autist have an "extreme male brain". In a study&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zapf|first=Alexandra C.|last2=Glindemann|first2=Liv A.|last3=Vogeley|first3=Kai|last4=Falter|first4=Christine M.|date=2015-04-17|title=Sex Differences in Mental Rotation and How They Add to the Understanding of Autism|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e0124628|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|issn=1932-6203|pmid=25884501|pmc=4401579}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2015, researchers confirmed that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation task (by studying people without autism): Males are more successful. Then they highlighted the fact that autists do not have this "male performance" in a mental rotation task. They conclude their study by "autistic people do not have an extreme version of a male cognitive profile as proposed by the EMB theory".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

There may be relationships between competent bodily movement and the speed with which individuals can perform mental rotation. Researchers found children who trained with mental rotation tasks had improved strategy skills after practicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meneghetti|first=Chiara|last2=Cardillo|first2=Ramona|last3=Mammarella|first3=Irene C.|last4=Caviola|first4=Sara|last5=Borella|first5=Erika|date=2016-02-10|title=The role of practice and strategy in mental rotation training: transfer and maintenance effects|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-016-0749-2|journal=Psychological Research|language=en|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s00426-016-0749-2|issn=0340-0727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Follow-ups studies will compare the differences in the brain among the attempts to discover effects on other tasks and the brain.

[[File:SimpleDiagramPyrolysis.png|alt=Simplified Pyrolysis chemistry on burning wood|thumb|400x400px|Simplified depiction of pyrolysis chemistry]]
'''Pyrolysis''' is the [[thermal]] [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/P/P04961.html |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology |accessdate=2018-01-10 |year=2009 |page=1824 |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the change of [[chemical composition]] and is irreversible. The word is coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived [[morpheme|element]]s ''pyro'' "fire" and ''[[lysis]]'' "separating".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used to the treatment of [[organic compound|organic]] materials. It is one of the processes involved in [[charring]] wood.&lt;ref name=inno&gt;[http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html ''Burning of wood''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209095142/http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html |date=2010-02-09 }}, InnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon, [[char]]. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly [[carbon]] as the residue, is called [[carbonization]].

The process is used heavily in the [[chemical industry]], for example, to produce [[ethylene]], many forms of [[carbon]], and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].  Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert [[biomass]] into [[syngas]] and [[biochar]],  waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

==Process terminology and mechanism==
Special cases of pyrolysis include [[dry distillation]], [[destructive distillation]], [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], and [[thermal depolymerization]].  It generally involves the breaking of chemical bonds in molecules to give smaller molecules; but may also leave residues with larger molecular mass.  The phenomenon involves exceeding the [[decomposition temperature]] of the material.

Pyrolysis differs from other processes like [[combustion]] and [[hydrolysis]] in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).&lt;ref&gt;Cory A. Kramer, Reza Loloee, Indrek S. Wichman and Ruby N. Ghosh, 2009, [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 Time Resolved Measurements of Pyrolysis Products From Thermoplastic Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate (PMMA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106220719/http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 |date=2014-11-06 }} ''ASME 2009 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition''&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, it is often not practical to achieve completely O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or water-free conditions, especially as pyrolysis is often conducted on complex mixtures.  The term has also been applied to the decomposition of organic material in the presence of [[superheated water]] or steam ([[hydrous pyrolysis]]), for example, in the [[Cracking (chemistry)|steam cracking]] of oil. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take place during [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]], the conversion of [[kerogen|buried organic matter]] to [[fossil fuels]]. 

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a [[vacuum]] to decrease the [[boiling point]] of the byproducts and avoid adverse chemical reactions. An example is the process of [[flash vacuum pyrolysis]] used in [[organic synthesis]].

Volatile pyrolysis byproducts can be [[Chemical analysis|analyzed]] through separation by [[gas chromatography]] and identification by [[mass spectrometry]], a process known as [[pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry|Py-GC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Goodacre, R.; Kell, D. B.|title=Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and its applications in biotechnology|journal=Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.|year=1996|volume=7||pages= 20-28|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(96)80090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Peacock, P. M.; McEwen, C. N.|title=Mass Spectrometry of Synthetic Polymers. Anal. Chem.|year=2006|volume=78|pages=3957-3964|doi=10.1021/ac0606249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis is also used in [[carbon-14 dating]].

== Occurrence and uses ==
===Ethylene===
Pyrolysis is used to produce [[ethylene]], the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (&gt;110 million tons/year in 2005).  In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around 600 °C in the presence of steam, i.e. [[steam cracking]].  The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze ([[ethylene glycol]]), PVC (via [[vinyl chloride]]), and many polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene&gt;{{cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars ===
Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures.  Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert [[coal]] into [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[metallurgy]], especially [[steelmaking]].  Volatile products are often useful, including [[benzene]] and [[pyridine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Ludwig Briesemeister, Andreas Geißler, Stefan Halama, Stephan Herrmann, Ulrich Kleinhans, Markus Steibel, Markus Ulbrich, Alan W. Scaroni, M. Rashid Khan, Semih Eser, Ljubisa R. Radovic|title=Coal Pyrolysis|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim| doi=10.1002/14356007.a07_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.
[[File:CoalPyrolysisProducts.png|thumb|290px|Typical organic products obtained by pyrolysis of coal (X = CH, N).]]
The coke-making or "coking" process consists of heating the material in "coking ovens" to very high temperatures (up to {{convert|900|C|F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by weight.

The original [[xylem|vascular structure]] of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as [[nutshell]]s or [[peach]] [[endocarp|stone]]s, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called [[activated carbon]], which is used as an [[adsorption|adsorbent]] for a wide range of chemical substances.

[[Biochar]] is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires.  They are a key component of the [[terra preta]] soils associated with ancient [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] communities of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref name="lehmann1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota than the typical red soil of the region.  Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through [[biochar]], the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

[[Carbon fiber]]s are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable [[polymer]], and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from {{convert|1500|-|3000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}).  The first carbon fibers were made from [[rayon]], but [[polyacrylonitrile]] has become the most common starting material.  For their first workable [[electric lamp]]s, [[Joseph Wilson Swan]] and [[Thomas Edison]] used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of [[cotton]] yarns and [[bamboo]] splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of [[pyrolytic carbon]]. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to {{convert|1000|-|2000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}. Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including [[artificial heart valve]]s.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon.

Other sources of [[organic matter]] as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge and distillers grain.&lt;ref name=bestEnergiesBestPyrol&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by '''flash pyrolysis''', in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between {{convert|350|and|500|°C|F|sigfig=2}} for less than two seconds. 

The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|pages=6765–6794|doi=10.3390/en8076765}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by [[hydrous pyrolysis]].

=== Semiconductors ===
The process of [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials.  The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane:
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Si  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Gallium arsenide]], another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of [[trimethylgallium]] and [[arsine]].

=== Recycling===
{{See also|Thermal Depolymerisation}}
Pyrolysis can also be used to treat plastic waste.  The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste.  In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Walter |last1=Kaminsky |title=Plastics, Recycling |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2000 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.J.

==Fine chemical synthesis==
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.  

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) at ca. 200 °C.  Products include the clusters  [[pentaborane]] and [[decaborane]].  These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also re[[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} gives Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

==History==
Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into [[charcoal]] since ancient times. Many important chemical substances, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfuric acid]], were first obtained by this process. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood.  The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authors=E. Fiedler, G. Grossmann, D. B. Kersebohm, G.

'''Menpehtyre Ramesses I''' (or '''Ramses''') was the founding [[pharaoh]] of [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]]. The dates for his short reign are not completely known but the time-line of late [[1290s BC|1292–1290 BC]] is frequently cited&lt;ref name="beckerath"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932193922|title=Chronologie des pharaonischen Ägypten : die Zeitbestimmung der ägyptischen Geschichte von der Vorzeit bis 332 v.

[https://books.google.be/books?id=nfiFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165 165].&lt;/ref&gt; While Ramesses I was the founder of the 19th dynasty, in reality his brief reign marked the transition between the reign of [[Horemheb]] who had stabilized Egypt in the late 18th dynasty and the rule of the powerful pharaohs of this dynasty, in particular his son [[Seti I]] and grandson [[Ramesses II]], who would bring Egypt up to new heights of imperial power.

==Origins==

[[File:Ramses I.jpg|thumb|left|Pharaoh Ramses I making an offering before Osiris, [[Allard Pierson Museum]].]]
Originally called Pa-ra-mes-su, Ramesses I was of non-royal birth, being born into a noble military family from the [[Nile delta]] region, perhaps near the former [[Hyksos]] capital of [[Avaris]]. He was a son of a troop commander called [[Seti (commander)|Seti]]. His uncle Khaemwaset, an army officer, married Tamwadjesy, the matron of the Harem of [[Amun]], who was a relative of Huy, the viceroy of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], an important state post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cruz-Uribe|first=Eugene|date=1978|title=The Father of Ramses I: OI 11456|jstor=544684|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=37|issue=3|pages=237–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the high status of Ramesses' family. Ramesses I found favor with [[Horemheb]], the last pharaoh of the tumultuous [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]], who appointed the former as his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|Vizier]]. Ramesses also served as the [[Priest|High Priest]] of [[Set (deity)|Set]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Montert, ''Everyday Life in Egypt in the Days of Ramesses The Great'', 1974, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=-Hk58E8jVPkC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197 197].&lt;/ref&gt;  &amp;ndash; as such, he would have played an important role in the restoration of the old religion following the [[Amarna]] [[heresy]] of a generation earlier, under [[Akhenaten]].

Horemheb himself had been a nobleman from outside the immediate royal family, who rose through the ranks of the Egyptian army to serve as the royal advisor to Tutankhamun and Ay and, ultimately, Pharaoh. Since Horemheb was childless, he ultimately chose Ramesses to be his heir in the final years of his reign presumably because Ramesses I was both an able administrator and had a son (Seti I) and a grandson (the future [[Ramesses II]]) to succeed him and thus avoid any succession difficulties.

Upon his accession, Ramesses assumed a ''prenomen'', or royal name. When transliterated, the name is ''mn-pḥty-rʿ'', which is usually interpreted as Menpehtyre, meaning "Established by the strength of [[Ra]]". However, he is better known by his ''nomen'', or personal name. This is transliterated as ''rʿ-ms-sw'', and is usually realised as Ramessu or Ramesses, meaning 'Ra bore him'. Already an old man when he was crowned, Ramesses appointed his son, the later pharaoh [[Seti I]], to serve as the Crown Prince and chosen successor. Seti was charged with undertaking several military operations during this time&amp;ndash;in particular, an attempt to recoup some of Egypt's lost possessions in [[Syria]]. Ramesses appears to have taken charge of domestic matters: most memorably, he completed the second [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]] at [[Karnak|Karnak Temple]], begun under Horemheb.

[[File:Ramses I Mummy.jpg|thumb|Mummy of Ramesses I]]
Ramesses I enjoyed a very brief reign, as evidenced by the general paucity of contemporary monuments mentioning him: the king had little time to build any major buildings in his reign and was hurriedly buried in a small and hastily finished tomb.&lt;ref name="tyldesley"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932221233|title=Ramesses: Egypt's greatest pharaoh|last=Tyldesley|first=Joyce|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780140280975|oclc=932221233|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] assigns him a reign of 16 months, but this pharaoh certainly ruled Egypt for a minimum of 17 months based on his highest known date which is a Year 2 II Peret day 20 (Louvre C57) stela which ordered the provision of new endowments of food and priests for the [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of [[Ptah]] within the Egyptian fortress of Buhen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/247341737|title=The monuments of Seti I: epigraphic, historical and art historical analysis|last=Brand|first=Peter J|date=2000|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117709|location=Leiden; Boston; Köln|language=English|pages=289, 300 and 311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jürgen von Beckerath observes that Ramesses I died just 5 months later—in June 1290 BC—since his son Seti I succeeded to power on III Shemu day 24.&lt;ref name="beckerath" /&gt; Ramesses I's only known action was to order the provision of endowments for the aforementioned Nubian temple at Buhen and "the construction of a chapel and a temple (which was to be finished by his son) at Abydos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872585819|title=A history of ancient Egypt|last=Grimal|first=Nicolas-Christophe|date=1992|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631174729|location=Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Massachusetts|language=English|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aged Ramesses was buried in the Valley of the Kings. His tomb, discovered by [[Giovanni Belzoni]] in 1817 and designated [[KV16]], is small in size and gives the impression of having been completed with haste. [[Joyce Tyldesley]] states that Ramesses I's tomb consisted of a single corridor and one unfinished room whose
{{blockquote|walls, after a hurried coat of plaster, were painted to show the king with his gods, with Osiris allowed a prominent position. The red granite sarcophagus too was painted rather than carved with inscriptions which, due to their hasty preparation, included a number of unfortunate errors."&lt;ref name="tyldesley" /&gt;}}

[[Seti I]], his son and successor, later built a small chapel with fine reliefs in memory of his deceased father Ramesses I at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. In 1911, [[John Pierpont Morgan]] donated several exquisite reliefs from this chapel to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranke|first=Hermann|date=1939|title=Review of The Temple of Ramesses I at Abydos|jstor=594071|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=59|issue=2|pages=272–274|doi=10.2307/594071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery and repatriation==

A mummy currently believed to be that of Ramesses I was stolen from Egypt and displayed in a private Canadian museum for many years before being repatriated.  The mummy's identity cannot be conclusively determined, but is most likely to be that of Ramesses I based on CT scans, X-rays, skull measurements and radio-carbon dating tests by researchers at Emory University, as well as aesthetic interpretations of family resemblance. Moreover, the mummy's arms were found crossed high across his chest which was a position reserved solely for Egyptian royalty until 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0430_030430_royalmummy.html|title=U.S. Museum to Return Ramses I Mummy to Egypt|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|date=April 30, 2003| access-date=2008-04-13|quote=A 3,000-year-old mummy that many scholars believe is ancient Egypt's King Ramses I is the star attraction of an exhibit at the Michael C.

The mummy had been stolen by the Abu-Rassul family of grave robbers and brought to North America around 1860 by Dr. [[James Douglas (businessman)|James Douglas]]. It was then placed in the [[The Niagara Falls Museum|Niagara Museum and Daredevil Hall of Fame]] in Niagara Falls [[Ontario]], Canada. The mummy remained there, its identity unknown, next to other curiosities and so-called freaks of nature for more than 130 years. When the owner of the museum decided to sell his property, Canadian businessman William Jamieson purchased the contents of the museum and, with the help of Canadian Egyptologist Gayle Gibson, identified their great value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2015/04/20/canadas-favourite-mummy-hunter-returns|title=Canada's favourite mummy hunter returns|website=Niagara Falls Review|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204121542/http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2015/04/20/canadas-favourite-mummy-hunter-returns|archivedate=2017-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Jamieson sold the Egyptian artifacts in the collection, including the various mummies, to the [[Michael C. Carlos Museum]] at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] for US $2 million. The mummy was returned to Egypt on October 24, 2003 with full official honors and is on display at the Luxor Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3215747.stm|title=Egypt's 'Ramses' mummy returned|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=October 26, 2003|accessdate=2008-04-13|quote=An ancient Egyptian mummy thought to be that of Pharaoh Ramses I has returned home after more than 140 years in North American museums.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1956 motion picture ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], depicts Rameses I (portrayed by [[Ian Keith]]) as the pharaoh who orders the elimination of the first-born of every [[Hebrew]] slave family in Egypt, leading to the scenario of future prophet [[Moses]] being sheltered by [[Bithiah]], who in the film is said to be the daughter of Rameses I and sister of [[Seti I]].

In the 2000 animated musical film ''[[Joseph: King of Dreams]]'', by [[DreamWorks Animation]], Ramesses I is depicted as the pharaoh who has his dreams interpreted by [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and who appoints Joseph to the office of Vizier when his foresight and administrative skills prevent Egypt from being ruined by famine.

'''Reading Recovery''' is a school-based, short-term intervention designed for children aged five or six, who are the lowest achieving in [[literacy]] after their first year of school. For instance, a child who is unable to read the simplest of books or write their own name, after a year in school, would be appropriate for a referral to a Reading Recovery program. The intervention involves intensive one-to-one lessons for 30 minutes a day with a trained literacy teacher, for between 12 and 20 weeks.

Reading Recovery was developed in the 1970s by New Zealand educator [[Marie Clay]]. After lengthy observations of early readers, Clay defined reading as a message-getting, problem-solving activity, and writing as a message-sending, problem-solving activity. Clay suggested that both activities involved linking invisible patterns of oral language with visible symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Recovery is an application of [[Whole Language]] instructional principles in an attempt to address the needs of struggling readers.

== Description of the program ==

A combination of teacher judgment and systematic evaluation procedures identify those lowest-achieving children for whom Reading Recovery was designed. The lowest performing children (the bottom 5-20% depending on the context) are identified using the Observation Survey (Clay, 2002), a multi-faceted series of assessment tools covering early reading and writing. The Observation Survey has been standardized in the UK and US to determine its validity and reliability, however coefficients have not been reported. 
Once a child has been identified and referred to the Reading Recovery program, intervention is developed. The intervention is different for every child, assessing what the child knows and what s/he needs to learn next. The focus of each lesson is to understand and construct "messages"—to understand messages in reading and construct messages in writing—and to learn how to attend to detail without losing focus on meaning.

Daily 30 minute lessons are individually designed and delivered by specially trained teachers. Drawing from their training, Reading Recovery teachers make moment-to-moment decisions to support the child's learning. During each lesson, children read many little books. These include two to three familiar books, a rereading of the previous day's new book and the introduction and reading of a new story. Teachers take a [[running record]] of the previous day's new book to analyse the child's independence and reading behaviour. Children also compose, write and read their own messages or stories. Magnetic alphabet letters are used for sorting, to assist visual discrimination, and to look closely at how words work. Reading skills, including phonetic skills, are taught in the context of extended reading and writing by Reading Recovery teachers who have completed a year-long inservice education program that focuses on moment-to-moment responses to children's actions and behaviour.

The intervention goal is to bring children up to the level of their peers and to give them the assistance they need to develop independent reading and writing strategies. Once they are reading and writing at a level equivalent to that of their peers, their series of lessons is discontinued.

The intervention is not intended as an alternative to classroom teaching, but is complementary, to enable children to engage in their classroom program.

==Professional development for teachers ==

An essential component of the Reading Recovery program is the training of the teachers who provide the tutorial instruction. Reading Recovery teachers learn to observe, analyse, and interpret the reading and writing behaviours of individual students and to design and implement an individual program to meet each student's needs. Just as the Reading Recovery children engage in learning through social interaction with the teacher, Reading Recovery teachers engage in learning through social interaction with their colleagues and mentors to construct a view of learning and teaching that supports literacy development. Reading Recovery has one of the best professional development protocols in the field of beginning reading.

'''Reading Recovery in Australia'''

Reading Recovery operates through state and territory departments of education as well as catholic education offices. These comprise:

* New South Wales (http://www.curriculumsupport.education.nsw.gov.au/earlyyears/reading/index.htm). 

In 2015, a report from the New South Wales Department of Education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Deborah  |last1=Bradford |first2=Wai-Yin |last2=Wan |date=2015 |title=Reading Recovery: A Sector-Wide Analysis |url=https://www.cese.nsw.gov.au/publications-filter/reading-recovery-evaluation |publisher=Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation, Department of Education, New South Wales, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;, concluded that Reading Recovery was largely ineffective, and should not be used for most children &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Alexandra |date=20 December 2015 |title=Reading Recovery program used in 960 NSW public schools does not work |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/reading-recovery-program-used-in-960-nsw-public-schools-does-not-work-20151218-glqplg.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, in 2016, Reading Recovery lost its "mandated status" as part of the curriculum in NSW's more than 900 public schools, although individual schools may still opt to use it &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bagshaw |first=Eryk|date=21 September 2016 |title=Reading Recovery: NSW government ditches 30-year-old, $55m a year program  |url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/reading-recovery-nsw-government-ditches-30yearold-55m-a-year-program-20160921-grkv1n.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. A further consequence of this shift in policy is that, in 2017, the NSW Department of Education initiated a hiring program to recruit dozens of new literacy and numeracy experts to support teachers in "evidence-based professional learning", according to NSW Minister for Education, [[Rob Stokes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Alexandra |date=30 December 2017 |title=New literacy teachers recruited as NSW government axes Reading Recovery  |url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/new-literacy-teachers-recruited-as-nsw-government-axes-reading-recovery-20171222-h09c5f.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location= |access-date= 19 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Religious alienation''' is a term some use to describe how religion creates an impediment to human self-understanding.

== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ==
Although the roots of alienation lie far back in the [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], the concept of alienation first gained prominence in the philosophy of [[Hegel]], and particularly in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in his earlier works, but it is not until the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) that alienation occupies a central place in his writings.

In the opening sections of the ''Phenomenology'', Hegel attacked the views of [[common sense]] and simplified [[natural science]] that the world consisted of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness. Truth, for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was stripped of any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately, Hegel considered that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with the ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was their truth. The supposed [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of the world of nature was in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover, behind these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view everything as a facet of his own [[self-consciousness]]. The same principle applied to the world of culture in which such spheres as art and religion, if viewed as independent of man, constituted so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the final understanding and recapitulation which was [[Absolute Knowledge]].

== Bruno Bauer ==
Hegel had created a system; and all his followers believed that it was the final one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular problems, they conceived his system to be ambivalent. The fact that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be overcome, led them to put the emphasis on the concepts of [[dialectic]] and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they challenged, first in religion and then in politics, his view that the problem of alienation had, at least in principle, been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of Hegel, [[Bruno Bauer]], applied the concept of alienation to the religious field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=bauer |title=Bruno Bauer |last=Moggach |first=Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer, who lectured in [[theology]] and made his name as a [[Gospel]] critic, considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity, caused a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this consciousness as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards the essence of self-consciousness that had become estranged from itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the use of the expression "self-alienation" that soon became current among the [[Young Hegelians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons| editors = Philip  Wiener (ed.)| last = McLellan| first = David| author-link = David McLellan (academic)| title = ALIENATION IN HEGEL AND MARX| encyclopedia = The Dictionary of the History of Ideas| location = New York| accessdate = 2009-09-28| year = 1973| url = http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907110351/http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| archivedate = 2009-09-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ludwig Feuerbach ==
For [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] (''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841)), people alienate their essential being by attributing their human qualities to a god who is then worshipped on account of these qualities. In worshipping god, therefore, people are unconsciously worshipping themselves. Thus Feuerbach argues that religion is a form of alienation which prevents people from attaining realisation of their own species-being. Feuerbach’s thinking has been described as [[Christian humanism|humanist]] in that his theory of alienation is based on a theory of human nature as [[species-being]], as innate to the human species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/education/alienation.html Worldsocialism.org Alienation study case]&lt;/ref&gt; This position would later be examined by [[Karl Marx]] in his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".

'''Slickline''' refers to a single strand wire which is used to run tools into wellbore for several purposes. It is used in the oil and gas industry, but also describes that niche of the industry that involves using a slickline truck or doing a slickline job.

Slickline looks like a long, smooth, unbraided wire, often shiny, silver/chrome in appearance. It comes in varying lengths, according to the depth of wells in the area it is used (it can be ordered to specification) up to 35,000 feet in length. It is used to lower and raise downhole tools used in oil and gas well maintenance to the appropriate depth of the drilled well. In use and appearance it is connected by the drum it is spooled off of in the back of the slickline truck to the wireline [[sheave]] a round wheel grooved and sized to accept a specified line and positioned to redirect the line to another sheave that will allow  the slickline to enter the wellbore.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/wireline-sheave-wheels/&lt;/ref&gt; Slickline is used to lower downhole tools into an oil or gas well to perform a specified maintenance job downhole. Downhole refers to the area in the pipe below surface, the pipe being either the casing cemented in the hole by the drilling rig (which keeps the drilled hole from caving in and pressure from the various oil or gas zones downhole from feeding into one another) or the tubing, a smaller diameter pipe hung inside the casing.

==Uses==
Slickline is more commonly used in production tubing. The wireline operator monitors at surface the slickline tension via a weight indicator gauge and the depth via a depth counter 'zeroed' from surface, lowers the downhole tool to the proper depth, completes the job by manipulating the downhole tool mechanically, checks to make sure it worked if possible, and pulls the tool back out by winding the slickline back onto the drum it was spooled from. The slickline drum is controlled by a hydraulic pump, which in turn is controlled by the 'slickline operator'.

Slickline comes in different sizes and grades. The larger the size, and higher the grade, generally means the higher line tension can be pulled before the line snaps at the weakest spot and causes a costly 'fishing' job. Due to downhole tools getting stuck because of malfunctions or 'downhole conditions' including sand, scale, salt, asphaltenes, and other well byproducts settling or loosening off the pipe walls because of agitation either by the downhole tools or a change in downhole inflow, sometimes it is necessary to pull hard on the tools to bring them back uphole to surface. If the tools are stuck, and the operator pulls too hard, the line will snap or pull apart at the weakest spot, which is generally closer to surface as the further uphole the weak point in the line is, the more weight it has to support (the weight of the line).

Weak spots in the line can be caused by making the circle around the counter wheel, making a bend around a sheave, a kink in a line from normal use (when rigging up the equipment extra line must be pulled out from the truck to give enough slack when the pressure control lubricator is picked up - this leaves line coiled on the often rutted ground, and sometimes it snags and kinks the line).

When the slickline parts, this can create an expensive 'fishing' job. It is called fishing because you often have to try different 'fishing' tools until you get a 'bite', then you have to work the original tools downhole free, or cut off the slickline where they join the tools downhole so that you can pull the broken slickline back to surface and out of the way, in order to fish the stuck toolstring. Because of the downtime involved in 'fishing', meaning not being able to flow the oil/gas well, the client is losing money by lack of production and also the cost of the slickline unit to fish, and the cost of what is left in the hole if it is not fished out (in the oil/gas industry, if the cause of the fishing job was not the fault of the slickline company, the oil/gas company is usually responsible to pay for it, and it can be very expensive).

Slickline was originally called measuring line, because the line was flat like a tape measure, and marked with depth increments so the operators would know how deep in the hole they were. This probably changed because the flat measuring line wasn't as strong as the modern slickline, and separate depth counters were developed.
It is advantageous to keep the diameter of the wire as small as possible for the following reasons:

* It reduces the load of its own weight.
* It can be run over smaller diameter sheaves, and wound on smaller diameter spools or reels without overstressing by bending (where the wire bends makes it weaker. Where it makes a complete circle, such as a counter wheel, makes it weaker yet).
* It keeps the reel drum size to a minimum (which reduces the area needed in the back of the slickline unit to house the drum and hydraulic pump, reducing weight and leaving more room for the other specialized equipment needed for slickline operations).
* It provides a small cross-section area for operation under pressure.

The disadvantage of a smaller diameter slickline is the lower strength. Depth and the nature of the job (a tool that must be pulled hard or might be stuck) will affect what slickline truck (different trucks specialize in different sizes of line) used.

The sizes of solid wireline in most common uses are: 0.092", 0.108", 0.125", 0.140", 0.150", and 0.160" in diameter, and are obtainable from the wire-drawing mills in one-piece standard lengths of 18,000, 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000 foot lengths. Other diameters and lengths are usually available on request from the suppliers, with the largest size currently available at 0.188".

==Mechanical and Hydraulic Jars==
Slickline tools operate with a mechanical action, controlled from surface in the wireline trucks operators compartment. Typically, this mechanical action is accomplished by the operation of jars. There are generally two types of jars; mechanical and hydraulic.

Mechanical jars look like a long, tubular piece of machined metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' depends on how much sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.

Hydraulic jars for slickline are generally meant to jar up only, because not enough sinker bar is able to feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the downhole tools. Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force on the top of the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by threaded connection to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the downhole tools. Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that [[hydraulic fluid]] has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range.

Generally once he hits that range on his weight indicator, he waits while the jars open to the less restricted point, whereupon the sinker bar travels upwards rapidly, providing an upwards hit on the downhole tools. The jars can then be 'reset' by lowering the line until the weight of the sinker bar closes, or pushes the inner mandrel of the hydraulic jars back to the starting position. Because the hydraulic jars are designed to provide a wait time to allow the operator to get up to the desired line tension, they can provide a very effective upwards hit.

Mechanical jar and hydraulic jar hitting power is affected by the length of the jars (the longer the length, they faster they can travel before they stop), the mass of the weight above them (the more the mass, the harder they will hit), and the tension of the line pulling on them.

Some completion components may be deployed and retrieved on slickline such as wireline retrievable [[Downhole safety valve|safety valves]], battery powered downhole gauges, perforating, placing explosively set bridge plugs, and placing or retrieving [[gas lift]] valves.  Slickline can also be used for fishing, the process of trying to retrieve other equipment and wire, which has been dropped down the hole.

==Applications==
The most common applications for slickline are:

* Tagging T.D. (Total Depth, which is the furthest depth possible down the wellbore)
* Gauge Ring runs (which is running a special sized downhole tool called a gauge ring, which comes in various pre-machined diameters, designed to ensure the pipe is clear to a certain point)
*Tubing Broach / Plunger Installations (a tubing broach looks like an aggressive, tubular file, available in different diameters, used for removing burrs and crimps in the inside of tubing and casing in oil and gas wells)[[File:Slickline_Tubing_Broach.jpg|thumb|right|Tubing Broach]]
* Bailing sand and debris (removing formation sand/rock and other such debris left over from the drilling and completion of the well, using a specialized tool called a bailer. This tool uses either a Chinese water pump type stroke action or a hydrostatic vacuum action to suction up the downhole debris, allowing it to be conveyed back to surface via the wireline)
* Shifting sleeves (formations downhole can be isolated behind sliding metal 'windows' called sliding sleeves. They are shifted open or closed by means of a specialized shifting tool locating the sleeve and it being jarred up or down, providing access or closing off that formation or section of casing)
* Setting / Pulling plugs and chokes (specialized downhole tools which either lock into pre-machined restrictions in the tubing, or which lock into the tubing itself, sealing pressure from below or above the plug)
* Setting / Pulling gas lift valves
* Running tailpipes (tubing extensions where the tubing is not landed close enough to the formation perforations in the casing)
* Bottom hole pressure  and temperature surveys (specialized electronic and mechanical tools designed to measure the pressure and temperature at predetermined depths in the wellbore. This data can be used to determine reservoir life)
* Spinner Surveys (to determine which formation perforations have the best inflow / which perforations make the most water / liquids)
* Kinley perforator, sandline cutter, and caliper
* Running production logging tools
* Fishing operations (fishing usually refers to attempting to retrieve lost tools or wire, or other debris that was not intended to restrict the flow / disrupt the well operations. Fishing can be difficult, due the fish being downhole, and other affecting conditions such as high pressure, the fish being jammed in the tubing / casing)
* Paraffin cutting (making a hole through and removing a wax buildup, which is a byproduct of oil cooling too much to reach surface)
* Chipping ice / salt (restrictions and plugs which can be formed as by products of a flowing well)
* Lubricating long assemblies in and out of the hole (lubricating is done via a larger than tool overall diameter pipe, joined at surface on top of the wellhead, which houses the valve that shuts the pressure in downhole. The lubricator should be long enough to be able to swallow the toolstring and downhole tools that are to be run or pulled)

==Braided line==
Braided line is generally used when the strength of slickline is insufficient for the task.  Most commonly, this is for heavy fishing such as retrieving broken drill pipe.

==Slickline Tools==

===Jar===
This type of tool can be extended and closed rapidly to induce a mechanical shock to the tool string.  This shock can induce certain components such as plugs to lock into place and then unlock for retrieving. Jars are commonly used to shear small brass or steel pins that are put in place to function certain down-hole tools at a certain moment. The operator can use the jars to shear the pins at a predetermined depth. Spang jars are manually operated by the wireline operator who either lifts or lowers wire rapidly, requiring a great deal of expertise.

===Stem===
Stem essentially just serves to add weight to the toolstring.  The weight may be necessary to overcome the pressure of the well.  Some variations of stem, called roller stem, may have wheels built into the tool to allow the tool string to glide more easily down moderately deviated wells. Stem give the hammering action to the tool string which in turn allows the jars to transmit the force given by the movement of the stems bars.  Depending on well conditions, either extra small OD stems are use or extra large.  The range can be from .75" to 3.50" OD and the stems normally come in 2&amp;nbsp;ft, 3&amp;nbsp;ft or 5&amp;nbsp;ft lengths.  The connection to the rope socket or other tools can be a threaded connection or a QLS system (quick connect).

===Pulling tools===
These are tools designed for fishing other wireline components which have been dropped or placed in the well down hole.  All wireline tools are designed with 'fishing necks' on their top side, intended to be easily grabbed by pulling tools with a matching 'id' to that of the 'od' of the fishing neck.  Pulling tools are also used for retrieving seated components such as plug prongs. Almost all pulling tools are equipped with a safety feature (shear pin) so they may release a stuck tool and allow the tool string to be brought to the surface for changes in components (hydraulic jars for example).

===Gauge Cutter (Gauge Ring)===
A gauge cutter is a tool with a round, open-ended bottom which is milled to an accurate size. Large openings above the bottom of the tool allow for fluid bypass while running in the hole.
Most often a gauge ring will be the first tool ran on a slickline operation. A gauge ring that is just undersized will allow the operator to ensure clear tubing down to the deepest projected working depth; for example 2 7/8" tubing containing 2.313" profiles would call for a gauge ring between 2.25" - 2.30". 
A gauge ring can also be used to remove light paraffin that may have built up in the tubing. Often a variety of different sized gauges and/or scratchers will be run to remove parafin little by little.Gauge cutter can be used for drift runs also.

===Lead impression block===
If an obstruction is found downhole, a lead impression block can be run to help determine its nature.  The LIB has a malleable lead base in which the obstruction can leave an impression when they meet. 
The LIB is called Wireline Camera because of its function to mark any object downhole.
They are also sometimes called "confusion" blocks because they only give a two-dimensional view of the down-hole object, making it hard for an inexperienced person to determine what three-dimensional object is in the hole

===Downhole bailer===
Bailers are downhole tools that are generally long and tubular shaped, and are used for both getting samples of downhole solids (sand, scale, asphaltines, rust, rubber and debris from well servicing operations) and for 'bailing' the unwanted downhole solids from the well. Bailers are attached either via threaded connection or releasable downhole tool to the wireline toolstring, and are manipulated from surface by the wireline operator. Bailers usually have an interchangeable bottom (the shoe) which also houses a check to keep the solids from falling or washing out of the bottom.

===Sample bailer===
A sample bailer is generally around a meter long, and has a hollow tube (the barrel) usually around 40&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, with a 'ball check' on the bottom and an opening at the top. This tool is beat downwards into the as yet unknown obstruction using the mechanical jars and weight above of the wireline toolstring. Generally, after a predetermined amount of 'hits', hopefully allowing a usable sample of solids to fill the barrel. When the tool is pulled upwards, the solids usually (hopefully) settle the ball check onto its 'seat', which will keep the solids in the barrel during the return trip to surface, where the solids can be inspected to determine what the downhole obstruction was. This procedure can be 'hit and miss', the success depending on how readily the solid was accepted into the barrel, and if the ball check was properly seated on the return trip to surface. If the ball check is not seated (sometimes a large, hard piece of solid will sit in between the ball and seat) downhole fluids tend to 'wash' the sample out of the bottom of the sample bailer, leaving the inspectors at surface wondering if the tool actually collected a sample. Persistence is generally a good rule of thumb with this tool.

===Stroke bailer===
A stroke bailer functions like a 'Chinese water pump', and is used to collect unwanted solids from the wellbore. A stroke bailer is long and tubular looking, with a smaller rod that extends from the top, a hole in the bottom, and is generally around 7 meters long, but the length depends on how much barrel section is added to the bailer. The barrel 'free floats' on the stroke rod, which is attached to the wireline toolstring. The tool is usually 'spudded' into the downhole solid, then the wireline toolstring is pulled upwards, which in turn pulls the stroke up through the barrel. Ideally, this draws the downhole solid in through the bottom 'shoe' of the tool, past the check and into the barrel for collection. The tool is usually stroked either a predetermined number of times, or until it appears the tool is not stroking, which can mean either it is full, or stuck.

===Hydrostatic bailer===
A hydrostatic bailer functions like a 'vacuum', and is used to suck up unwanted solids from the wellbore. A hydrostatic bailer is generally around 2.5 meters long and is tubular looking, with two 10&amp;nbsp;mm holes on opposing sides at the top of the tool, and a hole in the bottom. A hydrostatic bailer uses a pinned plug with o-ring seals at the bottom, and a plug at the top to maintain the surface pressure that it was assembled at (nominally around 100 kPa) all the way to the bottom of the well, whereupon it is spudded into the downhole solids, which ideally pushes the shoe into the bottom plug, which shears the pin on the bottom plug. An oil or gas well's pressure downhole is always more than atmospheric pressure at surface, due to the formation pressure, and a combination of depth and hydrostatic weight of wellbore fluids. Sometimes fluid will be added to the wellbore to assist in bailing by bringing up the pressure, and also lubricating the downhole solid. Because the pressure inside the bailer is much less than the downhole wellbore pressure, any solids that are loose enough are 'sucked up' by the vacuum formed when the bottom plug is sheared and travels upwards through the barrel, followed by the solids. At the same time, due to the changed from negative pressure to positive pressure, the top plug pops out (and is caught by the top part of the tool), and excess flow is directed out through the 10&amp;nbsp;mm ports on the sides of the top of the tool. These ports allow the barrel to fill more readily. Then the bailer is returned to surface where it is taken apart, the solids are emptied, and it is cleaned and serviced with new o-ring seals. Care must be taken when disassembling at surface as the tool is potentially charged with the downhole pressure (possibly many tens of thousands of kpa) and may 'blow apart' when being unthreaded if not bled off first.

===Running Tools===
These tools are primarily used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) located in the tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring that is used to 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection to the top of a variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.

'''Supergalactic coordinates''' are [[coordinates]] in a [[spherical coordinate system]] which was designed to have its [[equator]] aligned with the '''supergalactic plane''', a major structure in the local universe formed by the preferential distribution of nearby [[galaxy cluster]]s (such as the [[Virgo cluster]], the [[Great Attractor]] and the [[Pisces-Perseus supercluster]]) towards a (two-dimensional) [[plane (mathematics)|plane]].  The supergalactic plane was recognized by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] in 1953 from the [[Shapley-Ames Catalog]], although a flattened distribution of [[nebula]]e had been noted by [[William Herschel]] over 200 years earlier. [[Vera Rubin]] had also identified the supergalactic plane in the 1950s, but her data remained unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2016/10/vera-rubin|title=How Vera Rubin Discovered Dark Matter|last=Scoles|first=Sarah|date=4 October 2016|work=Astronomy.com|access-date=2017-10-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, supergalactic latitude and supergalactic longitude are usually denoted by SGB and SGL, respectively, by analogy to {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''l''}} conventionally used for [[galactic coordinates]].  The zero point for supergalactic longitude is defined by the intersection of this plane with the galactic plane.

==Definition==
*The north supergalactic pole (SGB = 90°) lies at galactic coordinates ({{math|''l''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 47.37°, {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} = +6.32°). In the [[equatorial coordinate system]] ([[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[J2000]]), this is approximately [[right ascension|RA]] = 18.9&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, [[declination|Dec]] = +15.7°.
*The zero point (SGB = 0°, SGL = 0°) lies at (''l''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 137.37°, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0°). In J2000 equatorial coordinates, this is approximately 2.82&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, +59.5°.
So the transformation from a triple of Cartesian supergalactic coordinates to a triple of galactic coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}_\text{gal} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos l_x \cos b_x &amp; \sin l_z \cos b_z \sin b_x - \sin b_z \sin l_x \cos b_x &amp; \cos l_z \cos b_z \\
    \sin l_x \cos b_x &amp; \sin b_z \cos l_x \cos b_x - \cos l_z \cos b_z \sin b_x &amp; \sin l_z \cos b_z \\
             \sin b_x &amp; \cos b_z \cos b_x \sin\left(l_x - l_z\right)                       &amp; \sin b_z
 \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}_\text{superg}
&lt;/math&gt;

The left column in this matrix is the image of the origin of the supergalactic system in the galactic system, the right column in this matrix is the image of the north pole of the supergalactic coordinates in the galactic system, and the middle column is the cross product (to complete the right handed coordinate system).

The '''Sylvia Fedoruk Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation (Fedoruk Centre)''' is an institute located in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] that was established by the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in 2011 as the Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation (CCNI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Canadian_nuclear_research_centre_secures_funding-2302124.html|title=World Nuclear News - Canadian nuclear research centre secures funding |date=23 February 2012|accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fedoruk Centre does not have a mandate to conduct research itself. Instead, it acts as a conduit to fund nuclear released research projects in Saskatchewan and to oversee the operation of nuclear facilities on the University campus such as the universities cyclotron facility.&lt;ref name="on_camp_news"&gt;{{Cite journal
 |last=MacPherson |first=Colleen
 |year=2011
 |title=Council approves nuclear innovation centre
 |journal=On Campus News
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Fedoruk Centre is involved in funding research in the nuclear medicine, materials science, nuclear energy systems including small reactor design, and environmental and social topics related to nuclear technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/03/02/sk-nuclear-money-1102.html|title=Sask. spending $30M on nuclear research centre - CBC News| accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 2012 the name of the organization was changed from the Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation to the Sylvia Fedoruk Canadian Centre for Nuclear Innovation in honour of [[Sylvia Fedoruk]] who did pioneering work in the treatment of cancer using cobalt-60 radiation therapy in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 |journal=The Star Phoenix
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre builds on other nuclear and accelerator related facilities already on the university campus that include the [[Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory]], [[Canadian Light Source]], [[SLOWPOKE reactor]] operated by the [[Saskatchewan Research Council]], and the [[Plasma Physics Laboratory (Saskatchewan)|STOR-M tokamak]].

The centre received an initial $30 million (CDN) in funding to advance research, innovation and training in four areas:
* Advance nuclear medicine and knowledge,
* Develop better materials for widespread applications (energy, health, environment, manufacturing, etc.),
* Improve safety and other engineering of nuclear energy systems, and
* Managing the risks and benefits of nuclear technology for society and our environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/about/impact.php|title=Fedoruk Centre About Us: Impact Areas| accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fedoruk Centre will be responsible for the operations of a $25 million  cyclotron facility being installed in a renovated a building between the Canadian Light Source and the [[Western College of Veterinary Medicine]] to be completed in 2014. The 24 MeV cyclotron will produce radioisotopes for medical imaging research and clinical use, including the province's PET-CT scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/facilities/cyclotron-facility.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210636/http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/facilities/cyclotron-facility.php |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the centre was formed some controversy existed over the governance and independence of the organization with only two board members appointed by the university while the other members have strong ties to the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/follow-the-yellowcake-road|title=Briar Patch Magazine - Follow the yellowcake road| date= Feb 28, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, all members of the Fedoruk Centre's Board of Directors are appointed by the University of Saskatchewan's Board of Governors. Two members are nominated by the Province of Saskatchewan, two by the University of Saskatchewan, with the remainder sought out by the Fedoruk Centre's Board and elected by the Board of Governors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fedorukcentre.ca/about/governance.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TRIUMF''' is [[Canada]]'s national [[Particle Accelerator|particle accelerator]] centre. It is considered Canada's premier [[physics]] laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2015 Budget, Chapter 3.1 – Supporting the Manufacturing Sector and Investing in Advanced Research|url=http://www.budget.gc.ca/2015/docs/plan/ch3-1-eng.html|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is consistently regarded as one of the leading [[subatomic]] physics research centers on the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An inside look at TRIUMF, the world’s biggest cyclotron|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/science/an-inside-look-at-triumf-the-worlds-biggest-cyclotron/ |website=Maclean's magazine|publisher=Maclean's magazine|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owned and operated by a consortium of universities as a joint venture, TRIUMF is located on the south campus of one of its founding members – the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. TRIUMF houses the world's largest [[cyclotron]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-7000/largest-cyclotron/&lt;/ref&gt; a source of 520 MeV protons, which was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:List_of_IEEE_Milestones |title=List of IEEE Milestones |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRIUMF's accelerator-focused activities involve particle physics, nuclear physics, [[nuclear medicine]], [[materials science]], and detector and accelerator development.

There are over 500 scientists, engineers, technicians, tradespeople, administrative staff, postdoctoral fellows, and students on the TRIUMF site. The lab attracts over 1000 national and international researchers every year and has generated over $1B in economic impact activity over the last decade.

TRIUMF scientists and university-based physicists develop and implement [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]]'s (NSERC) long-range plan for subatomic physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Subatomic Physics in Canada 2006–2016|url=http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/_doc/Reports-Rapports/LRP_Report_eng.pdf|website=NSERC|publisher=NSERC|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TRIUMF uses these plans to develop its own priorities.  TRIUMF has over 50 international agreements for collaborative scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Partnerships|url=http://www.triumf.ca/home/about-triumf/partners/international-partners|website=TRIUMF|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TRIUMF's cyclotron infrastructure has enabled the laboratory's [[proton therapy]] [[cancer]] treatment centre – the only one of its kind in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proton Therapy |url=http://www.triumf.ca/proton-therapy |publisher=TRIUMF |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRIUMF's proton therapy centre is operated in conjunction with the [[British Columbia Cancer Agency]] (BCCA) and the [[University of British Columbia]] Department of [[Ophthalmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proton Therapy Facility|url=http://www.triumf.ca/proton-treatment-facility|website=TRIUMF|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TRIUMF Proton Therapy Centre specializes in the treatment of [[ocular melanoma]] and uses [[protons]] from the laboratory's 520 MeV cyclotron to irradiate cancerous tumors with high precision, thus destroying the tumor while leaving the surrounding tissue unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proton Therapy Celebrates 20th Anniversary|url=http://www.triumf.ca/20yearsPT|website=TRIUMF|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asteroid [[14959 TRIUMF]] is named in honour of the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asteroid (14959) TRIUMF|url=http://www.rasc.ca/asteroids/asteroid-14959-triumf|website=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|publisher=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|accessdate=February 28, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306100242/http://www.rasc.ca/asteroids/asteroid-14959-triumf|archivedate=March 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

TRIUMF was founded in 1968 by [[Simon Fraser University]], the University of British Columbia, and the [[University of Victoria]] in order to meet research needs that no single university could provide. The original acronym, stemming from the name TRI University Meson Facility, was dropped and is no longer used to reflect TRIUMF's current state as a consortium of 19 universities. TRIUMF currently has 19 member and associate universities from across [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.triumf.ca/home/about-triumf/history|website=TRIUMF: Canada's national lab for particle and nuclear physics|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Triumf Front Signboard.jpg|thumb|TRIUMF entrance]]

Since its inception as a local university facility, TRIUMF has evolved into a national laboratory while still maintaining strong ties to the research programs of Canadian universities. The science program has expanded from nuclear physics to include particle physics, molecular and materials science, nuclear medicine, and accelerator research and development.

TRIUMF's 520 MeV cyclotron was officially commissioned on February 9, 1976 by [[Pierre Trudeau]], the 15th's [[Prime Minister of Canada]]. At the commissioning ceremony, he said "I don't really know what a cyclotron is, but I am certainly very happy Canada has one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Particle physics lab TRIUMF invites artists to connect science to society|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/triumf-artist-residence-40-years-1.3440572|website=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Riken]] SRC (superconducting ring cyclotron) was built, TRIUMF was the world's largest cyclotron in terms of weight and beam or magnetic field radius.  The Riken SRC is now heavier than the TRIUMF cyclotron, but TRIUMF has the largest beam radius and the largest vacuum tank. The Riken magnetic field covers from 3.5 m to 5.5 m radius with the maximum beam radius of about {{convert|5|m|in}}. The TRIUMF field goes from 0 to about 320 inches radius with the maximum beam radius of 310 inches. This is because it requires a lower magnetic field to reduce EM stripping.

===Laboratory directors===
Since its inception, TRIUMF has had eight directors overseeing its operations.
* '''John Warren''' – 1968–1971
* [[John Reginald Richardson]] – 1971–1976

(AAPS), TRIUMF's previous commercialization entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aapsinc.com/about-aaps/company-profile/ |title = About AAPS |publisher = AAPS, Inc. |accessdate = 9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
TRIUMF selectively applies its expertise to other areas of research and to the generation of entrepreneurial opportunities. Thus, the core program of nuclear, particle, and accelerator physics has expanded to cover key niche areas in life sciences and molecular and materials science.

===Main cyclotron and proton beam lines===
At the heart of TRIUMF is the 500 MeV cyclotron that produces the primary proton beams. A large fraction of the TRIUMF program relies on these beams, including the ISAC, the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science programs in μSR and β-NMR, and the Proton Treatment Facility. The operation of the main cyclotron has enabled TRIUMF to acquire the expertise to operate the three medical cyclotrons for Nordion and the TR-13 medical cyclotron used to produce medical isotopes, and assist companies to exploit commercial opportunities for the sale of cyclotron and other accelerator technologies.

====The 520 MeV cyclotron====
TRIUMF produces negatively charged hydrogen ions (H⁻: 1 proton, 2 electrons) from an ion source. The ions are transported through an evacuated electrostatic beam line containing elements to focus and steer the beam over 60m to the cyclotron. The 520 MeV (million electron volts) variable energy cyclotron accelerates these ions with a high frequency alternating electric field and uses a massive six-sector magnet to confine the beam in an outward spiral trajectory. Inserting a very thin graphite extraction foil strips, or removes, the electrons from the H⁻ ion while allowing the proton to pass through. The proton, because it is a positively charged particle, is deflected in the outward direction due to the magnetic field and is directed to a proton beam line.

The accelerating process takes approximately 0.3 ms before the proton achieves three-quarters the speed of light. The success of TRIUMF's programs depends on the ability to deliver protons from the cyclotron reliably. Typically, the cyclotron, although over 35 years old, averages an up-time of greater than 90% (2000–2007), with the 15-year average just under 90%. Typically the beam is delivered for about 5,000 hours per year with one major (three month) and one minor (one month) maintenance periods. The cyclotron beam properties and capabilities have improved over the years as a result of systems upgrades and the fundamental infrastructure providing the magnetic and electrical fields and the RF [[resonator]]s as well as the vacuum vessel will serve TRIUMF for many more years.

====The Four Proton Beamlines====
TRIUMF has four independent extraction probes with various sizes of foils to provide protons simultaneously to up to four beam lines. Because of the high energy of the proton beam, these [[beamline]]s use magnetic rather than electrostatic focusing and steering elements.

;Beamline 1A (BL1A) : can deliver 180 to 500 MeV protons to two target systems. The beam power ranges from 50 to 75&amp;nbsp;kW. The first target, T1, services three experimental channels. The second target, T2, services two μSR experimental channels. Downstream of T2 is a 500 MeV facility used to produce strontium isotopes for medical-imaging generators as well as the Thermal Neutron Facility (TNF).

;Beamline 1B : separates off BL1 at the edge of the cyclotron vault and provides international users with the Proton Irradiation Facility (PIF) that is used for radiation testing of electronic circuits, for example, mimicking space radiation for testing computer chips.

;Beamline 2A (BL2A) : capable of providing 475 to 500 MeV proton beams at up to 50&amp;nbsp;kW to the ISAC target facility that produces rare-isotope ion beams for a host of Canadian and international experiments.

;Beamline 2C (BL2C) : used for the Proton Therapy Program to treat choroidal melanomas (eye tumours) and proton irradiation to produce strontium isotopes, which are chemically processed and then used for medical imaging generators. This beam line also has the flexibility to provide protons of lower energy for PIF users. The energy range for this line is 70 to 120 MeV.

;Beamline 4 North (BL4N) : (expected completion 2017), will be a new 500 MeV beamline used for the proposed expansion of ISAC with a specialized actinide target.

===ISAC facilities for rare-isotope beams===
The ISAC facility produces and uses heavy ion beams to produce short-lived isotopes for study. A proton beam from the main accelerator is used to produce beams of exotic [[isotopes]] which are further accelerated using [[linear accelerators]]. Several experiments study the properties and structure of these exotic isotopes along with their [[nucleosynthesis]].  Between ISAC-I and ISAC-II, many experiments can be completed.

====ISAC-I facility====
In the ISAC-I facility, 500 MeV protons at up to 100 μA can be steered onto one of two production targets to produce radioactive isotopes. The isotopes pass through a heated tube to a source where they are ionized, accelerated off the source's high-voltage platform at up to 60 kV and sent through a mass separator to select the ion beam of choice. The beam is transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures to the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. Experiments at ISAC-I include:

=====8π spectrometer=====
A microscope used to examine the behaviour of atomic nuclear produced, which are collected at the centre of 8pi where they undergo radioactive decay.  The main component of the 8π spectrometer are the Hyper-pure Germanium detectors used to observe gamma rays emitted from excited states of daughter nuclei. [http://www.triumf.info/wiki/tigwiki/index.php/8pi]

=====DRAGON=====
The Detector of Recoils And Gammas Of Nuclear Reactions (DRAGON) is an apparatus designed to measure the rates of nuclear reactions important in astrophysics, particularly nucleosynthesis reactions which occur in the explosives environments of nova, supernova, and x-ray bursters. [http://dragon.triumf.ca/home.html]

=====Laser spectroscopy=====
The Collinear Fast-Beam Laser Spectroscopy (CFBS) experiment at TRIUMF is designed to exploit the high beam-intensity and radioisotope-production capability of TRIUMF's ISAC facility, as well as modern ion-trap beam-cooling techniques, in order to measure the hyperfine energy levels and isotope shifts of short-lived isotopes using laser spectroscopy. [http://www.triumf.ca/laser-spectroscopy]

=====TITAN=====
TRIUMF's Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN) measures the mass of short-lived isotopes with high precision.  Radioactive isotopes from ISAC are sent to TITAN to undergo cooling, charge-breeding and trapping.  The entire process occurs in about 10 milliseconds, allowing radioactive isotopes with short half lives to be studied. [http://titan.triumf.ca/]

=====TRINAT=====
TRINAT, TRIUMF's Neutral Atom Trap, holds a cluster of neutral atoms suspended in a very small space, in high vacuum, allowing for the study of decay products of radioactive atoms. [http://trshare.triumf.ca/~trinat/website/trinat_exp]

====ISAC-II facility====

The rare-isotope beams produced in the ISAC-II facility are transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures in the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. For high-energy delivery, the drift tube linac (DTL) beam is deflected north along an S-bend transfer line to the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator (SC-linac) for acceleration above the Coulomb barrier (5–11 MeV/u). TRIUMF began developing superconducting accelerator technology in 2001 and is now a leader in the field with a demonstrated accelerating gradient (at low beta) significantly above other operating facilities. Experiments at ISAC-II include:

=====EMMA=====
The ElectroMagnetic Mass Analyzer (EMMA) (completion date 2016) is a recoil mass spectrometer for TRIUMF's ISAC-II facility. ISAC-II will provide intense beams of radioactive ions with masses up to 150 atomic mass units to international scientists studying nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. The energies of these beams will depend on the specific nuclei being accelerated, but typical top speeds will range from 10–20% of the speed of light. [http://davids.triumf.ca/emma.htm]

=====HERACLES=====
Formerly known as the Chalk River/Laval array, HERACLES consists of 150 scintillators detectors covering almost 4-pi. It was used in over a dozen of experiments in the last ten years for multi-fragmentation studies at intermediate energies (10 to 100 MeV/A). [http://legacyweb.triumf.ca/tug/agm2000/HERACLES.html]

=====TIGRESS=====
The TRIUMF-ISAC Gamma-Ray Escape Suppressed Spectrometer (TIGRESS) is a state-of-the art new gamma-ray spectrometer designed for a broad program of nuclear physics research with the accelerated radioactive ion beams provided by the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator. [http://tigress.triumf.ca/]

====ISAC-I/II====

=====DSL=====
TRIUMF's [[Doppler Shift]] Lifetimes facility, which is an experimental setup for the measurement of the lifetimes of excited states of nuclei.[http://davids.triumf.ca/dsl.htm]

===ATLAS Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre===
The [[ATLAS experiment]] at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] uses proton-proton collisions at the highest energy ever achieved in the laboratory to look for the [[Higgs Boson]], the particle central to the current model of how subatomic particles attain mass. ATLAS will also search for phenomena "beyond the standard model" of particle physics such as [[supersymmetry]], extra dimensions, and quark compositeness. The ATLAS detector will observe the particles emerging from the roughly 900 million proton-proton collisions per second and, although fast electronics will filter the events so that only those most likely to be of interest will be recorded, ATLAS will produce 3.5–5.0 petabytes of data per year (one petabyte is one million gigabytes). In addition, secondary data sets will be produced that could double the amount of data produced.

In order to analyze this enormous amount of information, CERN is coordinating an international network of large high-performance computing centres that are linked by [[grid computing]] tools so that they act as one huge system. This network is called the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). The Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre, located at TRIUMF, works with nine of the other ATLAS Tier-1 centres in the world to process the raw data produced by the experiment. In addition, Tier-2 centres located in universities, both in Canada and abroad, are used to further process the results of the Tier-1 analysis and extract groundbreaking physics results from the data. The Tier-2 centres will also be the primary sites for computer simulations of ATLAS, which is an integral part of the data analysis.

===Centre for Molecular and Materials Science===
TRIUMF uses subatomic particles as probes of materials structure at the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science (CMMS).  The chief techniques are μSR and β-NMR.

====μSR====
TRIUMF utilizes a technique called μSR, a powerful probe into materials like semiconductors, magnets and superconductors. Beams of positive [[muon]]s are created with their spins lined up in the same direction. When these beams are shot into a material, the muons' spins precess (wobble like a top) around the local magnetic fields in the material. The unstable muons soon decay into positrons; since these [[positron|antielectrons]] tend to be emitted in the direction of the muons' spin, μSR scientists can examine how the internal magnetic fields of different materials have affected the muons' spins by observing the directions in which the positrons are emitted.

====β-NMR====
β detected NMR is an exotic form of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) in which the nuclear spin precession signal is detected through the beta decay of a radioactive nucleus. The central question to be studied is how the local electronic and magnetic properties near an interface or surface of new materials (e.g.,. a high Tc superconductor) differ from those of the bulk.

===Laboratory for Advanced Detector Development===
TRIUMF uses its expertise gained from the development of detectors for particle and nuclear physics, in collaboration with Canadian universities, to support advanced detector development for molecular and materials sciences and nuclear medicine.  TRIUMF's detector group designs and constructs electronic signal processing systems needed to handle the large volumes of data from modern detectors.

===Nuclear Medicine Laboratories===
The core of the TRIUMF nuclear medicine program is [[Positron Emission Tomography]] or PET imaging, a technique whereby tiny amounts of radioactive nuclei known as radioisotopes are combined with certain bio-molecules and injected into the body. The biomolecules can be “traced” by imaging the decay products (two photons produced by the decay of the radioactive nucleus via the emission of a positron) outside the body. PET allows the concentration of positron-labeled compounds to be determined quantitatively in space and time within the living body. PET is more sensitive than any other human imaging method, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], especially for the detection of cancer.

The PET program facilities at TRIUMF include cyclotron systems for the production of radioisotopes, chemistry labs for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals and quality control labs. TRIUMF currently uses the TR-13 medical cyclotron and target systems for the production of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N. Radiopharmaceutical production facilities include the small modular clean room at the cyclotron for the synthesis of [[Fludeoxyglucose|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).]] for BCCA as well as three chemistry annex labs for production and development of radiopharmaceuticals used in brain research and other programs at UBC.

Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre (PPRC) is a joint TRIUMF/UBC program studying central nervous system disorders. Approximately 80% of the studies are related to [[Parkinson's disease]], and the remainder are related to mood disorders and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The program has explored the origins, progression, and therapies of the disease as well as the complications arising from therapy using molecular imaging as the primary tool.

The Functional Imaging Program at the BCCA is a collaboration among the agency, TRIUMF, UBC, and the [[BC Children's Hospital]]. Capital acquired through the BC Provincial Health Services Authority Emerging Technologies Fund allowed purchase of the province's first hybrid PET/CT scanner in 2004. The clinical PET/CT program, located at BCCA's Vancouver Centre, was enabled by TRIUMF supplying &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, the positron emitting radionuclide used in production of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG, as a marker of glucose metabolism, is the tracer used in oncologic PET imaging, a diagnostic study which has become a standard of care in the management of many cancer types.

===Proton and Neutron Irradiation Facilities===
Beginning in 1995, TRIUMF has built up several beamlines that provide low-intensity, energetic proton and neutron beams to simulate radiation exposures either in space or terrestrial environments. Even at low intensity, several minutes of exposure in these beams can correspond to years of operation in space, air, or ground so that accelerated testing of electronics can be carried out.

These TRIUMF facilities, PIF &amp; NIF, have since become recognized as premier test sites for space-radiation effects using protons and, with the capability of using these protons to produce a neutron-energy spectrum similar to that found at aircraft altitudes and at ground level, testing with neutrons is also possible. A large fraction of the proton users are Canadian space-related companies such as [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates|MDA Corporation]], while neutron use is primarily by international companies for avionics, microelectronics and communications equipment, such as [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] or [[Cisco Systems|Cisco Systems, Inc]].

Additionally, one of the beamlines is used for the cancer treatment of [[Uveal melanoma|ocular melanoma]] at the Proton Therapy Centre which is operated in conjunction with the BC Cancer Agency and the UBC Department of Ophthalmology. Before proton treatment became available, the most common course of action was removal of the eye. Other possible treatments included surgical removal of the tumour (which has severe limitations), or implanting a radioactive disk on the wall of the eye under the tumour for some days. These alternatives were unsuitable for large tumours, and could damage sensitive parts of the eye, often resulting in loss of vision. After proton therapy, however, patients can retain useful vision. The protons enter the eye at a carefully controlled energy, and come to rest at a precise, predictable distance inside. They deposit their energy of motion (kinetic energy) in a very narrow layer, destroying living cells in that layer. Because the beam of protons is so concentrated and deposits its energy so predictably, we can successfully destroy a tumour while better preserving the other nearby parts of the eye.

==External scientific collaborations==
TRIUMF is also involved in the development and construction of detectors and equipment for larger particle physics experiments located all over the world.

===ALPHA===
The international [[ALPHA Collaboration]], focused on trapping [[antihydrogen]] with experiments based at [[CERN]], includes members from TRIUMF.

===KEK===
TRIUMF has a longstanding collaborative relationship with Japan's [[KEK]], which was further enhanced in December, 2015 when it was announced that each organization would be establishing branch offices at the other's respective institution to facilitate the advancement of their physics research activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada and Japan strengthen partnership to advance physics research|url=http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1035361|publisher=Interactions.org|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large Hadron Collider===
TRIUMF accelerator physicists, engineers, and technical personnel have unique expertise for the design and construction of critical parts of the accelerator, such as assembling the liquid [[argon]] end cap [[calorimeter]]s for the [[ATLAS detector]]. As well, TRIUMF was involved in the construction and procurement of several magnets and power supplies for the LHC itself. The resulting accelerator contributions were a necessary part of the Canadian investment in the project. TRIUMF is also home to the ATLAS-Canada Tier-1 Data Centre, funded by the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]]. This centre will pre-process the raw data from the experiment prior to analysis by Canadian and foreign researchers. It will also provide domestic detector experts access to raw data for detailed calibration and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATLAS-Canada Tier-1 Data Centre at TRIUMF|url=http://grid.triumf.ca/public/|publisher=TRIUMF|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SNO===

===T2K===
TRIUMF is part of the [[T2K]] ([[Tokai, Ibaraki|Tokai]]-to-[[Kamioka Observatory|Kamioka]]) [[neutrino]] oscillation experiment in [[Japan]]. TRIUMF is involved in constructing a [[time projection chamber]] and fine-grained detectors composed of plastic scintillators for the T2K ''near detector'', to measure the properties of the neutrino beam at its production site in Tokai before it travels 295&amp;nbsp;km to Kamioka, over which distance neutrino oscillations are expected to take place.

==TRIUMF Users' Group==
The TRIUMF Users Group (TUG) is an international community of scientists and engineers with a special interest in the use of the TRIUMF facility. Its purpose is:
* to provide a formal means for exchange of information relating to the development and use of the facility;
* to advise members of the entire TRIUMF organization of projects and facilities available;
* to provide an entity responsive to the representations of its members for offering advice and counsel to the TRIUMF management on operating policy and facilities.
Any qualified scientist can join the users group. The group's interests are looked after by an elected committee (TRIUMF Users' Executive Committee or TUEC). Part of TUEC's responsibilities is to organize meetings on behalf of the membership were necessary. At least one meeting, the annual general meeting (AGM), is held each year near the beginning of December. A link to the TUG website is listed in the external links below.

The '''Text Creation Partnership''' ('''TCP''') is a not-for-profit organization based in the library of the [[University of Michigan]] {{as of
 |2000
 |alt=since 2000}}. Its purpose is to produce large-scale full-text electronic resources (especially in the humanities) on behalf of both member institutions (particularly academic libraries) and scholarly publishers, under an arrangement calculated to serve the needs of both, and in so doing to demonstrate the value of a business model that sees corporate and non-profit information-providers as potentially amicable collaborators rather than as antagonistic vendors and customers respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview see {{cite journal

TCP has sponsored four text-creation projects to date. The first and the largest is "EEBO-TCP (Phase I)" (2001–2009), an effort to produce structurally marked-up full-text transcriptions of 25,000+ of the roughly 125,000 books to be found either in the Pollard and Redgrave and Wing [[short-title catalogue]]s of early English printed books, or among the [[Thomason Tracts]], that is, from among nearly all books, pamphlets, and broadsides published in English or in England before 1700. The books were selected and transcribed from the digital scans produced by [[ProQuest]] Information and Learning, and distributed by them as a web-based product under the name "'''Early English Books Online'''" (EEBO). The scans from which the texts were transcribed were themselves made from the microfilm copies made over the years by ProQuest and its antecedent companies, including the original University Microfilms, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The third TCP project was Evans-TCP (2003–2007, with some ongoing work through 2010), an effort to transcribe 6,000 of the 36,000 pre-1800 titles listed in Charles Evans' ''American Bibliography,'' and distributed, again as page images scanned from microfilm copies, by [[Readex]], a division of [[NewsBank, Inc.]] under the name "[[Archive of Americana]]" ("Early American Imprints, series I: Evans, 1639–1800"). Evans-TCP has produced e-texts of nearly 5,000 books.

The final TCP project was ECCO-TCP (2005–2010, with some work ongoing), an effort to transcribe 10,000 eighteenth-century books from among the 136,000 titles available in [[Thomson-Gale]]'s web-based resource, "Eighteenth-Century Collections Online" (ECCO). ECCO-TCP ran out of funding in 2010 after transcribing about 3,000 (and editing about 2,400) titles.

==Organization==

The TCP is overseen by a Board of Directors, drawn chiefly from senior library administrators at partner institutions, representatives of the corporate partners, and the [[Council on Library and Information Resources]] (CLIR). The Board is assisted in matters of selection and scholarship by an academic advisory group that includes faculty in the fields of early modern English and American studies.

The TCP has informal ties to a number of University-based scholarly text projects, especially in helping to provide them with source texts with which to work. Institutions represented include Northwestern University (IL), Oxford University (UK), Washington University (St. Louis), the University of Sydney (Australia), the University of Toronto (ON), and the University of Victoria (BC). TCP has also worked with students by sponsoring an Undergraduate Essay Contest every year, convening task forces on the uses of TCP texts in pedagogy, and appealing to scholars and students for ideas on selection and use.

Text production is managed through the University of Michigan's [[Digital Library Production Service]] (DLPS), with its extensive experience in the production of SGML/XML-encoded electronic texts. DLPS is assisted by [[Oxford University's]] Bodleian Digital Libraries Systems &amp; Services (BDLSS), including the late [[Sebastian Rahtz]].&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/martinw/2016/03/23/the-oxford-text-archive-2015/&lt;/ref&gt; Small part-time production operations have also been started within two other libraries: the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies in Pratt Library (Victoria University in the University of Toronto), specializing in Latin books; and the National Library of Wales (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) in Aberystwyth, specializing in Welsh books.

==Commonalities==

All four TCP text projects are very similar. In each case:

# The TCP produces text from commercial image files that have in turn been created from microfilm copies of early books.
# The commercial image providers receive what is in effect a full-text index to their image product for much less than it would cost to produce themselves: value added to their product.
# The partner libraries actually own, rather than simply license, the resultant texts, and are free (subject to some conditions) to mount the texts themselves in whatever system they like, or use the texts internally as a tool of scholarship and teaching.
# The texts are created according to library-determined standards, uniform across multiple data-sets and potentially cross-searchable.
# Because they are created collaboratively, the texts are relatively inexpensive (on a per-book basis) and become more so with each library that joins the partnership.
# The texts will eventually be made freely accessible to the public at large.
# The selection of texts to convert, though differing from project to project, in each case follows similar principles: variety, significance, representative quality, avoidance of duplication; specific requests from faculty or scholarly initiatives at member institutions are also generally honored.
# TCP has been hitherto primarily interested in creating texts, not in creating a "product"; though texts from all three projects are or will be mounted on servers at the University of Michigan library, the Michigan site is not the official TCP site: any partner library with adequate resources and safeguards may do the same. EEBO-TCP texts, for example, are served by Michigan, ProQuest, the Oxford University Digital Library, and the University of Chicago.

==Standards==

All four TCP text projects are produced in the same way and to the same standards, which are documented, at least in part, on the [http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/docs/ TCP web site].

# '''Accuracy.''' The TCP strives to produce texts that are as accurately transcribed as possible, with a specified overall accuracy rate of 99.995% or better (i.e. one error or fewer per 20,000 characters).
# '''Keying.''' Given the nature of the material, the only method found to deliver such accuracy economically has been to have the books keyed by data conversion firms under contract.
# '''Quality control.''' Accuracy of transcription and aptness of markup are assessed in all cases by a group of library-based proofers and reviewers managed by the University of Michigan DLPS.
# '''Encoding.''' All resultant text files are marked up in valid SGML or XML (SGML is archived, XML is exported) conforming to a proprietary "Document Type Description" (DTD) derived from the P3/P4 version of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) standard.
# '''Purposeful markup.''' Compared to the full TEI, the TCP DTD is very simple and intended to capture only the features most useful for intelligible display, intelligent navigation, and productive searching. The TCP practice is to capture, so far as feasible, the overall hierarchical structure of each book (parts, sections, chapters, etc.); the features that tend to mark the beginnings and ends of divisions (headings, explicits, salutations, valedictions, datelines, bylines, epigraphs, etc.); the most significant elements of discourse and organization (paragraphs in prose, lines and stanzas in verse, speeches, speakers, and stage directions in drama, notes, block quotes, sequential numerations of all kinds); and only the most essential aspects of physical formatting (page breaks, lists, tables, font changes).
# '''Fidelity to the original.''' In each case, the text is intended to represent the book as originally printed, so far as that is possible. Printer's errors are preserved, hand-written changes are ignored, duplicate scans are omitted, out-of-order images are keyed in the intended order, and most of the unusual characters of the original are preserved.
# '''Ease of reading and searching.''' At the same time, though the transcriptions are carried out character-by-character, TCP, on the theory that all transcription is a kind of translation from one symbolic system to another, tends to define characters in terms more of their meaning than of their form, and to map eccentric letter-forms to meaningful modern equivalents, generally in keeping with the Unicode definition of "character."
# '''Languages.''' Though most of the TCP texts are in English, many are not. Books and divisions of books not in English are tagged with an appropriate language code, but are not otherwise distinguished.
# '''Omitted material.''' The TCP produces Latin-alphabet ''text''. Non-textual material such as musical notation, mathematical formulae, and illustrations (except for any text they may contain) are omitted and their locations marked with a special tag. Extended text in non-Latin alphabets (Greek, Hebrew, Persian, etc.) is also omitted.

==Accomplishments and prospects==

As of April 2011, the TCP had created about 40,000 searchable, navigable, full-text transcriptions of early books, a database of unmatched scope, scale, and utility to students in many fields. Whether it will be able to go on to produce the remaining 38,000 texts included in its ambitious recent plans (for EEBO-TCP Phase II) will depend on the validity of its original vision, arising from the theory that libraries could and should cooperate to become producers and standard-setters rather than consumers; and that universities and commercial firms, despite their very different life-cycles, constraints, and motives, could join in durable partnerships of benefit to all parties.

As of Jan 1, 2015, the full text of the EEBO phase I has been released under a Creative Commons License, and can be freely downloaded and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/2014/12/24/eebo-tcp-phase-i-public-release-what-to-expect-on-january-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 there were 28,466 titles available via Phase II. As of July 2015, ProQuest had the exclusive right for five years to distribute the EEBO-TCP Phase II collection. After those five years the texts will be made freely available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/|title=EEBO-TCP: Early English Books Online - Text Creation Partnership|website=www.textcreationpartnership.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capmany and D. Novak, “Microwave photonics combines two worlds," ''Nature Photonics'' '''1''', 319-330 (2007). [http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v1/n6/abs/nphoton.2007.89.html]&lt;/ref&gt; since it uses an [[Optics|optical]] [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]]. It relies on the process of time-stretch, which effectively slows down the [[analog signal]] in time (or compresses its bandwidth) before it can be digitized by a slow electronic ADC.

== Background ==
There is a huge demand for very high speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), as they are needed for [[Electronic test equipment|test and measurement equipment]] in laboratories and in high speed [[data]] [[communications system]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Most of the ADCs are based purely on electronic circuits, which have limited speeds and add a lot of impairments, limiting the bandwidth of the signals that can be digitized and the achievable [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. In the TS-ADC, this limitation is overcome by time-stretching the analog signal, which effectively slows down the signal in time prior to digitization. By doing so, the bandwidth (and [[carrier wave|carrier frequency]]) of the signal is compressed. Electronic ADCs that would have been too slow to digitize the original signal, can now be used to capture this slowed down signal.

== Operation principle==
[[File:Tsadc block diagram.png|thumb|right|400px|A time-stretch [[analog-to-digital converter]] (with a stretch factor of 4) is shown. The original analog signal is time-stretched and segmented with the help of a time-stretch [[preprocessor]] (generally on optical [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]]). Slowed down segments are captured by conventional electronic ADCs. The digitized samples are rearranged to obtain the digital representation of the original signal.]]
[[File:Pts preprocessor mwp link.png|thumb|right|400px|[[Optics|Optical]] [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]] for a time-stretch analog-to-digital converter is shown. The original analog signal is [[modulation|modulated]] over a [[chirp]]ed optical pulse (obtained by [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersing]] an [[ultrashort pulse|ultra-short]] [[supercontinuum]] pulse from a mode-locked laser, MLL). Second dispersive medium stretches the optical pulse further. At the [[photodetector]] (PD) output, stretched replica of original signal is obtained.]]

The time-stretch processor, which is generally an [[Optics|optical]] [[Front-end and back-end|frontend]], stretches the signal in time. It also divides the signal into multiple segments using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], for example a [[wavelength division multiplex]]ing (WDM) [[Filter (optics)|filter]], to ensure that the stretched replica of the original analog signal segments do not overlap each other in time after stretching. The time-stretched and slowed down signal segments are then converted into [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] by slow electronic ADCs. Finally, these samples are collected by a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) and rearranged in a manner such that output data is the digital representation of the original analog signal. Any [[distortion]] added to the signal by the time-stretch [[preprocessor]] is also removed by the DSP.

An optical front-end is commonly used to accomplish this process of time-stretch. An [[Ultrashort pulse|ultrashort optical pulse]] (typically 100 to 200 [[femtoseconds]] long), also called a [[supercontinuum]] pulse, which has a broad optical bandwidth, is [[time stretch dispersive Fourier transform|time-stretched]] by [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersing]] it in a highly dispersive medium (such as a dispersion compensating fiber). This process results in (an almost) linear time-to-[[wavelength]] mapping in the stretched pulse, because different wavelengths travel at different speeds in the dispersive medium. The obtained pulse is called a [[chirp]]ed pulse as its [[frequency]] is changing with time, and it is typically a few nanoseconds long. The analog signal is [[Modulation|modulated]] onto this chirped pulse using an [[Electro-optic modulator|electro-optic intensity modulator]]. Subsequently, the modulated pulse is stretched further in the second dispersive medium which has much higher dispersion value. Finally, this obtained optical pulse is converted to electrical domain by a [[photodetector]], giving the stretched replica of the original analog signal.

For continuous operation, a train of [[supercontinuum]] pulses is used. The chirped pulses arriving at the electro-optic modulator should be wide enough (in time) such that the trailing edge of one pulse overlaps the leading edge of the next pulse. For segmentation, optical filters separate the signal into multiple wavelength [[Channel (communications)|channels]] at the output of the second dispersive medium. For each channel, a separate photodetector and [[Front-end and back-end|backend]] electronic ADC is used. Finally the output of these ADCs are passed on to the [[Digital Signal Processor|DSP]] which generates the desired digital output.

==Impulse response of the photonic time-stretch (PTS) system==
The PTS processor is based on specialized analog optical (or [[microwave]] photonic) [[optical fiber|fiber]] [[Data link|links]]&lt;ref name="CapmanyNP2007"/&gt; such as those used in [[cable television|cable TV]] distribution. While the dispersion of fiber is a nuisance in conventional analog [[optical link]]s, time-stretch technique exploits it to slow down the electrical [[waveform]] in the optical domain. In the cable TV link, the light source is a [[continuous-wave]] (CW) [[laser]]. In PTS, the source is a chirped pulse laser.

[[File:Tsadc 10Tsps.png|thumb|right|400px|Capture of a 95&amp;nbsp;GHz RF tone using the photonic time-stretch digitizer. The signal is captured at an effective sample rate of 10 terasamples per second.]]

In a conventional analog optical link, dispersion causes the upper and lower modulation [[sidebands]], ''f''&lt;sub&gt;optical&lt;/sub&gt; ± ''f''&lt;sub&gt;electrical&lt;/sub&gt;, to slip in relative [[Phase (waves)|phase]]. At certain frequencies, their beats with the optical [[Carrier wave|carrier]] [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] destructively, creating nulls in the [[frequency response]] of the system. For practical systems the first null is at tens of [[Gigahertz|GHz]], which is sufficient for handling most electrical signals of interest. Although it may seem that the dispersion penalty places a fundamental limit on the impulse response (or the bandwidth) of the time-stretch system, it can be eliminated. The dispersion penalty vanishes with [[single-sideband modulation]].&lt;ref name="CapmanyNP2007"/&gt; Alternatively, one can use the modulator’s secondary (inverse) output port to eliminate the dispersion penalty,&lt;ref name="CapmanyNP2007"/&gt; in much the same way as two [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] can eliminate [[Null (radio)|spatial nulls]] in [[wireless]] communication (hence the two antennas on top of a [[Wi-Fi|WiFi]] [[Wireless access point|access point]]). This configuration is termed phase-diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Yan Han, Ozdal Boyraz, Bahram Jalali, "Ultrawide-Band Photonic Time-Stretch A/D Converter Employing Phase Diversity," "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES" VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2005 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1420773]&lt;/ref&gt;   Combining the complementary outputs using a [[Maximal-ratio combining|maximal ratio combining]] (MRC) algorithm results in a transfer function with a flat response in the frequency domain.  Thus, the [[impulse response]] (bandwidth) of a time-stretch system is limited only by the bandwidth of the [[Electro-optics|electro-optic]] modulator, which is about 120&amp;nbsp;GHz—a value that is adequate for capturing most electrical waveforms of interest.

Extremely large stretch factors can be obtained using long lengths of fiber, but at the cost of larger loss—a problem that has been overcome by employing [[Raman amplification]] within the dispersive fiber itself, leading to the world’s fastest real-time digitizer.&lt;ref&gt;J. Chou, O. Boyraz, D. Solli, and B. Jalali, “Femtosecond real-time single-shot digitizer," ''Applied Physics Letters'' '''91''', 161105 (2007). [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APPLAB000091000016161105000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, using PTS, capture of very high frequency signals with a world record resolution in 10-GHz bandwidth range has been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;S. Gupta and B. Jalali, “Time-warp correction and calibration in photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter," ''Optics Letters'' '''33''', 2674–2676 (2008). [http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-33-22-2674]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with time lens imaging==
Another technique, temporal imaging using a time [[Lens (optics)|lens]], can also be used to slow down (mostly optical) signals in time. The time-lens concept relies on the mathematical equivalence between [[space|spatial]] [[diffraction]] and [[Time|temporal]] dispersion, the so-called space-time [[duality (mathematics)|duality]].&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Kolner and M. Nazarathy, “Temporal imaging with a time lens," ''Optics Letters'' '''14''', 630-632 (1989) [http://www.opticsinfobase.org/ol/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-14-12-630]&lt;/ref&gt; A lens held at fixed distance from an object produces a magnified visible [[image]]. The lens imparts a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] phase shift to the [[spatial frequency]] components of the optical waves; in conjunction with the [[free space]] [[Wave propagation|propagation]] (object to lens, lens to eye), this generates a magnified image. Owing to the mathematical equivalence between [[paraxial]] [[diffraction]] and temporal dispersion, an optical waveform can be temporally [[Optical imaging|imaged]] by a three-step process of dispersing it in time, subjecting it to a phase shift that is quadratic in time (the time lens itself), and dispersing it again. Theoretically, a [[Focus (optics)|focused]] [[Optical aberration|aberration]]-free image is obtained under a ''specific condition'' when the two dispersive elements and the phase shift satisfy the temporal equivalent of the classic lens equation. Alternatively, the time lens can be used without the second dispersive element to transfer the waveform’s temporal profile to the spectral domain, analogous to the property that an ordinary lens produces the spatial [[Fourier transform]] of an object at its [[focus (optics)|focal points]].&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Goodman, “Introduction to Fourier Optics," McGraw-Hill (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the time-lens approach, PTS is not based on the space-time duality – there is no lens equation that needs to be satisfied to obtain an error-free slowed-down version of the input waveform.  Time-stretch technique also offers continuous-time acquisition performance, a feature needed for mainstream applications of [[oscilloscopes]].

Another important difference between the two techniques is that the time lens requires the input signal to be subjected to high amount of dispersion before further processing. For electrical waveforms, the electronic devices that have the required characteristics: (1) high dispersion to loss ratio, (2) uniform dispersion, and (3) broad bandwidths, do not exist. This renders time lens not suitable for slowing down wideband electrical waveforms. In contrast, PTS does not have such a requirement. It was developed specifically for slowing down electrical waveforms and enable high speed digitizers.

== Relation to phase stretch transform ==
The [[phase stretch transform]] or PST is a computational approach to signal and image processing. One of its utilities is for feature detection and classification. phase stretch transform is a spin-off from research on the [[time stretch dispersive Fourier transform]]. It transforms the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered 3D dispersive property (refractive index).

==Application to imaging and spectroscopy==
In addition to wideband A/D conversion, photonic time-stretch (PTS) is also an enabling technology for high-throughput real-time instrumentation such as [[optical imaging|imaging]]&lt;ref&gt;K. Goda, K.K. Tsia, and B. Jalali, "Serial time-encoded amplified imaging for real-time observation of fast dynamic phenomena," Nature 458, 1145–1149, 2009. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7242/full/nature07980.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Solli, J. Chou, and B. Jalali, "Amplified wavelength–time transformation for real-time spectroscopy," ''Nature Photonics'' 2, 48-51, 2008. [http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v2/n1/full/nphoton.2007.253.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Chou, D. Solli, and B. Jalali, "Real-time spectroscopy with subgigahertz resolution using amplified dispersive Fourier transformation," ''Applied Physics Letters'' 92, 111102, 2008. [http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v92/i11/p111102_s1]&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Time stretch quantitative phase imaging|artificial intelligence facilitated high-speed phase microscopy]] is demonstrated to improve the diagnosis accuracy of cancer cells out of blood cells by simultaneous measurement of phase and intensity spatial profiles.&lt;ref&gt;C. Chen, A. Mahjoubfar, &amp; B. Jalali, “Deep Learning in Label-free Cell Classification," ''Scientific Reports'' 6, 21471 (2016) {{doi|10.1038/srep21471}}. [http://www.nature.com/articles/srep21471]&lt;/ref&gt; The world's fastest optical imaging method called [[serial time-encoded amplified microscopy (STEAM)]] makes use of the PTS technology to acquire image using a single-pixel photodetector and commercial ADC. 
Wavelength-time spectroscopy, which also relies on photonic time-stretch technique, permits real-time single-shot measurements of rapidly evolving or fluctuating spectra.

[[Time stretch quantitative phase imaging]] ([[Time stretch quantitative phase imaging|TS-QPI]]) is an imaging technique based on time-stretch technology for simultaneous measurement of phase and intensity spatial profiles.   In time stretched imaging, the object’s spatial information is encoded in the spectrum of laser pulses within a pulse duration of sub-nanoseconds. Each pulse representing one frame of the camera is then stretched in time so that it can be digitized in real-time by an electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ultra-fast pulse illumination freezes the motion of high-speed cells or particles in flow to achieve blur-free imaging.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5019">'''The U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on [[Agent Orange]]/Dioxin''' was formally established in February 2007 as an initiative of prominent private citizens, scientists and policy-makers on both the Vietnamese and US sides, working on issues that the two countries’ governments have found difficult to address. It is not an implementing agency nor a fundraising organization. Its role has been to call attention to the need for five key actions to be undertaken in a humanitarian spirit: to establish treatment and education centers for Vietnamese with disabilities; cooperate with the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to contain and clean up dioxin, beginning at three priority airport "hot spots"; set up a modern dioxin testing laboratory in Vietnam; foster programs for training of trainers in restoration and management of damaged landscapes; and educate the U.S. public on the issues. Leading the Vietnamese side is Ambassador Ngo Quang Xuan, vice chair of the Vietnamese National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, and leading the U.S. side is [[Walter Isaacson]], president and CEO of the [[Aspen Institute]]. The convener of the group is [[Susan Berresford]], former President of the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://host.madison.com/ct/news/opinion/column/article_c2e8fcd6-0477-59d8-8cdf-8c01613b153c.html Susan V.

On June 16, 2010, members of the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin unveiled a comprehensive 10-year Declaration and Plan of Action to address the toxic legacy of Agent Orange and other herbicides in Vietnam. The Plan of Action was released as an Aspen Institute publication and calls upon the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to join with other governments, foundations, businesses, and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin "hot spots" in Vietnam, and to expand humanitarian services for people with disabilities in that country.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37735860/ Plan addresses Agent Orange legacy in Vietnam - World news - World environment | NBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.spc-rep.html Special Report: Agent Orange] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901175643/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.spc-rep.html |date=2012-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2010, Senator Patrick Leahy (D- VT) acknowledged the work of the Dialogue Group by releasing a statement on the floor of the United States Senate.

The '''University of Brighton Design Archives''' centres on British and global design organisations of the twentieth century. It is located within the [[University of Brighton]] Grand Parade campus in the heart of [[Brighton]] and is an international research resource.  It has many archival collections that were generated by design institutions and individual designers&lt;ref&gt;University of Brighton, "Design Archives; Projects and Exhibitions" http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/projects (accessed 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The University of Brighton Design Archives has its origins in the deposit of the archive of the [[Design Council]] (formerly the Council of Industrial Design) in 1994. The organisation was restructured by recommendation of the 1993–94,"Future Design Council" report (also known as the Sorrell Report) and consequently its records needed to be relocated.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-us/our-history/ Design Council website]&lt;/ref&gt;
Various repositories were considered and the [[University of Brighton]] was selected since it offered the newly established Design History Research Centre (DHRC) led by Professor Jonathan Woodham and Dr Patrick Maguire, who provided research expertise in the area of design and the state. In 1996 an award from the [[Getty Foundation]] Archive Program supported not only the acquisition of the Design Council Archive but also the appointment of a curator and a research officer.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham, Jonathan; Lyon, Philippa, eds.. Art and Design at Brighton 1859–2009: from Arts and Manufactures to the Creative and Cultural Industries. (2009) p18 Brighton: University of Brighton. world war 2
  {{ISBN|978-1-905593-58-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections development ==

The Design Archives has developed its collections since the 1990s and each archive has been acquired according to a specific collecting policy; to document aspects of twentieth-century design history with a strategic focus on the connections between them. Acquisitions have included the archives of [[James Gardner (designer)|James Gardner]] and [[Henri Kay Henrion|FHK Henrion]], who both worked with the [[Council of Industrial Design]] (later the Design Council) in the early parts of their career.  Subsequent additions of individual designer's archives include those of [[Alison Settle]] a journalist and editor of [[Vogue (British magazine)|British Vogue]], and Council member in the 1950s; whose archive had been deposited in the University's library.

The archives of [[Bernard Schottlander]], [[Paul Clark (designer)|Paul Clark]], and [[Barbara Jones (artist)|Barbara Jones]], designers from different periods each having connections with the Design Council's work. Communication designers [[Hans Arnold Rothholz|HA Rothholz]], [[Edwin Embleton]] and [[Anthony Froshaug]]. Architects [[Joseph Emberton]] and [[Theo Crosby]], and the display and set designer, [[Natasha Kroll]].

The archive also holds a collection of papers reflecting all aspects of the work of engineer, designer and former senior project officer at the Design Council, [[WH Mayall]].

The acquisition of the archive of the International Council of Graphic Design Associations ([[Ico-D|ICOGRADA]]) in 2002-3 marked the development of an international perspective for the collection. ICOGRADA is the professional world body for graphic design and visual communication, founded in London in 1963. The ICOGRADA archive comprises a significant body of documentation relating to governance, administration and educational activities, an important collection of 1500 posters from around the world, and library holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/archives/icograda-archive | title=ICOGRADA Archive | publisher=University of Brighton Design Archives | accessdate=23 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design]] (ICSID) archive came to the University of Brighton and further extended the international reach of the Design Archives.

== Online access ==

Since 2005 the Design Archives has contributed catalogue data to the [[Archives Hub]], a gateway to thousands of archives across more than 200 UK institutions. Records are added regularly as part of the Design Archives' ongoing cataloguing programme. Increasingly, digital objects are being added to these records.

Online access to the Design Archives' visual resources has been available in digital form since 1997–1998 with the JIDI: JISC Image Digitisation Initiative, which funded the digitisation of parts of the Design Council Photographic Library, including the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]] material.  In 1999, the Archives participated in [[Scran]] (Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network), contributing images of exhibits at the 1947 Enterprise Scotland Exhibition. A further 3,000 images were added to the [[VADS (organisation)|Visual Arts Data Service]] for free public access in 2001.

In 2000, the Design Archives developed a more structured e-learning resource, 'Designing Britain 1945–1975: The Visual Experience of Post-War Society'. A £132,000 grant from [[Jisc]] supported the creation of seven modules, each containing around 100 visual records and contextual texts by subject specialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vads.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/about.html Designing Britain website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Design Archives was one of eleven image collections to take part in the JISC-funded 'Digital Images for Education' project, receiving £43,000 in funding, and delivering over 2,300 images from across the wealth of its holdings to this subscription-based service, launched in 2011. The key emphasis of this resource is on film and digital images that capture local history, UK history, and world history during the preceding 25 years.  The Archives was also among nine Higher Education partners contributing data and expertise to the "Look Here!" Project, funded and led by the Visual Arts Data Service. In 2015 the Design Archives won funding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amplification Awards|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/amplificationawards/|website=Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] for the project Exploring British Design, a prototype web portal to connect information about British design held in different museums, archives and libraries.

== Recent recognition ==

In 2009 the Design Archives team was expanded as a result of further investment by the University of Brighton.

In recognition of its national and international role in higher education, the Design Archives received a 3-year [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) grant of £180,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Snoad, Laura. [http://www.designweek.co.uk/design-archives-gets-higher-education-grant/3017052.article "Design Archives gets higher education grant."] Design Week 25, 32 (13 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The award followed a review of university museums and galleries, led by Sir [[Muir Russell]], which resulted in HEFCE widening its definition of university collections eligible for support. In 2017, the Design Archives successfully reapplied for funding from this competitive source for the next four years.

The Design Archives now form part of a group of 33 university museum, galleries and collections to receive this direct support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=413043 "Cash for design archive.’] Times Higher Education Supplement (19 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The industry publication ''[[Design Week]]'' named the Design Archives as one of the five key design research collections in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Snoad, Laura. [http://www.designweek.co.uk/step-into-the-past/3014392.article "Step into the Past."] Design Week 25, no. 23 (10 June 2010): p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11106">'''World Federation for Medical Education''' (WFME) is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]] concerned with education and training of medical doctors worldwide. WFME’s main objective is to "enhance the quality of medical education worldwide, with promotion of the highest scientific and ethical standards in medical education". The organisation develops standards for medical education and promotes accreditation of medical schools. It also co-manages the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME works in partnership with its six Regional Associations for Medical Education&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/about/member-associations|title=WFME Member Associations|last=|first=|date=|website=wfme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other international organisations including the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/register-nonstate-actors/nsa.aspx?id=151|title=WHO Register of non-State actors (Pilot)|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Medical Association]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/alliance-and-partner/partners/|title=WMA - The World Medical Association-Partners|website=www.wma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with WFME’s associate members, and with medical schools worldwide.

== History ==
WFME was founded on the 30 September 1972 in [[Copenhagen]]. The founding organisations included the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[World Medical Association]] (WMA).

In 1988 the Edinburgh declaration was approved at the World Conference on Medical Education, calling for greater co-operation between the health system and the education system, reflecting national needs in medical education and continuing lifelong education of medical staff to achieve quality in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/wfme-publications/99-the-edinburgh-declaration/file|title=The Edinburgh Declaration 1989|last=|first=|date=|website=wfme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/172229/1/WHA42_R38_eng.pdf|title=Edinburgh Declaration on the reform of medical education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of medical education responding to the national needs was also stressed at the World Summit on Medical Education 1993.

WFME participated in the Global Consensus Project for Social Accountability of Medical Schools initiated in 2010, which further focused on the co-operation and link between medical education and the society, highlighting the necessity to meet the health care needs of patients and societies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/documents/about-wfme/79-wfme-history-of-the-first-forty-years-1972-2012/file|title=WFME History of the first 40 years|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2008-2014 WFME maintained the [[Avicenna Directories|Avicenna]] directory, a public database of worldwide&amp;nbsp;[[medical schools]],&amp;nbsp;[[Pharmacy school|schools of pharmacy]], schools of&amp;nbsp;[[public health]]&amp;nbsp;and educational institutions of other academic health professions, which was later merged with [[International Medical Education Directory|IMED]] to create the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/about/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools {{!}} About|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME previously had offices in Bethesda, [[Maryland]] (USA) and [[Edinburgh]] (UK), and most recently in [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark) and Ferney-Voltaire (France). The organisation is currently registered in the UK and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uia.org/s/or/en/1100024502|title=World Federation for Medical Education {{!}} Yearbook Profile {{!}} Union of International Associations|website=www.uia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/home/contact|title=WFME Contact page|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The three major projects WFME currently prioritises are the creation of global standards&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/standards|title=WFME Standards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for quality improvement of medical education, managing the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/directories|title=WFME Directories|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Recognition of Accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/accreditation|title=WFME Accreditation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing Global Standards, the WFME appointed three International Task Forces, one for each of the three phases of medical education:
* basic (undergraduate) Medical Education (BME)
* postgraduate medical education (PME)
* continuing medical education (CME)/professional development of medical doctors (CPD)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Building on the standards, WFME provides guidance on establishing medical schools in the context of global standards but also with respect to the national need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/guidance|title=WFME Criteria for establishment of a new medical school|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with FAIMER, WFME co-manages the [[World Directory of Medical Schools|World Directory of Medical School]], a public database of medical schools worldwide.&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"/&gt;

WFME Recognition Programme aims to ensure that [[accreditation]] of medical schools in the world, is at an internationally accepted standard. WFME awards Recognition Status to the [[accrediting agencies]] that apply and are assessed to be up to the agreed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/accreditation/accrediting-accreditors/recognition-process|title=WFME Recognition process|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]] published&amp;nbsp;a press release stating that students applying for [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]] Certification&amp;nbsp;after 2023 will be required to have graduated from a medical school that has been "appropriately accredited by an agency that uses criteria comparable to those established for U.S. medical schools by the&amp;nbsp;[[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME)&amp;nbsp;or that uses other globally accepted criteria, such as WFME’s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/forms/9212010.press.release.pdf|title=ECFMG 2023 press release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME also develops a project on the Role of the Doctor in the modern society, reflecting the changing position of the medical professions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/role-of-the-doctor|title=WFME Role of the Doctor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
WFME strategy is developed and agreed at the yearly Executive Council meeting. The Executive Council includes &amp;nbsp;the directors of the six regional organisations, representatives of the founding organisations ([[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Medical Association|WMA]]) and collaborating organisations ([[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]], [[International Federation of Medical Students' Associations|IFMSA]]) The [[Junior Doctors Network]] of WMA also attends by invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/about/executive-council|title=WFME Executive council|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
