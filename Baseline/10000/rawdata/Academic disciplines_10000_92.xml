'''Advanced Placement Environmental Science''' ('''AP Environmental Science''', '''APES''',  '''AP Enviro''', '''AP Environmental''', '''AP Environment''', or '''AP Envi. Sci.''') is a course offered by the [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]] to [[high school]] students interested in the [[environmental science|environmental]] and [[natural science]]s. This course is designed to provide students with scientific principles, concepts, and methodologies necessary to comprehend the relationships abundant within the natural world, to identify and analyze environmental problems, to evaluate relative risks associated with these identified problems, and to examine alternative solutions for resolving and/or preventing similar problems facing the global environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barlaz | first1 = Dora | last2 = Freudenrich | first2 = Craig | last3 = Gardner | first3 = Jane | title = AP Environmental Science 2011 | publisher = Kaplan Publishing | year = 2011 | location = New York, New York | accessdate = 2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of students scoring a grade of "5" was only 7.4% in the 2016 testing administration. It remains one of the lowest "5" scoring AP Exams to this date right under AP Art History, AP English Literature &amp; Composition, AP English Language &amp; Composition, and AP World History.

Each summary should be a concise exposition of the source's central idea(s) and give the reader a general idea of the source's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliographies|url=http://writing.ku.edu/bibliographies|website=KU Writing Center|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annbib3&gt;{{cite web |title=Annotated Bibliographies|author=Geoff Stacks, Erin Karper |year=2001 |publisher=Purdue University |url=http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/general/gl_annotatedbib.html |accessdate=2009-10-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907132223/http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/general/gl_annotatedbib.html| archivedate=September 7, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main Components of Annotated Bibliographies ==
The following are the main components of an annotated bibliography. It is important to note that not all fields shown below must be used at once in an annotated bibliography. The fields may vary depending on the type of annotated bibliography and special instructions from the instructor in case the bibliography is part of a school assignment.
* '''Full bibliographic citation :''' An annotated bibliography must contain the necessary and complete bibliographical information i.e. (author, title, publisher and date, etc),
* '''Author’s Background:''' You should provide the name, authority, experience, or qualifications of the author.
* '''Purpose of the work:''' You should provide the reasons why the author wrote the work
* '''Scope of the work:''' You should state the breadth or depth of coverage and topics or sub-topics covered.
* '''Main argument:''' State the main informative points of the paper
* '''Audience:''' For whom was it written (general public, subject specialists, student?
* '''Methodology:''' What methodology and research methods did the work employ? 
* '''Viewpoint:''' What is the author’s perspective or approach (school of thought, etc.)? Do you detect an unacknowledged bias, or find any undefended assumptions?
* '''Sources:''' Does the author cite other sources, and if so, what types? Is it based on the author’s own research? Is it personal opinion?
* '''Reliability of the source:''' How reliable is the work?  
* '''Conclusion:''' What does the author conclude about the work? Is the conclusion justified by the work?
* '''Features:''' Any significant extras, e.g. visual aids (charts, maps, etc.), reprints of source documents, an annotated bibliography?
* '''Strengths and Weaknesses:''' What are the strengths and weaknesses of the work?
* '''Comparison:''' How does the source relate to other works done by other writers on the topic: does it agree or disagree with another author or a particular school of thought; are there other works which would support or dispute it?
* '''Your Voice / Personal Conclusion:''' Provide your point of view of the work or your reaction to the source based on other available works, prior knowledge of the subject matter or knowledge pools done by other researchers.

==Types of annotations==
Annotations may be written with different goals in mind. There are three types of annotations, depending on what might be most important for your reader or according to your professor’s instructions.It is impossible to describe a standard procedure for all types of annotations because one annotation does not fit all purposes. In order to know the best type of annotation, it is prudent to consult your instructor or follow the instructions. For example, if the assignment states that your annotative bibliography should give evidence proving an analytical understanding of the sources you have used, then you are supposed to write an analytical annotated bibliography which includes evaluation of the sources you are using. The three types of annotated bibliographies are; summary annotations, critical annotations and a combination of the former two.

'''Summary annotations'''

Summary annotations are further classified into informative and indicative annotations.

The following are the main features of summary annotations:
* They show a summary of the source content
* They highlight the arguments and proofs/evidence mentioned in the work
* They sometimes describe the author’s methodology and any theories used
* They offer the conclusion of the source 
* They do not evaluate the work they are discussing
'''Informative Annotations'''

This type of annotation is a summary of the source. An informative annotation should include the thesis of the work, arguments or hypothesis, proofs and a conclusion.&lt;ref name=annbib&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/AnnBib_content.html |title=Annotated Bibliographies: Content |location=Madison |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison: The Writing Center |work=Writer's Handbook |accessdate=2008-03-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080304040827/http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/AnnBib_content.html| archivedate= 4 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informative annotations provide a straight summary of the source material.

They summarise all relevant information about the author and the main points of the work.

To write an informative annotation, begin by writing the thesis; then develop it with the argument or hypothesis, list the proofs, and state the conclusion

'''Indicative annotated bibliographies'''

Indicative annotations do not provide actual information from the source.

They provide overall information about what kinds of questions or issues are addressed by the work, for example, through chapter titles.

In the indicative entry, there is no attempt to give actual data such as hypotheses, proofs, etc.

===Evaluative annotations===
This type of annotation assesses the source's strengths and weaknesses, in terms of usefulness and quality.&lt;ref name=annbib /&gt;

Evaluative annotated bibliographies do more than just summarising, they provide critical appraisals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://help.library.ubc.ca/planning-your-research/how-to-write-an-annotated-bibliography/|title=How to Write an Annotated Bibliography|last=The University of British Columbia|first=|date=August 10, 2016|website=Planning Your Research|publisher=The University of British Columbia|access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They evaluate the source or author critically to find any biases, lack of evidence, objectives, etc.

They show how the work may or may not be useful for a particular field of study or audience.

They explain how researching this material assisted your own project.

===Combination annotations===
Most annotated bibliographies contain combination annotations. This type of annotation will summarize or describe the topic, and then evaluate the source's usefulness and a summary. Usually also includes a detailed analysis on the reason the article was written.&lt;ref name=annbib /&gt;

== Formats of writing annotated bibliographies ==
Annotated bibliographies contain two main sections; the bibliographic information section and the annotations section.

Since the formats may slightly vary from one institution to another and amongst scholars and researchers depending on the regulations, courses and materials being annotated, it is imperative to ask for specific guidelines.

'''The bibliographic information'''

There are also bibliography annotations that combine all three types (MLA, APA and Chicago style). When deciding on the style for your annotated bibliography, consider its purpose and the instructions given to you by your supervisor. Regardless of the formatting style required at your institution, all annotated bibliography pieces need to follow the same rule: the author’s last name should be the only part that is flush left, while the rest of the text requires to be indented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://domywriting.com/blog/annotated-bibliography-example/ ''Annotated Bibliography Example''] from the DoMyWriting's blog 2018. Retrieved August 07, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The bibliographic information is written before the annotation using the suitable referencing style. The information is normally identified using a hanging indent.

Generally, though, the bibliographic information of the source (the title, author, publisher, date, etc.) is written in either MLA or APA format.

'''The annotations'''

The annotations for each source are written in paragraph form.

The lengths of the annotations can vary significantly from a couple of sentences to a couple of pages.

The length of the annotation should be between 100 to 200 words.

When writing summaries of sources, the annotations may not be very long.

However, when writing an extensive analysis of each source, more space may be needed.

A few sentences of general summary followed by several sentences of how you can fit the work into your larger paper or project can serve you well when you go to draft.

==Writing==
Sample entry of an [[APA style]] annotated bibliography:
{{quote box
| border = 2px
| align = left
| bgcolor = Cornsilk
| title = Murray, S. (2009). ''The library: An illustrated history'' (ALA ed.). Chicago, IL: Skyhorse Publishing.
| halign = left
| quote = &lt;poem&gt;
Murray's book offers an in-depth look at the history of libraries since ancient times. He
incorporates beautiful illustrations, quotations, and descriptions of numerous libraries
worldwide. This book states the history of the evolution of the book from era to era.
It also serves as a primary source of information for research in library history. This
is a good book that should be of interest to book lovers and librarians.
&lt;/poem&gt;
| salign = right

'''Appreciative listening''' is a type of listening behavior where the listener seeks certain information which they will appreciate, for example that which helps meet his/her needs and goals. One uses appreciative listening when listening to good [[music]], [[poetry]] or maybe even the stirring words of a great leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=John A.|title=Types of Listening|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/kline-listen/b10ch4.htm|accessdate=18 September 2011 | publisher=Air University Press |location=Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama | date=April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Team Approach to Behaviour Management |page=43 |first1=Chris |last1=Derrington |first2=Barry |last2=Groom |publisher=Paul Chapman Publishing |year=2004 |url=http://childhealthanddevelopment.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/different-types-of-listening.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It involves listening to music that one enjoys, people the listener likes to listen to because of their style and the choices the listener make in the films and television he/she watches, radio programmes and plays and musicals in the theatre.  Unlike [[informative listening]] or [[relationship listening]], appreciative listening does not rely on the message from the speaker it is how one responds as a listener.  Our appreciation of what we hear will vary depending on our individual tastes, but will also be affected by three different factors:

== Presentation ==
There are many different factors that encompass [[presentation]] including the medium, the setting and the style and personality of a presenter. Of course this works both ways and equally you will have been entranced by others because of the force of their personality and their delivery style.

The environment can also impact your appreciation of the presentation. Seating, temperature, clarity and volume of sound will all impact on whether it’s a good or poor experience.

== Perception ==
Perception is an important factor in appreciative listening. As one is exposed to different experiences his/her perceptions can change. For example: individual's taste in music. We need to listen to various [[List of music styles|types of music]] to have a preference over other types and appreciate them. An individual's expectations also affects our perception. 

An individual's perception and expectations are driven by his/her attitudes which determine how he/she reacts to and interact to the world in which he/she lives.

== Previous experience ==
Some of our perceptions are clearly influenced by our previous experience and impact on whether or not we enjoy listening to something, or whether we are even willing to listen. Whether our memories evoke pleasant or unpleasant reminders will affect our appreciation. However, it’s important to remain open to new experiences.  We can develop our appreciative listening skills.

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2131">The '''Assimitron''' was a Japanese device uses to measure fluctuating CO2 levels at crop canopies. Led by E. Inoue at the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences in [[Tsukuba]], [[Japan]], the device itself was an offshoot of an earlier Australian invention, the Evapotron that first found mention in a 1958 article in the journal ''Nature.'' The Evaporimeter, as it was first called, was used to measure the evaporations from natural surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Taylor &amp; A.J. Dyer, An Instrument for Measuring Evaporation from Natural Surfaces, Nature 181 (Feb 8, 1958): 408-409.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Assimitron, it “instantaneously” performed “the necessary calculations for determining water vapour flux by correlation of humidity fluctuations with vertical wind fluctuations.”.&lt;ref&gt;E. Inoue, Z. Uchijima, T. Saito, S. Isobe, and K. Uemura, ‘The “Assimitron”, a Newly Devised Instrument for Measuring CO2 flux in the Surface Air Layer,’ Journal of Agricultural Meteorology, Tokyo 25 (1969): 165-171, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Such calculations required the use of a complex centralized computer to process the enormous quantities of data. Part of this stemmed from the need to perform two different equations to deal with turbulent and low flows, depending on whether it was a windy or sunny day.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Uchijima, “Carbon dioxide environment and flux within a corn crop canopy,” in Prediction and Measurement of Photosynthetic Productivity (Wageningen: Centre for Agricultural Publishing and Documentation, 1970): 179-196, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3128">'''Atticism''' (meaning "favouring [[Attica]]", the region of [[Athens]] in [[Greece]]) was a [[rhetoric]]al movement that began in the first quarter of the 1st century BC; it may also refer to the wordings and phrasings typical of this movement, in contrast with various contemporary forms of Koine [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] (both literary and vulgar), which continued to evolve in directions guided by the common usages of [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] Greek.

Atticism was portrayed as a return to Classical methods after what was perceived as the pretentious style of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Sophist]] rhetoric and called for a return to the approaches of the [[Attic orators]].

Although the plainer language of Atticism eventually became as belabored and ornate as the [[peroration]]s it sought to replace, its original simplicity meant that it remained universally comprehensible throughout the Greek world. This helped maintain vital cultural links across the [[Mediterranean]] and beyond. Admired and popularly imitated writers such as [[Lucian]] also adopted Atticism, so that the style survived until the [[Renaissance era|Renaissance]], when it was taken up by non-[[Greek people|Greek]] students of [[Byzantine]] expatriates. [[Renaissance]] scholarship, the basis of modern scholarship in the west, nurtured strong Classical and Attic views, continuing Atticism for another four centuries.

Represented at its height by rhetoricians such as [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], and grammarians such as [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]] and [[Phrynichus Arabius]] at [[Alexandria]], this tendency prevailed from the 1st century BC onward, and with the force of an ecclesiastical dogma controlled all subsequent Greek culture, even so that the living form of the Greek language, even then being transformed into modern Greek much later, was quite obscured and only occasionally found expression, chiefly in private documents, though also in popular literature.

For instance, there were literary writers such as [[Strabo]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Josephus]] who intentionally withdrew from this way of expression ([[classical Greek]]) in favor of the common form of Greek.

In painting, the so-called "Parisian Atticism" is a particular movemement in French painting of the 17th century, spanning approximatively between 1640 and 1660, when famous painters working in Paris like [[Eustache Le Sueur]] or [[Jacques Stella]] elaborated a rigorous classicist style, characterized by a research of sobriety, luminosity and harmony and references to the Greco-Roman world.

BUPT comprises 17 schools, and has an international school program with [[Queen Mary University of London]]. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university was created in 1955 under the [[Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]] and the Communications Department of the General Staff Department of the [[People's Liberation Army]]. The name was changed from Institute to University in 1993. It is the most famous and renowned university in the field of telecommunications in China.

==History==
BUPT is one of the 73 Key National Universities under the administration of the [[Chinese Ministry of Education]]. The university was founded in 1955 as the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. It was the tertiary institution for teaching and research in the post and telecommunications fields. In 1993, it was renamed to Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).

The university offers a wide range of subjects including engineering, management, humanities and sciences. Most of its subjects and disciplines are related to applied science and engineering. BUPT enjoys a nationwide reputation for innovation and excellence in advanced research and learning in information and communication technology. It serves as one of the most important teaching and research bases for the information technology and telecommunication industry in China.

Directly administered by the [[Ministry of Education]], BUPT is one of the first 61 universities that were listed in the Project "211" Universities in 1995, which aims at strengthening 100 National Key Universities as a national priority for the 21st century. Since then, BUPT has greatly improved its quality of education, scientific research, management and institutional efficiency. In order to provide favorable academic environment, BUPT has established a complete campus network embracing the library, staff rooms, research centers, dormitories etc. Great efforts have also been made in bringing up a number of academic leaders and competent teachers who have high academic attainments and are prestigious both at home and abroad. In particular, the training of young academic leaders has been accelerated, and more and more outstanding talents are attracted to work at BUPT.

=== BUPT today ===
BUPT is one of the 56 universities in China that are authorized to formally form a Graduate school by the General Office of the Academic Degree of the State Council after a long time of painstaking experiment. The Graduate School has developed complete graduate programs that cover the disciplines of engineering, science, economics, administration, law and philosophy. It is also one of the earliest universities in China that has officially been authorized to offer doctoral and master programs.

In the 2005–2006 academic year, BUPT offers 33 undergraduate programs, 34 postgraduate programs, two professional degrees - MBA and Master of Engineering and 12 doctoral programs to the domestic and overseas students.

One of the indicators of the strength of a [[brand]] in the hearts and minds of customers, '''brand preference''' represents which brands are preferred under assumptions of equality in price and availability.

== Purpose ==

Measures of brand preference attempt to quantify the impact of [[marketing]] activities in the hearts and minds of customers and potential customers. Higher brand preference usually indicates more revenues (sales) and profit, also making it an indicator of company financial performance.

== Construction ==
There are at least three classes of methodologies to measure brand preference directly: 
* [[Statistical survey|Survey]] questions (self-report, unaided preference)
* Brand choice measures (choice of preferred brand from a competitive set of brands)
* Constant sum measures (planned purchases amongst a competitive set of brands)

The '''''Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum''''' is a late renaissance (c.1619-1620) [[grimoire]] and esoteric print of calendar engravings.  Its full title is ''Magnum Grimorium sive Calendarium Naturale Magicum Perpetuum Profundissimam Rerum Secretissimarum Contemplationem Totiusque Philosophiae Cognitionem Complectens''. It is in three sheets, measuring more than four feet long and about two feet wide, and includes an early example of a [[Yahshuah|Pentagrammaton]].

The "author" in the 1619 (or 1620) Frankfurt print is given as [[Johann Baptist Grossschedel]] von Aicha (Frankfurt 1620), and attributes some of the engravings to [[Tycho Brahe]]. The original engraver is given as [[Theodor de Bry]] (Flemish-born German engraver, 1528–98) as originally published in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/manuscripts/search/detail_c.cfm?ID=44336 Glasgow University Library catalogue entry] "This is a copy of the ''Calendarium Naturale Magicum'', compiled by Grossschedel von Aicha and published by de Bry in 1620. The emblematic figures from the original engraving have been cut up into individual sections and pasted into this manuscript, and the text from the original plate added in black and red lettering. Each page is set within a red border decorated at the top. The ''Calendarium Naturale Magicum'' is thus analysed in its various sections 'Tabula Prima... Tabula Duodecima'. Additional text material in way of explanation and examples has been added to the sections within the Tabula Septima dealing with the seven planetary onomantic tables of fortune."&lt;/ref&gt; The 1620 engraver used by Grossschedel may be [[Matthäus Merian the Elder]] (Swiss engraver, 1593–1650).&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Avery Hunt, Margaret C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17863">'''Cognitive valence theory''' ('''CVT''') is a theoretical framework that describes and explains the process of intimacy exchange within a dyad relationship. [[Peter A. Andersen]],{{Who?|date=November 2015}} PhD created the cognitive valence theory to answer questions regarding intimacy relationships among colleagues, close friends and intimate friends, married couples and family members.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; Intimacy or immediacy behavior is that behavior that provides closeness or distance within a dyad relationship. Closeness projects a positive feeling in a relationship, and distance projects a negative feeling within a relationship. Intimacy or immediacy behavior can be ''negatively valenced'' or ''positively valenced''.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valence (psychology)|Valence]], associated with [[physics]], is used here to describe the degree of negativity or positivity in expected information. If your partner perceives your actions as negative, then the interaction may repel your partner away from you. If your partner perceives your actions as positive, then the interaction may be accepted and may encourage closeness. Affection and intimacy promotes positive valence in a relationship. CVT uses non-verbal and verbal communications criteria to analyze behavioral situations.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive valence theory: the focus of CVT==

CVT focuses on how intimate relationships are initiated and why only a few relationships are extended past initial contact.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; CVT employs six factors or [[schema (psychology)|schemata]] to explain verbal and non-verbal intimacy behaviors, interpersonal perceptions, physiological arousal, social cognition and relational outcomes within a specified relationship.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1985, pp. 1-36"&gt;Andersen, 1985, pp. 1–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1989, np"&gt;Andersen, 1989, np&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1998, pp. 39-72"&gt;Andersen, 1998, pp. 39–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, pp. 228-237"&gt;Andersen, 1999, pp. 228–237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp.181–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 512-514&lt;/ref&gt; CVT utilizes six types of schemata that regulate interpersonal interaction: culture, personality, interpersonal valence, situation, state, and the relationship.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1985, pp. 1-36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1989, np"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1998, pp. 39-72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, pp. 228-237"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp.181–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517&lt;/ref&gt; Each schema explores intimacy or immediacy behavior when interlaced with human emotion. CVT focuses on these six schemata in relations to moderate levels of arousal in human emotions. Moderate levels of arousal are acceptable in a dyad relationship, but high levels of arousal may cause undue excitement, panic, fear, anger and disorientation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"/&gt;

== Nonverbal and verbal communications ==

[[Nonverbal communication]] is the process of communications by sending and receiving messages without speaking. Intimate relations may be affected by the use of nonverbal communications. Nonverbal communications are transmitted through messaging that utilizes [[haptic communication]]s (touching, hugs, kisses and caressing someone); [[body language]] (physical appearance, posture, gestures and eye contact); [[oculesics]] (or eye behavior, including pupil dilation); [[kinesics]] (facial expressions and receptive contact from others); and [[chronemics]] (time spent with someone else or waiting for someone).&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515-517"/&gt; All these nonverbal behaviors can affect intimacy or immediacy within a relationship.

[[Verbal communication]] or dialogue communications also plays an important part in a dyad relationship. While nonverbal communication provides a forum conducive to wordless conversation, verbal conversation can provide the monologue or dialogue to vocally express personal feelings, emotions and supplement nonverbal actions. However, research has shown that only 7% of all communications is directly related to verbal communications. Research further reports that 38% of communications are by the tone of voice and 55% of communication is determined by body language—posture, gestures and eye contact.&lt;ref name="Mehrabian &amp; Ferris, 1967"&gt;Mehrabian &amp; Ferris, 1967, pp. 248–252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative and positive valence ===

Negative valence behavior is [[nonverbal communication]] transmission of a behavioral feeling or emotion received in a negative manner. The receiver perceives the negative transmission and may repel your contact or interaction. As in physics, negative particles repel which may cause the receiver of the transmission or communication to avoid your contact.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; As the example stated above, initial contact of noticing another person in the grocery store or gas station may not be returned, through an acknowledgement of the initiator’s smile or gesture or the gesture of acknowledgement may purport a stare, frown or other look suggesting “leave me alone” or “not interested.” Intimacy or immediacy may be detrimental to a relationship if that immediacy is negatively accepted by the receiver.

Positive valence behavior is another non-verbal transmission of a behavioral feeling or emotion from one person to another and received in a positive manner. The receiver perceives the positive transmission and may be attracted to that person.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Positive behavior may affect intimacy or immediacy within the dyad relationship, but this positive behavior must be recognized and acknowledged by the receiver or partner.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, pp. 181–185&lt;/ref&gt; Initial contact within an impending dyad relationship may be as simple as noticing another person in a grocery store or gas station. A first look or glance from the initiator may be returned with a smile or gesture of acknowledgement by the receiver. This gesture may then be returned to the initiator as a positive, and further contact may be encouraged.

== Cognitive schemata ==

Andersen (1993, Planap, 1985) suggests that cognitive schemata or our social knowledge help interpret various social interactions. CVT incorporates these six schemata into the regulation or guidance of interpersonal interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===

[[Culture]] is the total expression of one’s behavior patterns, arts, values, goals, and practices of a population or community.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary"&gt;Merriam-Webster collegiate dictionary, 2002, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geertz]] (1973) further argues “…this school of thought holds that culture is composed of psychological structures by means of which individuals or groups of individuals guide their behavior”.&lt;ref name="Geertz, 1973"&gt;Geertz, 1973, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Culture plays a definitive role in the formation of human behavior. In some cultures, it is permissible to hold hands; other cultures this open act of compassion is forbidden. Looking or gazing upon another is accepted; other cultures, the eyes are not directed at anyone not of your family. Public affection is acceptable in one country but to kiss, touch or hold someone’s hand is blasphemous. This behavior may be deemed negatively valenced.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===

[[Personality type|Personality]] or [[personality traits]] also affect intimacy or immediacy within a dyad relationship. Just as humans differ in their size, weight and emotional attributes, human personalities differ in their degree of sociability, their likes and dislikes, the level of tolerance towards shyness and openness and their adherence to [[proxemics]] or the distance displaced from one person towards another. Essentially, this is where knowing your partner’s personality is crucial to a happy relationship. This relationship promotes positive valence or misinterpreting your partner’s personality may promote a negative valence.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 513&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpersonal valence ===

Interpersonal Valence can be best described as a nonverbal communication typology. A touch from someone you like is received differently than an unwanted touch. Interpersonal valence has a positive affect for socially and physically attractive people and a negative valence for those not so attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of attraction may be within the initiator’s point of view or may also be perceived from the receiver.

=== State ===
Andersen argues here that [[:wikt:mental state|state]] is the internal, short-term condition affecting communications.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; This form of state suggests that external behavioral situations affect one’s internal behavioral, coping adaptability. Simply, disagreements at home or at the office signal a negative valence of immediacy or intimacy. An argument with your boss or a disrespectful employee may lower your internal coping adaptability, and negative valence emerges. However, one’s acceptance of intimacy or immediacy is higher when positive valence is experienced. A good day at the office, congratulations on the successful completion a special project or a home cooked meal may amplify positive valence and increase immediacy or intimacy.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt;

=== The relationship ===

The relationship is the most important part of the cognitive schemata model.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; Partnership within a dyad has numerous labels. Within relationships ([[interpersonal relationships]]), we label our dyad partners as acquaintances, friends, colleagues, professional coworkers, personal friends, family members, fellow college students and college professors and, those people whose paths cross with ours simply as convenient contacts.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Each dyad partner, whether initial or long-term may display a level of intimacy or immediacy based on a degree of appropriateness for the situation. Public forums are the stage in which positive or negative valence performs. As stated earlier, an unwanted look or a touch may heighten the degree of negative valence. In contrast, a look or an accepted touch may heighten the degree of positive valence and be the most desirable behavior for each of the dyad partners. Relationships are dependent upon both partners and their commitment to the dyad. Relationships therefore are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive Valence Theory or CVT offers one explanation for this fragility. Negative valence received from any of the cognitive schemata can result in a negative relational outcome.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, p. 229"&gt;Andersen, 1999, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Negative valence reduces the intimacy or immediacy strength within a relationship. Negative valence can also thwart healthy dyad growth by heightening the lack of love and care within the dyad. Positive valence acts in a 180 degree fashion as positive feeling promotes growth and strengthens the love and care within the dyad. With positive valence, there can still be risks, but the rewards may outweigh the costs.

=== Valence violations ===

As mentioned above, valence is the degree of positivity or negativity in expected information. Relational outcomes will become negatively valenced when violations occur within the six schemata. Negative valence here can be associated with the amount of relationships we initially form and the amount of relationships that become long lasting.&lt;ref name="Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008"/&gt; Andersen’s cognitive valence theory points out (under relational outcome) how violations of any of the six schemata will affect a dyad relationship. Negative violations can result in (1) negative cognitive and affective appraisals of your partner; (2) compensation/reduction intimacy behaviors, and (3) reductions in relational closeness or disengagement.&lt;ref name="Andersen, 1999, p. 229"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; The theory further describes the degree of positivity associated with positive relational outcomes within a dyad relationship. Andersen’s cognitive valence theory also points that (under relational outcome) how positive valenced intimacy can  show (1) positive cognitive and affective appraisals of one’s partner; (2) reciprocity or an increase in intimacy behaviors, and (3) increase in relational growth and closeness.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related theories ==

[[Expectancy violations theory]] (EVT) focuses on people’s reactions to unexpected human behavior. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics of the communicators.&lt;ref name="McPherson &amp; Yuhua, 2007"&gt;McPherson &amp; Yuhua, 2007, pp. 18–33&lt;/ref&gt; EVT requires determining whether one interactant's behavior change qualifies as a positive or negative violation. Within the realm of involvement and immediacy changes, it predicts that (a) unexpected positive behavior by a positively valenced interactant will produce reciprocal behavior, (b) unexpected negative behavior by a positively valenced interactant will produce compensatory behavior, (c) unexpected negative behavior by a negatively valenced interactant will produce reciprocal negative behavior, and (d) unexpected positive behavior by a negatively valenced interactant may produce either reciprocal or compensatory behavior, depending on which is more salient – the valence of the behavior or the valence of the interactant.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"&gt;Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995, pp. 251–279&lt;/ref&gt; The Arousal-Labeling theory (ALT) likewise posits that both compensation and reciprocity may occur, but the focus of this model is on how the undifferentiated arousal engendered by a partner's behavior change is effectively labeled – positive labels producing reciprocity and negative labels producing compensation.&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt; Discrepancy-Arousal theory (DAT) combines arousal and affect with expectancies, predicting that discrepancies from expected behavior patterns produce arousal change, that moderate arousal change is effectively positive and elicits approach (typically reciprocity), and that high arousal change is effectively negative and elicits avoidance (typically compensation).&lt;ref name="Burgoon, Stern, &amp; Dillman, 1995"/&gt;

== Conclusion ==

Cognitive valence theory seeks to describe and explain the process of intimacy exchange within a dyad relationship. CVT accomplishes this process through the employment of six schemata: culture, personality, interpersonal valence, situation, state, and the relationship. Intimacy behaviors provide the strength and positivity to generate close, personal friendships. These friendships may be found in the home family, an impending personal relationship and/or marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero &amp; Hecht, 2008, 518&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ''if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it''.&lt;ref name="Covey, 2004"&gt;Covey, 2004, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative software''' or '''groupware''' is [[application software]] designed to help people involved in a common task to achieve their  goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is "intentional group processes plus software to support them".&lt;ref name="Johnson-Lenz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson-Lenz|first=Peter|title=Rhythms, Boundaries, and Containers|url=http://nexus.awakentech.com:8080/at/awaken1.nsf/UNIDs/CFB70C1957A686E98825654000699E1B?OpenDocument|publisher=Awakening Technology|date=30 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the level of interaction it allows, collaborative software may be divided into: [[real-time collaborative editing]] (RTCE) platforms that allow multiple users to engage in live, simultaneous and reversible editing of a single file (usually a document),  and [[version control]] (also known as revision control and source control) platforms, which allow separate users to make parallel edits to a file, while preserving every saved edit by every user as multiple files (that are variants of the original file).

Collaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). According to Carstensen and Schmidt (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carstensen |first1=P.H.|last2= Schmidt|first2= K. |year=1999 |title= Computer supported cooperative work: new challenges to systems design |url= http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/carstensen99computer.html |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate= 2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; groupware is part of CSCW. The authors claim that CSCW, and thereby groupware, addresses "how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems." Software products such as email, calendaring, [[text chat]], [[wiki]], and [[Enterprise bookmarking|bookmarking]] belong to this category whenever used for group work,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} whereas the more general term [[social software]] applies to systems used outside the workplace, for example, [[online dating service]]s and [[social networking site]]s like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].

The use of collaborative software in the work space creates a [[collaborative working environment]] (CWE).

Finally, collaborative software relates to the notion of [[collaborative work systems]], which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place, whether it is formal or informal, intentional or unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;Beyerlein, M; Freedman, S.; McGee, G.; Moran, L. (2002). [http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/39/07879637/0787963739.pdf Beyond Teams: Building the Collaborative Organization]. The Collaborative Work Systems series, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the groupware or collaborative software pertains to the technological elements of computer-supported cooperative work, collaborative work systems become a useful analytical tool to understand the behavioral and organizational variables that are associated to the broader concept of CSCW.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, P. (1991). Computer Supported Cooperative Work: An Introduction. Kluwer Academic Pub. {{ISBN|978-0792314462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aparicio, M and Costa, C.

[[Douglas Engelbart]] first envisioned collaborative computing in 1951 and documented his vision in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework], Douglas C.

Engelbart and William K. English, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and held the first public demonstration of his work in 1968 in what is now referred to as "[[The Mother of All Demos]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/dougs-1968-demo.html |title=1968 Demo Overview and Links to Video |publisher=Dougengelbart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Engelbart's lab was hooked into the [[ARPANET]], the first computer network, enabling them to extend services to a broader userbase.

Online collaborative gaming software began between early networked computer users. In 1975, [[Will Crowther]] created [[Colossal Cave Adventure]] on a [[DEC PDP-10]] computer. As internet connections grew, so did the numbers of users and multi-user games. In 1978 [[Roy Trubshaw]], a student at [[University of Essex]] in the United Kingdom, created the game MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).

The US Government began using truly collaborative applications in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99362&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;coll=GUIDE&amp;CFID=107391064&amp;CFTOKEN=53017578 |title=Learning from user experience with groupware |doi=10.1145/99332.99362 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first robust applications was the Navy's Common Operational Modeling, Planning and Simulation Strategy (COMPASS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cwid.js.mil/public/CWIDFctShtSuccesses21Mar08.doc Heritage of Delivering Successful Warfighting Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt; The COMPASS system allowed up to 6 users to create point-to-point connections with one another; the collaborative session only remained while at least one user stayed active, and would have to be recreated if all six logged out. MITRE improved on that model by hosting the collaborative session on a server that each user logged into. Called the Collaborative Virtual Workstation (CVW), this allowed the session to be set up in a virtual file cabinet and virtual rooms, and left as a persistent session that could be joined later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Maybury/publication/220423771_Expert_Finding_for_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments/links/00b495295de7a430ec000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true Collaborative virtual environments for analysis and decision support], Mark Mayburry&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Pavel Curtis]], who had built MUDs at [[PARC (company)|PARC]], created PlaceWare, a server that simulated a one-to-many auditorium, with side chat between "seat-mates", and the ability to invite a limited number of audience members to speak. In 1997, engineers at [[GTE]] used the PlaceWare engine in a commercial version of MITRE's CVW, calling it InfoWorkSpace (IWS). In 1998, IWS was chosen as the military standard for the standardized Air Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/news/infoworkspace-saves-lives-in-iraq/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace saves lives in Iraq - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IWS product was sold to [[General Dynamics]] and then later to Ezenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/products/products-infoworkspace/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140527023159/http://www.ezenia.com/products/products-infoworkspace/|archivedate = 2014-05-27|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groupware==
Collaborative software was originally designated as ''groupware'' and this term can be traced as far back as the late 1980s, when Richman and Slovak (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Richman|first1= Louis S |last2= Slovak |first2=Julianne |date=June 8, 1987 |title= SOFTWARE CATCHES THE TEAM SPIRIT New computer programs may soon change the way groups of people work together -- and start delivering the long-awaited payoff from office automation.fouttoune |publisher=Money.cnn.com |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/06/08/69109/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote:

{{quote|"Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together, the new ''groupware'' aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers, technicians, and anyone else who interacts in groups, revolutionizing the way they work."}}

Even further back, in 1978 Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz coined the term groupware; their initial 1978  definition of groupware was, “intentional group processes plus software to support them.” Later in their article they went on to explain groupware as “computer-mediated culture... an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace." Groupware integrates co-evolving human and tool systems, yet is simply a single system.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Lenz"/&gt;

In the early 1990s the first commercial groupware products were delivered, and big companies such as [[Boeing]] and [[IBM]] started using electronic meeting systems for key internal projects. [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]] appeared as a major example of that product category, allowing remote group collaboration when the internet was still in its infancy. Kirkpatrick and Losee (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=D. |last2=Losee |first2=S. |date=March 23, 1992 |title= HERE COMES THE PAYOFF FROM PCs New network software lets brainstormers around a table all ''talk'' at once on their keyboards. The result: measurable productivity gains from desktop computing |url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1992/03/23/76204/index.htm |publisher=Money.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote then:

{{quote|"If GROUPWARE really makes a difference in productivity long term, the very definition of an office may change. You will be able to work efficiently as a member of a group wherever you have your computer. As computers become smaller and more powerful, that will mean anywhere."}}

===Design and implementation issues===
The complexity of groupware development is still an issue. One reason for this is the socio-technical dimension of groupware. Groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues (as in traditional software development) but also consider the organizational aspects &lt;ref&gt;D'Atri A., De Marco M., Casalino N. (2008). “Interdisciplinary Aspects of Information Systems Studies”, pp. 1-416, Physica-Verlag, Springer, Germany, Doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2010-2  {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2009-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application. Some examples for issues in groupware development are:

*Persistence is needed in some sessions. Chat and voice communications are routinely non-persistent and evaporate at the end of the session. Virtual room and online file cabinets can persist for years. The designer of the collaborative space needs to consider the information duration needs and implement accordingly.
*Authentication has always been a problem with groupware. When connections are made point-to-point, or when log-in registration is enforced, it's clear who is engaged in the session. However, audio and unmoderated sessions carry the risk of unannounced 'lurkers' who observe but do not announce themselves or contribute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130605033257/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/transfer.html A Case Study in Technology Transfer of Collaboration Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130912234901/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/second.html Collaborating securely - Can it be done?]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Until recently, bandwidth issues at fixed location limited full use of the tools. These are exacerbated with mobile devices.
*Multiple input and output streams bring concurrency issues into the groupware applications.
*Motivational issues are important, especially in settings where no pre-defined group process was in place.
*Closely related to the motivation aspect is the question of reciprocity. [[Clarence Ellis (computer scientist)|Ellis]] and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Clarence A. |last1=Ellis|first2= Simon J. |last2=Gibbs |first3= Gail |last3=Rein|year= 1991 |title=Groupware: some issues and experiences. |DOI=10.1145/99977.99987 |volume=34 |journal=Communications of the ACM |pages=39–58|url=http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~tar/DBC/groupware-ellis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the distribution of efforts and benefits has to be carefully balanced in order to ensure that all required group members really participate.
*Real-time communication via groupware can lead to a lot of noise, over-communication and information overload.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

One approach for addressing these issues is the use of design patterns for groupware design.&lt;ref&gt;Till Schümmer and Stephan Lukosch. 2007. Patterns for Computer-Mediated Interaction (Wiley Software Patterns Series). John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-02561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process.

==Groupware and levels of collaboration==
Groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of [[collaboration]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |title=Groupware - Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |publisher=Lotus Development Corporation |date= |year=1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Casalino N., Draoli M. (2009), “Governance and Organizational Aspects of an Experimental Groupware in the Italian Public Administration to Support Multi-Institutional Partnerships”, in Information Systems: People, Organizations, Institutions, and Trchnologies, D’Atri A., Saccà D. (Eds.), Physica-Verlag, Springer, Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 81-89, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2147-5}}, doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2148-2_11&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Communication''' can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information. A phone call or an [[Instant Messaging|IM]] Chat discussion are examples of this.
# '''Conferencing''' (or collaboration level, as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels) refers to interactive work toward a shared goal. Brainstorming or voting are examples of this.
# '''Co-ordination''' refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal. A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team; everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win. That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal: collaborative management.

===Collaborative management (coordination) tools===
Collaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities. Examples include:
* [[Electronic calendar]]s (also called [[time management]] software) &amp;mdash; schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members
* [[Project management]] systems &amp;mdash; schedule, track, and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed
* [[Online proofing]] &amp;mdash; share, review, approve, and reject web proofs, artwork, photos, or videos between designers, customers, and clients
* [[Workflow system]]s &amp;mdash; collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process
* [[Knowledge management software|Knowledge management systems]] &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage, and share various forms of information
* [[Enterprise bookmarking]] &amp;mdash; collaborative bookmarking engine to tag, organize, share, and search enterprise data
* [[Prediction market]]s &amp;mdash; let a group of people predict together the outcome of future events
* [[Extranet]] systems (sometimes also known as 'project extranets') &amp;mdash; collect, organize, manage and share information associated with the delivery of a project (e.g.: the construction of a building)
* [[Intranet]] systems &amp;mdash; quickly share company information to members within a company via Internet (e.g.: marketing and product info)&lt;ref name="Intranet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaffey|first1=Dave|title=Groupware, Workflow, and Intranets: Reengineering the Enterprise with Collaborative Software|date=1998|publisher=Digital Press|location=Boston|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Social software]] systems &amp;mdash; organize social relations of groups
* [[Online spreadsheet]]s &amp;mdash; collaborate and share structured data and information
* [[Client portal]]s &amp;mdash; interact and share with your clients in a private online environment{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Collaborative software and human interaction==
The design intent of collaborative software (groupware) is to transform the way documents and [[rich media]] are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration.

Collaboration, with respect to information technology, seems to have several definitions. Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application. Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs.

There are three primary ways in which humans interact: conversations, transactions, and collaborations.

''Conversational interaction'' is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building. There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints, generally focused on personal experiences.&lt;ref name="iSchool"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunbar|first1=R. I.|last2=Marriott|first2=A.|last3=Duncan|first3=N. D.|title=Human conversational behavior|journal=Human Nature : An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective|date=1997|volume=8|issue=3|pages=231–246|doi=10.1007/BF02912493|accessdate=3 December 2014|url=http://medisch-fitness.com/documents/75procentdagelijksegesprekkenbestedenweaanroddelen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication technology such as telephones, [[instant messaging]], and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions.

''Transactional interaction'' involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants.

In ''collaborative interactions'' the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity (i.e., the converse of transactional). When teams collaborate on projects it is called [[Collaborative project management]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19566">The '''conservation and restoration of performance art''' is the process of documenting, collecting, and prolonging the life of [[Performance Art]]. Performance Art often features a live presentation initially documented by an artist, cultural institution, or host location. This genre of art can take place in a wide range of mediums, and is usually based on four core elements: Time, Space, the Performer's body, and the relationship between viewers and performer. These variables determine how it can be collected and conserved within museums or cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA Learning- Performance Into Art|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/conceptual-art/performance-into-art|website=www.moma.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of performance art==
[[Performance art]] activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in Asia and Latin America. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Term: Performance Art|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/performance-art|website=www.tate.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century performance art originated from early avant-garde genres such as [[Futurism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]. The choreographed movements combined elements of traditional theater performances and styles of political rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance Art|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-performance-art.htm|website=www.theartstory.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the post-war performance art movement can be credited to composer [[John Cage]] and dancer [[Merce Cunningham]] at North Carolina's [[Black Mountain College]]. Cage's teaching in New York shaped the work of artists such as [[George Brecht]], [[Yoko Ono]], and [[Allan Kaprow]], who formed part of the impetus behind the Fluxus movement and the creation of "happenings," which were then preceded by [[Abstract expressionism]] and Action painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Abigail|title=A Brief History of "Happenings" in 1960s New York|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-what-were-1960s-happenings-and-why-do-they-matter|website=www.artsy.net|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s the [[List of performance artists]] has continued to increase, and the styles of the genre are never confined.

==Artistic intent ==
In experiencing painting, film, literature, theatre, dance, music, and other arts, is it useful to consider the artist’s intent, including evidence from previous work, external statements, and historical and personal contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costa Rodrigues|first1=Marta Filipa|title=The Challenges of the Ephemeral: Conserving Performance Art|url=https://www.academia.edu/16325064/The_Challenges_of_the_Ephemeral_Conserving_Performance_Art|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Art and nature, non-aesthetic intent, the artist's testimony, historical context, situational approaches, intent for audiences, and textual intent are factors that take part in what or how the artist allows their work to be represented. The [[Artist's statement]] is another form in determining the conditions of their performance. These preferences include how the work can be documented, collected, and preserved.

==Ethical concerns==
Performance art is often undefined in its boundaries, so this may raise concern for where and how it is exhibited. Additional concerns are raised in [https://www.academia.edu/8925656/Performance_Art_Pornography_and_the_Mis-Spectator_The_Ethics_of_Documenting_Participatory_Performance participatory performances]. There are several Codes of Ethics for professionals working in conservation and preservation-related fields. The main conservation Code of Ethics is the [[American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works]] (AIC) Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. However, many of the professional organizations have their own codes, such as the [http://archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics Society of American Archivists Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics].

==Conserving performance==
Performance art contains a [http://www.theartstory.org/movement-performance-art.htm history] of disregarding a standard definition or description, which presents a series of questions and discussions to qualify its conservation. Conserving and preserving Performance art was originally questioned if it was possible and for what reasons should it be collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rockwell|first1=John|title=Reverberations; Preserve Performance Art? Can You Preserve the Wind?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/movies/reverberations-preserve-performance-art-can-you-preserve-the-wind.html?_r=0|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broad discussion of what context the live works could be preserved has been presented by David Smith of [[Asia Art Archive]] and Athena Christa Holbrook from [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts or Contexts|url=http://www.voca.network/blog/2016/08/01/concepts-or-contexts/|website=Voices in Contemporary Art|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discuss the legitimacy of how a performance can be conserved and the resulting value of the work after by the artist, collection, and for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts or Contexts|url=http://www.voca.network/blog/2016/08/01/concepts-or-contexts/|website=www.voca.network|accessdate=17 April 2017|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural institutions===
With input from artists, art educators and historians, conservators, and curators, a wider perspective is being generated for cultural institutions to develop new techniques in conserving and restoring live, time based works through workshops like [http://www.2ndpublic.org/news/2016/04/collecting-and-conserving-performance-art The International Symposium "Collecting and Conserving Performance Art"], held in Wolfsburg,Germany.
Cultural institutions like [[Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Tate Modern]] have continued to develop conservation techniques on media-specific preservation needs, like securing equipment, updating exhibition-mode technology, and developing ways to re-create duration-based presentations. Their [http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/107264 lists and policies] establish a consistent method of collecting and preserving Performance Art by examining the license to "re-perform" the work, existing practices used to bring live works into a collection, and looking at past participants and producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection/Departments|url=https://www.moma.org/explore/collection/departments/|website=www.moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The artist===
The artists/creators of the performance are the original source for the intentions for conserving the work. The artist's intent can determine how or to what degree the live work can be preserved. Popular performance artist [[Marina Abramović]] has spent much of her career recreating new versions of past performances by either replicating the physical actions or by selecting a reoccurring location, theme, or medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marina Abramovic Institute|url=http://oma.eu/projects/marina-abramovic-institute|website=www.oma.eu|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also spent time as an educator in Performance Art so that her similar methods and styles are repeated. Marina has used several resources in copyrighting her work to ensure it's authenticity and the work can be preserved in its current state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=https://mai.art/|website=www.mia.art|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Performance scripts have also been used to preserve a live performance. With these written instructions or steps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fluxus Performance Workbook|url=http://www.deluxxe.com/beat/fluxusworkbook.pdf|publisher=Performance Research 2002|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original live work can be re-performed or accurately represented keeping the artist's intentions true to the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Script: Symposium on Performance Art Practice and Documentation in Asia|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Programme/Details/29|website=www.aaa.org|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although curators and art critics have questioned if these scripts are sufficient materials for preserving and collecting the work; this method can be argued with similar conservation methods used in theater and performing arts.

==Conservation and restoration treatment methods==
[http://www.complex.com/style/2013/04/the-25-best-performance-art-pieces-of-all-time/ Performance art that includes video], film, slide, audio, or computer technologies often falls under the [[conservation and restoration of time-based media art]] because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time. Collecting, preserving, and exhibiting these performances raises complex technical and ethical challenges to conservators. Reside from Performance art fall under two main categories for either physical objects, and digital objects or [[New media]] associated with the work. While performances can have either category or combination to document the performance, exhibit, and preserve the existence or transformation of the work; the digital component has become the dominant method of prolonging the existence of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Based Media Art|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenheim.org|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some strategies of overcoming the challenges of collecting live work are addressed in Marta Rodriguez's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=Marta|title=The Challenges of the Ephemeral: Conserving Performance Art|url=https://www.academia.edu/16325064/The_Challenges_of_the_Ephemeral_Conserving_Performance_Art|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mediums ===
Performance Art can take the form of several mediums with the possibility for combination such as but not limited to:

* [[BioArt]]
* [[Cyberformance]]
* [[Digital art]]
* [[Digital poetry]]
* [[Electronic art]]
* [[Evolutionary art]]
* [[Generative art]]
* [[Information art]]
* [[Interactive art]]
* [[Internet art]]
* [[Kinetic art]]
* [[Light art]]
* [[Motion graphics]]
* [[Net art]]
* [[Photography]]
* [[Sound art]]
* [[Video art]] 
* [[Virtual art]]

These mediums can be the result of documentation for the performance or be directly involved in the art itself. The mediums often determine how the work is collected, conserved, and restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marina Abromovic: What is Performance Art?|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/global-culture/conceptual-performance/v/moma-abramovic-what-is-performance-art|website=www.khanacademy.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical objects===
Physical props, tools, clothing, etc. remaining or created as a result of the performance can be a common representation to document and preserve the Performance. [[Collections care]] guides and policies manage best practices for prolonging the life of the work.

====Preventive care and maintenance====
Many works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[visible light]] and [[ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Natural History Collections Management Policy|url=https://entomology.si.edu/Collections/NMNH_CMP_Sept-18-2006.pdf|website=www.si.edu|accessdate=12 April 2017|pages=23–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other causes of deterioration include:
*[[Pollution]]
*Poor Storage 
*Poor Handling and Use

[[Collections care]] is an essential element of museum policy. It is a "responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. Cultural institutions should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Natural History Collections Management Policy|url=https://entomology.si.edu/Collections/NMNH_CMP_Sept-18-2006.pdf|website=www.si.edu|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital===
Digital mediums can be used for documentation or be a result of a performance such as digital photography, video, and audio files.  [[Conservation and restoration of new media art]] can establish best practices for individuals, artists, and cultural institutions to prolong the life of the work.

====Digital preservation====
Works of new media art such as [[film]], [[tapes]], [[web browsers]], software [[operating systems]] eventually become obsolete, and [[New Media art]] faces serious issues around the challenge to preserve artwork beyond the time of its contemporary production. The [http://rhizome.org/art/ digital archiving of media] (see the [http://rhizome.org/art/ Rhizome ArtBase], and the Internet Archive), and the use of emulators to prolong the life of work that depend on obsolete software or operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Frank|title=The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/design/the-mission-to-save-vanishing-internet-art.html?_r=0|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preventive care and maintenance====
Instability and change are inherent to these artworks, since artist-selected equipment and technologies fail and become obsolete. Many time-based media artworks are ephemeral by nature; rather than being composed of a unique original, they exist only when they are installed, so every iteration can be considered a different representation of the artwork. To preserve the fragile identity of time-based media artworks, conservators must proactively manage the degree of change that may be introduced to each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation- Time Based Media|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenheim.org|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods of preservation====
The [http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net/ Variable Media Questionnaire (VMS)] has developed into a significant tool in relation to digital preservation.
*Refreshing- The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format.
*Restoration- The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original.
*Networked storage- The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives. 
*Migration- To upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Depocas|first1=Alain|title=Permanence Through Change: The Variable Media Approach|date=2003|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|location=New York|isbn=0968469329|pages=125–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel.

====Acquisition and storage====
Physical media-equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term strategy, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or outdated. Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as [[Internet art]], performance art and [[live electronic music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collecting and Conserving Performance Art|url=http://www.restauratoren.de/termine-details/2021-collecting-and-conserving-performance-art.html|website=Verband der Restauratoren|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/107264 What to consider when collecting Performance Art]

====Causes of deterioration====
For the residue and documentation of performance art, new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and [[metadata]] standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the [[Open Archival Information System]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation- Time Based Media|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenheim.org|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[Digital preservation]] and [[Web archiving]] offers special challenges and opportunities. Where scientific data and legal records may be easily migrated from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions. [[Emulator|Emulation]] and Reinterpretation are additional approaches for prolonging the life of digital objects and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation- Time Based Media; Managing Inherent Change|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenhiem.org|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pest management ===
For physical objects and props relating to a performance piece, conservators must follow proper pest management standards. [[Integrated Pest Management]] policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Policies and checklists specific to [[museum integrated pest management]], for example from the [[National Park Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Pest Management Manual- Museum Pests|url=https://nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Smithsonian Institution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Pest Management Check List|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/articles/pests9.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss best practices, to include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition and storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas.

'''Contemporary archaeology''' is a field of archaeological research that focuses on the most recent (20th and 21st century) past, and also increasingly explores the application of archaeological thinking to the contemporary world. It has also been referred to as the archaeology of the 'contemporary past'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchli |first=Victor |first2=Gavin |last2=Lucas |title=Archaeologies of the Contemporary Past |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=4 January 2002 |pages=208 |isbn=9781134571383 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=xK-BAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |jstor=3527092}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this term in the United Kingdom is particularly associated with the Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory (CHAT) conference group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chat-arch.org |title=CHAT ACT: Agency, Action and Advocacy Moesgaard Museum, Aarhus University, Denmark Friday 26 – Sunday 28 October 2018 |work=Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory |access-date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field forms part of [[historical archaeology]], or the archaeology of the modern period. Unlike [[ethnoarchaeology]], contemporary archaeology studies the recent and contemporary past in its own right, rather than to develop models that can inform the study of the more distant past.

Often informed by anthropological [[material culture studies]], but characterised by putting traditional archaeological methods and practices to new uses, research in this field generally aims to make an archaeological contribution to broader social scientific studies of the contemporary world, focusing especially upon contributing methods of studying material things (objects, landscapes, buildings, material heritage, etc.) to sociological, geographical and political studies of the modern world. The field has developed especially in heritage management, for example through [[English Heritage]]'s "Change and Creation" programme on the landscapes of the later 20th century &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schofield |first=J. |title=The Archaeology of the 20th Century |url=http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927230416/http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[Chartered Institute for Archaeologists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Contemporary Archaeology aims to explore the characteristics of diverse and rapid change across micro and macro scales by using a range of conventional and experimental [[Archaeology]] investigative techniques. Like all archaeological scholarship and practice, Contemporary Archaeology uses both [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] approaches, which can include archaeological modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=David L. |author-link=David L. Clarke |title=Models in Archaeology |publisher=[[Methuen (publisher)|Methuen]] |year=1972 |pages=1055 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=SCFmAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Quentin Lewis recognized, contemporary archaeology has a firmer footing in the UK and Europe than it does in North America, or at least it is not an especially recognizable scholarly niche quite yet in the US.  The work of scholars in the UK and Europe has turned to some materiality that is admittedly distinctive if not unique, such as the extensive scholarship of the landscapes of 20th century warfare (for instance, English Heritage’s ambitious Cold War Monuments project, Gabriel Moshenska’s work on British air raid shelters and children’s homefront experiences of World War II, Heinrich Natho’s study of Norwegian World War II coastal defenses, and Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal’s analysis of Spanish Civil War Monuments); Laura McAtackney’s work on “peace walls” in northern Ireland; Anna Badcock and Robert Johnston’s study of protest camp sites in Derbyshire; and contemporary graffiti (John Schofield has cleverly captivated many journalists and questioned what archaeologists value with his assessment of Sex Pistols graffiti).  Yet for all these distinctive dimensions of British and European heritage we could certainly point to just as many equally interesting material experiences in every corner of North America.  Some of the visibility of contemporary archaeology is inevitably linked to a British and European willingness to conduct material analysis that does not require excavation.  Outside North America a vast number of scholars call themselves archaeologists while studying space, the built environment, and a broad range of material things without necessarily wielding a trowel.  In the US historical archaeology has fashioned a particularly productive niche by focusing on field excavation and everyday materiality, and much of our training is devoted to field methods and analysis of a distinctive range of commodities like ceramics, glass, and faunal remains that are routinely recovered from excavation contexts on nearly any historic period site" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/tag/contemporary-archaeology/ |title=Contemporary Archaeology |date=1 February 2012 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[The Society for Historical Archaeology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a history reaching back as far, at least, as William Rathje's "garbology" project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913924,00.html |title=The Nation: Truth in Garbage |date=26 January 1976 |access-date=13 November 2018 |magazine=[[TIME]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Archaeology remains a new sub-discipline within the university. In remaining focused on archaeology's ability to tell stories that reach beyond official or formal discourse, Contemporary Archaeology has the potential to offer significant political critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Borderline Archaeology: a practise of contemporary archaeology - exploring aspects of creative narratives and performance cultural production |last=Campbell |first=Fiona |last2=Ulin |first2=Jonna |date=11 June 2004 |publisher=[[Göteborgs universitet]] |isbn=91-85245-01-1 |url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/16211/5/gupea_2077_16211_5.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

[[Helena T.

[[File:Devereux Hall (Jacobs Hall, Campbell Mansion).JPG|thumb|California center's Devereux Hall in Santa Barbara County in 2010]]
The organization's first major expansion, to California, was aided by support from the [[Max Factor Sr.|Max Factor Family Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prost|first1=Marlene|title=Devereux: An Investment in Self-esteem|agency=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=May 7, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the Devereux Foundation opened a school and [[residential treatment center]] on the Campbell Ranch in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]]. Devereux Hall was designated [http://www.sbcountyplanning.org/boards/hlac/Landmarks/27%20-%20DEVEREUX%20HALL.pdf Historical Landmark No. 27] by the [[Santa Barbara County, California|County of Santa Barbara]] on September 8, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coombs|first1=Gary|last2=Olsen|first2=Phyllis|title=In the Grand Manor: The Story of Devereux Hall|date=1987|publisher=Institute for American Research|location=Goleta, California|isbn=0911773053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FidoNet''' is a worldwide [[computer network]] that is used for communication between [[bulletin board system]]s (BBSes). It uses a [[store-and-forward]] system to exchange private (email) and public (forum) messages between the BBSes in the network, as well as other files and protocols in some cases.

The FidoNet system was based on a number of small interacting programs. Only one of these interacted with the BBS system directly and was the only portion that had to be [[Porting|ported]] to support other BBS software. This greatly eased porting, and FidoNet was one of the few networks that was widely supported by almost all BBS software, as well as a number of non-BBS [[online service]]s. This modular construction also allowed FidoNet to easily upgrade to new [[data compression]] systems, which was important in an era using [[modem]]-based communications over telephone links with high [[long-distance calling]] charges.

The rapid improvement in modem speeds during the early 1990s, combined with the rapid decrease in price of computer systems and storage, made BBSes increasingly popular. By the mid-1990s there were almost 40,000 FidoNet systems in operation, and it was possible to communicate with millions of users around the world. Only [[UUCP#UUCPNET|UUCPNET]] came close in terms of breadth or numbers; FidoNet's user base far surpassed other networks like [[BITNET]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The broad availability of low-cost [[Internet]] connections starting in the mid-1990s lessened the need for FidoNet's store-and-forward system, as any system in the world could be reached for equal cost. Direct dialing into local BBS systems rapidly declined. Although FidoNet had shrunk considerably since the late 1990s, it has remained in use even today{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} despite internet connectivity becoming universally available.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Pre-nodelist "fido list" June 1984.jpg|thumb|Hand-compiled list of Fido BBS systems, June 1984. This document formed the basis of the first nodelists.]]
There are two major accounts of the development of the FidoNet, differing only in small details.

====Tom Jennings' account====
Around Christmas 1983, [[Tom Jennings]] started work on a new [[MS-DOS]]–hosted bulletin board system that would emerge as Fido BBS. Jennings set up the system in [[San Francisco]] some time in early 1984. Another early user was John Madil, who was trying to set up a similar system in [[Baltimore]] on his [[Rainbow 100]]. Fido started spreading to new systems, and Jennings eventually started keeping an informal list of their phone numbers, with Jennings becoming #1 and Madil #2.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;Ben Baker, [http://www.fidonet.ca/baker.htm "Fidonet History"], 2 May 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennings released the first version of the FidoNet software in June 1984. In early 1985 he wrote a document explaining the operations of the FidoNet, along with a short portion on the history of the system. In this version, FidoNet was developed as a way to exchange mail between the first two Fido BBS systems, Jennings' and Madil's, to "see if it could be done, merely for the fun of it". This was first supported in Fido V7, "sometime in June 84 or so".&lt;ref name=tom&gt;Tom Jennings, [http://www.worldpowersystems.com/FidoNet/fidohist1.txt "FidoNet History and Operation"], February 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbsdoc"&gt;Jason Scott Sadofsky, "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402/ BBS: The Documentary]", FIDONET Episode, 21 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="byte198410"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-10/1984_10_BYTE_09-11_Databases#page/n353/mode/2up | title=FidoNet, Sidekick, Apple, Get Organized!, and Handle | work=BYTE | date=October 1984 | accessdate=23 October 2013 |author1=Markoff, John |author2=Shapiro, Ezra | page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ben Baker's account====
In early 1984, Ben Baker was planning on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the [[McDonnell Douglas]] automotive division in [[St. Louis]]. Baker was part of the [[CP/M]] [[special interest group]] within the club.&lt;ref&gt;Baker provides details of the club and the SIG at about the 8- to 10-minute mark during BBS interviews by Jason Scott Sadofsky, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 "BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)"]&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, [[CBBS]] system, and went looking for a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] would be giving them a [[Rainbow 100]] computer on indefinite loan, so he made plans to move the CBBS onto this machine. The Rainbow contained two [[Central processing unit|processors]], an [[Intel 8088]] and a [[Zilog Z80]], allowing it to run both [[MS-DOS]] and [[CP/M]], with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the [[I/O port]]s, so CBBS could not communicate with a [[modem]]. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The Fido software required changes to the serial drivers to work properly on the Rainbow. A porting effort started, involving Jennings, Madil and Baker. This caused all involved to rack up considerable [[Long-distance calling#Categories and charges|long distance charges]] as they all called each other during development, or called into each other's BBSes to leave email. During one such call "in May or early June", Baker and Jennings discussed how great it would be if the BBS systems could call each other automatically, exchanging mail and files between them.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; This would allow them to compose mail on their local machines, and then deliver it quickly, as opposed to calling in and typing the message in while on a long-distance telephone connection. Jennings responded by calling into Baker's system that night and uploading a new version of the software consisting of three files: FIDO_DECV6 (the new version of the BBS program itself), FIDONET, and NODELIST.BBS. The new version of FIDO BBS had a timer that caused it to exit at a specified time, normally at night, and as it exited it would run the separate FIDONET program. NODELIST was the list of Fido BBS systems, which Jennings had already been compiling.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The FIDONET program was what later became known as a ''mailer''. FIDO was modified to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a ''node number'' for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a ''message packet''. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would [[Handshaking|handshake]] and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.&lt;ref&gt;Baker at the 35 minute mark, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 "BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to lower long distance charges, the mail exchanges were timed to run late at night, normally 4 AM.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; This would later be known as ''national mail hour'',&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; and, later still, as ''Zone Mail Hour''.

===Up and running===
By June 1984 Version 7 of the system was being run in production, and nodes were rapidly being added to the network. By August there were almost 30 systems in the nodelist, 50 by September, and over 160 by January 1985. As the network grew, the maintenance of the nodelist became prohibitive, and errors were common. In these cases people would start receiving phone calls at 4 AM, from a caller that would say nothing and then hang up. In other cases the system would be listed before it was up and running, resulting in long distance calls that accomplished nothing.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt;

In August 1984 Jennings handed off control of the nodelist to the group in St. Louis, mostly Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker. Kaplan had come across Fido as part of finding a BBS solution for his company, which worked with DEC computers and had been given a Rainbow computer and a [[USRobotics]] 1200bit/s [[modem]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan provides details 14 to 16 minute mark during this inverview, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 "BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)"]&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, joining FidoNet required one to set up their system and use it to deliver a netmail message to a special system, Node 51. The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured that at least some of the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned node number. If delivery succeeded, the system was considered to be working properly, and it was added to the nodelist.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt; The first new nodelist was published on 21 September 1984.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

===Nets and nodes===
Growth continued to accelerate, and by the spring of 1985 the system was already reaching its limit of 250 nodes. In addition to the limits on growth of what was clearly a popular system, nodelist maintenance continued to grow more and more time consuming.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

It was also realized that Fido systems were generally clustered – of the 15 systems running by the start of June 1984, 5 of them were in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;  A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn.  Local calls were normally free or charged at a low rate.  Additionally, the initial call setup, generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, it would make sense to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call. Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within a minute or two, so delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls.

The team settled on the concept of adding a new ''network number'' patterned on the idea of [[area code]]s.&lt;ref group=N&gt;Details of the sequence of events leading to the new routing scheme differ slightly between accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; A complete [[network address]] would now consist of the network and node number pair, which would be written with a slash between them. All mail travelling between networks would first be sent to their local ''network host'', someone who volunteered to pay for any long distance charges. That single site would collect up all the netmail from all of the systems in their network, then re-package it into single packets destined to each network. They would then call any required network admin sites and deliver the packet to them. That site would then process the mail as normal, although all of the messages in the packet would be guaranteed to be local calls.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The network address was placed in an unused field in the Fido message database, which formerly always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would look it up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

A huge advantage of the new scheme was that node numbers were now unique only within their network, not globally. This meant the previous 250 node limit was gone, but for a variety of reasons this was initially limited to about 1,200. This change also devolved the maintenance of the nodelists down to the network hosts, who then sent updated lists back to Node 51 to be collected into the master list. The St. Louis group now had to only maintain their own local network, and do basic work to compile the global list.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

At a meeting held in Kaplan's living room in St. Louis on 11 April 1985&lt;ref group=N&gt;In the interviews, Baker says this took place in May.&lt;/ref&gt; the various parties hammered out all of the details of the new concept. As part of this meeting, they also added the concept of a ''region'', a purely administrative level that was not part of the addressing scheme. Regional hosts would handle any stragglers in the network maps, remote systems that had no local network hosts. They then divided up the US into ten regions that they felt would have roughly equal populations.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

By May, Jennings had early versions of the new software running. These early versions specified the routing manually through a new ROUTE.BBS file that listed network hosts for each node. For instance, an operator might want to forward all mail to St. Louis through a single node, node 10. ROUTE.BBS would then include a list of all the known systems in that area, with instructions to forward mail to each of those nodes through node 10. This process was later semi-automated by John Warren's NODELIST program.&lt;ref name=tom2&gt;Tom Jennings, [http://www.worldpowersystems.com/FidoNet/fidohist2.txt "FidoNet History #2"], 20 August 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this information was folded into updated versions of the nodelist format, and the ROUTES file is no longer used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbscorner.com/bbsnetworks/fidonet.htm |title=The Fidonet BBS Network |publisher=Bbscorner.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of FIDO and FIDONET, 10C, was released containing all of these features. On 12 June 1985 the core group brought up 10C, and most Fido systems had upgraded within a few months.&lt;ref name=tom2/&gt; The process went much smoother than anyone imagined, and very few nodes had any problems.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

===Echomail===
Some time during the evolution of Fido, [[email attachment|file attachments]] were added to the system, allowing a file to be referenced from an email message. During the normal exchange between two instances of FIDONET, any files attached to the messages in the packets were delivered after the packet itself had been up or downloaded. It is not clear when this was added, but it was already a feature of the basic system when the 8 February 1985 version of the FidoNet standards document was released, so this was added very early in Fido's history.

At a [[sysop]] meeting in Dallas, the idea was raised that it would be nice if there was some way for the sysops to post messages that would be shared among the systems.&lt;ref name=wagner&gt;Wynn Wagner, [http://www.rxn.com/~net282/fidonet.wagner.echomail.txt "History of Echomail"], July 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a ''tosser/scanner''. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.&lt;ref name=randy&gt;Randy Bush, [http://www.fidonet.org/inet92_Randy_Bush.txt "FidoNet: Technology, Use, Tools, and History"], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In this fashion, Rush's system implemented a store and forward public message system similar to [[Usenet]], but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such ''echomail'' forum was one created by the Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as SYSOP. Another called TECH soon followed. Several public ''echos'' soon followed, including GAYNET and CLANG. These spawned hundreds of new echos, and led to the creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987.&lt;ref name=robbins&gt;Frank Robbins, [http://elsmar.com/pdf_files/fidonet-info.txt "FidoNet History Timeline"]&lt;/ref&gt; Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt;

Echomail did not necessarily use the same distribution pathways as normal netmail, and the distribution routing was stored in a separate setup file not unlike the original ROUTES.BBS. At the originating site a header line was added to the message indicating the origin system's name and address. After that, each system that the message traveled through added itself to a growing PATH header, as well as a SEENBY header. SEENBY prevented the message from looping around the network in the case of mis-configured routing information.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt;

Echomail was not the only system to use the file attachment feature of netmail to implement store-and-forward capabilities. Similar concepts were used by online games and other systems as well.

===Zones and points===
The evolution towards the net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on either end of the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt;

At the same time, it was noted that some [[power user]]s were interested in using FidoNet protocols as a way of delivering the large quantities of echomail to their local machines where it could be read offline. These users did not want their systems to appear in the nodelist - they did not (necessarily) run a bulletin board system and were not publicly accessible.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; A mechanism allowing netmail delivery to these systems without the overhead of nodelist maintenance was desirable.

In October 1986 the last major change to the FidoNet network was released, adding ''zones'' and ''points''. Zones represented major geographical areas roughly corresponding to continents. There were six zones in total, North America, South America, Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Points represented non-public nodes, which were created privately on a BBS system. Point mail was delivered to a selected host BBS as normal, but then re-packaged into a packet for the point to pick up on-demand. The complete addressing format was now &lt;code&gt;zone:net/node.point&lt;/code&gt;, so a real example might be &lt;code&gt;Bob Smith@1:250/250.10&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; Points were widely used only for a short time, the introduction of [[offline reader]] systems filled this role with systems that were much easier to use. Points remain in use to this day, but are less popular than when they were introduced.

===Other extensions===
Although FidoNet supported file attachments from even the earliest standards, this feature tended to be rarely used and was often turned off. File attachments followed the normal mail routing through multiple systems, and could back up transfers all along the line as the files were copied. A solution was offered in the form of ''file requests'', which made file transfers driven by the ''calling'' system and used one-time point-to-point connections instead of the traditional routing. Two such standards became common, "WaZOO" and "Bark", which saw varying support among different mailers. Both worked in a similar fashion, with the mailer calling the remote system and sending a new handshake packet to request the files.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Becker [http://www.rxn.com/services/fts/fts-0008.txt "An Enhanced FidoNet Technical Standard Extending FTS-0001 to include Bark requests"], 15 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vince Perriello, [http://ftsc.org/docs/fts-0006.002 "YOOHOO and YOOHOO/2U2"], 30 November 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Although FidoNet was, by far, the best known BBS-based network, it was by no means the only one. From 1988 on, [[PCBoard]] systems were able to host similar functionality known as [[RelayNet]], while other popular networks included [[RBBSNet]] from the [[Commodore 64]] world, and [[AlterNet]]. Late in the evolution of the FidoNet system, there was a proposal to allow mail (but not forum messages) from these systems to switch into the FidoNet structure.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Gove, [http://ftsc.org/docs/fsc-0076.001 "A Proposal for NetMail AreaTags"], 3 December 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This was not adopted, and the rapid rise of the internet made this superfluous as these networks rapidly added internet exchange, which acted as a [[lingua franca]].

[[File:Fidonodes.PNG|thumb|Rapid rise, 1996 peak, and slower decline in number of Fidonodes]]

===Peak===
FidoNet started in 1984 and listed 100 nodes by the end of that year. Steady growth continued through the 1980s, but a combination of factors led to rapid growth after 1988. These included faster and less expensive modems, and rapidly declining costs of hard drives and computer systems in general. By April 1993 the FidoNet nodelist contained over 20,000 systems. At that time it was estimated that each node had, on average, about 200 active users. Of these 4 million users in total, 2 million users commonly used echomail, the shared public forums, while about 200,000 used the private netmail system.&lt;ref name=randy/&gt; At its peak, FidoNet listed approximately 39,000 systems.&lt;ref name=tom/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;The Jargon File puts it at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/FidoNet 38,000] at its peak.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its lifetime, FidoNet was beset with management problems and infighting. Much of this can be traced to the fact that the inter-net delivery cost real money, and the traffic grew more rapidly than decreases caused by improving modem speeds and downward trending long distance rates. As they increased, various methods of recouping the costs were attempted, all of which caused friction in the groups. The problems were so bad that Jennings came to refer to the system as the "fight-o-net".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fight-o-net "fight-o-net"], Jargon File, 4 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}
As modems reached speeds of 28.8&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, the overhead of the [[TCP/IP]] protocols were no longer so egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995 the bulletin board market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost. But this seriously diluted the entire purpose of the store-and-forward model, which had been built up specifically to address a long-distance problem that no longer existed.

The FidoNet nodelist started shrinking, especially in areas with widespread availability of internet connections. This downward trend continues, but has levelled out at approximately 2,500 nodes.&lt;ref group=N&gt;The exact number can be determined by examining the official nodelist. However, the format is difficult to parse and many systems deliberately appear more than once, in different sections. The 2,500 node limit is an estimate made by the current maintainer as of 2013, Janis Kracht.&lt;/ref&gt; FidoNet remains popular in areas where Internet access is difficult to come by, or expensive.

===Resurgence===

There is now (~2014) a retro movement which is resulting in a slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and internet mail has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access this better than the internet as a whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with [[ASCII]] text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their internet mail and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.

==FidoNet organizational structure==
FidoNet is governed in a hierarchical structure according to FidoNet policy, with designated coordinators at each level to manage the administration of FidoNet nodes and resolve disputes between members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fidonet.us/policy4.html | title = FidoNet Policy Document: Version 4.07 | date = June 9, 1989 | publisher = FidoNet | accessdate = 2010-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Network coordinators are responsible for managing the individual nodes within their area, usually a city or similar sized area. Regional coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of the network coordinators within their region, typically the size of a state, or small country. Zone coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of all of the regions within their zone. The world is divided into six zones, the coordinators of which elect one of themselves to be the ''International Coordinator'' of FidoNet.

==Technical structure==
FidoNet was historically designed to use modem-based [[Dial-up internet access|dial-up]] ([[plain old telephone service|POTS]]) access between bulletin board systems, and much of its policy and structure reflected this.

The FidoNet system officially referred only to transfer of ''Netmail''&amp;mdash;the individual private messages between people using bulletin boards&amp;mdash;including the protocols and standards with which to support it. A netmail message would contain the name of the person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer. It was common, however, for system operators to reserve the right to review the content of mail that passed through their system.

Netmail allowed for the ''attachment'' of a single file to every message. This led to a series of ''piggyback'' protocols that built additional features onto FidoNet by passing information back and forth as file attachments. These included the automated distribution of files, and transmission of data for inter-BBS games.

By far the most commonly used of these piggyback protocols was ''Echomail'', public discussions similar to [[Usenet]] newsgroups in nature. Echomail was supported by a variety of software that collected up new messages from the local BBSes' public forums (the ''scanner''), compressed it using [[.arc|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], attached the resulting archive to a Netmail message, and sent that message to a selected system. On receiving such a message, identified because it was addressed to a particular ''user'', the reverse process was used to extract the messages, and a ''tosser'' put them back into the new system's forums.

Echomail was so popular that for many users, Echomail ''was'' the FidoNet. Private person-to-person Netmail was relatively rare.

===Geographical structure===
FidoNet is politically organized into a tree structure, with different parts of the tree electing their respective coordinators. The FidoNet hierarchy consists of ''zones'', ''regions'', ''networks'', ''nodes'' and ''points'' broken down more-or-less geographically.

The highest level is the zone, which is largely continent-based:
* Zone 1 is [[North America]]
* Zone 2 is Europe, Former [[Soviet Union]] countries, and Israel
* Zone 3 is [[Australasia]]
* Zone 4 is [[Latin America]] (except [[Puerto Rico]])
* Zone 5 was Africa
* Zone 6 was Asia, Israel and the Asian parts of Russia, (which are listed in Zone 2). On 26 July 2007 zone 6 was removed, and all remaining nodes were moved to zone 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shenkenberger | first = Carol | editor-last = Felten  | editor-first = Björn | date =  26 July 2007 | publication-date = 30 July 2007 | title = Removal of Zone 6 | periodical = FidoNews | volume =24 | issue= 31 | page = 2 | url = http://www.fidotel.com/public/fidonews/archive/2007/FIDO2431.htm | accessdate = 2010-10-08 | quote =With sadness I have removed the last entry for Zone6 as of this writing.  All remaining members have been transitioned to Zone3 as previously determined by Z6 members at large.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each zone is broken down into regions, which are broken down into nets, which consist of individual nodes.  Zones 7-4095 are used for ''othernets''; groupings of nodes which use Fido-compatible software to carry their own independent message areas without being in any way controlled by FidoNet's political structure. Using un-used zone numbers would ensure that each network would have a unique set of addresses, avoiding potential routing conflicts and ambiguities for systems that belonged to more than one network.

===FidoNet addresses===
FidoNet addresses explicitly consist of a ''zone'' number, a ''network'' number (or region number), and a ''node'' number. They are written in the form &lt;tt&gt;Zone:Network/Node&lt;/tt&gt;.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 4.0}} The FidoNet structure also allows for semantic designation of region, host, and hub status for particular nodes, but this status is not directly indicated by the main address.

For example, consider a node located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [[United States]] with an assigned node number is 918, located in Zone 1 (North America), Region 19, and Network 170. The full FidoNet address for this system would be &lt;tt&gt;1:170/918&lt;/tt&gt;.  The ''region'' was used for administrative purposes, and was only part of the address if the node was listed directly underneath the Regional Coordinator, rather than one of the networks that were used to divide the region further.

FidoNet policy requires that each FidoNet system maintain a ''nodelist'' of every other member system. Information on each node includes the name of the system or BBS, the name of the node operator, the geographic location, the telephone number, and software capabilities. The nodelist is updated weekly, to avoid unwanted calls to nodes that had shut down, with their phone numbers possibly having been reassigned for voice use by the respective telephone company.

To accomplish regular updates, coordinators of each network maintain the list of systems in their local areas. The lists are forwarded back to the International Coordinator via automated systems on a regular basis. The International Coordinator would then compile a new nodelist, and generate the [[diff|list of changes]] (nodediff) to be distributed for node operators to apply to their existing nodelist.

===Routing of FidoNet mail===
In a theoretical situation, a node would normally forward messages to a ''hub''. The hub, acting as a distribution point for mail, might then send the message to the Net Coordinator. From there it may be sent through a Regional Coordinator, or to some other system specifically set up for the function. Mail to other zones might be sent through a Zone Gate.

For example, a FidoNet message might follow the path:
*1:170/918 ''(node)'' to 1:170/900 ''(hub)'' to 1:170/0 ''(net coordinator)'' to 1:19/0 ''(region coordinator)'' to 1:1/0 ''(zone coordinator)''. From there, it was distributed 'down stream' to the destination node(s).

Originally there was no specific relationship between network numbers and the regions they reside in. In some areas of FidoNet, most notably in Zone 2, the relationship between region number and network number are entwined. For example, 2:201/329 is in Net 201 which is in Region 20 while 2:2410/330 is in Net 2410 which is in Region 24. Zone 2 also relates the node number to the hub number if the network is large enough to contain any hubs. This effect may be seen in the nodelist by looking at the structure of Net 2410 where node 2:2410/330 is listed under Hub 300. This is not the case in other zones.

In Zone 1, things are much different. Zone 1 was the starting point and when Zones and Regions were formed, the existing nets were divided up regionally with no set formula. The only consideration taken was where they were located geographically in respect to the region's mapped outline. As net numbers got added, the following formula was used.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Region number × 20
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then when some regions started running out of network numbers, the following was also used.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Region number × 200
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Region 19, for instance, contains nets 380-399 and 3800-3999 in addition to those that were in Region 19 when it was formed.

Part of the objective behind the formation of local nets was to implement cost reduction plans by which all messages would be sent to one or more hubs or hosts in [[data compression|compressed form]] ([[.arc|ARC]] was nominally standard, but [[PKZIP]] is universally supported); one toll call could then be made during off-peak hours to exchange entire message-filled archives with an out-of-town uplink for further redistribution.

In practice, the FidoNet structure allows for any node to connect directly to any other, and node operators would sometimes form their own toll-calling arrangements on an ad-hoc basis, allowing for a balance between collective cost saving and timely delivery. For instance, if one node operator in a network offered to make regular toll calls to a particular system elsewhere, other operators might arrange to forward all of their mail destined for the remote system, and those near it, to the local volunteer.  Operators within individual networks would sometimes have cost-sharing arrangements, but it was also common for people to volunteer to pay for regular toll calls either out of generosity, or to build their status in the community.

This ad-hoc system was particularly popular with networks that were built on top of FidoNet. Echomail, for instance, often involved relatively large file transfers due to its popularity. If official FidoNet distributors refused to transfer Echomail due to additional toll charges, other node operators would sometimes volunteer. In such cases, Echomail messages would be routed to the volunteers' systems instead.

The FidoNet system was best adapted to an environment in which local [[telephone]] service was inexpensive and long-distance calls (or intercity data transfer via [[packet-switched]] [[computer network|networks]]) costly. Therefore, it fared somewhat poorly in [[Japan]], where even local lines are expensive, or in [[France]], where tolls on local calls and competition with [[Minitel]] or other data networks limited its growth.

===Points===
As the number of messages in Echomail grew over time, it became very difficult for users to keep up with the volume while logged into their local BBS. ''Points'' were introduced to address this, allowing technically savvy users to receive the already compressed and batched Echomail (and Netmail) and read it locally on their own machines. {{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 5}}

To do this, the FidoNet addressing scheme was extended with the addition of a final address segment, the point number. For instance, a user on the example system above might be given point number 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address &lt;tt&gt;1:170/918.10&lt;/tt&gt;.

In real-world use, points are fairly difficult to set up. The FidoNet software typically consisted of a number of small utility programs run by manually edited scripts that required some level of technical ability. Reading and editing the mail required either a "sysop editor" program, or a BBS program to be run locally.

In North America (Zone 1), where local calls are generally free, the benefits of the system were offset by its complexity. Points were used only briefly, and even then only to a limited degree. Dedicated [[offline mail reader]] programs such as [[Blue Wave (mail reader)|Blue Wave]], Squiggy and Silver Xpress (OPX) were introduced in the mid-1990s, and quickly rendered the point system obsolete. Many of these packages supported the [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] offline mail standard.

In other parts of the world, especially Europe, this was different. In Europe, even local calls are generally metered, so there was a strong incentive to keep the duration of the calls as short as possible. Point software employs standard compression (ZIP, ARJ, etc.) and so keeps the calls down to a few minutes a day at most. In contrast to North America, pointing saw rapid and fairly widespread uptake in Europe.

Many regions distribute a pointlist in parallel with the nodelist. The pointlist segments are maintained by Net- and Region Pointlist Keepers and the Zone Point List Keeper assembles them into the Zone pointlist. At the peak of FidoNet there were over 120,000 points listed in the Zone 2 pointlist. Listing points is on a voluntary basis and not every point is listed, so how many points there really were is anybody's guess. As of June 2006, there are still some 50,000 listed points. Most of them are in Russia and Ukraine.

===Technical specifications===
FidoNet contained several technical specifications for compatibility between systems.  The most basic of all is [http://ftsc.org/docs/fts-0001.016 ''FTS-0001''], with which all FidoNet systems are required to comply as a minimal requirement.  FTS-0001 defined:
*Handshaking - the protocols used by mailer software to identify each other and exchange meta information about the session.
*Transfer protocol ''([[XMODEM]])'' - the protocols to be used for transferring files containing FidoNet mail between systems.
*Message format - the standard format for FidoNet messages during the time which they were exchanged between systems.

Other specifications that were commonly used provided for ''echomail'', different transfer protocols and handshake methods (''e.g.: Yoohoo/Yoohoo2u2, EMSI''), file compression, nodelist format, transfer over reliable connections such as the Internet ([[Binkp]]), and other aspects.

===Zone mail hour===
Since computer bulletin boards historically used the same [[telephone line]]s for transferring mail as were used for dial-in human users of the BBS, FidoNet policy dictates that at least one designated line of each FidoNet node must be available for accepting mail from other FidoNet nodes during a particular hour of each day.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 6.0}}

''Zone Mail Hour'', as it was named, varies depending on the geographic location of the node, and was designated to occur during the early morning.  The exact hour varies depending on the time zone, and any node with only one telephone line is required to reject human callers. In practice, particularly in later times, most FidoNet systems tend to accept mail at any time of day when the phone line is not busy, usually during night.

==FidoNet deployments==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Most FidoNet deployments were designed in a modular fashion.  A typical deployment would involve several applications that would communicate through shared files and directories, and switch between each other through carefully designed [[shell script|scripts]] or [[batch file]]s.  However, [[wiktionary:monolith|monolithic]] software that encompassed all required functions in one package is available, such as D'Bridge.  Such software eliminated the need for custom batch files and is tightly integrated in operation.  The preference of deployment was that of the operator and there were both pros and cons of running in either fashion.

Arguably the most important piece of software on a DOS-based Fido system was the ''[[FOSSIL| FOSSIL driver]]'', which was a small device driver which provided a standard way for the Fido software to talk to the modem.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 10.0}}  This driver needed to be loaded before any Fido software would work.  An efficient FOSSIL driver meant faster, more reliable connections.

''Mailer software'' was responsible for transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times.  The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols.  If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user.  When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it from time to time by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further.  Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems.

''BBS software'' was used to interact with human callers to the system.  BBS software would allow dial-in users to use the system's message bases and write mail to others, locally or on other BBSes.  Mail directed to other BBSes would later be routed and sent by the mailer, usually after the user had finished using the system.  Many BBSes also allowed users to exchange files, play games, and interact with other users in a variety of ways (i.e.: node to node chat).

A ''scanner/tosser'' application, such as [[FastEcho]], [[FMail]], [[TosScan]] and [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]], would normally be invoked when a BBS user had entered a new FidoNet message that needed to be sent, or when a mailer had received new mail to be imported into the local messages bases.  This application would be responsible for handling the packaging of incoming and outgoing mail, moving it between the local system's message bases and the mailer's inbound and outbound directories.  The scanner/tosser application would generally be responsible for basic routing information, determining which systems to forward mail to.

In later times, ''message readers'' or ''editors'' that were independent of BBS software were also developed.  Often the System Operator of a particular BBS would use a devoted message reader, rather than the BBS software itself, to read and write FidoNet and related messages. One of the most popular editors in 2008 was [[GoldED+]].  In some cases FidoNet nodes, or more often FidoNet points, had no public bulletin board attached, and existed only for the transfer of mail for the benefit of the node's operator. Most nodes in 2009 had no BBS access, but only points, if anything.

The original ''Fido BBS'' software, and some other FidoNet-supporting software from the 1980s, is no longer functional on modern systems.  This is for several reasons, including problems related to the [[Y2K bug]].  In some cases, the original authors have left the [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] or [[shareware]] community, and the software, much of which was [[closed source]], has been rendered [[abandonware]].

Several DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as [[FrontDoor]], Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge from the early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the freeware [[NetFoss]] Telnet [[FOSSIL]] driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to ''dial'' an IP address or hostname via Telnet, rather than dialing a real [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with [[DOSEMU]] (DOS emulator).
Mail Tossers such as FastEcho and FMail are still used today under both Windows and Linux/DOSEMU.

[[File:Qcc-0.57.1xe master queue.png|thumb|File queue in qcc, the ncurses UI for qico. The addresses are made-up.]]
There are several modern Windows based FidoNet Mailers available today with source code, including Argus, Radius, and Taurus&lt;!-- (they seem to be neither [[free software]] nor [[open source software]], since, IIRC, commercial use is prohibited according to a license in the Argus source code at SF.net)--&gt;. MainDoor is another Windows based Fidonet mailer, which also can be run using either a modem or directly over TCP/IP. Two popular [[free and open source software]] FidoNet mailers for [[Unix-like]] systems are the [[binkd]] (cross-platform, IP-only, uses the [[binkp]] protocol) and qico (supports modem communication as well as the IP protocol of ifcico and binkp).

On the ''hardware'' side, Fido systems were usually well-equipped machines, for their day, with quick CPUs, high-speed modems and [[16550]] UARTs, which were at the time an upgrade.  As a Fidonet system was usually a BBS, it needed to quickly process any new mail events before returning to its 'waiting for call' state. In addition, the BBS itself usually necessitated lots of storage space.  Finally, a FidoNet system usually had at least one dedicated phoneline.  Consequently, operating a Fidonet system often required significant financial investment, a cost usually met by the owner of the system.

== FidoNet availability ==
While the use of FidoNet has dropped dramatically compared with its use up to the mid-1990s, it is still used in many countries and especially [[Russia]] and former republics of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Some BBSes, including those that are now available for users with [[Internet]] connections via [[telnet]], also retain their FidoNet netmail and echomail feeds.

Some of FidoNet's echomail conferences are available via gateways with the Usenet news hierarchy using software like UFGate.  There are also mail gates for exchanging messages between Internet and FidoNet.  Widespread net abuse and [[e-mail spam]] on the Internet side has caused some gateways (such as the former 1:1/31 [[IEEE]] fidonet.org gateway) to become unusable or cease operation entirely.

== FidoNews==
''FidoNews'' is the [[online journal|newsletter]] of the FidoNet community.  Affectionately nicknamed ''The Snooze'', it is published weekly.  It was first published in 1984.  Throughout its history, it has been published by various people and entities, including the short-lived International FidoNet Association.

Forest Sciences and Technology Centre of Catalonia  (CTFC) is a centre for [[forest research]] based in [[Solsona, Lleida]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/platform/organizations/0436_en.htm Forest Sciences Centre of Catalonia (CTFC)], European Commission - Environment Directorate-General&lt;/ref&gt; and is among the leading applied research centres in Spain.&lt;ref name=inverness&gt;[https://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk/research/whats-new/partners-1/ctfc-or-the-forest-sciences-centre-of-catalonia CTFC or The Forest Sciences Centre of Catalonia], University of the Highlands and Islands Inverness College (accessed 21 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1996&lt;ref name="Lewis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lowell Lewis|title=Catalunya I California: Estats Agermanats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4HmbMldOx4C&amp;pg=PA75|date=July 2013|publisher=Author House|isbn=978-1-4817-7037-8|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a consortium of five local and regional institutions (the Consell Comarcal del Solsonès, the [[University of Lleida]], the Diputació de Lleida, the Catalan Foundation for Research and Innovation, and the [[Catalan Government]]). The institution has grown to employ over one hundred professionals (including scientists, technicians, fellows and administrative personnel) who work in collaboration with different administrations, institutions and companies, and its annual budget is around 14 million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref name=inverness /&gt;

The activity of the CTFC is not restricted to competitive research, but also covers the transfer of technology and of knowledge and training, representing an important volume of its activity and adding value to its results. The transfer of technology in shape of conferences with the private sector and public administrations complements the organisation of seminars for the wider public and agents of different sectors (management, proprietary, technical, administration and scientific, etc.); nationally and internationally contributing to the transfer of this knowledge and to the generation of debate. In the field of training, the activity of the CTFC embraces basic training for workers and continuing training and skills development at postgraduate and masters level, including many visiting students from other countries.

CTFC is part of the [http://cerca.cat/ CERCA] network of excellence research centre of the Government of Catalonia, in the core of the research ecosystem. It has an external scientific advisory board which makes an independent evaluation every 4 years (2012, 2016), with an obligation to implement its recommendations, and an overarching supervision by the Parliament of Catalonia.&lt;ref name=inverness /&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission of CTFC is to “Contribute to the modernization and to the competitiveness of the forest sector, to the rural development and the sustainable management of the natural environment, through research, transfer of  technology and knowledge to the society, and training.” 
 
The  main  activities  of  CTFC  have  traditionally  been  guided  by  its  mission.  However,  the complexity  of  the  forest  sector  in  Catalonia  and,  its  relative  weakness  compared  to  other 
economic sectors, has led to a reinterpretation of the mission by the CTFC in a research context. In  this  line,  the  main  motto  of  the  institution  has  been  expanded  in  order  to  focus  on  the 
exploration of the multifunctional nature of Mediterranean forests. Those have indeed a unique richness compared to other types of forests and beyond wood they include a large number of 
other marketed and non‐marketed products and services that deliver to societies, from biomass energy to mushrooms or water quality, biodiversity and fire risk reduction.  
 
CTFC has been implicated in several policy initiatives at regional &amp; Mediterranean level, where its research results have directly been used within the policy processes: Regional Wood Biomass Strategy,  Natura 2000 ZECs, Overarching Forest Policy Plan (2012), FAO Tlemcen Declaration regarding Mediterranean forests (2013), Preventive Forest Management Strategy against Wild Fires (2015-2016), Wood Support Scheme (2015).

== Vision ==
The vision of the CTFC is to be recognised as a centre of reference at local, national and international levels in the fields of forest and rural development.

== Main lines of research ==
The R+D activity at CTFC is structured through six work programmes, which are connected to one another. Each one of those six work programmes is articulated in different action lines, not only in research but also in transfer of technology and training.

* [[Silviculture]] and forest management
* Forest production: wood and bioenergy
* Operation of ecosystems and biodiversity 
* Socioeconomic and forest politics
* Wildfires and other perturbations
* Non-wood forest products

In [[popular culture]], '''formula fiction''' is [[literature]] in which the storylines and [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have been reused to the extent that the [[narrative]]s are predictable.  It is similar to [[genre fiction]], which identifies a number of specific settings that are frequently reused.  The label of ''formula fiction'' is used in [[literary criticism]] as a mild [[pejorative]] to imply lack of originality.

Formula fiction is similar to genre fiction. The label of genre fiction is typically assigned because of the reuse of settings, content, layout, and/or style. The label of formula fiction is assigned because of the reuse of plot, [[plot device]]s and [[stock character]]s.

Genres like [[high fantasy]], [[Western movie|Westerns]] and [[science fiction]] [[space opera]] often have specific settings, such as a pseudo-[[Medieval Europe]]an setting, the [[Old West]], or [[outer space]].  Approaching a given genre, certain assumed background information covers the nature and purpose of possible predictable elements of the story, such as the appearance of [[European dragon|dragon]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]s in [[high fantasy]], [[Faster than light|warp drives]] in [[science fiction]], or [[shootout]]s at high noon in [[Western movie|Westerns]]. These set-ups are taken for granted by the genre conventions, and need not be explained for the reader anew, though these elements can easily be treated subversively as well, playing with some of the preconceptions inherent in formula fiction.

The ''formula'' is defined specifically by predictable [[narrative structure]]. Formulaic tales incorporate plots that have been reused so often as to be easily recognizable. Perhaps the most clearly formulaic plots characterize the [[romantic comedy]] genre; in a book or film labeled as such, viewers already know its most basic central plot, including to some extent the ending. This does not always prove to be detrimental to a given work's reception however, as the popularity of the aforementioned genre demonstrates.

''Formula fiction'' should not be confused with ''[[pastiche]]'' (the mimicking of another work or author's style), though the latter by its nature may include elements of the former; the same holds true of some [[parody]] and [[satire|satirical]] works as well, which may well include formulaic elements such as common [[stereotype]]s or [[caricature]]s, or which may use formulaic elements in order to mock them or point out their supposedly [[cliché]] or [[realism (arts)|unrealistic]] nature. Indeed, between [[parody]], [[satire]] and such [[subgenre]]s as romantic comedy, [[comedy]] as a whole often relies on either formulaic elements, or the mocking of such elements.

Formula fiction is often stereotypically associated with early [[pulp magazine]] markets, though some works published in that medium, such as "[[The Cold Equations]]", subvert the supposed expectations of the common narrative formula of that time.

The dissection and tracking of common formulaic [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s (as well as their subversions and new permutations) has become reasonably popular beyond strictly academic circles. (The [[Final Girl]] being one such example, as well as, to some extent, Campbell's ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''). [[Amateur]] circles have websites such as the [[TV Tropes|TV Tropes Wiki]].

[[Acid|Acidification]] of [[freshwater]] is an environmental issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.air-quality.org.uk/13.php Freshwater Acidification]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
 
One of the causes of fresh water acidification is [[acid rain]]. That means rain that is unusually [[acidic]] (low [[pH]]). Acid rain has harmful effects on soil ([[soil acidification]]), [[animals]], [[plants]] [[infrastructure]] and [[water]]. 

Another cause of freshwater acidification is the [[Buffer solution]]. The soil usually has [[Chemical substance|substance]]s that ensure that the pH is neutral and that the acid will be removed:  The Buffer solution. If the buffer solution is finished then the soil will become acid. This may cause [[toxic]] [[chemicals]] or [[nitrate]] to be released. The rain will cause the nitrate or the toxic chemicals to rinse out the surface water or ground water, causing them to contaminate water.
 
== Harmful effects ==
 
Fish and other aquatic animals will die in water with low pH. The acidity of the water cannot be detected with the naked eye, the water may look clear and bright, but it may still be acid. Acidified water cannot be used for drinking. First the water has to be neutralized (neutral pH), as acidic water is damaging to your health and could possibly cause [[kidney]] problems.
 
== Solution ==
 
Some countries try de-acidification of the lakes by adding a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of [[calcium carbonate]].
It is also possible to stop the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al acidification by reducing the use of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Sulfur dioxide]]),  [[NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Ammonia]]). Lowering the use of these substances is done by using low-[[Sulphur]]  [[fuel]], or [[flue gas desulphurization]].

'''High comedy''' or '''pure comedy''' is a type of [[comedy]] characterized by [[wit]]ty dialogue, [[satire]], biting humor, or criticism of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trumbull |first=Eric W.|url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/typecomd.htm |title=Types of Drama / Plays: Comedy |publisher=Northern Virginia Community College |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, high comedy can be seen among [[sitcom]]s and [[talk shows]] targeted at cultured and articulate audiences. Examples of high comedy include [[Arrested Development (TV series)]], [[The Simpsons]], [[The Marx Brothers]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Seinfeld]], [[The Larry Sanders Show]] and [[The Office (UK TV series)]].

'''Housekeeping''' refers to the management of duties and chores involved in the running of a [[household]], such as [[cleaner|cleaning]], [[cooking]], [[home maintenance]], [[shopping]], [[laundry]] and [[Invoice|bill]] pay. These tasks may be performed by any of the household members, or by other persons hired to perform these tasks. The term is also used to refer to the money allocated for such use.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/housekeeping?q=housekeeping "housekeeping"] ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|Oxford Dictionaries Online]]''. Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, an office or organization, as well as the [[Housekeeping (computing)|maintenance]] of [[computer storage]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/housekeeping?showCookiePolicy=true "housekeeping"] ''[[The Collins English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] is a person employed to manage a household,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/housekeeper "housekeeper"] ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|Oxford Dictionaries Online]]''. Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[domestic staff]]. According to the Victorian Era ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', the housekeeper is second in command in the house and "except in large establishments, where there is a house steward, the housekeeper must consider his/herself as the immediate representative of her mistress".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household/chapter2.html#chapter2  ''Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management''] Web version of the book at the [[University of Adelaide]] Library.

==Housecleaning==
[[File:Broom, sponge and towel.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Broom, sponge and duster]]
[[File:A Day in the Life of a Wartime Housewife- Everyday Life in London, England, 1941 D2366.jpg|thumb|Part of the housework of a London housewife, 1941]]
It includes activities such as housecleaning, that is, disposing of [[rubbish]], cleaning dirty surfaces, dusting and [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]]. It may also involve some outdoor chores, such as removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows and sweeping doormats. The term housecleaning is often used also figuratively in politics and business, for the removal of unwanted personnel, methods or policies in an effort at reform or improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/housecleaning The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language] Retrieved 2011-01-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Housecleaning is done to make the home look and smell better and be safer and easier to live in. Without housecleaning [[lime scale]] can build up on [[Tap (valve)|tap]]s, [[mold]] grows in wet areas,  smudges on glass surfaces, dust forms on surfaces, [[bacteria]]l action make the garbage disposal and toilet smell and [[spider|cobwebs]] accumulate. Tools used in housecleaning include [[vacuum cleaner|vacuums]], [[broom]]s, [[mop]]s and [[Sponge (material)|sponges]], together with cleaning products such as [[detergent]]s, [[disinfectant]]s and [[bleach]].

===Removal of litter===
Disposal of rubbish is an important aspect of house cleaning. Plastic bags are designed and manufactured specifically for the collection of litter. Many are sized to fit common waste baskets and trash cans. Paper bags are made to carry aluminum cans, glass jars and other things although most people use plastic bins for glass since it could break and tear through the bag. [[Recycling]] is possible with some kinds of litter.&lt;ref&gt;Dellutri, Laura. 2005. Speed Cleaning 101. Meredith Books, Des Moines, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dusting===
[[File:Some dusting tools.PNG|right|thumb|95px|Some dusting tools]]
Over time [[dust]] accumulates on household surfaces. As well as making the surfaces dirty, when dust is disturbed it can become suspended in the air, causing sneezing and breathing trouble. It can also transfer from furniture to clothing, making it unclean. Various tools have been invented for dust removal; [[Feather duster|Feather and lamb’s wool dusters]], cotton and polyester dust cloths, furniture spray, disposable paper "dust cloths", dust mops for smooth floors and vacuum cleaners. Vacuum cleaners often have a variety of tools to enable them to remove dirt not just from carpets and rugs, but from hard surfaces and upholstery.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Rose.  2006. 10-Minute Housekeeping. Beverly, MA: Fair Winds Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dusting is very important in hospital environments.&lt;ref&gt;''Executive Housekeeping Today'' (2004), Volumes 23-25, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of dirt===
[[File:US Army 51089 Unsung heroes.jpg|thumb|Two women cleaning the floor]]
Examples of dirt or "soil" are [[detritus]] and common spills and stains that exists in the home. Equipment used with a cleaner might be a bucket and sponge or a rag. A modern tool is the spray bottle, but the principle is the same.

===Household chemicals===

Various household cleaning products have been developed to facilitate the removal of dust and dirt, for surface maintenance, and for disinfection.&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"&gt;Wolkoff P, Schneider T, Kildeso J, Degerth R, Jaroszewski, and Schunk H. Science of the Total Environment, 215, (1998) pg. 135–156&lt;/ref&gt; Products are available in powder, liquid or spray form. The basic ingredients determine the type of cleaning tasks for which they are suitable. Some are packaged as general purpose cleaning materials while others are targeted at specific cleaning tasks such as drain clearing, oven cleaning, lime scale removal and polishing furniture. Household cleaning products provide aesthetic and hygiene benefits but are also associated with health risks for the users, and building occupants.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon KD, Jo WK, Lim JH, and Jcong WS. Environ Sci Pollut Res 15, (2008) pg. 521–526&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Health and Human Services offers the public access to the Household Products Database.  This database provides consumer information for over 4,000 products based on information provided by the manufacturer through the [[material safety data sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/household/prodtree?prodcat=Inside+the+Home | title=Household Products Database | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surfactant]]s lower the surface tension of water, making it able to flow into smaller tiny cracks and crevices in soils making removal easier. [[Alkaline]] chemicals break down known soils such as grease and mud. [[Acid]]s break down soils such as lime scale, [[soap scum]], and stains of mustard, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages. Some [[solvent]]-based products are flammable and some can dissolve paint and varnish. [[Disinfectants]] stop smell and stains caused by bacteria.

When multiple chemicals are applied to the same surface without full removal of the earlier substance, the chemicals may interact. This interaction may result in a reduction of the efficiency of the chemicals applied (such as a change in [[pH]] value caused by mixing alkalis and acids) and in cases may even emit toxic fumes. An example of this is the mixing of ammonia-based cleaners (or acid-based cleaners) and bleach.&lt;ref name="Nazaroff, WW. 2004"&gt;Nazaroff, WW., Weschler, CJ., Atmospheric Environment. 38 (2004) pg. 2841–2865&lt;/ref&gt; This causes the production of [[chloramines]] that volatilize (become gaseous) causing acute [[inflammation]] of the lungs (toxic pneumonitis), long-term respiratory damage, and potential death.&lt;ref&gt;Reisz, GR., Gammon, RS. Toxic Pneumonitis from mixing household chemicals. CHEST 89 (1986) pg. 49–52&lt;/ref&gt;

Residue from cleaning products and cleaning activity (dusting, vacuuming, sweeping) have been shown to impact [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ) by redistributing [[particulates|particulate matter]] (dust, dirt, human skin cells, organic matter, animal [[dander]], particles from [[combustion]], fibers from insulation, [[pollen]], and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]]) that gaseous or liquid particles become adsorbed to. The particulate matter and chemical [[residue (chemistry)|residual]] will be of highest concentrations right after cleaning but will decrease over time depending upon levels of contaminants, air exchange rate, and other sources of chemical residual.&lt;ref name="Nazaroff, WW. 2004"/&gt;  Of most concern are the family of chemicals called VOCs such as [[formaldehyde]], [[toluene]], and [[limonene]].&lt;ref&gt;Burton, A. Environmental Health Perspectives – Indoor Air Quality.  Vol. 115 #7 (2007) pg. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) are released from many household cleaning products such as disinfectants, polishes, floor waxes, air-freshening sprays, all purpose cleaning sprays, and glass cleaner.  These products have been shown to emit irritating vapors.&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raizenne M. 1998"&gt;Raizenne M., Dales R., Burnett, R., Canadian Jour of Public Health.  Air Pollution Exposures and Children's Health. Vol. 89, Suppl. 1 May–June 1998. pg. S43–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zock, JP. 2007 pg. 735–741"&gt;Zock, JP., Plana, E., Jarvis D. et al.  Am J Resipir Crit Care Medicine. Vol. 176. (2007) pg. 735–741&lt;/ref&gt; VOCs are of most concern due to their tendency to evaporate and be inhaled into the lungs or [[adsorbed]] to existing dust, which can also be inhaled.&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"/&gt; It has been found that aerosolized (spray) cleaning products are important risk factors and may aggravate symptoms of adult [[asthma]],&lt;ref name="Zock, JP. 2007 pg. 735–741"/&gt; respiratory irritation,&lt;ref name="Wolkoff P 1998 pg. 135–156"/&gt; childhood asthma, wheeze, bronchitis, and allergy.&lt;ref name="Raizenne M. 1998"/&gt;

Other modes of exposure to potentially harmful household cleaning chemicals include absorption through the skin (dermis), accidental ingestion, and accidental splashing into the eyes.  Products for the application and safe use of the chemicals are also available, such as nylon scrub sponge and [[rubber glove]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;Bredenberg, Jeff et al. 1998. Clean it Fast, Clean it right. Emmaus, PA, USA:Rodale. {{ISBN|0-87596-509-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is up to the consumer to keep themselves safe while using these chemicals. Reading and comprehending the labels is important.

Chemicals used for cleaning toilet, sinks, and bathtubs can find their way into our sewage water and can often not be effectively removed or filtered.

There is a growing consumer and governmental interest in [[natural]] cleaning products and [[green cleaning]] methods. The use of nontoxic household chemicals is growing as consumers become more informed of the health effects of many household chemicals, and municipalities are having to deal with the expensive disposal of [[household hazardous waste]] (HHW).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, D., Werner, CM., Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy. Changing Homeowners' Behaviors Involving Toxic Household Chemicals: A psychological, multilevel approach. (2001) pg. 1–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slack, RJ., Gronow, JR., Voulvoulis N. Science of the Total Environment. 337 (2005) 119–137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools===
[[Broom]]s remove debris from floors and [[dustpan]]s carry dust and debris swept into them, [[bucket]]s hold cleaning and rinsing solutions, [[vacuum cleaner]]s and [[carpet sweeper]]s remove surface dust and debris, [[chamois leather]] and [[squeegee]]s are used for window-cleaning, and [[mop]]s are used for washing floors.&lt;ref&gt;Bredenberg, Jeff et al. 1998. ''Clean It Fast, Clean It Right.'' Emmaus, PA: Rodale&lt;/ref&gt; Protective gear including rubber [[gloves]], [[Mask|face cover]]s, and [[Eye protection|protective eyewear]] is also used when dealing with cleaning products.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Yard===
A home's yard and exterior are sometimes subject to cleaning. Exterior cleaning also occurs for safety, upkeep and usefulness. It includes removal of paper litter and grass growing in sidewalk cracks.

==House chores==
House chores, or chores are components of housekeeping, and are usually in reference to specific tasks to be completed.   Examples of house chores are: washing dishes; taking out trash after dinner.

==Social significance==

While housekeeping can be seen as an objective activity that can be done by either men or women, some people have argued that housekeeping is a site of historical oppression and gender division between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/The-Politics-of-Housework.html | title=The Politics of Housework | publisher=Redstockings | date=1970 | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Mainardi, Pat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housekeeping also has a role in maintaining certain parts of the capitalist economy, including the division of home and work life, as well as industries that sell chemicals and household goods.

A survey conducted by the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in 2014 came to the result that approximately 43 percent of men did food preparation or cleanup on any given day, compared with approximately 70 percent of women. In addition, 20 percent of men did housekeeping chores (including cleaning and laundry) on any given day, compared to approximately 50 percent of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey|date=June 24, 2015|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''initial sound table''' is a table, list or chart which shows the initial sound letter of a word together with its picture (pictured words). The initial sound table can assist students to recognise initial sounds and to get [[Reading (process)|first reading]] and writing skills. In 1658 [[John Amos Comenius]] created an initial sound table in [[Orbis Pictus]] (a picture book intended for children).

''Alternative names:'' initial sound list, initial sound chart, initial sound [[alphabet]], alphabet chart, alphabet picture chart

== Writing to read ==
In the German-speaking countries, language experience is often based on children's writing of stories that involves [[Whole language|invented spelling]]s (e.g. with the help of an "initial sound table" picturing words that start with a specific sound). The Swiss teacher Jürgen Reichen ([[progressive education]]) founded this "writing to read" method&amp;nbsp;1982. The method combines two basic features of in favour of "[[phonics]]" (unduly equated with "[[direct instruction]]", stepwise teaching, etc.). According to this approach children should be encouraged to "write
words as they pronounce them" with the help of an "initial sound list" of pictured words.
Constructing words in this way is supposed to help them to understand the basic relationship
between spoken and written language.

[[Johann Amos Comenius]] already added 1658 an initial-sound-table to his „[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]“.

The '''International Film Music Critics Association''' ('''IFMCA''') is a professional association for [[music journalism|online, print and radio journalists]] who specialize in writing about [[film score|original film and television music]].

==History and purpose==
The IFMCA was founded in the late 1990s as the '''Film Music Critics Jury''' by film music journalist [[Mikael Carlsson]] (now the owner of film music record label [[MovieScore Media]]), and after period of inactivity was re-launched in 2003 under its new title.

Its membership includes 65 journalists from 16 different countries who write for such high-profile film and soundtrack-related publications and websites as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]], [[SoundtrackNet]], [[Music from the Movies]] and [[UnderScores]], as well as more mainstream publications such as [[Ain't It Cool News]], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and the [[Irish Times]]. Members of the IFMCA have also been involved in writing [[liner notes]] for major film music record labels such as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Varèse Sarabande]], [[Intrada Records]], La-La Land Records and [[Music Box Records]].

The aim of the group is to promote original film music and the work of film music composers as legitimate artists worthy of recognition from the mainstream film and music media, and to publicize the work of its members in pursuing this aim. To this end, the group maintains a website documenting its activities; operates a central online review interface which provides links to articles, reviews and interviews written by its members; organizes an annual awards event, the IFMCA Awards, celebrating music for films written during the preceding year; and is involved in organizing major international film music festivals, such as those in [[Tenerife International Film Music Festival|Tenerife]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Home |url=http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/ |title=Tenerife International Film Music Festival |publisher=Fimucite.com |accessdate=11 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002151/http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/# |archive-date=11 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Úbeda]] in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://festival.bsospirit.com/en/index.php ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kraków]] in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmp.org.pl/ |title=Festiwal Muzyki Polskiej |publisher=Fmp.org.pl |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Soundtrack Academy|World Soundtrack Awards]] in [[Ghent]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poland |url=http://filmmusiccritics.org/members/ |title=IFMCA: the International Film Music Critics Association » Members |publisher=Filmmusiccritics.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IFMCA Awards==
The organization is responsible for the annual International Film Music Critics Association Awards, the only awards given to composers by active film music journalists, and which are seen by many as a valuable precursor to the [[Academy Awards]] in the absence of a guild for composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incontention.com/2010/01/29/international-film-music-critics-nominees/ |title=International Film Music Critics nominees |publisher=Incontention.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been called the "Oscars of film music",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=704788 |title=Araujo, premio IFMCA a la banda sonora de videojuegos por "Lords of Shadow" |publisher=Abc.es |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been featured in major daily newspapers in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/Sinfonias/videojuego/elpepurtv/20110308elpepirtv_1/Tes |title=Sinfonías en el videojuego: Premio internacional para Óscar Araujo por una banda sonora |publisher=Elpais.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundoportugues.org/content/1/8810/nuno-malo-eleito-compositor-revelacao-ano-nos-estados-unidos/ |title=Nuno Malo eleito o compositor revelação do ano nos Estados Unidos |publisher=Mundoportugues.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are recognized by major performing rights organizations such as [[ASCAP]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2011/02/Faces_Places/FilmTV/IFMCA_Awards.aspx |title=ASCAP Composers Score at the IFMCA Awards |publisher=Ascap.com |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores|SGAE]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgae.es/el-compositor-catalan-oscar-araujo-gana-el-premio-a-la-mejor-banda-sonora-2010-para-videojuego-de-la-international-film-music-critics-association/ |title=SGAE: El compositor catalán Óscar Araujo gana el Premio a la Mejor Banda Sonora 2010 para Videojuego de la International Film Music Critics Association |publisher=Sgae.es |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently have been seen by the video games industry as an important step forward in legitimizing game music as a mainstream creative art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/02/12/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-soundtrack-nominated-for-2-ifmca/ |title=Castlevania: Lords of Shadow soundtrack nominated for 2 IFMCA awards |publisher=Joystiq.com |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Allen Paulos''' (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He has gained fame as a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of [[numeracy|mathematical literacy]]. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical [[innumeracy]]; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability, and logic.

==Early life==
Paulos was born in [[Denver Colorado]] and grew up in Chicago, [[Illinois]] and [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. In an interview he described himself as lifelong skeptic.&lt;ref name=Podcast&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Skeptics!|url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|publisher=Christopher Brown|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222062748/http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-john-allen-paulos|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to high school in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. After his Bachelor of Mathematics at [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967) and his  Master of Science at [[University of Washington]] (1968) he received his [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1974). He was also part of the [[Peace Corps]] in the seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNDB|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/786/000041663/|publisher=NNDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic work is mainly in [[mathematical logic]] and [[probability theory]].

His book ''[[Innumeracy (book)|Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences]]'' (1988) was a bestseller and ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses [[innumeracy]] with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more [[quantitative property|quantitative]] way.

He has also written on other subjects often "combining disparate disciplines", such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in ''Mathematics and Humor'' and ''I Think, Therefore I Laugh'', the [[stock market]] in ''A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market'', quantitative aspects of narrative in ''Once Upon a Number'', the arguments for God in ''Irreligion'', and most recently "bringing mathematics to bear on...biography" in ''A Numerate Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Paulos |first=John Allen |interviewer=Jim Stein |title=A Numerate Life: A Mathematician Explores the Vagaries of Life, His Own and Probably Yours |url=http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |date=10 November 2015 |work=New Books in Mathematics |access-date=24 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115193717/http://newbooksinmath.com/2015/11/12/john-allen-paulos-a-numerate-life-prometheus-books-2015/ |archivedate=January 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and is a [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] fellow (formally known as Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]])).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|url=http://www.csicop.org|publisher=CSI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulos has appeared frequently on radio and television, including a four-part [[BBC]] adaptation of ''A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper'' and appearances on the [[Lehrer News Hour]], [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]], [[Larry King]], and [[David Letterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paulos at David Letterman |url=https://math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |publisher=Temple University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411001818/http://www.math.temple.edu/~paulos/other.html |archivedate=April 11, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Paulos taught a course on quantitative literacy for journalists at the Columbia University School of Journalism. The course stimulated further programs at Columbia and elsewhere in precision and data-driven journalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

His long-running "[[ABCNews.com]]" monthly column ''Who's Counting''&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/ Who's Counting] at ABC News&lt;/ref&gt; deals with mathematical aspects of stories in the news. All the columns over a 10- year period are archived here.&lt;ref name="Who's Counting"/&gt;

He is married and the father of two.

'''''Kids Can Say No!''''', stylized as '''''Kids Can Say &lt;u&gt;No&lt;/u&gt;''','' is a 1985 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[Short film|short]] [[educational film]] produced and directed by Jessica Skippon and written by Anita Bennett. It is intended to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]], how to escape such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. In the film, Australian celebrity [[Rolf Harris]] is in a park with a group of four children and tells them about proper and improper [[physical intimacy]], which he calls "yes" and "no" feelings. The film has four [[role-playing]] scenes in which children encounter [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], with Harris and the children discussing each scene.

Harris said that he came up with the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw [[Vancouver]]'s [[Green Thumb Theatre]] production of ''[[Feeling Yes, Feeling No]]'', a play about [[child sexual abuse]]. ''Kids Can Say No!'', released in October 1985 on [[VHS]] in the United Kingdom, was the first British [[children's film]] about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, ''[[The Times]]'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of ''Kids Can Say No!'' and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel ''Beyond the Scare'', which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of ''Kids Can Say No!'' eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.

''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault|indecently assaulting]] young girls. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial to illustrate its unintentional irony, but the film was not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]]. Harris was found guilty of all counts. During the trial, it was learned that, while Harris was filming ''Kids Can Say No!'', he was in the midst of a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend and, by its release, he had committed nine of the twelve assaults. According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

During and after each of the role-playing scenes, Harris and the children discuss the situation and what the child should do.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; Harris tells the children not to be afraid to tell someone if they have been improperly touched, saying, "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help.

Harris, then host of ''[[Rolf's Cartoon Time]]'', approached the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC) and the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] with his idea about making a film on child [[sexual abuse]]. Both organisations were receptive.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use [[child actor]]s in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Express]]|title=Hypocrisy: Rolf Harris Warned of Paedophiles in Children's Charity Video|author=Twomey, John|date=1 June 2014|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/485939/Rolf-Harris-warned-of-paedophiles-in-children-s-charity-video|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris approached [[Film director|director]] Jessica Skippon, with whom he had made a film about water safety,&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; and said that he wanted to make ''Kids Can Say No!'' to protect children.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

''Kids Can Say No!'' was made in [[London]] with input from Carolyn Okell Jones, an expert on [[child abuse]],&lt;ref name=Pettifor/&gt; and was filmed on [[Hampstead Heath]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; The child actors were students at the [[Barbara Speake Stage School]].&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; Skippon directed and produced the film. Funding was difficult because neither the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] nor the [[Home Office]] considered the film under their jurisdiction, and each office referred Skippon to the other.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; Childwatch, a [[Charitable organization|charitable organisation]],&lt;ref name=Bracchi&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Irish Daily Mail]]|title=He Even Led a War Against Other Child Molesters|author=Bracchi, Paul|date=1 July 2014|page=5|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=IRDAIM0020140701ea710001f&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=21 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; donated £15,000 and technical facilities were provided by Barclays Bank Video.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; Harris covered the rest of the film's production costs&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt; and American children's songwriter&lt;ref name=Peachey&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Rolf Harris Guilty: The Hypocrite Who Warned Children about Paedophiles|author=Peachey, Paul|date=30 June 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rolf-harris-guilty-the-hypocrite-who-warned-children-about-paedophiles-9574322.html|accessdate=2 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702041329/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rolf-harris-guilty-the-hypocrite-who-warned-children-about-paedophiles-9574322.html|archivedate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Alsop]] wrote the theme song.&lt;ref name=Beal&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|title='Filthy Predator': Victim Tells of Star's Depravity|author=Beal, James|date=1 July 2014|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=THESUN0020140701ea71000em&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=21 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Anita Bennett wrote the script, which was reviewed and approved by a NSPCC committee.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; ''Kids Can Say No!'' was the second film from Rolf Harris Video, an educational video [[production company]] Harris founded in 1980. In an interview, he said that his role of talking with children about sexual abuse in the film was a natural one because "my track record has made me a believable person. I have never betrayed the kids' trust".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

''Kids Can Say No!'' was the first British [[children's film]] about sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Bingham&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Artist to the Queen and Adored by Generations of Viewers|author=Bingham, John|date=1 July 2014|page=2|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=DT00000020140701ea710008d&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is intended to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, how to get out of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt;

In April 1986, Harris met with [[Western Australia Police]] officials and members of several state-government departments in [[Mount Hawthorn, Western Australia|Mount Hawthorn]] to propose another film for children about how to handle [[sexual predator]]s. Despite Harris' offer to work for free, the officials declined and instead developed a broader campaign on the subject without Harris.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Sydney Opera House (9587195189).jpg|thumb|alt=Sydney Opera House|[[Child abuse|Child-abuse]] expert Carolyn Okell Jones presented ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the [[Sydney Opera House]] (''pictured'') in 1986 as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]].]]
''Kids Can Say No!'' was released in the United Kingdom in October 1985&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; on [[VHS]]&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; with notes for teachers and two relevant books,&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; and was distributed by Skippon Video, Skippon's UK-based company.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; Although several other short children's educational films about sexual abuse were on the market in the UK including several also released that year, ''Kids Can Say No!'' was the only British film; the others were made in Australia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In August 1986, Jones presented the film at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia as part of the sixth [[International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect|International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect]], the largest conference in the world on child abuse. The 56-year-old Harris, who was chosen to be [[master of ceremonies]] for the three-day conference's opening event because of his celebrity and involvement with the film, told the audience that paedophilia was finally "coming out from under its veil of secrecy".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|title=The Dark Double Life of Rolf Harris|author=Guilliatt, Richard|author2=[[Jacquelin Magnay]]|date=12 July 2014|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/the-dark-double-life-of-rolf-harris/story-e6frg8h6-1226981773650|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of ''Kids Can Say No!'' were purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[News.com.au]]|title=Chilling Words from Rolf Harris in a Child Sex Abuse Educational Video, Kids Can Say No!|date=1 July 2014|author=Miranda, Charles|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/chilling-words-from-rolf-harris-in-a-child-sex-abuse-educational-video-kids-can-say-no/story-fncynjr2-1226973208034|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VHS tapes circulated widely in schools and [[rape crisis center]]s in Australia; although showings began to decrease as VHS became less popular,&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; the film was a significant teaching tool.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt; The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of ''Kids Can Say No!'' and therefore broadcast it a second time that year.&lt;ref name=Whelan/&gt;

===Sequel===
After the release of ''Kids Can Say No!'', many teachers who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of how to deal with the disclosures,&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt; ''Beyond the Scare''.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; ''Kids Can Say No!'' encourages children to report abuse they experience and ''Beyond the Scare'' advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

''Beyond the Scare'', filmed in a [[North London]] school, consists of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers to listen to the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote [[child protection]] projects in schools. Although Harris appears in ''Beyond the Scare'', his role is less prominent than in ''Kids Can Say No!''&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=The Importance of Listening: The Issue of Child Sex Abuse|date=7 October 1986|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=40GH-HB00-00VY-8177&amp;csi=270944,270077,11059,8411&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true|accessdate=25 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt;

==Harris' trial==
[[File:Rolf Harris.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Rolf Harris|In 2014, Harris was convicted of twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] against four young girls, having committed nine counts before the 1985 release of ''Kids Can Say No!'']]
''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was prosecuted for twelve counts of [[indecent assault]] between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the youngest was seven years old. The prosecutors found ''Kids Can Say No!'' on [[YouTube]] and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not [[Admissible evidence|admitted as evidence]].&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt;

After the trial began, Skippon warned media outlets that it was illegal to use the film without written permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|title=Rolf Harris Starred in Video about Protecting Children in 1980s|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/rolf-harris-starred-in-video-about-protecting-children-in-1985-9573633.html|first=Paul|last=Cheston|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director wrote to ''[[The Independent]]'' that no complaints were made against Harris during the making of the film.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; In an article about the allegations against Harris, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' noted that ''Kids Can Say No!'' was commissioned by the NSPCC;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|title=BBC Sex Scandal: A Gifted Entertainer who was Nervous of Groupies|author=Flint, John|date=21 April 2013|page=17|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=SUNTEL0020130421e94l00066&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; a NSPCC spokesperson responded, "The film was made independently by Rolf Harris and a film company nearly 30 years ago&amp;nbsp;... We did not commission it, fund it, make it or distribute it".&lt;ref name=Twomey/&gt;

[[Southwark Crown Court]] found Harris guilty of all twelve counts of indecent assault.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; During the trial, it was learned that, while making ''Kids Can Say No!'', Harris was involved in a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release,&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release.&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; The first complainant was about the age of the children in ''Kids Can Say No!,''&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt; although the conviction related to this count was quashed in 2017.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42012064|title=Rolf Harris indecent assault conviction overturned|work=BBC News|date=16 November 2017|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt; A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in ''Kids Can Say No!'' said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.&lt;ref name=Peachey/&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews of ''Kids Can Say No!'' have generally been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. She calls the film's theme song "catchy, one of those irritating snatches of music that is hard to forget".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

''The Times'' obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using ''Kids Can Say No!'' or any other film to teach children about the subject. [[Northampton]] [[social work]]er Helen Kenward said that she would not show the film to children. [[Psychiatrist]] Brendan McCarthy called it simplistic. According to teacher Clare Rankin, children under five would not understand the film. [[Physician]] Paula Drummond was concerned that it might inspire children to falsely accuse adults they disliked, although McCarthy said that children were unlikely to make false abuse accusations. McCarthy was especially critical of the film, calling it "no clearer to a child than the Gorbachev-Reagan talks".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt; Moorehead summarised the experts' comments as suggesting that ''Kids Can Say No!'' is "muddling, evasive and pussy-footed, best not for children at all, but as&amp;nbsp;... aids for parents and professional workers to alert them to paedophilia and incest".&lt;ref name=Moorehead/&gt;

In a 1988 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]]'' review, Judith Whelan writes that Harris is more serious in the film than he was when performing "[[Jake the Peg]]". According to Whelan, the film "would best be seen by children in a group, with an adult (teacher or parent) nearby who could encourage discussion after the show or answer children's questions during it".&lt;ref name=Whelan&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Saying 'No' is a Child's First Defence|author=Whelan, Judith|date=21 November 1988|page=6|url=https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&amp;NS=16&amp;AID=9UNI002400&amp;an=smhh000020011117dkbl0214s&amp;cat=a&amp;ep=ASI|accessdate=24 June 2015}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Kids Can Say No!'' resurfaced in 2014, Peter Walker wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the film "illustrates with grim eloquence, in retrospect, the prosecution notion that [Harris] was a man of two distinct sides: the avuncular and trustworthy public figure, and lurking behind, the groper and abuser".&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Walker notes that the scene in which a man assaults his child's friend mirrors what Harris did to his daughter's best friend, and that the closing sequence has "an accidental resonance that would only emerge more than 25 years later" because of the two police officers behind Harris.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

According to Richard Guilliatt and [[Jacquelin Magnay]] in an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', Harris' campaign against paedophilia in ''Kids Can Say No!'' can "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".&lt;ref name=Guilliatt/&gt; NSPCC chief executive officer [[Peter Wanless]] appeared on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' saying that Harris' appearance in the film was hypocritical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Rolf Harris Guilty: Abuse Victim Wrote to the Queen to Warn Her as the Presenter Painted Monarch's Portrait|first=Jenn|last=Selby|date=1 July 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rolf-harris-guilty-victim-wrote-to-the-queen-to-warn-her-as-the-presenter-painted-her-portrait-9575140.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' article, Paul Bracchi writes that Harris' work on ''Kids Can Say No!'' at the same time that he was abusing girls was "one of the most sickening examples [of] hiding in plain sight".&lt;ref name=Bracchi/&gt; In 2014, theme composer Peter Alsop said that Harris may have used the film to [[Child grooming|groom children]] because it encouraged trust by parents.&lt;ref name=Beal/&gt;

'''Life skills-based education''' ('''LSBE''') is a form of education that focuses on cultivating personal [[life skills]] such as self-reflection, critical thinking, problem solving and interpersonal skills. LSBE aims to help children reach their full personal potentials and to prepare them for the challenges of everyday life. 

Life skills-based education has a long history of supporting child development and health promotion in many parts. In 1986, the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]] recognized life skills in terms of making better health choices. The 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) linked life skills to education by stating that education should be directed towards the development of the child’s fullest potential. The 1990 Jomtien Declaration on Education for All took this vision further and included life skills among essential learning tools for survival, capacity development and quality of life. The 2000 Dakar World Education Conference took a position that all young people and adults have the human right to benefit from "an education that includes learning to know, to do, to live together and to be", and included life skills in two out of the six EFA Goals.

Life skills-based education is now recognized as a methodology to address a variety of issues of child and youth development and thematic responses including as expressed in UNGASS on HIV/AIDS (2001), UNGASS on Children (2002), World Youth Report (2003), World Program for Human Rights Education (2004), UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development (2005), UN Secretary General’s Study on Violence Against Children (2006), 51st Commission on the Status of Women (2007), and the World Development Report (2007).

Expected learning outcomes include a combination of knowledge, values, attitudes and skills with a particular emphasis on those skills that related to critical thinking and problem solving, self-management and communication and inter-personal skills.

'''Logistics engineering''' is a  field of engineering dedicated to the scientific organization of the [[purchase]], [[transport]], storage, [[distribution (business)|distribution]], and [[warehousing]] of materials and finished goods. Logistics engineering is a complex science that considers trade-offs in component/system design, repair capability, training, [[Spare parts management|spares inventory]], demand history, storage and distribution points, transportation methods, etc., to ensure the "thing" is where it's needed, when it's needed, and operating the way it's needed all at an acceptable cost.

==Overview==

[[Logistics]] is generally concerned with [[Cost centre (business)|cost centre]] service activities, but provides [[value (economics)|value]] via improved [[efficiency]] and customer satisfaction. It can quickly lose that value if the customer becomes dissatisfied. The end customer can include another process or work center inside of the manufacturing facility, a [[warehouse]] where items are stocked or the final customer who will use the product. Another approach which has appeared in recent years is the [[supply chain management]]. The supply chain  also looks at an efficient chaining of the supply / purchase and distribution sides of an [[organization]]. While logistics looks at single echelons with the immediate supply and distribution linked up, supply chain looks at multiple echelons/stages, right from [[procurement]] of the [[raw material]]s to the final distribution of finished goods up to the customer. It is based on the basic premise that the supply and distribution activities if integrated with the manufacturing / logistic activities, can result in better profitability for the organization. The [[local minimum]] of total cost of the manufacturing operation is getting replaced by the [[global minimum]] of total cost of the whole chain, resulting in better profitability for the chain members and hence lower costs for the products.

Logistics engineering as a discipline is a very important aspect of [[systems engineering]] that also includes [[reliability engineering]]. It is the science and process whereby [[Reliability_engineering|reliability]], [[maintainability]], and [[availability]] are designed into products or systems. It includes the supply and physical distribution considerations above as well as more fundamental engineering considerations. Logistics engineers work with complex mathematical models that consider elements such as [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), [[statistical distribution]]s, [[queueing theory]], and a host of other considerations. For example, if we want to produce a system that is 95% reliable (or improve a system to achieve 95% reliability), a logistics engineer understands that total system reliability can be no greater than the least reliable subsystem or component. Therefore our logistics engineer must consider the reliability of all subcomponents or subsystems and modify system design accordingly. If a subsystem is only 50% reliable, one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that subsystem, design in multiple subsystems in parallel (5 in this case would achieve approximately 97% reliability of that subsystem), purchase and store spare subsystems for rapid change out, establish repair capability that would get a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time, and/or choose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs. reliability solution.  Then the engineer moves onto the next subsystem.

===The name: logistics engineering===

The are few differences between the terms [[business logistics]] and logistics engineering. Logistics engineering is more focused on the mathematical or scientific application of logistics.&lt;ref&gt;G. Don Taylor, Logistics Engineering Handbook, CRC Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fields and topics===

The various fields and topics that logistics engineers are involved with include:

*[[Customer Service]]: provision of services to customers before, during and after a purchase
*[[Purchasing]]: acquiring goods or services to accomplish its goals
*[[Outsourcing|Sourcing]]: procurement practices, aimed at finding, evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services
*[[Demand forecasting]]: the art and science of forecasting customer demand to drive holistic execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management
*[[Facility location problem|Facility Location]]: the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing, and competitors' facilities
*Layout Design
*[[Inventory control]]: the activity of checking a shop’s stock
*[[Material Handling]]: short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle
*[[Warehousing]]
*Distribution System Design
*[[Reliability Engineering]]: sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product
*[[Reverse logistics]]: the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal
*[[Green logistics]]: attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities
*[[Intermodal freight transport|Intermodal transport]]
*Supportability analysis

===Performance metrics===
{{main|Performance metric}}

Different [[performance metric]]s (measures of performance) are used to examine the efficiency of an organization's logistics. The most popular and widely used performance metric is the landed cost. The landed cost is the total cost of purchasing, transporting, warehousing and distributing raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods.

Another performance metric equally important is the end customer [[Service level#.CE.B2 service level .28type 2.2C also known as .22fill rate.22.29|fill rate]]. It is the percentage of customer demand which is satisfied immediately off-the-shelf (from on-site inventory).  An alternative to fill rate, is system [[availability]].

In recent years, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has advocated the use of [[performance-based logistics]] (PBL) contracts to manage costs for support of [[weapon system]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">A '''loose sentence''' (also called a cumulative sentence) is a type of sentence in which the main idea ([[Clause#Independent and dependent clauses|independent clause]]) is elaborated by the successive addition of modifying clauses or phrases.

==Construction==

It adds modifying elements after the subject, complement, and verb.

==Effect==

Loose sentences may make a work seem informal, relaxed, and conversational.  However, according to Strunk and White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' (2000), a succession of loose sentences, especially those of two clauses, is to be avoided because of "mechanical symmetry and sing-song".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

* "Bells rang, filling the air with their clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry, bringing people into the streets to hear the news." (From the English Reviewer)
* She drove her car to go to the movies, and got gas.
* "I have been assured by a very knowing American friend of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nourished is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked or boiled; and I make no doubt it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout." Jonathan Swift, [[A Modest Proposal]]

== Alternatives ==
If the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of the type described, he should recast enough of them to remove the monotony, replacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two clauses, by sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses—whichever best represent the real relations of the thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strunk Jr.|first1=William|title=The Elements of Style|date=July 28, 2009|publisher=W L C|isbn=1557427283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the writer wanted to rewrite the above examples he could write:
* Bells rang. Their resonance filled the air with clangor, startling pigeons into flight from every belfry. Upon hearing the sounds, the townspeople rushed into the streets. They all stood in silence and awaited the news. 
* She drove to the movies. Afterwards she went to the gas station to fill up.

'''Medic to Medic''' (also known as M2M, Medic 2 Medic) is a programme of the International Medical Education Trust 2000 (IMET 2000), a UK charity that provides medical education worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medictomedic.org.uk Medic to Medic website ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imet2000.org IMET2000 website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded by Dr. Kate Mandeville, it became affiliated with IMET 2000 to address the shortage of in-country health care workers, as well as a way of helping students who risked dropping out of medical school because of extreme poverty. Since its inception in 2007, it has projects in [[Malawi]] and in [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/workforcealliance/members_partners/member_list/medictomedic/en/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main activities==
Medic to Medic aims to alleviate students from financial hardship so as to allow them to complete their studies. Given the number of professionals who migrate in search of better career prospects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16545526|title=BBC News - Malawian doctors - are there more in Manchester than Malawi?|last=McDonald|first=Charlotte|date=14 January 2012|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medic to Medic also aims to boost numbers of in-country health workers. The programme links students to private donors, akin to other well-known child sponsor models. [[E-mentoring]] from UK professionals is also part of the programme. 

In Malawi, the programme supports students training to be doctors and [[allied health professional]]s at [[Malawi College of Medicine]] and [[Malawi College of Health Sciences]]. In Uganda, it works with [[Makerere University]] and [[Gulu University]] to support the most needy students, especially those from Northern Uganda.

Medical students at some UK universities are involved in fundraising activities, sponsorship and mentoring support in the field over the summer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/societies/directory/medictomedic/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mentoring.londondeanery.ac.uk/international/international-coaching-project/pilot-project-for-malawi&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57236">'''Metacognition''' is "[[cognition]] about cognition", "[[think]]ing about thinking", "[[know]]ing about knowing", becoming "aware of one's [[awareness]]" and higher-order thinking skills. The term comes from the root word ''[[meta]]'', meaning "beyond".&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"&gt;Metcalfe, J., &amp; Shimamura, A. P. (1994). ''Metacognition: knowing about knowing''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Metacognition can take many forms; it includes knowledge about when and how to use particular strategies for learning or problem-solving.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe" /&gt; There are generally two components of metacognition: (1) knowledge about cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schraw |first= Gregory |title= Promoting general metacognitive awareness |journal= Instructional Science|year= 1998|volume= 26|pages= 113–125|doi= 10.1023/A:1003044231033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metamemory]], defined as knowing about memory and [[mnemonic]] strategies, is an especially important form of metacognition.&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"&gt;Dunlosky, J. &amp; Bjork, R. A. (Eds.).

Some [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologist]]s hypothesize that humans use metacognition as a survival tool, which would make metacognition the same across cultures.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;{{qn|date=May 2017}} Writings on metacognition date back at least as far as two works by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC): ''[[On the Soul]]'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definitions==
This higher-level cognition was given the label metacognition by American developmental psychologist [[John H. Flavell]] (1976).

The term metacognition literally means 'beyond cognition', and is used to indicate cognition about cognition, or more informally, thinking about thinking. Flavell defined metacognition as knowledge about cognition and control of cognition. For example, a person is engaging in metacognition if he notices that he is having more trouble learning A than B, or if it strikes him that he should double-check C before accepting it as fact. J. H. Flavell (1976, p.&amp;nbsp;232).  [[Andreas Demetriou]]'s theory (one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]) used the term hypercognition to refer to self-monitoring, self-representation, and self-regulation processes, which are regarded as integral components of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Efklides, A., &amp; Platsidou, M. (1993). The architecture and dynamics of developing mind: Experiential structuralism as a frame for unifying cognitive developmental theories. ''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 58'', Serial Number 234.
&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with his colleagues, he showed that these processes participate in general [[intelligence]], together with processing efficiency and reasoning, which have traditionally been considered to compose [[fluid intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Demetriou|first1 = A.|last2 = Kazi|first2 = S.|year = 2006|title = Self-awareness in g (with processing efficiency and reasoning)|url=|journal=Intelligence|volume = 34|issue =3|pages = 297–317|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2005.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacognition also involves thinking about one's own thinking process such as study skills, memory capabilities, and the ability to monitor learning.  This concept needs to be explicitly taught along with content instruction.
Metacognitive knowledge is about one's own cognitive processes and the understanding of how to regulate those processes to maximize learning.

Some types of metacognitive knowledge would include:
* Content knowledge (declarative knowledge) which is understanding one's own capabilities, such as a student evaluating his/her own knowledge of a subject in a class. It is notable that not all metacognition is accurate. Studies have shown that students often mistake lack of effort with understanding in evaluating themselves and their overall knowledge of a concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/metacognition_literature_review_final.pdf|title=Metacognition: A Literature Review|last=Lai|first=Emily|date=April 2011|website=Metacognition: A Literature Review PDF|format=PDF|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, greater confidence in having performed well  is associated with less accurate metacognitive judgment of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molenberghs|first=Pascal|last2=Trautwein|first2=Fynn-Mathis|last3=Böckler|first3=Anne|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2016-12-01|title=Neural correlates of metacognitive ability and of feeling confident: a large-scale fMRI study|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1942–1951|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw093|issn=1749-5024|pmc=5141950|pmid=27445213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Task knowledge (procedural knowledge), which is how one perceives the difficulty of a task which is the content, length, and the type of assignment. The study mentioned in Content knowledge also deals with a person's ability to evaluate the difficulty of a task related to their overall performance on the task. Again, the accuracy of this knowledge was skewed as students who thought their way was better/easier also seemed to perform worse on evaluations, while students who were rigorously and continually evaluated reported to not be as confident but still did better on initial evaluations.
* Strategic knowledge (conditional knowledge) which is one's own capability for using strategies to learn information. Young children are not particularly good at this; it is not until students are in upper elementary school that they begin to develop an understanding of effective strategies.
Metacognition is a general term encompassing the study of memory-monitoring and self-regulation, meta-reasoning, [[consciousness]]/[[awareness]] and auto-consciousness/[[self-awareness]]. In practice these capacities are used to regulate one's own cognition, to maximize one's potential to think, [[learning|learn]] and to the evaluation of proper [[ethics|ethical]]/[[Morality|moral rules]]. It can also lead to a reduction in response time for a given situation as a result of heightened awareness, and potentially reduce the time to complete problems or tasks.

In the domain of experimental psychology, an influential distinction in metacognition (proposed by T. O. Nelson &amp; L. Narens) is between Monitoring&amp;mdash;making judgments about the strength of one's memories&amp;mdash;and Control&amp;mdash;using those judgments to guide behavior (in particular, to guide study choices). Dunlosky, Serra, and Baker (2007) covered this distinction in a review of metamemory research that focused on how findings from this domain can be applied to other areas of applied research.

In the domain of [[cognitive neuroscience]], metacognitive monitoring and control has been viewed as a function of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which receives (monitors) sensory signals from other cortical regions and  implements control using feedback loops(see chapters by Schwartz &amp; Bacon and Shimamura, in Dunlosky &amp; Bjork, 2008).&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"/&gt;

Metacognition is studied in the domain of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Scientific modelling|modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.artint.2005.10.009 | volume=169 | issue=2 | title=Metacognition in computation: A selected research review | journal=Artificial Intelligence | pages=104–141| year=2005 | last1=Cox | first1=Michael T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is the domain of interest of emergent [[systemics]].

It has been used, albeit off the original definition, to describe one's own knowledge that we will die. Writers in the 1990s involved with the [[grunge]] music scene often used the term to describe self-awareness of mortality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Components==
Metacognition is classified into three components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flavell|first=J.H.|title=Metacognition and cognitive monitoring. A new area of cognitive-development inquiry|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|pages=906–911|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Metacognitive knowledge'' (also called metacognitive awareness) is what individuals know about themselves and others as cognitive processors.
# ''Metacognitive regulation'' is the regulation of cognition and learning experiences through a set of activities that help people control their learning.
# ''Metacognitive experiences'' are those experiences that have something to do with the current, on-going cognitive endeavor.

Metacognition refers to a level of thinking that involves active control over the process of thinking that is used in learning situations.  Planning the way to approach a learning task, monitoring comprehension, and evaluating the progress towards the completion of a task: these are skills that are metacognitive in their nature.

Metacognition includes at least three different types of metacognitive awareness when considering metacognitive knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=[[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]]|year=1987|volume=22|pages=225–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Declarative knowledge'': refers to knowledge about oneself as a learner and about what factors can influence one's performance.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; Declarative knowledge can also be referred to as "world knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=W|author2=Artelt, C.|title=Metacognition and mathematics education|journal=ZDM Mathematics Education|year=2010|volume=42|issue=2|pages=149–161|doi=10.1007/s11858-010-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Procedural knowledge'': refers to knowledge about doing things. This type of knowledge is displayed as heuristics and strategies.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; A high degree of procedural knowledge can allow individuals to perform tasks more automatically.

Similar to metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive regulation or "regulation of cognition" contains three skills that are essential.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1987|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=255–278|doi=10.1080/00461520.1987.9653052}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Planning'': refers to the appropriate selection of strategies and the correct allocation of resources that affect task performance.
# ''Monitoring'': refers to one's awareness of comprehension and task performance
# ''Evaluating'': refers to appraising the final product of a task and the efficiency at which the task was performed. This can include re-evaluating strategies that were used.

Similarly, maintaining motivation to see a task to completion is also a metacognitive skill. The ability to become aware of distracting stimuli &amp;ndash; both internal and external &amp;ndash; and sustain effort over time also involves metacognitive or [[executive functions]]. The theory that metacognition has a critical role to play in successful learning means it is important that it be demonstrated by both students and teachers.

Students who demonstrate a wide range of metacognitive skills perform better on exams and complete work more efficiently{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. They are self-regulated learners who utilize the "right tool for the job" and modify learning strategies and skills based on their awareness of effectiveness. Individuals with a high level of metacognitive knowledge and skill identify blocks to learning as early as possible and change "tools" or strategies to ensure goal attainment. Swanson (1990) found that metacognitive knowledge can compensate for IQ and lack of prior knowledge when comparing fifth and sixth grade students' problem solving. Students with a high-metacognition were reported to have used fewer strategies, but solved problems more effectively than low-metacognition students, regardless of IQ or prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanson|first=H.L.|title=Influence of metacognitive knowledge and aptitude on problem solving|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1990|volume=82|pages=306–314|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.306|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study examining students who send text messages during college lectures, it was suggested that students with higher metacognitive abilities were less likely than other students to have their learning affected by using a mobile phone in class.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, L.

{{quote|The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.|[[Bertrand Russell]]}}
Metacognologists are aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, the nature of the task at hand, and available "tools" or skills. A broader repertoire of "tools" also assists in goal attainment. When "tools" are general, generic, and context independent, they are more likely to be useful in different types of learning situations.

Another distinction in metacognition is executive management and strategic knowledge. Executive management processes involve planning, monitoring, evaluating and revising one's own thinking processes and products. Strategic knowledge involves knowing ''what'' (factual or declarative knowledge), knowing ''when and why'' (conditional or contextual knowledge) and knowing ''how'' (procedural or methodological knowledge). Both executive management and strategic knowledge metacognition are needed to self-regulate one's own thinking and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there is no distinction between domain-general and domain-specific metacognitive skills.  This means that metacognitive skills are domain-general in nature and there are no specific skills for certain subject areas. The metacognitive skills that are used to review an essay are the same as those that are used to verify an answer to a math question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gourgey|first=A.F.|title=Metacognition in basic skills instruction|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=81–96|doi=10.1023/A:1003092414893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Metacognition ==
Although metacognition has thus far been discussed in relation to the self, recent research in the field has suggested that this view is overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jost|first=J. T.|last2=Kruglanski|first2=A. W.|last3=Nelson|first3=T. O.|date=1998|title=Social metacognition: an expansionist review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=2|issue=2|pages=137–154|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0202_6|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15647141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is argued that metacognition research should also include beliefs about others’ mental processes, the influence of culture on those beliefs, and on beliefs about ourselves. This “expansionist view” proposes that it is impossible to fully understand metacognition without considering the situational norms and cultural expectations that influence those same conceptions. This combination of social psychology and metacognition is referred to as social metacognition. 

Social metacognition can include ideas and perceptions that relate to [[social cognition]]. Additionally, social metacognition can include judging the cognition of others, such as judging the perceptions and emotional states of others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is in part because the process of judging others is similar to judging the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, individuals have less information about the people they are judging; therefore, judging others tend to be more inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tullis|first=Jonathan G.|last2=Fraundorf|first2=Scott H.|date=2017-08|title=Predicting others' memory performance: The accuracy and bases of social metacognition|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=95|pages=124–137|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2017.03.003|issn=0749-596X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having similar cognitions can buffer against this inaccuracy and can be helpful for teams or organizations, as well as interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Leigh|last2=Cohen|first2=Taya R.|date=2012-01-01|title=Metacognition in teams and organizations|url=https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/metacognition-in-teams-and-organizations-2|journal=Social Metacognition|pages=283–302|doi=10.4324/9780203865989|isbn=9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Metacognition and the Self Concept ===
The self concept plays an important part in how people think about and act in their social worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=424661|title=Baumeister, R. F. (1998). The self. In D. T. Gilbert, S. T. Fiske, &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The handbook of social psychology (4th ed., Vol. 1, pp. 635-679). Boston, MA McGraw-Hill Co., Inc. - References - Scientific Research Publishing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scirp.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metacognitions can be divided into first order and second order thoughts. First order thoughts are the person’s first appraisal of a given thought (I am smart), while second order thoughts are their reflections about their certainty of that appraisal (I am not really sure how smart I am). These secondary cognitions are subject to the influence of culture and situational norms, and thus influence the strength of our self-convictions.

An example of the interaction between social metacognition and self-concept can be found in examining implicit theories about the self. Implicit theories can cover a wide-range of constructs about how the self operates, but two are especially relevant here; entity theory and incrementalist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dweck|first=Carol S.|last2=Chiu|first2=Chi-yue|last3=Hong|first3=Ying-yi|date=1995-10|title=Implicit Theories and Their Role in Judgments and Reactions: A Word From Two Perspectives|journal=Psychological Inquiry|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=267–285|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0604_1|issn=1047-840X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entity theory proposes that an individual’s self-attributes and abilities are fixed and stable, while incrementalist theory proposes that these same constructs can be changed through effort and experience. Entity theorists are susceptible to learned helplessness because they may feel that circumstances are outside their control (i.e. there’s nothing that could have been done to make things better), thus they may give up easily. Incremental theorists react differently when faced with failure: they desire to master challenges, and therefore adopt a mastery-oriented pattern.  They immediately began to consider various ways that they could approach the task differently, and they increase their efforts. Cultural beliefs can act on this as well. For example, a person who has accepted a cultural belief that memory loss is an unavoidable consequence of old age may avoid cognitively demanding tasks as they age, thus accelerating cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=B.|last2=Langer|first2=E.|date=1994-6|title=Aging free from negative stereotypes: successful memory in China and among the American deaf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=66|issue=6|pages=989–997|issn=0022-3514|pmid=8046582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a female who is aware of the stereotype that purports that females are not good at mathematics may perform worse on tests of mathematical ability or avoid mathematics altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele|first=Jennifer R.|last2=Ambady|first2=Nalini|date=2006-07|title="Math is Hard!" The effect of gender priming on women's attitudes|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=4|pages=428–436|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.06.003|issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt; These examples demonstrate that the metacognitive beliefs people hold about the self - which may be socially or culturally transmitted - can have important effects on persistence, performance, and motivation.

=== Attitudes as a Function of Social Metacognition ===
The way that individuals think about attitude greatly affects the way that they behave. Metacognitions about attitudes influence how individuals act, and especially how they interact with others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=21–42|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some metacognitive characteristics of attitudes include importance, certainty, and perceived knowledge, and they influence behavior in different ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Attitude importance is the strongest predictor of behavior and can predict information seeking behaviors in individuals. Attitude importance is also more likely to influence behavior than certainty of the attitude.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When considering a social behavior like voting a person may hold high importance but low certainty. This means that they will likely vote, even if they are unsure who to vote for. Meanwhile, a person who is very certain of who they want to vote for, may not actually vote if it is of low importance to them. This also applies to interpersonal relationships. A person might hold a lot of favorable knowledge about their family, but they may not maintain close relations with their family if it is of low importance.

Metacognitive characteristics of attitudes may be key to understanding how attitudes change. Research shows that the frequency of positive or negative thoughts is the biggest factor in attitude change.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=43 – 62|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may believe that climate change is occurring but have negative thoughts toward it such as “If I accept the responsibilities of climate change, I must change my lifestyle.” These individuals would not likely change their behavior compared to someone that thinks positively about the same issue such as “By using less electricity, I will be helping the planet.”

Another way to increase the likelihood of behavior change is by influencing the source of the attitude. An individual’s personal thoughts and ideas have a much greater impact on the attitude compared ideas of others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, when people view lifestyle changes as coming from themselves, the effects are more powerful than if the changes were coming from a friend or family member. These thoughts can be re-framed that emphasizes personal importance, such as “I want to stop smoking because it is important to me” rather than “quitting smoking is important to my family”. More research needs to be conducted on culture differences and importance of group ideology, which may alter these results.

=== Social Metacognition and Stereotypes ===
People have secondary cognitions about the appropriateness, justifiability, and social judgability of their own stereotypic beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=243–262|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; People know that it is typically unacceptable to make stereotypical judgments and make conscious efforts not to do so. Subtle social cues can influence these conscious efforts. For example, when given a false sense of confidence about their ability to judge others, people will return to relying on social stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent Y.|last2=Schadron|first2=Georges|last3=Leyens|first3=Jacques-Philippe|last4=Rocher|first4=Stephan|date=1994|title=Social judgeability: The impact of meta-informational cues on the use of stereotypes.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=66|issue=1|pages=48–55|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.1.48|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural backgrounds influence social metacognitive assumptions, including stereotypes. For example, cultures without the stereotype that memory declines with old age display no age differences in memory performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When it comes to making judgments about other people, implicit theories about the stability versus malleability of human characteristics predict differences in social stereotyping as well. Holding an entity theory of traits increases the tendency for people to see similarity among group members and utilize stereotyped judgments. For example, compared to those holding incremental beliefs, people who hold entity beliefs of traits use more stereotypical trait judgments of ethnic and occupational groups as well as form more extreme trait judgments of new groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaks|first=Jason E.|last2=Stroessner|first2=Steven J.|last3=Dweck|first3=Carol S.|last4=Sherman|first4=Jeffrey W.|date=2001|title=Person theories and attention allocation: Preferences for stereotypic versus counterstereotypic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=80|issue=6|pages=876–893|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.876|issn=1939-1315|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7sb722b1|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individual’s assumptions about a group combine with their implicit theories, more stereotypical judgments may be form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent|last2=Corneille|first2=Olivier|last3=Estrada|first3=Claudia|date=2001-05|title=The Interplay of Subjective Essentialism and Entitativity in the Formation of Stereotypes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0502_5|issn=1088-8683|citeseerx=10.1.1.379.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes that one believes others hold about them are called metastereotypes.

==Relation to sapience==
Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to [[sapience|sapient]] species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} There is evidence that [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], apes, and dolphins can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1037/a0020129|last = Couchman|first = Justin J.|author2=Coutinho, M.

==Strategies==
Metacognitive-like processes are especially ubiquitous when it comes to the discussion of [[self-regulated learning]]. Being engaged in metacognition is a salient feature of good self-regulated learners.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Reinforcing collective discussion of metacognition is a salient feature of self-critical and self-regulating social groups.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The activities of strategy selection and application include those concerned with an ongoing attempt to plan, check, monitor, select, revise, evaluate, etc.

Metacognition is 'stable' in that learners' initial decisions derive from the pertinent facts about their cognition through years of learning experience. Simultaneously, it is also 'situated' in the sense that it depends on learners' familiarity with the task, motivation, emotion, and so forth. Individuals need to regulate their thoughts about the strategy they are using and adjust it based on the situation to which the strategy is being applied.  At a professional level, this has led to emphasis on the development of [[reflective practice]], particularly in the education and health-care professions.

Recently, the notion has been applied to the study of second language learners in the field of [[English as a foreign or second language|TESOL]] and [[applied linguistics]] in general (e.g., Wenden, 1987; Zhang, 2001, 2010). This new development has been much related to Flavell (1979), where the notion of metacognition is elaborated within a tripartite theoretical framework. Learner metacognition is defined and investigated by examining their person knowledge, task knowledge and strategy knowledge.

Wenden (1991) has proposed and used this framework and Zhang (2001) has adopted this approach and investigated second language learners' metacognition or metacognitive knowledge. In addition to exploring the relationships between learner metacognition and performance, researchers are also interested in the effects of metacognitively-oriented strategic instruction on reading comprehension (e.g., Garner, 1994, in first language contexts, and Chamot, 2005; Zhang, 2010). The efforts are aimed at developing [[learner autonomy]], [[interdependence]] and [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulation]].

Metacognition helps people to perform many cognitive tasks more effectively.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; Strategies for promoting metacognition include self-questioning (e.g. "What do I already know about this topic? How have I solved problems like this before?"), thinking aloud while performing a task, and making graphic representations (e.g. concept maps, flow charts, semantic webs) of one's thoughts and knowledge.  Carr, 2002, argues that the physical act of writing plays a large part in the development of metacognitive skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gammil | first1 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Learning the Write Way | url = | journal = The Reading Teacher | volume = 59 | issue = 8| pages = 754–762 | doi = 10.1598/RT.59.8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategy Evaluation matrices (SEM) can help to improve the ''knowledge of cognition'' component of metacognition.  The SEM works by identifying the declarative (Column 1), procedural (Column 2) and conditional (Column 3 and 4) knowledge about specific strategies.  The SEM can help individuals identify the strength and weaknesses about certain strategies as well as introduce them to new strategies that they can add to their repertoire.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schraw|first=Gregory|title=Promoting general metacogntive awareness|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=113–125|doi=10.1023/A:1003044231033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulation checklist (RC) is a useful strategy for improving the regulation of cognition aspect of one's metacognition. RCs help individuals to implement a sequence of thoughts that allow them to go over their own metacognition.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"/&gt; King (1991) found that fifth-grade students who used a regulation checklist outperformed control students when looking at a variety of questions including written problem solving, asking strategic questions, and elaborating information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=A|title=Effects of training in strategic questioning on children's problem solving performance|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1991|volume=83|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.3.307|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of strategies that can be taught to students are word analysis skills, active reading strategies, listening skills, organizational skills and creating mnemonic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=L|author2=Thompson, M.|title=Neurofeedback combined with training in metacognitive strategies: Effectiveness in students with ADD|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|year=1998|volume=23|issue=4|pages=243–63|doi=10.1023/A:1022213731956|pmid=10457815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker and Walker have developed a model of metacognition in school learning termed [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]].  [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]] describes the capacity of the mind to exert conscious control over its reasoning and processing strategies in relation to the external learning task. Studies have shown that pupils with an ability to exert metacognitive regulation over their attentional and reasoning strategies used when engaged in maths, and then shift those strategies when engaged in science or then English literature learning, associate with higher academic outcomes at secondary school.

==Metastrategic knowledge==
"Metastrategic knowledge" (MSK) is a sub-component of metacognition that is defined as general knowledge about higher order thinking strategies. MSK had been defined as "general knowledge about the cognitive procedures that are being manipulated". The knowledge involved in MSK consists of "making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy" and of "naming" the thinking strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, A., &amp; Ben David, A. (2009). Paving a clear path in a thick forest: A conceptual analysis of a metacognitive component. Metacognition And Learning, 4(3), 177-195. {{DOI|10.1007/s11409-009-9044-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important conscious act of a metastrategic strategy is the "conscious" awareness that one is performing a form of higher order thinking. MSK is an awareness of the type of thinking strategies being used in specific instances and it consists of the following abilities: making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy, naming the thinking strategy, explaining when, why and how such a thinking strategy should be used, when it should not be used, what are the disadvantages of not using appropriate strategies, and what task characteristics call for the use of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Veenman, M. V. J. (2006). Metacognition: Definitions, constituents, and their intricate relation with cognition. Symposium organized by Marcel V. J. Veenman, Anat Zohar, and Anastasia Efklides for the 2nd conference of the EARLI SIG on Metacognition (SIG 16), Cambridge, UK, 19–21 July.&lt;/ref&gt;

MSK deals with the broader picture of the conceptual problem. It creates rules to describe and understand the physical world around the people who utilize these processes called [[higher-order thinking]]. This is the capability of the individual to take apart complex problems in order to understand the components in problem. These are the building blocks to understanding the "big picture" (of the main problem) through reflection and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, N., &amp; Moneta, G. B. (2012). Coping and perceived stress as a function of positive metacognitions and positive meta-emotions. Individual Differences Research, 10(2), 105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Action==

Both social and cognitive dimensions of sporting expertise can be adequately explained from a metacognitive perspective according to recent research. The potential of metacognitive inferences and domain-general skills including psychological skills training  are  integral to the genesis of expert performance. Moreover, the contribution of both mental imagery (e.g., mental practice) and attentional strategies (e.g., routines) to our understanding of expertise and metacognition is noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacIntyre | first1 = TE | last2 = Igou | first2 = ER | last3 = Campbell | first3 = MJ | last4 = Moran | first4 = AP | last5 = Matthews | first5 = J | year = 2014 | title = Metacognition and action: a new pathway to understanding social and cognitive aspects of expertise in sport | url = | journal = Front.

The potential of metacognition to illuminate our understanding of action was first highlighted by Aidan Moran who discussed the role of meta-attention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Moran A. P. (1996). The Psychology of Concentration in Sport Performers: A Cognitive Analysis. Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; A recent research initiative,  a research seminar series called [http://www.meta-research.org META] funded by the [[British Psychological Society|BPS]], is exploring the role of the related constructs of meta-motivation, meta-emotion, and thinking and action (metacognition).

==Mental illness==

===Sparks of interest===
In the context of mental health, metacognition can be loosely defined as the process that "reinforces one's subjective sense of being a self and allows for becoming aware that some of one's thoughts and feelings are symptoms of an illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2=Dimaggio, G.|author3=Buck, K. D.|author4=Callaway, S. S.|author5=Salvatore, G.|author6=Carcione, A.|author7=Stanghellini, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Poor insight in schizophrenia: Links between different forms of metacognition with awareness of symptoms, treatment needed, and consequences of illness|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=52|issue=3|pages=253–60|pmid= 21497218|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in metacognition emerged from a concern for an individual's ability to understand their own mental status compared to others as well as the ability to cope with the source of their distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Semerari | first1 = A. | last2 = Carcione | first2 = A. | last3 = Dimaggio | first3 = G. | last4 = Falcone | first4 = M. | last5 = Nicol | first5 = G. | last6 = Procacci | first6 = M. | last7 = Alleva | first7 = G. | year = 2003 | title = How to evaluate Metacognitive function in psychotherapy? The Metacognition Assessment Scale and its applications | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 238–261 | doi=10.1002/cpp.362}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[insights]] into an individual's mental health status can have a profound effect on the over-all prognosis and recovery.
Metacognition brings many unique insights into the normal daily functioning of a human being. It also demonstrates that a lack of these insights compromises 'normal' functioning. This leads to less healthy functioning. In the [[autism]] spectrum, there is a profound deficit in [[Theory of Mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2= Dimaggio, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Metacognitive disturbances in people with severe mental illness: Theory, correlates with psychopathology and models of psychotherapy|journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice|volume=84|issue=1|pages= 1–8|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.2010.02007.x|pmid=22903827}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In people who identify as alcoholics, there is a belief that the need to control cognitions is an independent predictor of alcohol use over anxiety. Alcohol may be used as a coping strategy for controlling unwanted thoughts and emotions formed by negative perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spada | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Zandvoort | first2 = M. | last3 = Wells | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Metacognitions in problem drinkers | url = | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 709–716 | doi = 10.1007/s10608-006-9066-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes referred to as [[self medication]].

===Implications===

Wells' and Matthews'&lt;ref&gt;Wells, A. &amp; Mathews, G. (1997). Attention and Emotion. A clinical perspective. Hove, UK: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; theory proposes that when faced with an undesired choice, an individual can operate in two distinct modes: "object" and "metacognitive". Object mode interprets perceived stimuli as truth, where metacognitive mode understands thoughts as cues that have to be weighted and evaluated. They are not as easily trusted. There are targeted interventions unique of each patient, that gives rise to the belief that assistance in increasing metacognition in people diagnosed with schizophrenia is possible through tailored psychotherapy. With a customized therapy in place clients then have the potential to develop greater ability to engage in complex self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lysaker | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Buck | first2 = K. D. | last3 = Carcione | first3 = A. | last4 = Procacci | first4 = M. | last5 = Salvatore | first5 = G. | last6 = Nicolò | first6 = G. | last7 = Dimaggio | first7 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Addressing metacognitive capacity for self-reflection in the psychotherapy for schizophrenia: A conceptual model of the key tasks and processes | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 58–69 | doi=10.1348/147608310X520436 | pmid=22903831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can ultimately be pivotal in the patient's recovery process. In the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]], cognitive formulations have greater attention to intrusive thoughts related to the disorder. "Cognitive self-consciousness" are the tendencies to focus attention on thought. Patients with OCD exemplify varying degrees of these "intrusive thoughts". Patients also suffering from [[generalized anxiety disorder]] also show negative thought process in their cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobi | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Calamari | first2 = J. E. | last3 = Woodard | first3 = J. L. | year = 2006 | title = Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Beliefs, Metacognitive Beliefs and Obsessional Symptoms: Relations between Parent Beliefs and Child Symptoms | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 153–162 | doi = 10.1002/cpp.485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive-attentional syndrome (CAS) characterizes a metacognitive model of emotion disorder (CAS is consistent with the attention strategy of excessively focusing on the source of a threat). This ultimately develops through the client's own beliefs. [[Metacognitive therapy]] attempts to correct this change in the CAS. One of the techniques in this model is called attention training (ATT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A | year = 1990 | title = Panic disorder in association with relaxation-induced anxiety: An attentional training approach to treatment | url = | journal = Behaviour Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 273–280 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(05)80330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to diminish the worry and anxiety by a sense of control and cognitive awareness. ATT also trains clients to detect threats and test how controllable reality appears to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = P. | last3 = Myers | first3 = S. | last4 = Wheatley | first4 = J. | last5 = Patel | first5 = T. | last6 = Brewin | first6 = C. R. | year = 2009 | title = Metacognitive therapy in recurrent and persistent depression: A multiple-baseline study of a new treatment | url = | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 291–300 | doi = 10.1007/s10608-007-9178-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works of art as metacognitive artifacts==
The concept of metacognition has also been applied to [[reader-response criticism]]. [[Narrative]] [[Work of art|works of art]], including novels, movies and musical compositions, can be characterized as metacognitive [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s which are designed by the artist to anticipate and regulate the beliefs and cognitive processes of the recipient,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Teksti metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Sanataiteen ja säveltaiteen ontologiaa | journal=Synteesi | volume=17 | issue=4 | year=1998 | pages=82–94 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/metakognitio.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Text as a Metacognitive Artifact: Literary and Musical Ontology }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Elokuva metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Reseptioesteettinen katsaus | journal=Synteesi | volume=21 | issue=1 | year=2002 | pages=59–65 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/elokuva.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Film as a metacognitive artifact: Reader-response critical review }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, how and in which order events and their causes and identities are revealed to the reader of a detective story. As Menakhem Perry has pointed out, mere order has profound effects on the aesthetical meaning of a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Perry, Menakhem | year=1979 | title=Literary Dynamics: How the Order of a Text Creates Its Meanings |journal=Poetics Today | volume=1 | issue=1–2 | pages=35–64, 311–361 | jstor=1772040 | doi=10.2307/1772040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative works of art contain a representation of their own ideal reception process. They are something of a tool with which the creators of the work wish to attain certain aesthetical and even moral effects.&lt;ref&gt;Lång 1998, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mind wandering==

There is an intimate, dynamic interplay between [[mind wandering]] and metacognition. Metacognition serves to correct the wandering mind, suppressing spontaneous thoughts and bringing attention back to more "worthwhile" tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kieran|first=C. R. Fox|author2=Kalina Christoff|title=Metacognitive Facilitation of Spontaneous Thought Processes: When Metacognition Helps the Wandering Mind Find Its Way|journal=The Cognitive Neuroscience of Metacognition|date=2014|pages=293–319|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45190-4_13|isbn=978-3-642-45189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mind-wandering and metacognition: variation between internal and external thought predicts improved error awareness|url=http://neuroconscience.com/2013/11/08/mind-wandering-and-meta-cognition-variation-between-internal-and-external-thought-predicts-improved-error-awareness/|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational metacognition ==
The concept of metacognition has also been applied to collective teams and organizations in general, termed [[Corporate Brain|organizational metacognition]].{{Portal|Thinking}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7327">The National Informal STEM Education Network (NISE Net)' ([http://www.nisenet.org/ NISE Net]) is a community of informal educators and scientists dedicated to supporting learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) across the United States.  In 2016 the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network transitioned to a new, ongoing identity as the National Informal STEM Education Network. While we'll still be known as the NISE Net, network partners will now engage audiences across the United States in a range of STEM topics. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisenet.org/about  NISE Network, About Page, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== NanoDays ==
[[File:Official logo for NanoDays.png|thumb|left|]]
NISE Network is the originator of the national NanoDays initiative - an annual, nationwide festival of educational programs about nanoscale science and engineering, and its potential impact on the future.  NanoDays events take place at more than 200 science and children's museums, research centers, and universities throughout the United States, from Puerto Rico to Hawaii.  NanoDays engages people of all ages in learning about this emerging field of science through hands-on experiments, stage performances, and other programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisenet.org/nanodays  NISE Network, NanoDays Page, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisnano.org/nanodays  NanoDays, Public Page, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancastersciencefactory.org/index.php?pID=44 Lancaster Science Factory, NanoDays 2011, March 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seattle PI, A Giant Subject is Scaled Down to Kid Size at NanoDays, April 3, 2008, [http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/article/A-giant-scientific-subject-is-scaled-down-to-kid-1269143.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Daily, Smithsonian Offers Activities and Experiments during NanoDays 2010, 2010 [http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=36930]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first nationwide week of events took place in 2008, with more than 100 institutions participating.  This has grown to more than 250 events annually in the United States nationwide.  A list of   [http://www.nisenet.org/nanodays participating NanoDays organizations] is available.

==''Nano'' mini-exhibition==
[[File:Nano mini exhibition logo.png|thumb|left|upright|Logo for the ''Nano'' mini-exhibition]]
Developed by the NISE Network, [http://www.whatisnano.org/nano-exhibit ''Nano''] is an interactive exhibition that engages family audiences in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. Hands-on exhibits present the basics of nanoscience and engineering, introduce some real world applications, and explore the societal and ethical implications of this new technology.  

''Nano'' was created by the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE Network) with support from the National Science Foundation. The ''Nano'' exhibition is intended for long-term display in museums across the United States, where it will engage millions of people. Up to seventy copies of ''Nano'' will be fabricated; all copies will be identical and distributed to museum partners free of charge. The exhibition complements NanoDays events and other NISE Network educational experiences.

Exhibit components include: '''What happens when things get smaller?''' - visitors see how magnetite behaves differently when its particles are different sizes; '''What's new about nano?''' - visitors build a model of a giant carbon nanotube; '''Where can you find nano?''' - visitors try a series of interactive challenges, then search a complex image to find examples of real nano products and phenomena; and finally, '''What does nano mean for us?''' - visitors balance blocks on a tippy table, which represents the challenges of working together to build a stable nano future.  There is also a seating area where visitors can learn more about nano through books and reading boards.  

Nano was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award Nos. ESI-0532536 and 0940143.

==Nano Education Materials for K-12 Teachers==

The NISE Network along with other leading Informal Science Education Institutions have developed many [http://www.nisenet.org/community/k-12-teachers curriculum and activity resources] for teachers to use in their classrooms.  Resources include hands-on experiments, videos, and posters, among other materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4238">The '''National Institute of Public Administration''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Institut Tadbiran Awam Negara'') or popularly known as '''INTAN''' is a [[Malaysia]]n government agency responsible for the training of civil servants in management and administration. 

==Background==
INTAN was established in 1959 as the 'Training Centre for Civil Servants', which was situated in [[Port Dickson]]. The prime objective of the centre was to train civil servants with the necessary knowledge and expertise to face the development challenges of the nation, especially after Independence. In 1963, the Training Centre was relocated to Jalan Ilmu, [[Petaling Jaya]], close to the [[University of Malaya]].

In 1972, the training centre was officially upgraded to an Institute, and is officially known as Institut Tadbiran Awam Negara (INTAN). This change in status coincided with the centre's increasing role and responsibilities under the National Economic Policy (NEP 1971-1990), aimed at socioeconomic development and eradicating poverty in this fledgling nation.

INTAN with the cooperation of the Public Services Department, have played pivotal roles in not only providing civil servants with the necessary facilities and training, but also scholarships, allowances, grants, and so on, for further education and career advancement (Jeong, 2007).

==Organisation==
INTAN is headed by a Director General, and assists by eight Deputy Directors. Each of the Deputy Director headed a Center. Essentially, there are eight (8) centers under INTAN:

#Quality Management
#Financial Management
#Economic Development and Policy Management
#Senior Management and Executive Development
#Case Studies Development and Multi-media
#Knowledge and Graduate Studies
#Information Technology
#Language

These eight centers contributed positively to the relevancy of INTAN as a modern-day training center of the government, in providing the staff with the necessary knowledge, skills and expertise, in fulfilling their roles as practical public servants. 

Furthermore, courses in INTAN can comprise short-period courses, such as Computer Competency courses (MS Word, Excel, Excess, Basic Internet skills, and so on), to long-term courses, such as Diploma in Public Administration, Diploma in Strategic Studies, Diploma in Foreign Policy, and other short or long courses. Other courses and trainings are provided in areas such as (Jeong, 2007): 

*Management
*Social Development
*Policy Development
*Agricultural Development
*Province and Town Development
*Land Administration
*Local Government Administration
*International Relations
*International Trade and Economy
*Defense and Security 
*Office Administration

Seminars, conferences, and workshops are also held from time to time, to update civil servants, which includes top civil officers, with the necessary knowledge, skills, and expertise, and also as a medium to exchange knowledge and expertise, to face the challenges and needs of modern public administration.

The '''National Museum of Music''' is in [[Ouagadougou]], ([[Burkina Faso]]) in a two-story building on Oubritenga Avenue on the south side of the Phillipe Zinda Kabore School.  

The building that once housed the [[Association for the Development of African Architecture and Urban Planning]] (ADAUA) was renovated to accommodate the [[museum]]. The building is in Sudanese Sahelian style with dome-shaped roofs. It is in the centre of the city and is easily accessible to the general public.

The first collection, put together between September 1998 and March 1999, is constantly growing. Instruments from all families are represented including [[aerophone]]s, [[membranophone]]s, [[idiophone]]s and [[chordophone]]s. Each object is the only one of its kind and varies from 5 to 200 years in age.

The museum is headed by the curator, [[Parfait Z. Bambara]]

{{Other uses}}
The phrase "'''not even wrong'''" describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor [[falsifiability|falsified]]. Hence, it refers to statements that cannot be discussed in a rigorous, [[scientific method|scientific sense]].&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt; For a meaningful discussion on whether a certain statement is true or false, the statement must satisfy the criterion called "falsifiability"—the inherent possibility for the statement to be tested and found false. In this sense, the phrase "not even wrong" is synonymous to "nonfalsifiable".&lt;ref name=Bukerman/&gt;

The phrase is generally attributed to  [[theoretical physicist]] [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or careless thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shermer M |authorlink = Michael Shermer | title = Wronger Than Wrong | journal = Scientific American | year = 2006 | pages =  | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110810231612/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=wronger-than-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNAPngEACAAJ |title=Atom and Archetype: The Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932–1958 |last=Jung |first=C.

Pauli remarked sadly, 'It is not even wrong'."&lt;ref name=peierls&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peierls, R. |title=Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, 1900–1958 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume=5 |issue= |page=186 |year=1960 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also often quoted as "That is not only not right; it is not even wrong", or in Pauli's native [[German language|German]], "{{lang|de|Das ist nicht nur nicht richtig; es ist nicht einmal falsch!}}". Peierls remarks that quite a few [[Apocrypha#Metaphorical usage|apocryphal stories]] of this kind have been circulated and mentions that he listed only the ones personally vouched for by him. He also quotes another example when Pauli replied to [[Lev Landau]], "What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not."&lt;ref name=peierls /&gt;

The phrase is often used to describe [[pseudoscience]] or bad science and is considered derogatory.&lt;ref name=Bukerman&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1573072,00.html |title = Not even wrong |publisher = The Guardian |date = September 19, 2005 |author = Oliver Burkeman |authorlink = Oliver Burkeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1970, the '''Peace Research Institute Frankfurt''' (PRIF), or '''Hessische Stiftung Friedens und Konfliktforschung''' (HSFK) was founded by the state of [[Hesse]].

With approximately 70 employees (as of 2011), PRIF is [[Germany]]’s largest and oldest [[peace]] research institute.&lt;ref name="EU non-proliferation"&gt;[http://www.nonproliferation.eu/thinktanks/thinktanks.php?tid=prif Peace Research Institute Frankfurt - PRIF / HSFK (Hessische Stiftung Friedens und Konfliktforschung)]. EU Non-Proliferation Consortium. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; PRIF does not carry out any commissioned research.

''{{quote|"The work of the PRIF is focused on identifying the causes of violent international and internal conflicts, carrying out research into the conditions necessary for peace, understood as a process of decreasing violence and increasing justice, and spreading the concepts of peace. Within the framework of its political consulting, research results are converted into practice oriented options for action that find their way into the public debate.&lt;ref name="hsfk"&gt;[http://www.hsfk.de/PRIF.13.0.html?no_cache=1&amp;L=1]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

PRIF investigates the causes of international [[crisis]] and [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]], pursues research on [[peace and conflict studies]] and [[disarmament]] policy. PRIF places a regional focus on the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, while researching the necessary conditions to increase justice and decrease violence (i.e. establish peace).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsfk.de/Die-HSFK.13.0.html PRIF]. PRIF. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Communities-and-Partners/Partners/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=25955 Peace Research Institute Frankfurt (PRIF)]. [[International Relations and Security Network]] Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It places special emphasis in its research work on arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament. From 1987 to 2002, the PRIF trained many young academics in countries having no non-proliferation expertise, organizing a network of European non-proliferation researchers. PRIF researchers have long-standing experience in political advice and consulting, having served, inter alia, in German delegations to [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]], [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|CTBT]], [[Chemical Weapons Convention|CWC]], [[Biological Weapons Convention|BWC]], [[Ottawa Treaty|Ottawa Convention]] and [[SALW]] gatherings, in the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Conference on Disarmament]] and in [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] Expert Groups.&lt;ref name="EU non-proliferation"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The Executive Director of the PRIF is Nicole Deitelhoff. Other members of the Executive Board are Christopher Daase, Susanne Boetsch, Peter Kreuzer, Sabine Mannitz and Jonas Wolff.

The Research Council is a body that includes all PRIF scholars. It makes decisions on the research program and on the projects of the individual research departments.

The Board of Trustees, consisting of Hesse’s Prime Minister, the Minister for Science and the Arts, and the Finance Minister of [[Hesse]], three public figures and three elected representatives from within the institute, supervises the management of the institution and approves its budget.

The Advisory Board supports the PRIF on the design and implementation of the institute's research programs. Four-year terms are by appointment of the Board of Trustees which is made up of eight scholars from Germany and abroad. The Advisory Board chairman is currently [[Thomas Risse]].

At the end of 2004, the PRIF was evaluated by a commission of the [[German Council of Science and Humanities]] and recommended for acceptance into the [[Leibniz Association]]. On January 1, 2009 the PRIF became a member institute in the scientific organization.

== Research Departments ==
Since 2009, PRIF devotes its work to the research program ''Just Democratic Peace'' which analyses justice-related conflicts and the ways in which peace and justice can be achieved at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsfk.de/en/research/research-program/|title=Research Programm|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at the PRIF is broken down into seven departments:

* I: International Security 
* II: International Institutions 
* III: Transnational Actors 
* IV: Intrastate Conflict
* V: 'Glocal' Junctions
* VI: Non-Program-Bound Research
* VII: Knowledge Transfer

== Publications ==
In addition to anthologies and [[monograph]]s in the publication series "Studies of the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt," PRIF publishes approximately ten HSFK-Reports (PRIF Reports in English),as well as the series "HSFK-Standpunkte – Beiträge zum demokratischen Frieden" [PRIF Viewpoints – Articles on Democratic Peace, published in German only]. PRIF publications can be downloaded online or ordered directly from the institute’s web site. Print versions are also available in many libraries.

The State of Peace Report, which has been appearing since 1987, is the yearbook of five German peace research institutes. Besides PRIF, the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg (IFHS) and the Research Center of the Evangelical Studies Community in Heidelberg [[Forschungsstätte der Evangelischen Studiengemeinschaft|FEST]] are involved. Since 1999 the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC) and the Institute for Development and Peace in Duisburg (INEF) have also been involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsfk.de/PRIF-Publications.179.0.html?&amp;L=1|title=PRIF Publications|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Peace Yearbook consists of an introductory statement followed by several analyses of current conflicts as well as foreign and security policy, supplemented by concrete policy recommendations. Since 2007, the [[Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung]] (German Foundation for Peace Research) has provided financial support for the State of Peace Report.

To improve the breeds and milk yield, high milk yield [[Murrah buffalo]] breed were imported from the 
[[Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes|Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes, Hisar, India]], a reputed species of the dairy type originating from [[Haryana]] state of [[India]]. Murrah breed are reputed as a high milk yield breed that can produce an average of more than eight liters of milk daily over a 300 days long annual productive cycle. Better performing Murrah buffalo can produce 12 to 15 liters per day on average, with top performers going up to 25 liters per day. PCC also imported Murrah breed from non-native-breed third-party countries such Bulgaria, USA and Latin America. PCC breeds and cross-breeds Murrah buffalo through artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippine Carabao Center|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/legal3dapcc.html|publisher=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCC had some success in reproductive biotechnology in 2004 when the first test-tube buffalo was born on April 5, also the birthday of [[President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. Incidentally, the test-tube buffalo is a female and was named as "Glory" after the President.

Late in 2007, according to [[Filipino people|Filipino]] scientists, the Center located in [[Nueva Ecija]] initiated a study to breed the super [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] that could produce 4 to 18 liters of milk/day using gene-based technology.&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"/&gt; The majority of the funding came from the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]]. When this marker-assisted selection process is perfected it will allow the poor farmers to conserve their resources by raising only the best producers that are genetically selected soon after birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">'''[[Philosophy]] of music''' is the study of "...fundamental questions about the nature of [[music]] and our experience of it".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Andrew Kania, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/music/ The Philosophy of Music]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edition, edited by Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]]. 
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What is the relationship between music and language?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions? (in the 19th century there was a debate over whether instrumental music could convey emotion)
* What is meaning in relation to music?

==Philosophical issues==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}

===Definition of music===
{{main article|Definition of music}}
"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound. They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There are many different ways of denoting the fundamental [[Aspect of music|aspects of music]] which are more specific than "sound": popular aspects include [[melody]] ([[pitch (music)|pitches]] that occur consecutively), [[harmony]] (pitches regarded as groups—not necessarily sounding at the same time—to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s), [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[timbre]] (also known as a sound's "color"). However, [[noise music]] may consist mainly of noise. [[Musique concrète]] often consists only of sound samples of non-musical nature, sometimes in random juxtaposition. [[Ambient music]] may consist of recordings of wildlife or nature. The arrival of these avant-garde forms of music in the 20th century have been a major challenge to traditional views of music as being based around melodies and rhythms, leading to broader characterizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Absolute music vs program music===
{{main article|Absolute music|Program music}}
There was intense debate over absolute music versus program music during the late Romantic Era. Advocates of the "[[absolute music]]" perspective argued that instrumental music does not convey emotions or images to the listener. They claimed that music is not explicitly "about" anything and that it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the "[[program music]]" perspective believed that music could convey emotions and images. One example of program music is [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone." Nietzsche wrote many commentaries applauding the music of Wagner and was in fact an amateur composer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |title=Nietzsche and Music |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140220/http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Romantic philosophers and proponents of absolute music, such as [[Johann von Goethe]] saw music not only as a subjective human "language" but as an absolute transcendent means of peering into a higher realm of order and beauty. Some expressed a spiritual connection with music. In Part IV of his chief work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] said that "music is the answer to the mystery of life. The most profound of all the arts, it expresses the deepest thoughts of life." In "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic", a chapter of ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] examines the profundity of music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and the sensual nature of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

===Meaning and purpose===
In his 1997 book ''How the Mind Works'', [[Steven Pinker]] dubbed music "auditory cheesecake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How The Mind Works|date=1997|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, London|isbn=0393045358|page=524|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&amp;lpg=PA534|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that in the years since has served as a challenge to the musicologists and psychologists who believe otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/survival_of_the_harmonious/?page=1|publisher=The Boston Globe|title=Survival of the harmonious|accessdate=2008-03-15|last= Bennett |first=Drake|  date=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those to note this stir was [[Philip Ball]] in his book ''The Music Instinct'' &lt;ref name="The Music Instinct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=The Music Instinct|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199896429|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Music-Instinct-Works-Without/dp/0199896429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where he noted that music seems to reach to the very core of what it means to be human:  "There are cultures in the world where to say 'I'm not musical' would be meaningless," Ball writes, "akin to saying 'I'm not alive'." In a filmed debate, Ball suggests that music might get its emotive power through its ability to mimic people and perhaps its ability to entice us lies in music's ability to set up an expectation and then violate it.&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery"&gt;{{cite web|last=How The Light Gets In|first=2013|title=Music's Mystery|url=http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery|publisher=The Institute of Art and Ideas|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics of music===
{{main article|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[symphony orchestra]] is not only the main large ensemble used in [[classical music]]; one work for orchestra, [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] has been called the supreme masterpiece of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook, Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press (24 June 1993). {{ISBN|9780521399241}}. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;!-- This is a remarkably sweeping claim, presented without citation. --&gt; Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also, many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a [[musical tuning|system of tuning]] called [[just intonation]].

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

It is often thought &lt;!-- By whom? --&gt;that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in the ''Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

The ''Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Polymer Science and Technology'' is a consortium of research groups, formed in 1989 from the Universities of [http://www.dur.ac.uk Durham], [http://www.leeds.ac.uk Leeds] and [http://www.bradford.ac.uk Bradford], all of whom are involved research in polymer science and technology.  The University of [http://www.sheffield.ac.uk Sheffield] joined in 2004. The Polymer IRC has complementary expertise in [[polymer chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[Chemical process|processing]] with research programmes covering a wide range of multi-disciplinary polymer science and technology.

Research programmes in the Polymer IRC are funded by grants from government bodies, in particular the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and [[industry]]. 

From 2011 the Polymer IRC has been centred at the extensive polymer engineering laboratories at the University of Bradford, [http://www.polyeng.com Polymer IRC] with further interdisciplinary research in polymers with pharmaceuticals, and, since 2015, materials chemistry.  From 2009, a substantial Science Bridges China programme in Advanced Materials for Healthcare with leading Chinese universities began, which has led to three joint international research laboratories and many early career researcher exchanges [http://www.ukchina-amri.com Science Bridges China].

{{About|the concept of region in geography}} 
In [[geography]], '''regions''' are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics ([[physical geography]]), human impact characteristics ([[human geography]]), and the interaction of humanity and the environment ([[environmental geography]]). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] areas such as national borders are defined in law.

Apart from the [[Earth|global]] [[continent]]al regions, there are also [[hydrosphere|hydrospheric]] and [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] regions that cover the [[ocean]]s, and discrete [[climate]]s above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as [[plain]]s and features.

As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms.  For example, ecoregion is a term used in [[environmental geography]], cultural region in [[cultural geography]], bioregion in [[biogeography]], and so on.  The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called [[regional geography]].

In the fields of [[physical geography]], [[ecology]], [[biogeography]], [[zoogeography]], and [[environmental geography]], regions tend to be based on natural features such as [[ecosystem]]s or [[biotope]]s, [[biome]]s, [[drainage basin]]s, [[natural region]]s, [[mountain range]]s, [[soil type]]s. Where [[human geography]] is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of [[ethnography]].

A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Globalization==
[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|frameless|upright=1.8|right|Map of the [[Earth]]]]
Global regions  distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and [[water]]. However, they have been generally recognised as such much earlier by terrestrial [[cartography]] because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into largest of land regions, known as [[continent]]s, and the largest of water regions known as [[ocean]]s. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either classification, such as [[archipelago]] regions that are [[littoral]] regions, or [[earthquake]] regions that are defined in [[geology]].

===Continental regions===
Continental regions are usually based on broad experiences in human history and attempts to reduce very large areas to more manageable [[regionalization]] for the purpose of study. As such they are conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries. Oceanic division into maritime regions are used in conjunction with the relationship to the central area of the continent, using directions of the [[compass]].

Some continental regions are defined by the major continental feature of their identity, such as the [[Amazon basin]], or the [[Sahara]], which both occupy a significant percentage of their respective continental land area.

To a large extent, major continental regions are mental constructs created by considering an efficient way to define large areas of the continents. For the most part, the images of the world are derived as much from academic studies, the media{{Clarify|date=December 2015}}, or from personal experience of global [[exploration]]. They are a matter of collective human knowledge of its own planet and are attempts to better understand their environments.

===Regional geography===
[[Regional geography]] is a branch of geography that studies regions of all sizes across the [[Earth]]. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region, which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization, which covers the proper techniques of space [[delimitation]] into regions.

Regional geography is also considered as a certain approach to study in geographical sciences (similar to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative]] or [[critical geography|critical geographies]]; for more information, see [[history of geography]]).

==Human geography==
[[Human geography]] is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with various discrete environments. It encompasses [[human]], [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[social issues|social]], and [[economics|economic]] aspects among others that are often clearly delineated. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see [[physical geography]]), it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities are being played out, and [[environmental geography]] is emerging as a link between the two. Regions of human geography can be divided into many broad categories:
*[[Cultural geography]]
*[[Demography]]
*[[Development geography]]
*[[Economic geography]]
*[[Ethnography]]
*[[Geopolitics]]
*[[Health geography]]
*[[Historical geography]]
*[[Language geography]]
*[[Religion geography]]
*[[Social geography]]
*[[Time geography]]
*[[Tourism geography]]
*[[Transportation geography]]
*[[Urban geography]]
*[[Media Geography]]

===Historical regions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hispanic]] --&gt;
{{main|Historical region}}
The field of [[historical geography]] involves the study of human history as it relates to places and [[Historical region|regions]] or the study of how places and regions have changed over time.

[[D. W. Meinig]], a historical geographer of America, describes many historical regions in his book ''The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History''.  For example, in identifying European "source regions" in early American colonization efforts, he defines and describes the ''Northwest European Atlantic Protestant Region'', which includes sub-regions such as the "Western Channel Community", which itself is made of sub-regions such as the ''English [[West Country]]'' of [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Somerset]], and [[Dorset]].

In describing historic regions of America, Meinig writes of "The Great Fishery" off the coast of Newfoundland and New England, an oceanic region that includes the [[Grand Banks]]. He rejects regions traditionally used in describing American history, like [[New France]], "West Indies", the [[Middle Colonies]], and the individual colonies themselves ([[Province of Maryland]], for example).  Instead he writes of "discrete colonization areas," which may be named after colonies but rarely adhere strictly to political boundaries. Historic regions of this type Meinig writes about include "Greater New England" and its major sub-regions of "Plymouth," "New Haven shores" (including parts of Long Island), "Rhode Island" (or "Narragansett Bay"), "the Piscataqua," "Massachusetts Bay," "Connecticut Valley," and to a lesser degree, regions in the sphere of influence of Greater New England, "Acadia" (Nova Scotia), "Newfoundland and The Fishery/The Banks."

Other examples of historical regions include Iroquoia, [[Ohio Country]], [[Illinois Country]], and [[Rupert's Land]].

=== Tourism region ===
{{Main article|Tourism region}}
A tourism region is a geographical region that has been designated by a governmental organization or [[tourism bureau]] as having common cultural or environmental characteristics. These regions are often named after a geographical, former, or current administrative region or may have a name created for [[tourism]] purposes. The names often evoke certain positive qualities of the area and suggest a coherent tourism experience to visitors. Countries, states, provinces, and other administrative regions are often carved up into tourism regions to facilitate attracting visitors.

Some of the more famous tourism regions based on historical or current administrative regions include [[Tuscany]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.intoscana.it/intoscana2/export/TurismoRTen Turismo.intoscana.it]. Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Yucatan Visitmexico.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102031607/http://visitmexico.com/wb/Visitmexico/Visi_Yucatan |date=2010-01-02 }}, Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; in Mexico. Famous examples of regions created by a government or tourism bureau include the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Lake District]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk Lakedistrict.gov.uk], Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wine Country (California)|California's Wine Country]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winecountry.com Winecountry.com], Retrieved 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;
great plains region

===Natural resource regions===
[[Natural resource]]s often occur in distinct regions.  Natural resource regions can be a topic of physical geography or environmental geography, but also have a strong element of human geography and economic geography.  A coal region, for example, is a physical or geomorphological region, but its development and exploitation can make it into an economic and a cultural region.  Some examples of natural resource regions include the [[Rumaila Field]], the oil field that lies along the border or Iraq and Kuwait and played a role in the [[Gulf War]]; the [[Coal Region]] of Pennsylvania, which is a historical region as well as a cultural, physical, and natural resource region; the [[South Wales Coalfield]], which like Pennsylvania's coal region is a historical, cultural, and natural region; the [[Kuznetsk Basin]], a similarly important coal mining region in Russia; [[Kryvbas]], the economic and iron ore mining region of Ukraine; and the [[James Bay Project]], a large region of Quebec where one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world has been developed.

===Religious regions===
Sometimes a region associated with a religion is given a name, like [[Christendom]], a term with medieval and renaissance connotations of Christianity as a sort of social and political [[Body Politic|polity]].  The term [[Muslim world]] is sometimes used to refer to the region of the world where Islam is dominant.  These broad terms are very vague when used to describe regions.

Within some religions there are clearly defined regions.  The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[List of Church of England dioceses|Church of England]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and others, define ecclesiastical regions with names such as [[diocese]], [[eparchy]], [[Ecclesiastical Province|ecclesiastical provinces]], and [[parish]].

For example, the United States is divided into 32 Roman Catholic [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of the United States|ecclesiastical provinces]].  The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] is organized into 33 geographic ''districts'', which are subdivided into ''circuits'' (the [[Atlantic District (LCMS)]], for example).  [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses regions similar to dioceses and parishes, but uses terms like [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] and [[Stake (Mormonism)|stake]].

{{anchor|Political regions}}

===Political regions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Regions of Italy]] --&gt;
{{see also|Administrative divisions}}
In the field of [[political geography]], regions tend to be based on political units such as [[sovereign state]]s; subnational units such as administrative regions,  [[province]]s, [[U.S. state|states (in the United States)]], [[county|counties]], [[township]]s, [[Territory (country subdivision)|territories]], etc.; and multinational groupings, including formally defined units such as the [[European Union]], the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]], and [[NATO]], as well as informally defined regions such as the [[Third World]], [[Western Europe]], and the Middle East.

===Administrative regions===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Montoire-sur-le-Loir]] --&gt;
{{further|Administrative division}}
The word "region" is taken from the [[Latin]] ''regio'' (derived from ''regere'', to rule), and a number of countries have borrowed the term as the formal name for a type of subnational entity (e.g., the [[Regions of Chile|''región'']], used in [[Chile]]). In English, the word is also used as the conventional translation for equivalent terms in other languages (e.g., the [[Oblasts of Russia|''область'']] (''[[oblast]]''), used in Russia alongside a broader term ''регион'').

The following countries use the term "region" (or its [[cognate]]) as the name of a type of subnational administrative unit:
*[[Regions of Belgium|Belgium]] (in French, ''région''; in German, ''Region''; the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term ''gewest'' is often translated as "region")
*[[Regions of Chad|Chad]] (''{{lang|fr|région}}'', effective from 2002)
*[[Regions of Chile|Chile]] (''región'')
*[[Regions of Côte d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Denmark|Denmark]] (effective from 2007)
*[[Regions of England|England]] (not the United Kingdom as a whole)
*[[Regions of Eritrea|Eritrea]]
*[[Regions of France|France]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Ghana|Ghana]]
*[[Regions of Guinea|Guinea]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau]] (''região'')
*[[Regions of Guyana|Guyana]]
*[[Regions of Hungary|Hungary]] (''régió'')
*[[Regions of Italy|Italy]] (''regione'')
*[[Regions of Madagascar|Madagascar]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Mali|Mali]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Malta|Malta]] (''reġjun'')
*[[Regions of Namibia|Namibia]]
*[[Regions of New Zealand|New Zealand]]
*[[Regions of Peru|Peru]] (''región'')
*[[List of regions and sub-regions of Portugal|Portugal]] (''região'')
*[[Regions of the Philippines|Philippines]] (''rehiyon'')
*[[Regions of Senegal|Senegal]] (''région'')
*[[Regions of Tanzania|Tanzania]]
*[[Regions of Togo|Togo]] (''région'')
*[[Regional Corporations and Municipalities of Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]] (''Regional Corporation'')
The Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[List of Quebec regions|Québec]] also uses the "administrative region" (''région administrative'').

Scotland had [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|local government regions]] from 1975 to 1996.

In Spain the official name of the [[autonomous community]] of [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] is ''Región de Murcia''. Also, some single-province autonomous communities such as [[Madrid]] use the term ''región'' interchangeably with ''comunidad autónoma''.

Two [[Län of Sweden|län]] (counties) in Sweden are officially called 'regions': [[Skåne]] and [[Västra Götaland]], and there is currently a controversial proposal to divide the rest of Sweden into large [[Regions of Sweden|regions]], replacing the current counties.

The government of the [[Regions of the Philippines|Philippines]] uses the term "region" (in [[Filipino language|Filipino]], ''rehiyon'') when it's necessary to group provinces, the primary administrative subdivision of the country. This is also the case in [[Brazil]], which groups its primary administrative divisions (''estados''; "states") into ''grandes regiões'' ([[Regions of Brazil|greater regions]]) for statistical purposes, while Russia uses ''экономические районы'' ([[Economic regions of Russia|economic regions]]) in a similar way, as does [[Development regions of Romania|Romania]] and [[Administrative regions of Venezuela|Venezuela]].

The [[government of Singapore]] makes use of the term "[[Regions of Singapore|region]]" for its own administrative purposes.

The following countries use an administrative subdivision conventionally referred to as a region in English:
*[[Oblasts of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], which uses the ''област'' (''oblast'')
*[[Oblasts of Russia|Russia]], which uses the ''область'' (''oblast'''), and for some regions the [[Krais of Russia|''край'']] (''[[krai]]'')
*[[Subdivisions of Ukraine|Ukraine]], which uses the ''область'' (''oblast''')
*[[Regions of Slovakia|Slovakia]] (''kraj'')

China has five 自治区 (''zìzhìqū'') and two 特別行政區 (or 特别行政区; ''tèbiéxíngzhèngqū''), which are translated as "[[autonomous region of China|autonomous region]]" and "[[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]]", respectively.

====Local administrative regions====
There are many relatively small regions based on local government agencies such as districts, agencies, or regions. In general, they are all regions in the general sense of being bounded spatial units.  Examples include electoral districts such as [[Washington's 6th congressional district]] and [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district]]; school districts such as [[Granite School District]] and [[Los Angeles Unified School District]]; economic districts such as the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]]; metropolitan areas such as the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], and metropolitan districts such as the [[Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]], the [[Las Vegas-Clark County Library District]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] of [[Greater London]], as well as other local districts like the [[York Rural Sanitary District]], the [[Delaware River Port Authority]], the [[Nassau County Soil and Water Conservation District]], and [[C-TRAN (Washington)|C-TRAN]].

===Traditional or informal regions===
The traditional territorial divisions of some countries are also commonly rendered in English as "regions". These informal divisions do not form the basis of the modern administrative divisions of these countries, but still define and delimit local regional identity and sense of belonging. Examples include:

* [[Regions of Finland|Finland]]
* [[Regions of Japan|Japan]]
* [[Regions of Korea|Korea]]
* [[Regions of Norway|Norway]] (''landsdeler'')
* [[Historical regions of Romania|Romania]]
* [[List of traditional regions of Slovakia|Slovakia]]

===Functional regions===
Functional regions are usually understood to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farmer|first1=CJQ|last2=Fotheringham|first2=AS|title=Network-based functional regions|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2011|volume=43|issue=11|pages=2723–2741|doi=10.1068/a44136}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Klapka, Halas, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klapka|first=P|last2=Halas|first2=M|date=2016|title=Conceptualising patterns of spatial flows: five decades of advances in the definition and use of functional regions|url=|journal=Moravian Geographical Reports|volume=24|issue=2|pages=2–11|doi=10.1515/mgr-2016-0006|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Smart, 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smart|first1=MW|title=Labour market areas: uses and definition|journal=Progress in Planning|date=1974|volume=2|pages=239–353|doi=10.1016/0305-9006(74)90008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A functional region is not an abstract spatial concept, but to a certain extent it can be regarded as a reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. 
The functional region is conceived as a general concept while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only selfcontainment. The concept of self-containment remains the only crucial defining characteristic of a functional region. Nodal regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), or travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) are considered to be special instances of a general functional region that need to fulfil some specific conditions regarding, for instance, the character of the region-organising interaction or the presence of urban cores, (Halas et al., 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halas|first1=M|last2=Klapka|first2=P|last3=Tonev|first3=P|last4=Bednar|first4=M|title=An alternative definition and use for the constraint function for rule-based methods of functional regionalisation|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=2015|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1175–1191|doi=10.1177/0308518X15592306}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Military regions===
{{see also|Military district}}
{{Chain of Command}}
In military usage, a region is shorthand for the name of a military [[Military organization#Commands, formations, and units|formation]] larger than an [[Army group|Army Group]] and smaller than an [[Theater (warfare)|Army Theater]] or simply Theater. The full name of the military formation is Army Region. The size of an Army Region can vary widely but is generally somewhere between about 1 million and 3 million soldiers. Two or more Army Regions could make up an Army Theater. An Army Region is typically commanded by a full [[General]] (US four stars), a [[Field Marshal]], or [[General of the Army]] (US five stars), or [[Generalissimo]] (Soviet Union). Due to the large size of this formation, its use is rarely employed. Some of the very few examples of an Army Region are each of the Eastern, Western, and southern (mostly in Italy) fronts in Europe during [[World War II]]. The military map unit symbol for this echelon of formation (see [[Military organization]] and [[APP-6A]]) consists of six Xs.

===Media geography===
Media geography is a spatio-temporal understanding, brought through different gadgets of media, nowadays, media became inevitable at different proportions and everyone supposed to consumed at different gravity. The spatial attributes are studied with the help of media outputs in shape of images which are contested in nature and pattern as well where politics is inseparable. Media geography is giving spatial understanding of mediated image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4632">'''Ring Tone Text Transfer Language''' ('''RTTTL''') was developed by [[Nokia]]{{Citation needed|reason=Nokia Smart Messaging specification or early Nokia ringtone software (PC Composer) does not mention/support RTTTL; however, RTTTL was already in use those times by "NokRing" by John Mostelo.|date=February 2010}} to be used to transfer [[ringtone]]s to [[cellphone]] by Nokia.

The RTTTL format is a string divided into three sections: name, default value, and data.

The ''jintu'' section consists of a string describing the name of the ringtone. It can be no longer than 10 characters, and cannot contain a colon ":" character. (However, since the [[Smart Messaging]] specification allows names up to 15 characters in length, some applications processing RTTTL also do so.)

The ''default value'' section is a set of values separated by commas, where each value contains a key and a value separated by an ''='' character, which describes certain defaults which should be adhered to during the execution of the ringtone. Possible names are
* '''d''' - [[duration (music)|duration]]
* '''o''' - [[octave]]
* '''b''' - [[beat (music)|beat]], [[tempo]]

The ''data'' section consists of a set of character strings separated by commas, where each string  contains a ''duration'', ''pitch'', ''octave'' and optional ''dotting'' (which increases the duration of the note by one half).

The format of RTTTL notation is similar to the [[Music Macro Language]] found in [[BASIC]] implementations present on many early microcomputers.

==Technical specification==
To be recognized by ringtone programs, an RTTTL/Nokring format ringtone must contain three specific elements: name, settings, and notes.

For example, here is the RTTTL ringtone for Haunted House:

&lt;code&gt;HauntHouse: d=4,o=5,b=108: 2a4, 2e, 2d#, 2b4, 2a4, 2c, 2d, 2a#4, 2e., e, 1f4, 1a4, 1d#, 2e., d, 2c., b4, 1a4, 1p, 2a4, 2e, 2d#, 2b4, 2a4, 2c, 2d, 2a#4, 2e., e, 1f4, 1a4, 1d#, 2e., d, 2c., b4, 1a4&lt;/code&gt;

The three parts are separated by a colon.

* '''Part 1:''' name of the ringtone (here: "HauntHouse"), a string of characters represents the name of the ringtone
* '''Part 2:''' settings (here: d=4,o=5,b=108), where "d=" is the default duration of a note. In this case, the "4" means that each note with no duration specifier (see below) is by default considered a [[quarter note]]. "8" would mean an [[eighth note]], and so on. Accordingly, "o=" is the default [[octave]]. There are four octaves in the Nokring/RTTTL format. And "b=" is the [[tempo]], in "beats per minute".
* '''Part 3:''' the notes. Each note is separated by a comma and includes, in sequence: a duration specifier, a standard music note, either a, b, c, d, e, f or g, and an octave specifier. If no duration or octave specifier are present, the default applies.

=== Durations ===

Standard musical durations are denoted by the following notations:
* '''1''' - [[whole note]]
* '''2''' - [[half note]]
* '''4''' - [[quarter note]]
* '''8''' - [[eighth note]]
* '''16''' - [[sixteenth note]]
* '''32''' - [[thirty-second note]]

[[dotted note|Dotted]] [[rhythm]] patterns can be formed by appending a period (".") character to the end of a duration/beat/octave element.

=== Pitch ===

* '''P''' - rest or pause
* '''A''' - A
* '''A#''' - A♯ / B♭
* '''B''' - B / C♭
* '''C''' - C 
* '''C#''' - C♯ / D♭
* '''D''' - D
* '''D#''' - D♯ / E♭
* '''E''' - E / F♭
* '''F''' - F / E♯
* '''F#''' - F♯ / G♭
* '''G''' - G
* '''G#''' - G♯ / A♭

=== Octave ===

The RTTTL format allows octaves starting from the A below middle C and going up four octaves. This corresponds with the inability of [[cellphone]]s to reproduce certain [[pitch (music)|tone]]s audibly. These octaves are numbered from lowest pitch to highest pitch from 4 to 7.

The [[octave]] should be left out of the notation in the case of a rest or pause in the pattern.

== Example ==

An example of the RTTTL format would be
&lt;code&gt;
 fifth:d=4,o=5,b=63:8P,8G5,8G5,8G5,2D#5&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10098">In archaeological terms, [[graffiti]] (plural of [[graffito (archaeology)|graffito]]) is a mark, image or writing scratched or engraved into a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Robert C.|title=Invisible Romans|date=2011|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, Mass|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous examples found on sites of the [[Roman Empire]], including taverns and houses, as well as on pottery of the time.  In many cases the graffiti tend toward the rude, with a line etched into the basilica in [[Pompeii]] reading "Lucilla made money from her body," phallic images, as well as erotic pictures.&lt;ref name=Mount&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mount|first1=Harry|title=What Can We Learn from Roman Graffiti? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10336768/What-can-we-learn-from-Roman-graffiti.html |accessdate=3 November 2015|work=The Telegraph'|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the graffiti left behind from the Roman Period can give a better understanding of the daily life and attitudes of the Roman people with conclusions drawn about how everyday Romans talked, where they spent their time, and their interactions within those spaces.

==Graffiti Samples==
Inscriptions cover a range of topics from poems, advertisements, political statements, to greetings. There are two forms of graffiti: painted inscriptions (usually public notices) and inscribed inscriptions (spontaneous messages).

===Pompeii===
Over 11,000 graffiti samples have been uncovered in the excavations of [[Pompeii]]. Archaeologists have been studying and recording graffiti in Pompeii since the 1800s. These documentations remain the best evidence of over 90 percent of recorded graffiti from the area, which has not survived the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlson, Kristin. "[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/reading-the-writing-on-pompeiis-walls-1969367/ Reading the Writing on Pompeii's Walls]." Smithsonian, 26 July 2010. Web. 3 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====House of Maius Castricius====
[[File:Pompeii Stairwell Poetry.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sample of poetry from stairwell of House of Maius Castricius, Pompeii]]
This domestic residence shows that ancient graffiti was not limited to the public sphere, as graffiti is in modern day. This site, discovered in the 1960s, has benefited from preservation efforts, leaving the graffiti samples in their original context and remain legible. There is a unique feature of eleven graffiti containing multiple lines of poetry. For the most part, the poems are arranged vertically and respect the space of the others. This mix of original work and common phases are not a miscellaneous group because of the number and composition; instead, it appears that a conversation has formed.&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"&gt;Benefiel, Rebecca R. "Dialogues of Ancient Graffiti in the House of Maius Castricius in Pompeii." American Journal of Archaeology 114.1 (2010): 59-101. Web. 3 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

One passage on the staircase reads:
     vasia quae rapui, quaeris formosa puella
     accipe quae rapui non ego solus; ama.
     quisquis amat valeat 

Which translates to:
     Beautiful girl, you seek the kisses that I stole.
     Receive what I was not alone in taking; love.
     Whoever loves, may she fare well.

====Outside the shop of Fabius Ululitremulus====
[[File:Arma virumque cano.jpg|thumbnail|right|Three inscriptions referring to the opening line of the Aeneid]]

An example here demonstrates a familiarity with [[Virgil]] and [[hexameter]] verse. On the doorpost of the shop near pictures of [[Aeneas]] and [[Romulus]] is written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sander M. Goldberg |authorlink= |title=Constructing Literature in the Roman Republic |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University |location= |pages=20 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSWUPFkvYaUC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Fullones+ululamque+cano,+non+arma+virumque.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq7CIlC3L9&amp;sig=Vl2_Y6pd6MhI3XWHm922FDJicWs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip4-7Ro9XKAhUH_R4KHc0ZBiAQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Fullones%20ululamque%20cano%2C%20non%20arma%20virumque.&amp;f=false |isbn=9780521854610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

     Fullones ululamque cano, non arma virumque.

Translating to:

     I sing of cloth-launderers and an owl, not [[Aeneid#Theme|arms and a man]].

The owl is a signifier of [[Minerva]], the goddess who has been said to be protector over the profession of [[fullo]]nes.&lt;ref name=Mount/&gt;

[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] notes that there are more than fifty examples of graffiti referring to Virgil in Pompeii alone, but also notes that the majority of the references are to the opening lines of Book 1 or Book 2 of the [[Aeneid]], suggesting that these lines may have been widely known in the fashion "[[To be, or not to be]]" is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mary Beard |authorlink=Mary Beard (classicist) |title=SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome |year=2015 |publisher=W.

Norton &amp; Company |location= |pages=369–370 |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKL4CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT369&amp;lpg=PT369&amp;dq=fullones+ululamque+cano,+non+arma+virumque&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0VZObZdvYs&amp;sig=dUTHHTbhZkDp41dqOynSco2HwIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPr_TLo9fKAhUK0h4KHTGKCa0Q6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=fullones%20ululamque%20cano%2C%20non%20arma%20virumque&amp;f=false |isbn=9781631491252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogues===
[[File:8259(Successus textor).jpg|thumbnail|right|Inscription diaologue]]

Graffiti is often meant to be seen and expects to be read. A dialogue is formed between the reader and the inscription and can be simple as they speak directly to the readers in forms such as "if anyone sits here, let him read this before everything else…" as well as "He who writes this is in love… and I who reads this am a prick."

There are also dialogues where one passage answers another. These responses take the forms of greetings, insults, prayers, etc.
     Successus textor amat coponiaes ancilla(m)
     nomine Hiredem quae quidem illum
     non curat sed ille rogat illa com(m)iseretur
     scribit rivalis vale

Translates to :
     Successus the weaver is in love with the slave of the
     Innkeeper, whose name is Iris. She doesn't care about
     him at all, but he asks that she take pity on him.
     A rival wrote this

A response to this translates to:&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"/&gt;
     You're so jealous you're bursting. Don't tear down
     someone more handsome―
     a guy who could beat you up and who is good-looking.

===Games and riddles===
Word squares ([[magic square]]) and riddles are also common forms of the culture of graffiti. These show a level of mental agility and flexibility of language.&lt;ref name="RRB_2012"&gt;Benefiel, Rebecca R. "Magic Squares, Alphabet Jumbles, Riddles and More: The Culture of Word-Games among the Graffiti of Pompeii." ''The Muse at Play''. Vol. 305. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, 2012. 65-80. Web. 4 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Examples of handwritten alphabets are common graffiti in Pompeii and could be evidence of children practicing their alphabet. This lends to the argument that children were responsible for much of the graffiti. However, the height of the inscriptions and location may contradict this.&lt;ref name="RRB_2012"/&gt;

==Commentary==
Writing around 100 AD, [[Plutarch]] wrote of graffiti: "There is nothing written in them which is either useful or pleasing – only so-and-so 'remembers' so-and-so, and 'wishes him the best', and is 'the best of his friends', and many things full of such ridiculousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Emily Gowers]] |title=Ancient vandalism? |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1493961.ece |quote= |pages= |work=Times Literary Supplement |location= |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=2016-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

21st-century scholars have found more to study and enjoy in the visual art and [[intertextuality]] of Roman graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kristina Milnor |authorlink= |title=Graffiti and the Literary Landscape in Roman Pompeii |year=2014 |publisher=OUP Oxford |location= |pages= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ndbQAgAAQBAJ |isbn=9780199684618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than simply text and thought, Roman graffiti give insight into the use of space and how people interacted within it. Studying the motivation behind the marks reveals a trend for the graffiti to be located where people spend time and pass most frequently as they move through a space. Common places for graffiti are staircases, central peristyle, and vestibule. The use of graffiti by Romans has been said to be very different from the defacing trends of modern day, with the text blending into the walls and rooms by respecting the frescoes and decoration with the use of small letters. In this way, the environment influences the graffiti by subject and organization, and the graffiti in turn changes and influences the environment.&lt;ref name="RRB_2010"/&gt;

==Studying graffiti==
Typical techniques when studying graffiti include drawing each inscription and taking photographs if special attention is required. When only a shadow of the engravings are visible to the naked eye, other methods of observance are needed to decipher the engravings.

===3D laser profilometry===

Using 3D laser profilometry to analyze the roughness of a surface, archaeologists have been able to determine the tools used in engraving. This technique merged with photographs taken with oblique light, different lighting conditions, and results from [[electrostatic detection device]]s have increased the readability of illegible inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Montani, Isabelle, et al. "Analysis of Roman Pottery Graffiti by High Resolution Capture and 3D Laser Profilometry." Journal of Archaeological Science 39.11 (2012): 3349.Web&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Society of the Humanities at Uppsala''' (''Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala'') is a Swedish Royal academy for the study of the humanities.

==Founding==
The society was founded in 1889 by a donation from tannery factory owner [[Jacob Westin]] in Stockholm who gave SEK 50,000 in his will dated 1878 to form a scientific community to further the study of philosophy, philology and history sciences. Westin also donated a large collection of books and manuscripts to [[Uppsala University]] library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khvsu.se/historik/ Kort historik.] Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala. Retrieved 8 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's statutes were ratified by the Swedish king on 28 March 1896.{{citation required|date=November 2015}}

==Prizes==
The society annually awards a prize to two doctoral dissertations, known as the Westinska prize.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The '''Saltire Prize''', named after the [[flag of Scotland]], is the national award for advances in the commercial development of [[marine energy]].

To be considered for the £10 million award teams must demonstrate, in [[Scottish waters]], a commercially viable [[Wave energy|wave]] or [[tidal stream energy]] technology "that achieves the greatest volume of electrical output over the set minimum hurdle of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period using only the power of the sea."

The Saltire Prize is open to any individual, team or organisation from across the world who believes they have wave or tidal energy technology capable of fulfilling the challenge. Applications can be submitted between March 2010 and January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/challenge |title=The Challenge | publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already there are five competitors registered.

==Additional prizes==

• The '''Saltire Prize Lecture''' - delivered at the Scottish Renewables Marine Conference every September, it focuses on the challenges in converting our world lead in wave and tidal energy to an industry of commercial scale, and in securing the economic, environmental and social benefits that this industry can bring.  The lecture is designed to promote knowledge exchange between academics, industry, financiers and government.

• The '''Saltire Prize Medal''' - created to recognise outstanding contributions to the development of marine renewable energy. The Medal is awarded every March at the Scottish Renewables Annual Conference, Exhibition and Dinner.

• The '''Junior Saltire Prize''' - launched in 2011, this is aimed at primary and secondary school pupils and was designed to help raise awareness of the opportunities that Scotland has to exploit its marine renewables potential.  It is sponsored by Skills Development Scotland and awards are presented to teams in three age groups: p5-7, s1-3 and s4-6.

• A '''Saltire Prize-sponsored doctorate''' in collaboration with the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) - This was announced in August 2012.  The research will consider how marine energy projects can be designed to maximise economic energy production while protecting the environment.

• '''Power of the Sea''' - a one off junior photography competition sponsored by the Saltire Prize, aimed at raising awareness of the natural environment and its potential for marine energy.	In December 2012, four young photographers from Scottish primary schools were selected by renowned Scottish photographer, David Eustace, as the national winners.

==History==
When it was first announced in 2008 it was the world's largest ever single prize for innovation in marine renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/04/02151533 |title=World to compete for Saltire Prize| publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize is overseen by the Challenge Committee. Saltire Prize policy is the responsibility of the Offshore Renewables Policy Team in the Scottish Government's Energy and Climate Change Directorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/about-us |title=About us| publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-expression values''' are part of a [[Value system|core value]] dimension in the [[modernization]] process.&lt;ref name="Inglehart97"&gt;{{cite book|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|year=1997|title=Modernization and  Postmodernization:  Cultural,  Economic,  and  Political Change  in  43  Societies|location=[[Princeton, New Jersey]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|authorlink=Ronald Inglehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-expression is a cluster of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] that include social toleration, [[life satisfaction]], [[public expression]] and an aspiration to liberty. [[Ronald Inglehart]], the [[University of Michigan]] professor who developed the theory of [[post-materialism]], has worked extensively with this concept. On the [[World Values Survey#Results|Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map]] ''self-expression values'' are contrasted with ''survival values'', illustrating the changes in values across countries and generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org|title=World Values Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the world is moving towards self-expression values  was discussed at length in an article in [[the Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/1511812 ''American Values: Living with a superpower''] January 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Self expression is to say something that you truly believe is important in a form of communication, such as art, speech and dance. It is to reveal yourself in a way that is special to yourself. 

==Emergence of self-expression values==
The emergence of the [[post-industrial society]] has brought about a wave of cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|title=The silent revolution in Europe: Intergenerational change in postindustrial societies|journal=[[American Political Science Review]]|year=1971|volume=65|pages=991–1017|authorlink=Ronald Inglehart|doi=10.2307/1953494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], and a growing share of [[East Asia]], a majority of the people are no longer employed in factories, but work in the [[service sector]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] | title = Field Listing: Labor force – by occupation | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html| accessdate = 23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a shift from a mechanical environment to one where ever more people spend their days dealing with other people, symbols, and [[information]], which means that workers in the knowledge sector must exercise their own judgment and choice.

This shift has had major consequences:
* Unprecedentedly high levels of prosperity and welfare states that make food, clothing, shelter, housing, education and health service available to almost everyone. Even in the United States, where the [[welfare state]] is relatively limited, a significant portion of the [[GDP]] is redistributed through the state. This makes physical survival, a minimum living standard, and an average life expectancy of nearly 80 years to be taken for granted by people living in the respective societies, which encourages people to focus on goals beyond immediate survival.
* Modern service jobs increasingly require use of [[cognitive skill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Florida|first=Richard|year=2002|title=The Rise of the Creative Class|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|authorlink=Richard Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers, teachers, lawyers, accountants, counselors, programmers and analysts all belong to the [[creative class]]. These workers have high autonomy in their work, even if they sometimes continue to work in hierarchical organizations. The need for cognitive skills is dramatically larger than in societies in the early stages of industrialization. To meet these needs, the labor forces of post-industrial societies increasingly pursue higher education, emphasizing creativity, imagination and intellectual independence. 
* Post-industrial societies are socially liberating compared to their predecessors. The centrally controlled, highly regimented workforces of the industrial world are gone, as are the strong [[conformity]] pressures that accompanied them. The traditional system—in which children's survival depended on their parents' providing for them, in return for which the children would take care of the parents in old age—has been undermined by the welfare state. As a result, close-knit family structures, once a necessity for survival, become increasingly a matter of choice, replacing "communities of necessity" with "elective affinities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|year=2002|chapter=Losing the Traditional: Individualization and Precarious Freedoms|title=Individualization|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|pages=1–21|authorlink=Ulrich Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destandardization of economic activities and social life diminishes social constraints in unprecedented ways. The shift in post-industrial societies is thus one of emancipation from authority.&lt;ref name="Inglehart05"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | lastauthoramp = yes | title = Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = New York | year = 2005 | ISBN = 9780521846950 | author2link=Christian Welzel}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-expression values and democracy==
[[Industrialization]] can lead to [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[theocracy]] or [[democracy]]. But post-industrial society brings socio-cultural changes that make truly effective democracy increasingly probable.

[[Knowledge society|Knowledge societies]] cannot function effectively without highly educated workers, who become articulate and accustomed to thinking for themselves. Furthermore, rising levels of economic security bring growing emphasis on self-expression values that give high priority to free choice. Mass publics become increasingly likely to want democracy, and increasingly effective in getting it. Repressing mass demands for liberalization becomes increasingly costly and detrimental to economic effectiveness. These changes link economic development with democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | title = Changing Mass Priorities: The Link between Modernization and Democracy | journal = Perspectives on Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 551–567 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1017/S1537592710001258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical measurements of self-expression values==
The most thorough assessment of self-expression values is carried out in the [[World Values Survey]]. Five "[[World Values Survey#History|waves]]" have been conducted so far, each adding additional countries to the survey.

Subsequent [[data analysis]] by Inglehart revealed that a large percentage in the variability in the data could be explained by using a set of measures that tapped just two dimensions: a traditional to secular-rational axis, and a survival to self-expression axis. The factor scores were originally based on 22 variables,&lt;ref name="Inglehart97" /&gt; but this was reduced to  only 10 (5 for each dimension) for the purposes of data availability.

The self-expression axis has the following [[factor loadings]].&lt;ref name="Inglehart05" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!  Survey question

|-
|  Respondent has signed or would sign a petition
|  0.74
|-

== History and Staff ==

The '''Edelstein Center''' was established in 2004, by Joel Edelstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/English/JoelEdelstein.asp |title=About Joel Edelstein |publisher=Centroedelstein.org.br |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a USA citizen living in [[Brazil]]. From its inception is directed by [[Bernardo Sorj]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernardosorj.com.br/english/index.asp |title=Director Bernardo Sorj’s site |publisher=Bernardosorj.com.br |date=2005-12-30 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Board of Advisors includes [[Adama Samassékou]] (Mali), Angelina Peralva (France), Daniel Pécaut (France), Giorgio Alberti (Italy), [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] (in memoriam, Argentina), [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]] (France) [[:es:Julio Cotler|Julio Cotler]] (Peru), Sérgio Costa (Germany), Shepard Forman (United States) and [[Simon Schwartzman]] (Brazil).

In 2007, in association with the Instituto [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifhc.org.br Instituto Fernando Henrique Cardoso]&lt;/ref&gt; founded the ''Democratic Platform Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plataformademocratica.org/English |title=Democratic Platform Project |publisher=Plataformademocratica.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009-2010, the '''Edelstein Center''' was one of the sponsors of the [[Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy]]. The other organizations were Instituto [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] and the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;ref name="drogasedemocracia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drogasedemocracia.org/English/Default.asp |title=Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy |publisher=Drogasedemocracia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010-2011, the '''Edelstein Center''' was part of the secretariat of the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/ |title=The Global Commission on Drug Policy |publisher=Globalcommissionondrugs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

'''The Information Society in Latin America'''

This research program concentrates on the impact of new [[information and communications technology]] on the transformation of [[Latin America]]'s education system, public space and democratic life.&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, Bernardo. Information Societies and Digital Divides: an Introduction. Milano: Polimetrica. Rio de Janeiro: The Edelstein Center for Social Research, 2008. {{ISBN|9788876991288}}. http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/PDF/Information_Societies_and_Digital_Divides_ebook.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[REMOLD, Julie.

Recently the '''Edelstein Center''' has completed a research on the use of computers and [[Internet]] by public school teachers in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, Bernardo; LISSOVSKY, Mauricio. Internet in Brazilian Public Schools: Policies beyond Politics. Rio de Janeiro: The Edelstein Center for Social Research, Working Paper nº 6, May 2011. http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/PDF/WP_6_English.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicates that even when they have a positive impact, they cannot be separated from the educational and human context. A comprehensive policy needs to properly training teachers, in particular confronting the difficulties of the older generation, use monitored software, and adequate maintaining the physical infrastructural and technical support for school computer labs.

'''Civil Society and Globalization Agendas'''

The ''Civil Society and Globalization Agendas'' research program focuses on the current changes in [[Latin America]]’s [[civil society]]. Civil society played an important role in the promotion of [[democracy]] during the period of [[military dictatorships]]. However, more recently, civil society organizations have expanded and changed profoundly. While continuing to play an important role in the defense of [[human rights]], in many countries civil society has become a vehicle for  political parties, individual politicians, unions and social movements to channel public funds for their own benefit and/or political cooptation.&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6861">'''''The Other Canon Foundation''''' is a center and network for research of [[heterodox economics]] founded by [[Erik Reinert]]. The name refers to the founders' message of there being another economic canon, alternative to the ruling [[neoclassical economics]]. Their suggestions, they claim, are valid for and can be applicated in the first, second and third world.&lt;ref name="othercanon1"&gt;http://www.othercanon.org/papers/organisation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Other Canon was founded in 2000 by Erik Reinert and 10 co-founders with different backgrounds in economics and social sciences. The founders also have distinct backgrounds coming from North America, Latin America, Asia, Eastern and Western Europe. Notable names among them are [[Wolfgang Drechsler]], [[Carlota Perez]] and [[Geoffrey Hodgson]]. In addition to the executive chairman Erik Reinert and the earlier mentioned Drechsler, the current executive board also employs [[Rainer Kattel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.othercanon.org/board/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories and influences ==
The ideological foundation of The Other Canon is not defined in a left-right perspective, claiming both sides have fallen into the same traps failing to explain and develop valid theories for today's economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercanon.org/uploads/The%20other%20Canon%2011%2099.doc#32;other Canon 11 99.doc ''The Other Canon - Reconstructing the Theory of Uneven Economic Development'']&lt;/ref&gt; Central to the group is the [[Theory of Uneven Development]], which aims to explain how and why the international economic landscape (of rich and poor nations) is as it is today. History of Economic Policy is used as an important tool in this process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.othercanon.org/documenting/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Other Canon is highly eclectic and gathers ideas from many authors of various epochs. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Gustav von Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]], [[Nicholas Kaldor]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Adam Smith]] (for considerations of the primary sector) are among the theorists to have influenced The Other Canon.

In accordance with Schumpeter, The Other Canon emphasizes the role of "man the producer" over "man the consumer" and intends to seek the reasons for growth and innovation rather than seeing it as something innate to capital and a simple result of adding it to human labour. They argue that the state is needed to stimulate entrepreneurship to maximise growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercanon.org/uploads/State%20paper.doc#32;paper.doc Erik Reinert. ''The Role of the State in Economic Growth'']&lt;/ref&gt;
The importance of role of the state is also underlined in development economics. In his book ''[[How Rich Countries Got Rich ... and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor]]'' (2007), Reinert criticises liberal economists for ignoring empirical evidence when they promote free-trade as the solution to third world countries. He claims poor countries should, and should be allowed to, use protectionism to build up their own industries until they can compete internationally and that the state should be involved in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Reinert. How Rich Countries Got Rich ... and Why Poor Countries Stay Poor (2007), London: Constable.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences to and criticism of the mainstream economics ==
Much of The Others Canon's criticism of the mainstream economics regards the focus on equilibrium and the static, as well as what the neoclassical models takes as given (perfect information, perfect foresight, constant [[returns to scale]] and no diversity/likeness of economic activity). Conforming with Schumpeterian theory The Other Canon emphasises the constant change in the economy and that entrepreneurs and capitalists all the time create temporary monopolies based on advantages of knowledge and/or uncertain assumptions about the future. The fact that mainstream economics sees innovation and novelty, and hence growth (of which capitalism is absolutely dependent), as exogenous phenomena does not fall lightly with The Other Canon who sees these factors as pivotal to the economy and something that is maximised through stimulation in the form of state policy.
The Other Canon claims reintroducing increasing and diminishing (decreasing) returns to scale can help us understand the economic development and why neo-classical economy has failed to explain the uneven development of nations. Reinerts claims poor country's concentrating their production on industries with diminishing returns to scale will lead them to become more inefficient the more they invest while the opposite thing will happen to the rich countries with their primarily increasing returns to scale industries. This, he argues, is why following [[David Ricardo|Ricardian Economics]], mainly his theory of [[comparative advantage]], will, instead of leading to the factor price equalisation neo-liberals profess, in fact usher poor countries into "specialising in being poor and inefficient".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.othercanon.org/uploads/SUM%20paper%20diminishing%20returns.doc#32;paper Reinert, Erik S. 'Diminishing Returns and Economic Sustainability; The Dilemma of Resource-based Economies under a Free Trade Regime.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], however, takes use of increasing returns to scale in his [[New Trade Theory]] to explain the success of the industrialised countries, but leaves out diminishing returns to scale explaining the misery of the [[Third World]].
The view of the economy as largely independent from society and the financial sector not being distinct from the real economy are also disputed by The Other Canon claiming that the economy is indeed embedded into society and that conflicts between the financial sector are normal and hence must be regulated.&lt;ref name="othercanon1"/&gt;

== Publishing ==
Since 2009, The Other Canon has its own book publishing series with Anthem Press in London,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anthempress.com/&lt;/ref&gt; called TAOCS - The Anthem Other Canon Series. So far, publications include 
*a new biography of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] by Schumpeter Society&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iss-evec.de/&lt;/ref&gt; chairman [[Esben Sloth Andersen]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">'''Traditional transmission''' (also called '''cultural transmission''') is a design feature of [[language]] that the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] developed to distinguish the features of human language from those of [[animal communication]]. He discovered thirteen features that all human languages have. Animals might communicate with some of the thirteen basic design features of language but never with all of them. Traditional transmission is exemplified by the fact that language is learned in [[social group]]s. Although there is disagreement about how much linguistic capability humans are born with, it is known that the only way that humans learn language and refine its use as they grow is in social settings.

A '''writer''' is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various [[report]]s and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express [[idea]]s well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magill |first1=Frank N.|title=Cyclopedia of World Authors|edition=revised  |volume=vols. I, II, III |year=1974 |publisher=Salem Press |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn= |pages=1–1973}} [A compilation of the bibliographies and short biographies of notable authors up to 1974.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "writer" is also used elsewhere in the arts – such as songwriter – but as a standalone "writer" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an [[oral tradition]].

Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional. Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas. Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific nature. Some writers may use [[image]]s (drawing, painting, graphics) or [[multimedia]] to augment their writing. In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.&lt;ref&gt;Nobel prize winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on ''how'' they write (that is, the process they use);&lt;ref name=Nicolson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''why'' they write (that is, their motivation);&lt;ref name=Blythe&gt;See, for example, {{cite book|title=Why I write: thoughts on the practice of fiction|year=c. 1998|publisher=Little, Brown|location=Boston|isbn=0316102296|editor=Will Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Franzen]], for example, criticised [[John Updike]] for being "exquisitely preoccupied with his own literary digestive processes ..." and his "lack of interest in the bigger postwar, postmodern, socio-technological picture" {{cite journal|last=Franzen|first=Jonathan|title=Franzen on Kraus: Footnote 89|journal=The Paris Review|date=6 September 2013|issue=206|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/category/issue-206/|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published. Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are never paid for their work.

The term ''writer'' is often used as a synonym of ''author'', although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative.

==Types==
Writers choose from a range of [[literary genre]]s to express their ideas. Most writing can be adapted for use in another medium. For example, a writer's work may be read privately or recited or performed in a play or film. Satire for example, may be written as a poem, an essay, a film, a comic play, or a piece of journalism. The writer of a letter may include elements of criticism, biography, or journalism.

Many writers work across genres. The genre sets the parameters but all kinds of creative adaptation have been attempted: novel to film; poem to play; history to musical. Writers may begin their career in one genre and change to another. For example, historian [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] began in the genre of [[travel literature]] and also writes as a journalist. Many writers have produced both fiction and non-fiction works and others write in a genre that crosses the two. For example, writers of [[historical romance]]s, such as [[Georgette Heyer]], invent characters and stories set in historical periods. In this genre, the accuracy of the history and the level of factual detail in the work both tend to be debated. Some writers write both creative fiction and serious analysis, sometimes using different names to separate their work. [[Dorothy L. Sayers|Dorothy Sayers]], for example, wrote crime fiction but was also a playwright, essayist, translator, and critic.

He had done for her all that a man could,
And some might say, more than a man should,
Then was ever a flame so recklessly blown out
Or a last goodbye so negligent as this?

Tilting her cheek for a polite kiss;
Then walked away, nor ever turned about.  ...

Poets make maximum use of the language to achieve an emotional and sensory effect as well as a cognitive one. To create these effects, they use [[rhyme]] and rhythm and they also exploit the properties of words with a range of other techniques such as [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]]. A common theme is love and its vicissitudes. [[Shakespeare]]'s famous love story ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', for example, written in a variety of poetic forms, has been performed in innumerable theatres and made into at least eight cinematic versions.&lt;ref&gt;1936, 1954, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1978, 2013, 2014. [https://www.imdb.com/find?q=Romeo+and+Juliet&amp;s=all IMDb listing.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Donne]] is another poet renowned for his love poetry.

====Novelist====
{{Main|Novelist}}

Novelists write novels – stories that explore universal themes through fiction. They situate invented characters and plots in a narrative designed to be both credible and entertaining.
{{Quotation|''Every novel worthy of the name is like another planet, whether large or small, which has its own laws just as it has its own flora and fauna. Thus, [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]'s technique is certainly the best one with which to paint Faulkner's world, and [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s nightmare has produced its own myths that make it communicable. [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Stendhal]], [[Eugène Fromentin]], [[Jacques Rivière]], [[Raymond Radiguet|Radiguet]], all used different techniques, took different liberties, and set themselves different tasks.''&lt;br /&gt;[[François Mauriac]], novelist&lt;ref name="Le Marchand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Marchand|first=Jean|title=Interviews: François Mauriac, The Art of Fiction No. 2|journal=The Paris Review|date=Summer 1953|issue= 2|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5197/the-art-of-fiction-no-2-franois-mauriac|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Satirist====
{{Main|Satire}}

A satirist uses wit to ridicule the shortcomings of society or individuals, with the intent of exposing stupidity. Usually, the subject of the satire is a contemporary issue such as ineffective political decisions or politicians, although human vices such as [[greed]] are also a common and universal subject. Philosopher [[Voltaire]] wrote a satire about optimism called ''[[Candide]]'', which was subsequently turned into an opera, and many well known lyricists wrote for it. There are elements of [[Absurdism]] in ''Candide'', just as there are in the work of contemporary satirist [[Barry Humphries]], who writes comic satire for his character [[Dame Edna Everage]] to perform on stage.

Satirists use various techniques such as [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], and [[hyperbole]] to make their point and they choose from the full range of genres – the satire may be in the form of prose or poetry or dialogue in a film, for example. One of the most famous satirists is [[Jonathan Swift]] who wrote the four-volume work ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and many other satires, including ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' and ''[[The Battle of the Books]]''.

{{Quotation|''It is amazing to me that ... our age is almost wholly illiterate and has hardly produced one writer upon any subject.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Jonathan Swift]], satirist (1704)&lt;ref&gt;The Epistle Dedicatory of ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]''. For text at Wikisource, see [[s:A Tale of a Tub|''A Tale of a Tub'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Short story writer====
{{Main|Short story}}
A short story writer is a writer of short stories, works of fiction that can be read in a single sitting.

===Performative===
====Librettist====
[[File:Wagner Luzern 1868.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Richard Wagner]], who also wrote the libretti for his works]]
{{Main|Libretto}}
Libretti (the plural of libretto) are the texts for musical works such as operas. The Venetian poet and librettist [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], for example, wrote the libretto for some of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s greatest operas. [[Luigi Illica]] and [[Giuseppe Giacosa]] were Italian librettists who wrote for [[Giacomo Puccini]]. Most opera composers collaborate with a librettist but unusually, [[Richard Wagner]] wrote both the music and the libretti for his works himself.
{{Quotation|''Chi son? Sono poeta. Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.''
("Who am I? I'm a poet. What do I do? I write. And how do I live? I live.")&lt;br /&gt;Rodolpho, in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of Rodolpho's aria in Act I of ''[[La bohème]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lyricist====
{{Main|Lyricist}}
Usually writing in verses and choruses, a lyricist specializes in writing [[lyrics]], the words that accompany or underscore a song or opera. Lyricists also write the words for songs. In the case of [[Tom Lehrer]], these were satirical. Lyricist [[Noël Coward]], who wrote musicals and songs such as "[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]" and the recited song "[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]", also wrote plays and films and performed on stage and screen as well. Writers of lyrics, such as these two, adapt other writers' work as well as create entirely original pieces.
{{Quotation|''Making lyrics feel natural, sit on music in such a way that you don't feel the effort of the author, so that they shine and bubble and rise and fall, is very, very hard to do.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Sondheim]], lyricist&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipton|first=James|title=Interview: Stephen Sondheim, The Art of the Musical|journal=The Paris Review|date=Spring 1997|issue= 142|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1283/the-art-of-the-musical-stephen-sondheim|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Playwright====
[[File:FF The Tempest title.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' from the 1623 [[First Folio]]]]
{{Main|Playwright}}

A playwright writes plays which may or may not be performed on a stage by actors. A play's narrative is driven by dialogue. Like novelists, playwrights usually explore a theme by showing how people respond to a set of circumstances. As writers, playwrights must make the language and the dialogue succeed in terms of the characters who speak the lines as well as in the play as a whole. Since most plays are performed, rather than read privately, the playwright has to produce a text that works in spoken form and can also hold an audience's attention over the period of the performance. Plays tell "a story the audience should care about", so writers have to cut anything that worked against that.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneytheatre.com.au/magazine/posts/2015/november/feature-mike-bartlett-kciii?fptd_mode=validation|title=Mike Bartlett on writing King Charles III|last=Bartlett|first=Mike|date=18 November 2015|website=Sydney Theatre Company Magazine|publisher=Sydney Theatre Company|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plays may be written in prose or verse. Shakespeare wrote plays in [[iambic pentameter]] as does [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]] in his play ''King Charles III'' (2014).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Playwrights also adapt or re-write other works, such as plays written earlier or literary works originally in another genre. Famous playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] or [[Anton Chekhov]] have had their works adapted many times. The plays of early Greek playwrights [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]], and [[Aeschylus]] are still performed. Adaptations of a playwright's work may be faithful to the original or creatively interpreted. If the writers' purpose in re-writing the play is to produce a film, they will have to prepare a screenplay. Shakespeare's plays, for example, while still regularly performed in the original form, are often adapted and abridged, especially for the [[filmmaking|cinema]]. An example of a creative modern adaptation of a play that nonetheless used the original writer's words, is [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The amendment of the name to ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' indicates to the audience that the version will be different from the original. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is a play inspired by Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' that takes two of Shakespeare's most minor characters and creates a new play in which they are the protagonists.

{{Quotation|'''''Player''''': ''It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly or from a great height.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Tom Stoppard]], [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]] (Act Two)&lt;ref name=Stoppard&gt;{{cite book|last=Stopppard|first=Tom|title=Rosencrantz and Guildentern Are Dead|year=1967|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=0-571-08182-7|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Screenwriter====
{{Main|Screenwriter}}

Screenwriters write a screenplay – or script – that provides the words for media productions such as films, television programs and video games. Screenwriters may start their careers by writing the screenplay [[Spec script|speculatively]]; that is, they write a script with no advance payment, solicitation or contract. On the other hand, they may be employed or commissioned to adapt the work of a playwright or novelist or other writer. Self-employed writers who are paid by contract to write are known as [[freelancer]]s and screenwriters often work under this type of arrangement.

Screenwriters, playwrights and other writers are inspired by the great [[Theme (arts)|themes]] and often use similar and familiar plot devices to explore them. For example, in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' is a "play within a play", which the hero uses to demonstrate the king's guilt. Hamlet gains the co-operation of the actors to set up the play as a thing "wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king".&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2|The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark/Act 2]]'', (Act II, Sc.2, line 609)&lt;/ref&gt; [[teleplay]] writer [[Joe Menosky]] deploys the same "play within a play" device in an episode of the science fiction [[Television program#Seasons/series|television series]] ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. The bronze-age playwright/hero enlists the support of a ''Star Trek'' crew member to create a play that will convince the ruler (or "patron" as he is called), of the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;See Season 6, Episode 22: [[Muse (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Muse", ''(Star Trek: Voyager)'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speechwriter====
{{Main|Speechwriter}}
A speechwriter prepares the text for a [[Public speaking|speech]] to be given before a group or crowd on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose. They are often intended to be persuasive or inspiring, such as the speeches given by skilled orators like [[Cicero]]; charismatic or influential political leaders like [[Nelson Mandela]]; or for use in a court of law or parliament. The writer of the speech may be the person intended to deliver it, or it might be prepared by a person hired for the task on behalf of someone else. Such is the case when speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in both government and private sectors.

===Interpretive and academic===
====Biographer====
{{Main|List of biographers}}
Biographers write an account of another person's life. [[Richard Ellmann]] (1918–1987), for example, was an eminent and award-winning biographer whose work focused on the Irish writers [[James Joyce]], [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. For the Wilde biography, he won the 1989 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]].

====Critic====
{{Main|Critic}}
Critics consider and assess the extent to which a work succeeds in its purpose. The work under consideration may be literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, or architectural. In assessing the success of a work, the critic takes account of why it was done – for example, why a text was written, for whom, in what style, and under what circumstances. After making such an assessment, critics write and publish their evaluation, adding the value of their scholarship and thinking to substantiate any opinion. The theory of criticism is an area of study in itself: a good critic understands and is able to incorporate the theory behind the work they are evaluating into their assessment.&lt;ref name=Habib&gt;For example, see {{cite book|last=Habib|first= M.A.R.|title=A History of Literary Criticism and Theory|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=MA, USA; Oxford, UK; Victoria, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics are already writers in another genre. For example, they might be novelists or essayists. Influential and respected writer/critics include the art critic [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867) and the literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] (born 1965), both of whom have books published containing collections of their criticism. Some critics are poor writers and produce only superficial or unsubstantiated work. Hence, while anyone can be an uninformed critic, the notable characteristics of a good critic are understanding, insight, and an ability to write well.

{{Quotation|''We can claim with at least as much accuracy as a well-known writer claims of his little books, that no newspaper would dare print what we have to say. Are we going to be very cruel and abusive, then? By no means: on the contrary, we are going to be impartial. We have no friends – that is a great thing – and no enemies.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Charles Baudelaire]], introducing his Review of the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1845&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Baudelaire – Art in Paris 1845–1862: Reviews of Salons and other exhibitions|year=1965|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|page=1|editor = Jonathan Mayne (editor and translator)|chapter=The Salon of 1845}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Editor====
{{Main|Editing|Copywriting}}
[[File:Un Cœur simple (manuscrito).jpg|thumb|Flaubert's heavily edited page of his manuscript for [[Three Tales (Flaubert)#"A Simple Heart"|Un Cœur simple]]]]

An editor prepares literary material for publication. The material may be the editor's own original work but more commonly, an editor works with the material of one or more other people. There are different types of editor. [[Copy editing|Copy editors]] format text to a particular style and/or correct errors in grammar and spelling without changing the text substantively. On the other hand, an editor may suggest or undertake significant changes to a text to improve its readability, sense or structure. This latter type of editor can go so far as to excise some parts of the text, add new parts, or restructure the whole. The work of editors of ancient texts or [[manuscript]]s or collections of works results in differing editions. For example, there are many editions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays by notable editors who also contribute original introductions to the resulting publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Beverley Ellison|title=Famous Introductions to Shakespeare's Plays by the Notable Editors of the Eighteenth Century (1906)|date = 2012|publisher=HardPress|isbn=1290807086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors who work on journals and newspapers have varying levels of responsibility for the text – they may write original material, in particular, editorials; select what is to be included from a range of items on offer; format the material; or check its accuracy.

====Encyclopaedist====
[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|Sculpture in Berlin depicting a stack of books on which are inscribed the names of great writers: [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]; [[Thomas Mann|Mann]]; [[Theodor Fontane|Fontane]]; [[Hermann Hesse|Hesse]]; [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]; [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]; [[Heinrich Böll|Böll]]; [[Karl Marx|Marx]]; [[Brothers Grimm]]; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]; [[Anna Seghers|Seghers]]; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]; [[Martin Luther|Luther]]; [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]; [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]]; [[Günter Grass|Grass]] ]]

{{Main|Encyclopedia}}
Encyclopaedists create organised bodies of knowledge. [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) is renowned for his contributions to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The encyclopaedist [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] (1499–1590) was a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] whose ''Historia general de las cosas de Nueva España'' is a vast encyclopedia of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilisation, commonly referred to as the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'', after the Italian manuscript library which holds the best preserved copy.

====Essayist====
{{Main|List of essayists}}

Essayists write essays, which are original pieces of writing of moderate length in which the author makes a case in support of an opinion. They are usually in [[prose]], but some writers have used poetry to present their argument.

====Historian====
{{See also|List of historians}}
A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it.&lt;ref name="wordnetprinceton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Historian |title= Historian |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of a historian is to employ [[Historiography|historical analysis]] to create coherent narratives that explain "what happened" and "why or how it happened". Professional historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton and Robert B. Townsend, "The Parlous Paths of the Profession" [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2008/0810/0810pro1.cfm ''Perspectives on History'' (Sept. 2008) online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]]'s six volume ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' influenced the development of [[historiography]].

====Lexicographer====
{{Main|Lexicography}}
Writers who create dictionaries are called lexicographers. One of the most famous is [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784), whose ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' was regarded not only as a great personal scholarly achievement but was also dictionary of such pre-eminence, that would have been referred to by such writers as [[Jane Austen]].

====Researcher/Scholar====
{{Main|Research|Scholarly method}}
[[File:Chomsky 4 - On the elite's view of the poor.ogg|thumb|left|One of many interviews with prolific American writer, philosopher, linguist, scientist, historian and critic [[Noam Chomsky]] (2009)]]

Researchers and scholars who write about their discoveries and ideas sometimes have profound effects on society. Scientists and philosophers are good examples because their new ideas can revolutionise the way people think and how they behave. Three of the best known examples of such a revolutionary effect are [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who wrote ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543); [[Charles Darwin]], who wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859); and [[Sigmund Freud]], who wrote ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899).

These three highly influential, and initially very controversial, works changed the way people understood their place in the world. Copernicus's [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the cosmos displaced humans from their previously accepted place at the centre of the universe; Darwin's evolutionary theory placed humans firmly within, as opposed to above, the order of nature; and Freud's ideas about the power of the [[unconscious mind]] overcame the belief that humans were consciously in control of all their own actions.&lt;ref name=Weinert&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinert|first=Friedel|title=Copernicus, Darwin and Freud: Revolutions in the History and Philosophy of Science|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Malden, Massachusetts, USA; Oxford UK;|isbn=978-1-4051-8184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Translator====
{{Main|Translation}}
Translators have the task of finding some equivalence in another language to a writer's meaning, intention and style. Translators whose work has had very significant cultural effect include [[Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar]], who translated ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Arabic]] and [[Jean-François Champollion]], who deciphered [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] with the result that he could publish the first translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] hieroglyphs in 1822. Difficulties with translation are exacerbated when words or phrases incorporate rhymes, rhythms, or [[pun]]s; or when they have connotations in one language that are non-existent in another. For example, the title of ''[[Le Grand Meaulnes]]'' by [[Alain-Fournier]] is supposedly untranslatable because "no English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple [French] word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses."&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title="Introduction" to the English translation of "Le Grand Meaulnes"|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780141441894|page=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators have also become a part of events where political figures who speak different languages meet to look into the relations between countries or solve political conflicts. It is highly critical for the translator to deliver the right information as a drastic impact could be caused if any error occurred. 

{{Quotation|''Even if translation is impossible – we have no choice but to do it: to take the next step and start translating. ... The translator's task is to make us either forget or else enjoy the difference.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robert Dessaix]], translator, author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dessaix|first=Robert|title="Dandenongs Gothic: On Translation" in (and so forth)|year=1998|publisher=Pan McMillan Australia Ltd|location=Sydney|isbn=0-7329-0943-0|pages=307|authorlink=Robert Dessaix}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Blogger====
{{Main|Blog}}
Writers of blogs, which have appeared on the [[World Wide Web]] since the 1990s, need no authorisation to be published. The contents of these short opinion pieces or "posts" form a commentary on issues of specific interest to readers who can use the same technology to interact with the author, with an immediacy hitherto impossible. The ability to link to other sites means that some blog writers – and their writing – may become suddenly and unpredictably popular. [[Malala Yousafzai]], a young Pakistani education activist, rose to prominence because of her blog for [[BBC]].

A blog writer is using the technology to create a message that is in some ways like a newsletter and in other ways, like a personal letter.  "The greatest difference between a blog and a photocopied school newsletter, or an annual family letter photocopied and mailed to a hundred friends, is the potential audience and the increased potential for direct communication between audience members".&lt;ref name=Rettburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Rettberg|first=Jill Walker|title=Blogging|year=2008|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge UK; Malden, Massachusetts USA|isbn=978-0-7456-4133-1|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as with other forms of letter, the writer knows some of the readers, but one of the main differences is that "some of the audience will be random" and "that presumably changes the way we [writers] write."&lt;ref name=Rettburg /&gt; It has been argued that blogs owe a debt to Renaissance essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]], whose ''Essais'' ("attempts"), were published in 1580, because Montaigne "wrote as if he were chatting to his readers: just two friends, whiling away an afternoon in conversation".&lt;ref name=Bakewell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=What Bloggers Owe Montaigne|journal=The Paris Review|date=12 November 2010|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/11/12/what-bloggers-owe-montaigne/|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Columnist====
{{Main|Columnist}}
Columnists write regular pieces for newspapers and other periodicals, usually containing a lively and entertaining expression of opinion. Some columnists have had collections of their best work published as a collection in a book, so that readers can re-read what would otherwise be no longer available. Columns are quite short pieces of writing so columnists often write in other genres as well. An example is the columnist [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], who besides being a columnist, is also an architecture critic and author of books.

====Diarist====
{{Main|List of diarists}}
[[File:Anne Frank signature.svg|thumb|Signature of [[Anne Frank]]]]
Writers who record their experiences, thoughts or feelings in a sequential form over a period of time in a diary are known as diarists. Their writings can provide valuable insights into historical periods, specific events or individual personalities. Examples include [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703), an English administrator and Member of Parliament, whose detailed private diary provides eyewitness accounts of events during the 17th century, most notably of the [[Great Fire of London]]. [[Anne Frank]] (1929–1945) was a 13-year-old girl whose diary from 1942 to 1944 records both her experiences as a persecuted Jew in World War II and an adolescent dealing with intra-family relationships.

====Journalist====
{{Main|Journalism}}
Journalists write reports about current events after investigating them and gathering information. Some journalists write reports about predictable or scheduled events such as social or political meetings. Others are [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]] who need to undertake considerable research and analysis in order to write an explanation or account of something complex that was hitherto unknown or not understood. Often investigative journalists are reporting criminal or corrupt activity which puts them at risk personally and means that what it is likely that attempts may be made to attack or suppress what they write. An example is [[Bob Woodward]], a journalist who investigated and wrote about [[Watergate scandal|criminal activities by the US President]].
{{Quotation| ''Journalism ... is a public trust, a responsibility, to report the facts with context and completeness, to speak truth to power, to hold the feet of politicians and officials to the fire of exposure, to discomfort the comfortable, to comfort those who suffer.''&lt;br /&gt;Geoffrey Barker, journalist.&lt;ref name="Barker and de Brito"&gt;Barker and de Brito, controversially lamenting the preference for looks over experience in televised journalism. {{cite news|last=Geoffrey Barker|title=Switch off the TV babes for some real news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/switch-off-the-tv-babes-for-some-real-news-20130501-2it0o.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=May 2, 2013}} {{cite news|last=Sam de Brito|title=Reality's bite worse than Barker|url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/culture/blogs/all-men-are-liars/realitys-bite-worse-than-barker-20130502-2ivq8.html|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Memoirist====
{{Main|Memoir}}

Writers of memoirs produce accounts from the memories of their own lives, which are deemed unusual, important, or scandalous enough to be of interest to general readers. Although intended to be factual, readers are alerted to the likelihood of some inaccuracies or bias towards an idiosyncratic perception by the choice of genre. A memoir, for example, is allowed to have a much more selective set of experiences than an autobiography which is expected to be more complete and make a greater attempt at balance. Famous memoirists include [[Frances Vane, Viscountess Vane]], and [[Giacomo Casanova]].

====Ghostwriter====
{{Main|Ghostwriter}}
Ghostwriters write for, or in the style of, someone else so the credit goes to the person on whose behalf the writing is done.

====Letter writer====
[[File:Kusakabe Kimbei - Writing Letter (large).jpg|thumb|''Writing Letter''&lt;br /&gt;(Photograph by [[Kusakabe Kimbei]])]]

{{Main|Letter (message)}}
Writers of letters use a reliable form of transmission of messages between individuals, and surviving sets of letters provide insight into the motivations, cultural contexts, and events in the lives of their writers. [[Peter Abelard]] (1079–1142), philosopher, logician, and theologian is known not only for the heresy contained in some of his work, and the punishment of having to burn his own book, but also for the letters he wrote to [[Héloïse (abbess)|Héloïse d'Argenteuil]] {{nowrap|(1090?–1164)}}.&lt;ref&gt;For text see [[s:Letters of Abélard and Héloïse|Letters of Abélard and Héloïse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters (or [[epistle]]s) of [[Paul the Apostle]] were so influential that over the 2000 years of Christian history, Paul became "second only to Jesus in influence and the amount of discussion and interpretation generated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to St. Paul in the Middle Ages|year=2013|publisher=Koninklijke, Brill, NV|location=Leiden The Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-23672-1 |pages=1|editor=Steven R. Cartwright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul and the Legacies of Paul|year=1990|publisher=Southern Methodist University Press|location=Dallas|editor=William S. Babcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nla.ms-ms5393-2-s1.jpg|thumb|left|Water damaged unpublished autograph manuscript page of [[William Bligh|Bligh]]'s voyage in the launch of {{HMS|Bounty}}, from the ship to [[Tofua]] and from thence to [[Timor]] April 28 to June 14, 1789, after the ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny]]''. It contains notes used later as the basis for his report and all his subsequent narratives.]]

====Report writer====
{{Main|Report}}

Report writers are people who gather information, organise and document it so that it can be presented to some person or authority in a position to use it as the basis of a decision. Well-written reports influence policies as well as decisions. For example, [[Florence Nightingale]] (1820–1910) wrote reports that were intended to effect administrative reform in matters concerning health in the army. She documented her experience in the [[Crimean War]] and showed her determination to see improvements: "...after six months of incredible industry she had put together and written with her own hand her ''Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army.'' This extraordinary composition, filling more than eight hundred closely printed pages, laying down vast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest detail of a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of information of the most varied kinds – military, statistical, sanitary, architectural" became for a long time, the "leading authority on the medical administration of armies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachey|first=Lytton|title=[[Eminent Victorians]]|year=1918|publisher=Penguin Modern Classics|isbn=0-14-000649-4|pages=142–3|edition=1981|authorlink=Lytton Strachey|chapter=Florence Nightingale – 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nightingale|first=Florence|title=Notes on matters affecting the health, efficiency, and hospital administration of the British army : founded chiefly on the experience of the late war|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/notes-on-matters-affecting-the-health-efficiency-and-hospital-administration-of-the-british-army-founded-chiefly-on-the-experience-of-the-late-war/oclc/7660327|work=Adelaide Nutting historical nursing collection, AN 0054.|publisher=London : Harrison and Sons, 1858|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The logs and reports of [[Master mariner]] [[William Bligh]] contributed to his being honourably acquitted at the [[court-martial]] inquiring into the loss of {{HMS|Bounty}}.

====Scribe====
[[File:The Letter Writer.jpg|thumb|Scribe in India taking instructions from a client]]
{{Main|Scribe}}

A scribe writes ideas and information on behalf of another, sometimes copying from another document, sometimes from oral instruction on behalf of an illiterate person, sometimes transcribing from another medium such as a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recording]], [[shorthand]], or personal notes.

Being able to write was a rare achievement for over 500 years in Western Europe so monks who copied texts were scribes responsible for saving many texts from classical times. The monasteries, where monks who knew how to read and write lived, provided an environment stable enough for writing. Irish monks, for example, came to Europe in about 600 and "found manuscripts in places like [[Tours]] and [[Toulouse]]" which they copied.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Kenneth|title=Civilisation|year=1969|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=0-14-016589-4|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monastic writers also illustrated their books with highly skilled art work using gold and rare colours.

====Technical writer====
{{Main|Technical writer}}

A technical writer prepares instructions or manuals, such as [[user guide]]s or [[owner's manual]]s for users of equipment to follow. Technical writers also write various procedures for business, professional or domestic use. Since the purpose of technical writing is practical rather than creative, its most important quality is clarity. The technical writer, unlike the creative writer, is required to adhere to the relevant [[style guide]].

==Process and methods==

===Writing process===
[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s horror at his manuscript burning]]
{{main|Writing process}}
There is a range of approaches that writers take to the task of writing. Each writer needs to find their own process and most describe it as more or less a struggle.&lt;ref name=Older&gt;{{cite news|last1=Older|first1=Daniel José|title=Writing Begins With Forgiveness: Why One of the Most Common Pieces of Writing Advice Is Wrong|url=http://sevenscribes.com/writing-begins-with-forgiveness-why-one-of-the-most-common-pieces-of-writing-advice-is-wrong/|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes writers have had the bad fortune to lose their work and have had to start again. Before the invention of [[photocopier]]s and electronic text storage, a writer's work had to be stored on paper, which meant it was very susceptible to fire in particular. (In very early times, writers used [[vellum]] and clay which were more robust materials.) Writers whose work was destroyed before completion include [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the inventor of [[Esperanto]], whose years of work were thrown into the fire by his father because he was afraid that "his son would be thought a spy working code".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Mother Tongue&amp;nbsp;– The English Language|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-014305-8|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Essayist and historian [[Thomas Carlyle]], lost the only copy of a manuscript for ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' when it was mistakenly thrown into the fire by a maid. He wrote it again from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles William, Ed. "Introductory Note" in ''The Harvard Classics'', Vol. XXV, Part 3. New York: P.F. Collier &amp; Son, 1909–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers usually develop a personal schedule. [[Angus Wilson]], for example, wrote for a number of hours every morning.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Angus|title=Interview with Angus Wilson|journal=The Paris Review|year=1957|issue=Autumn-Winter No.17|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4848/the-art-of-fiction-no-20-angus-wilson|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writer's block]] is a relatively common experience among writers, especially professional writers, when for a period of time the writer feels unable to write for reasons other than lack of skill or commitment.

{{Quotation|''Happy are they who don't doubt themselves and whose pens fly across the page''&lt;br /&gt;[[Gustave Flaubert]] writing to [[Louise Colet]]&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Plate caption to an image of a much-corrected page of [[Madame Bovary]] in the Bibliothèque Municipale de Rouen. In {{cite book|last=Brown|first=Frederick|title=Flaubert: a biography|year=2006|publisher=Little, Brown and Co|location=New York|isbn=9780316118781}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Leonid Pasternak - The Passion of creation.jpg|thumb|left|''Throes of Creation'' by [[Leonid Pasternak]] ]]

====Sole====
Most writers write alone – typically they are engaged in a solitary activity that requires them to struggle with both the concepts they are trying to express and the best way to express it. This may mean choosing the best genre or genres as well as choosing the best words. Writers often develop idiosyncratic solutions to the problem of finding the right words to put on a blank page or screen. "Didn't [[W. Somerset Maugham|Somerset Maugham]] also write facing a blank wall? ... [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] couldn't write a line if there was another person anywhere in the same house, or so he said at some point."&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Ted Hughes|Hughes]]|first=Ted|title=Ted Hughes: The Art of Poetry No. 71|journal=The Paris Review|year=1995|volume=Spring|issue= 134|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1669/the-art-of-poetry-no-71-ted-hughes|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborative====
Collaborative writing means that multiple authors write and contribute to a piece of writing. In this approach, it is highly likely the writers will collaborate on editing the piece too. The more usual process is that the editing is done by an independent editor after the writer submits a draft version.

In some cases, such as that between a librettist and composer, a writer will collaborate with another artist on a creative work. One of the best known of these types of collaborations is that between [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. Librettist [[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote the words for the [[comic opera]]s created by the partnership.

====Committee====
Occasionally, a writing task is given to a committee of writers. The most famous example is the task of translating the Bible into English, sponsored by King [[James VI and I|James VI]] of England in 1604 and accomplished by six committees, some in [[Cambridge]] and some in [[Oxford]], who were allocated different sections of the text. The resulting [[King James Version|Authorized King James Version]], published in 1611, has been described as an "everlasting miracle" because its writers (that is, its Translators) sought to "hold themselves consciously poised between the claims of accessibility and beauty, plainness and richness, simplicity and majesty, the people and the king", with the result that the language communicates itself "in a way which is quite unaffected, neither literary nor academic, not historical, nor reconstructionist, but transmitting a nearly incredible immediacy from one end of human civilisation to another."&lt;ref name=Nicolson2&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Adam|title=When God Spoke English: The Making of the King James Bible|year=2011|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-743100-7}}(p.240, 243)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multimedia====
[[File:William Blake Nurses Song Copy Z 1826.jpg|thumb|[[William Blake]] "[[Nurse's Song]]" from ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'']]
Some writers support the verbal part of their work with images or graphics that are an integral part of the way their ideas are communicated. [[William Blake]] is one of rare poets who created his own paintings and drawings as integral parts of works such as his ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]''. [[Cartoonist]]s are writers whose work depends heavily on hand drawn imagery. Other writers, especially writers for children, incorporate painting or drawing in more or less sophisticated ways. [[Shaun Tan]], for example, is a writer who uses imagery extensively, sometimes combining fact, fiction and illustration, sometimes for a didactic purpose, sometimes on commission.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Shaun|title=The Oopsatoreum|year=2012|publisher=Powerhouse Publishing|location=Sydney|isbn=9781863171441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's writers [[Beatrix Potter]], [[May Gibbs]], and [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Seuss Geisel]] are as well known for their illustrations as for their texts.

====Crowd sourced====
{{main|Crowdsourcing}}
Some writers contribute very small sections to a piece of writing that cumulates as a result. This method is particularly suited to very large works, such as dictionaries and encyclopaedias. The best known example of the former is the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', under the editorship of lexicographer [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], who was provided with the prolific and helpful contributions of [[William Chester Minor|W.C. Minor]], at the time an inmate of a hospital for the criminally insane.&lt;ref name=Crowthorne&gt;{{cite book|last=Winchester|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Winchester|title=[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne: a tale of murder, madness and the love of words]]|year=1998|publisher=Viking|location=London|isbn=0670878626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known example of the latter – an encyclopaedia that is crowdsourced – is Wikipedia which relies on the contributions of thousands of volunteer writers and editors worldwide, such as [[Simon Pulsifer]].&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite web|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Simon Pulsifer: The Duke of Data|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570732,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=16 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations===
Writers have many different reasons for writing, among which is usually some combination of self-expression&lt;ref name=Styron&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton|title=William Styron, The Art of Fiction No. 5|url= http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5114/the-art-of-fiction-no-5-william-styron|journal=The Paris Review|year=1954|issue=Spring|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recording facts, history or research results. The many [[physician writer]]s, for example, have combined their observation and knowledge of the [[human condition]] with their desire to write and contributed many poems, plays, translations, essays and other texts. Some writers write extensively on their motivation and on the likely motivations of other writers. For example, [[George Orwell]]'s essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946) takes this as its subject. As to "what constitutes success or failure to a writer", it has been described as "a complicated business, where the material rubs up against the spiritual, and psychology plays a big part".&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Jane|title=JK Rowling on turning failure into success|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/jk-rowling-on-turning-failure-into-success-20141219-129vm6.html|accessdate=27 December 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''The moral I draw is that the writer should seek his reward in the pleasure of his work and in release from the burden of this thoughts; and, indifferent to aught else, care nothing for praise or censure, failure or success.''&lt;br /&gt;[[W. Somerset Maugham]] in ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' (1919)&lt;ref name=Maugham&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maugham|first1=Somerset|title=The Moon and Sixpence|date=1999|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099284765|page=8|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Command====
Some writers are the authors of specific military orders whose clarity will determine the outcome of a battle. Among the most controversial and unsuccessful was [[FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]'s order at the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], which being vague and misinterpreted, led to defeat with many casualties.

====Develop skill/explore ideas====
Some writers use the writing task to develop their own skill (in writing itself or in another area of knowledge) or explore an idea while they are producing a piece of writing. [[Philology|Philologist]] [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], for example, created a new language for his fantasy books.

{{Quotation| ''For me the private act of poetry writing is songwriting, confessional, diary-keeping, speculation, problem-solving, storytelling, therapy, anger management, craftsmanship, relaxation, concentration and spiritual adventure all in one inexpensive package.''&lt;br /&gt;[[Stephen Fry]], author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, journalist&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Stephen|title=The Ode Less Travelled – Unlocking the Poet Within|year=2007|publisher=Arrow Books|isbn=978-0-09-950934-9|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Entertain====
Some genres are a particularly appropriate choice for writers whose chief purpose is to entertain. Among them are [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s, many comics and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]]. Writers of children's literature seek to entertain children but are also usually mindful of the educative function of their work as well.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''I think that I shall never see''
''a billboard lovely as a tree;''
''Indeed, unless the billboards fall''
''I'll never see a tree at all.''

====Influence====
[[File:Ninety-Five Theses, Wittenberg.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' (at the All Saints' Church, [[Wittenburg]])]]
Anger has motivated many writers, including [[Martin Luther]], angry at religious corruption, who wrote the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' in 1517, to reform the church, and [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902) who wrote the public letter, ''[[J'accuse…!|J'Accuse]]'' in 1898 to bring public attention to government injustice, as a consequence of which he had to flee to England from his native France. Such writers have affected ideas, opinion or policy significantly.

Writers may write a particular piece for payment (even if at other times, they write for another reason), such as when they are commissioned to create a new work, transcribe an old one, translate another writer's work, or write for someone who is illiterate or inarticulate. In some cases, writing has been the only way an individual could earn an income. [[Frances Milton Trollope|Frances Trollope]] is an example of women who wrote to save herself and her family from penury, at a time when there were very few socially acceptable employment opportunities for them. Her book about her experiences in America, called ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' became a great success, "even though she was over fifty and had never written before in her life" after which "she continued to write hard, carrying this on almost entirely before breakfast".&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Katherine|title=Victorian Wives|year=1974|publisher=Allison &amp; Busby|location=London, New York|isbn=0-85031-634-0|pages=65–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her writer son [[Anthony Trollope]] "her books saved the family from ruin".&lt;ref name=Moore /&gt;

Tanner|chapter=Aristotle's Works: The Possible Origins of the Alexandria Collection|editor=Roy MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[dialogue]]s also appear to have been written either "as lecture notes or discussion papers for use in his philosophy school at the Athens [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] between 334 and 323 BC."&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt; They encompass both his 'scientific' writings ([[metaphysics]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[meteorology]], and [[astronomy]], as well as [[logic]] and [[argument]]) the 'non-scientific' works (poetry, [[Public speaking|oratory]], ethics, and politics), and "major elements in traditional [[Classical Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] education".&lt;ref name= MacLeod /&gt;

Writers of [[textbook]]s also use writing to teach and there are numerous instructional guides to writing itself. For example, many people will find it necessary to make a speech "in the service of your company, church, civic club, political party, or other organization" and so, instructional writers have produced texts and guides for speechmaking.&lt;ref name=Dowis&gt;{{cite book|last=Dowis|first=Richard|title=The Lost Art of the Great Speech: How to Write One : How to Deliver It|year=2000|publisher=AMA publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8144-7054-8|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tell a story====
Many writers use their skill to tell the story of their people, community or cultural tradition, especially one with a personal significance. Examples include [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]]; [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]]; [[Doris Lessing]]; [[Toni Morrison]]; [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]; and [[Patrick White]].
Writers such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Herta Müller]], and [[Erich Maria Remarque]] write about the effect of conflict, dispossession and war.

====Woo a lover====
Writers use prose, poetry, and letters as part of courtship rituals.  [[Edmond Rostand]]'s play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', written in verse, is about both the power of love and the power of the self-doubting writer/hero's writing talent.

==Authorship==
[[File:Autographe de Marianne Alcoforado (Maria Anna Alcoforada), comme écrivain du couvent de Béja.jpg|thumb|Signature of [[Mariana Alcoforado]] (Maria Anna Alcoforada), once thought to be the writer of the [[Epistolary novel|epistolary fiction]], ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]''. ]]

===Pen names===
Writers sometimes use a pseudonym, otherwise known as a pen name or "nom de plume". The reasons they do this include to separate their writing from other work (or other types of writing) for which they are known; to enhance the possibility of publication by reducing prejudice (such as against women writers or writers of a particular ethnicity); to reduce personal risk (such as political risks from individuals, groups or states that disagree with them); or to make their name better suit another language.

Examples of well-known writers who used a pen name include: [[George Eliot]] (1819–1880), whose real name was Mary Anne (or Marian) Evans; [[George Orwell]] (1903–1950), whose real name was Eric Blair; [[George Sand]] (1804–1876), whose real name was Lucile Aurore Dupin; [[Dr. Seuss]] (1904–1991), whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel; Stendhal (1783–1842), whose real name was Marie-Henri Beyle and [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910), whose real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens.

Apart from the large numbers of works attributable only to "Anonymous", there are a large number of writers who were once known and are now unknown. Efforts are made to find and re-publish these writers' works. One example is the publication of books like ''Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers'' (a 2010 reproduction of a pre-1923 publication) by "Anonymous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anonymous|title=Japan As Seen and Described by Famous Writers (published pre-1923)|year=2010 |publisher=BiblioLife|isbn=9781142479084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the founding of a Library and Study Centre for the Study of Early English Women's Writing in Chawton, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chawton.org/ Chawton House Library | Home to early English women's writing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional writers===
Some fictional writers are very well known because of the strength of their characterization by the real writer or the significance of their role as writer in the plot of a work. Examples of this type of fictional writer include Edward Casaubon, a fictional scholar in George Eliot's ''[[Middlemarch]]'', and Edwin Reardon, a fictional writer in [[George Gissing]]'s ''[[New Grub Street]]''. Casaubon's efforts to complete an authoritative study affect the decisions taken by the protagonists in Eliot's novel and drive significant parts of the plot. In Gissing's work, Reardon's efforts to produce high quality writing put him in conflict with another character, who takes a more commercial approach. [[Robinson Crusoe]] is a fictional writer who was originally credited by the real writer ([[Daniel Defoe]]) as being the author of the confessional letters in the work of the same name. [[Bridget Jones]] is a comparable fictional diarist created by writer [[Helen Fielding]]. Both works became famous and popular; their protagonists and story were developed further through many adaptations, including film versions. [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] was a real writer who created a fictional character with his own name. The ''[[Sibylline Books]]'', a collection of prophecies were supposed to have been purchased from the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] by the last king of Rome. Since they were consulted during periods of crisis, it could be said that they are a case of real works created by a fictional writer.

===Writers of sacred texts===

[[Religious text]]s or scriptures are the texts which various religious traditions consider to be [[sacred]], or of central importance to their religious tradition. Some religions and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movements believe that their sacred texts are [[divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[revelation|revealed or inspired]], while others have individual authors.

==Controversial writing==

Skilled writers influence ideas and society, so there are many instances where a writer's work or opinion has been unwelcome and controversial. In some cases, they have been persecuted or punished. Aware that their writing will cause controversy or put themselves and others into danger, some writers self-censor; or withhold their work from publication; or hide their manuscripts; or use some other technique to preserve and protect their work. Two of the most famous examples are [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Leonardo "had the habit of conversing with himself in his writings and of putting his thoughts into the clearest and most simple form". He used "left-handed or mirror writing" (a technique described as "so characteristic of him") to protect his scientific research from other readers.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite book|title="Leonardo's Manuscripts" in Leonardo de Vinci|publisher=Reynal and Company, in association with William Morris and Company|location=New York|pages=157|edition=Authoritative work, published in Italy by Istituto Geografico De Agostini, in conjunction with exhibition of Leonardo's work in Milan in 1938 (re-edited English translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of persecution, social disgrace, and being proved incorrect are regarded as contributing factors to Darwin's delaying the publication of his radical and influential work ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.

One of the results of controversies caused by a writer's work is scandal, which is a negative public reaction that causes damage to reputation and depends on public outrage. It has been said that it is possible to scandalise the public because the public "wants to be shocked in order to confirm its own sense of virtue".&lt;ref name="Wilson &amp; Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Scandal!: An Explosive Exposé of the Affairs, Corruption and Power Struggles of the Rich and Famous|year=2011|publisher=Random House|author2=Damon Wilson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal may be caused by what the writer wrote or by the style in which it was written. In either case, the content or the style is likely to have broken with tradition or expectation. Making such a departure may in fact, be part of the writer's intention or at least, part of the result of introducing innovations into the genre in which they are working. For example, novelist [[D H Lawrence]] challenged ideas of what was acceptable as well as what was expected in form. These may be regarded as literary scandals, just as, in a different way, are the scandals involving writers who mislead the public about their identity, such as [[Norma Khouri]] or [[Helen Darville]] who, in deceiving the public, are considered to have committed fraud.

Writers may also cause the more usual type of scandal – whereby the public is outraged by the opinions, behaviour or life of the individual (an experience not limited to writers). Poet [[Paul Verlaine]] outraged society with his behaviour and treatment of his wife and child as well as his lover. Among the many writers whose writing or life was affected by scandals are [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Albert Camus]], and [[H. G. Wells]]. One of the most famously scandalous writers was the [[Marquis de Sade]] who offended the public both by his writings ''and'' by his behaviour.

===Punishment===
[[File:Tyndale-martyrdom.png|thumb|Engraving depicting the death of [[William Tyndale]]]]
The consequence of scandal for a writer may be censorship or discrediting of the work, or social ostracism of its creator. In some instances, punishment, persecution, or prison follow. The [[list of journalists killed in Russia]] is an example. Others include:
* The [[Balibo Five]], a group of Australian television journalists who were killed while attempting to report on Indonesian incursions into [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1975.
* [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (1906–1945), an influential theologian who wrote ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'' and was hanged for his resistance to [[Nazism]].
* [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937), who wrote political theory and criticism and was imprisoned for this by the Italian Fascist regime.
* [[Günter Grass]] (1927–2015), whose poem "[[What Must Be Said]]" led to his being declared ''[[persona non grata]]''  in [[Israel]].
* [[Peter Greste]] (born 1965), a journalist who was imprisoned in Egypt for news reporting which was "damaging to national security."&lt;ref name=bbc-crisis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25546389 |title=Egypt crisis: Al-Jazeera journalists arrested in Cairo |work=BBC News |date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Primo Levi]] (1919–1987) who, among many Jews imprisoned during World War II, wrote an account of his incarceration called ''[[If This Is a Man]]''.
* [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), who was sentenced to imprisonment for [[heresy]] as a consequence of writing in support of the then controversial theory of [[heliocentrism]], although the sentence was almost immediately commuted to [[house arrest]].
* [[Sima Qian]] (145 or 135 BC – 86 BC) who "successfully defended a vilified master from defamatory charges" and was given "the choice between [[castration]] or execution." He "became a eunuch and had to bury his own book ... in order to protect it from the authorities."&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book|last=Battles|first=Matthew|title=Library – An Unquiet History|year=2003|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0-434-00887-7}}p40&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Salman Rushdie]] (born 1947), whose novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' was banned and burned internationally after causing [[The Satanic Verses controversy|such a worldwide storm]] that a [[Fatwa|fatwā]] was issued against him. Though Rushdie survived, numerous others were killed in incidents connected to the novel.
* [[Roberto Saviano]] (born 1979), whose best-selling book ''[[Gomorrah (book)|Gomorrah]]'' provoked the Neapolitan [[Camorra]], annoyed [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and led to him receiving permanent police protection.
* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] (1918–2008), who used his experience of imprisonment as the subject of his writing in ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' and ''[[Cancer Ward]]''—the latter, while legally published in the Soviet Union, had to gain the approval of the [[Union of Soviet Writers|USSR Union of Writers]].
* [[William Tyndale]] ({{Circa|1494}} – 1536), who was executed because he translated the Bible into English.
* [[Simon Sheppard (activist)|Simon Sheppard]] (born 1957) who was imprisoned in the UK for expressing controversial opinions on race and the Holocaust.

==Protection and representation==
The organisation [[Reporters Without Borders]] (also known by its French name: Reporters Sans Frontières) was set up to help protect writers and advocate on their behalf.

The professional and industrial interests of writers are represented by various national or regional guilds or unions. Examples include writers guilds in [[Australian Writers' Guild|Australia]] and [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and unions in [[Arab Writers Union|Arabia]], [[Writers Union of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Union of Azerbaijani Writers|Azerbaijan]], [[Writers' Union of Canada|Canada]], [[Estonian Writers' Union|Estonia]], [[Hungarian Writers' Union|Hungary]], [[Irish Writers' Union|Ireland]], [[Moldovan Writers' Union|Moldova]], [[Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas|Philippines]], [[Polish Writers' Union|Poland]], [[Union des écrivaines et des écrivains québécois|Québéc]], [[Writers' Union of Romania|Romania]], [[Union of Russian Writers|Russia]], [[Sudanese Writers Union|Sudan]], and the [[Writer's Union of Ukraine|Ukraine]]. In the United States, there is both a [[Writers Guild of America|writers guild]] and a [[National Writers Union]].

==Awards==
[[File:Tomas Transtromer and Modhir Ahmed.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] Swedish winning poet and translator [[Tomas Tranströmer]] signs a book about his work by [[Modhir Ahmed]] (2007)]]
There are many awards for writers whose writing has been adjudged excellent. Among them are the many [[literary award]]s given by individual countries, such as the [[Prix Goncourt]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]], as well as international awards such as the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Russian writer [[Boris Pasternak]] (1890–1960), under pressure from his government, reluctantly declined the Nobel Prize that he won in 1958.
