===Marvel Comics===

Adam Kubert is known for his work at Marvel Comics. From 1993 to 1996 he illustrated 17 issues of writer [[Larry Hama]]'s run on ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' between issues #75 to 102. His first issue on the series featured the after affects of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] removing the [[adamantium]] from Wolverine's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 265|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In ''Wolverine'' #75, Wolverine was left a shell of his former self, barely surviving Magneto's attack...thanks to writer Larry Hama and penciller Adam Kubert.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubert drew the ''Weapon X'' limited series as part of the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he drew the ''[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught: X-Men]]'' and ''Onslaught: Marvel Universe'' one-shots which lead into the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" crossover.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: "Onslaught truly rose to power in the ''Onslaught: X-Men'' special by writers Mark Waid and Scott Lobdell and artist Adam Kubert."&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 1998 he illustrated 12 issues of [[Peter David]]'s run on ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' from #454 to 467, as well as the -1 issue (July 1997). From late 1998 to early 1999 Kubert drew ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' #81 - 84, on which he was teamed up with European colorist [[Richard Isanove]], who subsequently followed Kubert to ''Ultimate X-Men'', employing the pencils-to-color approach seen on most of ''Ultimate X-Men'' covers.

In 2001, Kubert drew the new ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' title,&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 304: "Looking to repeat the success of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' in 2000, the second major title of this alternate universe was crafted by esteemed writer Mark Millar along with the famed Kubert brothers, Andy and Adam, taking turns at the drawing table."&lt;/ref&gt; penciling the first four issues, and then illustrating 16 various issues beginning with #7, before leaving the title with issue #33 (July 2003). In 2004, he began a run on ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'', once again with writers Mark Millar and [[Brian Michael Bendis]],&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 320: "Ultimate veterans Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, and Adam Kubert reexamined Marvel's first family, creating this alternate version of the Fantastic Four."&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating that series' first six issues, and then issues 13-18.

===DC Comics===
Both Adam and his brother Andy signed exclusive contracts with DC Comics in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/comicbooknews027.html|title= Artists Adam and Andy Kubert Sign 3-Year Exclusive Agreements With DC Comics|date= June 6, 2005|publisher= Comic Book Bin|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140111060533/http://www.comicbookbin.com/comicbooknews027.html|archivedate= January 11, 2014|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14947|title= Lying In The Gutters|first= Rich|last= Johnston|authorlink = Rich Johnston|date= June 7, 2005|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120728184934/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14947|archivedate= July 28, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|quote= The Kubert Brothers' exclusive deal with DC Comics was announced at the weekend.

Further delay forced DC Comics to bring in substitute creative teams and delay the fourth part of the "Last Son" storyline and the [[Stereoscopy|3D issue]] to #851, which was released in early July 2007. The final part of the storyline was in ''Action Comics Annual'' #11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=108943|title= More ''Action Comics'' Scheduling Woes|first= Matt|last= Brady|date= April 15, 2007|publisher= Newsarama|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121738/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=108943|archivedate= September 29, 2007|deadurl= yes|df=mdy-all|accessdate= April 3, 2008|quote= A note to let everyone know that our "Last Son" finale has been moved to ''Action Comics Annual'' #11 to accommodate Adam [Kubert]'s schedule and allow us to continue on with our ''Action Comics'' run.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his work on Superman he penciled the "[[Final Crisis]]" tie-in, ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament'', written by [[Brad Meltzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16693|title= Meltzer Bridges ''Final Crisis'' with ''Last Will and Testament'|first= Jeffrey|last= Renaud|date= June 4, 2008|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121006203545/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16693|archivedate= October 6, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dougall|first2=Alastair, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 301|isbn= 978-1465424563|quote= Geo-Force, founding member of the Outsiders, starred in this one-shot special thanks to writer Brad Meltzer and artist Adam Kubert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last work for his latest tenure at DC was the ''Batman and The Outsiders Special,'' released in February 2009. This issue, written by [[Peter Tomasi]], highlighted [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s efforts to recruit a new team of Outsiders in the wake of [[Batman]]'s apparent death.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Dougall, p. 303: "In this one-shot scripted by new series writer Peter J. Tomasi and illustrated by Adam Kubert, Alfred Pennyworth assembled a new team of Outsiders."&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of the comic book, Kubert said he was pleased with his work at DC and had done, "what [he] set out to do," which was to draw Superman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/15933-adam-kubert-talks-batman-and-the-outsiders-nycc-2009.html |title=Adam Kubert Talks ''Batman and The Outsiders'' @ NYCC 2009 |year=2009 |publisher=Newsarama |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MYqN0T3X?url=http://www.newsarama.com/15933-adam-kubert-talks-batman-and-the-outsiders-nycc-2009.html |archivedate=January 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Marvel===
May 2009 marked Adam Kubert's return to Marvel, his first interior work being published as one of two stories in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #73 and 74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=1001|title= Review of ''Wolverine'' #73|first= Benjamin|last= Birdie|date= May 13, 2009|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121009013119/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=1001|archivedate= October 9, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}} Archive requires scrolldown&lt;/ref&gt; Following this he contributed several covers to ''[[New Mutants]]'' and ''Wolverine: Weapon X'', and penciled the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" tie in, ''The List: Amazing [[Spider-Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://marvel.com/comics/issue/27417/dark_reign_-_the_list_amazing_spider-man_one-shot_2009_1|title= ''Dark Reign - The List: Amazing Spider-Man'' One-Shot (2009) #1|date= November 18, 2009|publisher= Marvel Comics|accessdate= April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to penciling for Marvel, he continued to do some work for DC, contributing the stories for the ''[[Wednesday Comics]]'' "[[Sgt. Rock]]" feature, drawn by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 338: "The [series] contained fifteen continuous stories, including a new Sgt. Rock saga drawn by the legendary Joe Kubert and written by his son Adam."&lt;/ref&gt; He has since stated that he is Marvel-exclusive, but they are allowed him to work on the "Sgt. Rock" feature as he had signed on to do it before his contract at DC had expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22150|title= ''Wednesday Comics'': The Kuberts|first= Jeffrey|last= Renaud|date= July 22, 2009|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140111071217/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22150|archivedate= January 11, 2014|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|quote= This was just an exception.

He then drew issues #4–6 of [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s run on ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]''.

The painting '''''Ahasveros and Haman at the Feast of Esther''''' is one of the few works of [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] whose complete [[provenance]] is known.  The origin of the painting can be traced back to 1662, two years after its completion. {{cquote|''There are only three figures in the picture and the banquet is suggested sketchily. Esther lowers her arms apprehensively as she finishes her speech, the king's lips are pursed in anger, and Haman's pose reveals a sense of doom. The distance between the king and his vizier seems enormous, while the king and queen form a united pair.&lt;ref&gt;Tyazehlov, V. N. (2008) The Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Room 10, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subject==
The subject is an episode from chapters 5-7 of the [[book of Esther]] in the [[Old Testament]].  [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]], counciller to the king [[Ahasuerus]], proposed to hang [[Mordechai]] for not paying him respect by standing as he entered the room or by greeting him, and the entire Jewish nation as revenge for their pride. The Jews were saved by the intercession of Mordechai's cousin [[Esther]], who was also Ahasuerus' wife.  It is this rescue that is still celebrated in the Jewish festival of [[Purim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Webberley |first=Helen |work=Rembrandt and The Purim Story |publisher=Jewishmag.com |date= February 2008 |url=http://www.jewishmag.com/121mag/rembrandt-purim-art/rembrandt-purim-art.htm |title=The Purim Story and the Dutch Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that festival, Haman is portrayed as the villain, and this is reflected in Rembrandt's depiction of him.

According to the [[Pushkin Museum]] this is one of the best creations of Rembrandt's late period.

{{cquote|''The dramatic conflict between the three persons is expressed through their restrained but eloquent gestures. The scene has a tense atmosphere of suspense. The figure of Esther is radiant, her robe with a long train is gleaming as if with precious stones. Haman is immersed in the shadows. Rembrandt achieves great depth in rendering the inner life, the spiritual energy of his characters.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ru/gmii/defengl.htm The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024125053/http://www.museum.ru/gmii/defengl.htm |date=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Rembrandt==
Rembrandt was inspired by the play ''Hester'', by Johannes Serwouters (1623-1677), when painting "Ahasuerus and Haman at the feast of Esther".  The [[playwright]] was first performed in 1659 in the [[Schouwburg of Van Campen]] and dedicated to Leonore Huydecoper, the daughter of [[Joan Huydecoper I|Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, {{ISBN|0-500-09331-8}}, p. 112; Schwartz, G. (1987) Rembrandt, zijn leven, zijn schilderijen. Een nieuwe biografie met alle beschikbare schilderijen in kleur afgebeeld, p. 272-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Serwouters wrote his play as a reaction to the [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe. Her husband may have ordered the painting, in this way helping Rembrandt being in financial difficulties.

After its completion in 1660, [[Rembrandt]] sold the painting ''Ahasuerus and Haman at the feast of Esther'' to [[Jan J. Hinlopen]].&lt;ref&gt;Dudok van Heel, S.A.C. (1969) De Rembrandt's in de verzamelingen Hinlopen. In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, pp. 233-237. (In Dutch.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the year 1662 a poetry book by [[Jan Vos (poet)|Jan Vos]] was published, in which there were a number of poems based on the paintings belonging to Jan J. Hinlopen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vos |first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vos (poet) |title=Alle de gedichten van Jan Vos |publisher= |year=1726 |location= |pages=360–63, 388, 516, 536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVM_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |id= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jan Vos describes the painting as following:

[[Image:Schouwbrug_van_campen1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Engravure of the Playhouse Van Campen in 1658 by [[Salomon Savery]]]]

::''Here one sees Haman eating with Ahasuerus and Esther.
::''But it is in vain; his breast is full of regret and pain.
::''He eats Esther's food; but deeper into her heart.
::''The king is mad with revenge and rage.
::''The wrath of a monarch...&lt;ref&gt;From: Slive, S. (1953) Rembrandt and his critics, 1630-1730, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Part of Jan Hinlopen's collection passed to his two daughters, this painting was one of them.
[[Sara Hinlopen]], the longest living of her family, died 89 years old, but without children.&lt;ref&gt;One of her in-laws mentioned in his diary she left a considerable amount of money ''being stingy''.  In: Het dagboek van J. Bicker Raye, bewerkt door F.M. Bijerinck &amp; M.G. de Boer, (1935), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of her belongings passed to Nicolaes [[Geelvinck]] and his three sisters. Unfortunately, her will does not mention any painting, most probably to avoid inheritance taxes.

In 1760 ''Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther'' was sold as number 45 at an auction, listed as coming from [[Nicolaes Geelvinck]], and organized after the death of [[Gerard Hoet]], a minor painter but important collector in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;Catalogus of naamlyst van schilderyen, met derzelver prysen, zedert ... 1752. tot ... 1768. ... openbaar verkogt. Dienende tot een vervolg ... op de ... cataloguen door Gerard Hoet ... / Uitgegeeven door Pieter Terwesten, 1770. pp. 220-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1764 the painting came to [[Catherine the Great]], most probably through the German entrepreneur [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]], in financial trouble after the [[Seven Years' War]]. After receiving 320 paintings at one time from  Gotzkowsky, the Russian [[Tsarina]] started the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].

Probably advised by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] the painting went in 1862 to the [[Museum Rumyantsev]] in Moscow. Since 1924  'Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther' can be seen in the [[Pushkin Museum]], also in Moscow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''All-over painting''' refers to the non-differential treatment of the surface of a work of two-dimensional art, for instance a painting. This concept is most popularly thought of as emerging in relation to the so-called "drip" paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]] and the "automatic writing" or "abstract calligraphy" of [[Mark Tobey]] in the 1950s, though the applicability of the term all-over painting would be wider than that. "All-over painting" is not a formal style of painting and the term does not represent an "[[art movement]]." Some painting under the heading [[color field]] painting displays the "all-over" painting style. Such a painting would fail to treat the top, for instance, differently from the bottom; the left than the right. Uniform treatment of all sections of the surface are the hallmark of all-over painting. All-over paintings would lack a dominant point of interest, or any indication of which way is "up." Some paintings by [[Cy Twombly]] have had this term applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-alloverpainting.html |title=all-over painting Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about all-over painting |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007141533/http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting |date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprofessor.com/art-movements/all-over-painting.php |title=All-over Painting |publisher=Artprofessor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |title=ArtLex's Al-Am page |publisher=Artlex.com |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2012-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705050409/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/library/00/0019/t001940.asp |title=Directory of Art Services and Resources |publisher=artnet |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''art colony''' or '''artists' colony''' is a place where creative practitioners live and interact with one another. Artists are often invited or selected through a formal process, for a residency from a few weeks to over a year. Beginning with the early 20th century models, such as [[MacDowell Colony]] and [[Yaddo]], hundreds of modern-day artist colonies now offer the benefit of time, space, and collaborative time away from the usual workaday world. Worldwide, the two primary organizations serving artist colonies and residential centres are [[Res Artis]], based in [[Amsterdam]], and the Alliance of Artists Communities, based in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The [[Intra Asia Network]], based in [[Taiwan]], is a less formal body working to advance creative communities and exchanges throughout [[Asia]]. These consortia comprise most of the world's active artists' colonies.

The art movement itself has only started to be investigated by scholars, with the chief historical studies consisting of Michael Jacobs's introductory ''The Good and Simple Life''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacobs, Michael|title=The Good and Simple Life: Artist Colonies in Europe and America|publisher=Phaedon|year=1985|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nina Lübbren's ''Artists’ Colonies in Europe 1870-1910''.&lt;ref name="Lubbren"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lübbren, Nina|title=Rural Artists' Colonies in Europe 1870-1910|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2001|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formative period in Europe==
Art colonies initially emerged as village movements in the 19th and early 20th century. It is estimated that between 1830 and 1914 some 3000 professional artists participated in a mass movement away from urban centres into the countryside, residing for varying lengths of time in over 80 communities. There seem to have been three chief forms of these settlements, consisting of

*villages with transient and annually fluctuating populations of artists—mostly painters who visited for just a single summer season (such as Honfleur, Giverny, Katwijk, Frauenchiemsee, Volendam and Willingshausen);
*villages with a semi-permanent mix of visiting and resident artists (Ahrenshoop, Barbizon, Concarneau, [[Dachau art colony|Dachau]], St Ives, Laren, and Skagen); and
*villages in which a largely stable group of artists decided to settle permanently (Egmond, Sint-Martens-Latem, Newlyn and [[Worpswede#Artistic community|Worpswede]]).

In the latter villages, artists invariably bought or built their own houses and studios.

While artist colonies appeared across Europe, as well as in America and Australia, Lübbren has found that the majority of colonies were clustered in the Netherlands, Central Germany, and France (encircling Paris). Overall, artists of 35 different nationalities were represented throughout these colonies, with Americans, Germans and British forming the largest participating groups. This gave socialising a cosmopolitan flavour: 'Russia, Sweden, England, Austria, Germany, France, Australia and the United States were represented at our table, all as one large family, and striving towards the same goal,' the painter Annie Goater penned in 1885 in an essay on her recent experiences at one French colony. Villages can also be classified according to the nationalities they attracted. Barbizon, Pont-Aven, Giverny, Katwijk, Newlyn and Dachau drew artists from around the world and had a pronounced international flavour. Americans were always a major presence at Rijsoord, Egmond, Grèz-sur-Loing, Laren and St Ives; Grèz-sur-Loing went through a Scandinavian phase in the 1880s; and Germans were the largest group after the indigenous Dutch at Katwijk. On the other hand, foreigners were rare at [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Tervuren]], [[Nagybanya]], [[Kronberg]], [[Staithes]], [[Worpswede]] and [[Willingshausen]] while [[Skagen]] hosted mainly Danes and a few other Scandinavians.&lt;ref name="Lubbren"/&gt;

Some painters were renowned within artistic circles for settling down permanently in a single village, most notably [[Jean-François Millet]] at Barbizon, [[Robert Wylie]] at Pont-Aven, [[Otto Modersohn]] at Worpswede, [[Heinrich Otto]] at Willinghausen, and [[Claude Monet]] at Giverny. They were not necessarily leaders, although these artists were respected and held a certain [[moral authority]] in their respective colonies. There were also regular 'colony hoppers' who moved about the art colonies of Europe in a nomadic fashion. [[Max Liebermann]], for instance, painted at Barbizon, Dachau, Etzenhausen and at least six short-lived Dutch colonies; [[Frederick Waugh]] worked in Barbizon, Concarneau, Grèz-sur-Loing, St Ives and Provincetown in the United States; [[Evert Pieters]] was active at Barbizon, Egmond, Katwijk, Laren, Blaricum, Volendam and Oosterbeek; [[Elizabeth Armstrong Forbes]] painted at Pont-Aven, Zandvoort, Newlyn and St Ives.&lt;ref name="Lubbren"/&gt;

The greater number of early European art colonies were to be casualties of the First World War. Europe was no longer the same place socially, politically, economically and culturally, and art colonies seemed a quaint anachronism in an abrasively modernist world. However, a small proportion did endure in one or another form, and owe their continuing existence to cultural tourism. The colonies of Ahrenshoop, Barbizon, Fischerhude, Katwijk, Laren, Sint-Martens-Latem, Skagen, Volendam, Willingshausen and Worpswede not only still operate in a modest fashion, but run their own museums where, besides maintaining historic collections of work produced at the colony, they organise exhibition and lecture programs. If they have not fared as well, several formerly major colonies such as Concarneau and Newlyn are remembered via small yet significant collections of pictures held in regional museums. Other colonies succumbed during the late 20th century to cultural entrepreneurs who have redeveloped villages in the effort to simulate, within certain kitsch parameters, the 'authentic' appearance of the colony during its artistic heyday. This is not always successful, with Giverny, Grèz-sur-Loing, Kronberg, Le Pouldu, Pont-Aven, Schwaan and Tervuren probably being among the most insensitively commercialised of the former art colonies.&lt;ref name="Lubbren"/&gt;

==American colonies==
Some art colonies are organized and planned, while others arise because some artists like to congregate, finding fellowship and inspiration—and constructive competition—in the company of other artists.

The [[American Academy in Rome]], founded in 1894 originally as the American School of Architecture, which in the following year joined with the [[American School of Classical Studies]], is often cited as the early model for what would become the modern arts and humanities colony. Its well-funded, well-organized campus, and extensive program of fellowships, were soon replicated by early 20th-century artist colonies and their wealthy benefactors.

The [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]] art colony came into being when [[Charles Webster Hawthorne]] opened his Cape Cod School of Art there in the summer of 1899.&lt;ref name="iamprovincetown.com"&gt;[http://www.iamprovincetown.com/history/art-colony-history.html Provincetown History: The Art Colony, A Brief History]&lt;/ref&gt; Other noted artists arrived and expanded the colony. In 1914 the Provincetown Art Association was founded. Business and professional people from the community as well as established artists provided the initial leadership and by 1916, a ''Boston Globe'' headline read "Biggest Art Colony in the World at Provincetown." &lt;ref name="iamprovincetown.com"/&gt; Provincetown claims to be the oldest continuously operating artist's colony in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.provincetowntourismoffice.org/index.aspx?nid=75 Provincetown Tourism Office] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716065915/http://www.provincetowntourismoffice.org/index.aspx?nid=75 |date=July 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] Art Colony in Woodstock, New York began as two colonies: first [[Byrdcliffe Colony|Byrdcliffe]], founded in 1902 by [[Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead]], [[Hervey White]], and [[Bolton Brown]], and then the [[Maverick Concert Hall|Maverick]] Colony, founded by Hervey White after seceding from Byrdcliffe in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''The Maverick: Hervey White's Colony of the Arts'', exh. cat. Woodstock: Woodstock Artists Association and Museum, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Woodstock remains an active center of art galleries, music, and theatrical performances.

The high desert town of [[Sedona, Arizona]], became a Southwest artists' colony from the mid-20th century. Modernists [[Max Ernst]] and [[Dorothea Tanning]] arrived from New York in the late 1940s, when the town was populated by less than 500 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants, and small Native American communities. Among the Wild West setting, Ernst built a small cottage by hand in Brewer Road, and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists, and for Ernst—who compiled his book ''Beyond Painting'' and completed his sculptural masterpiece ''Capricorn'' while living there. The environment also inspired Egyptian sculptor Nassan Gobran to move there from Boston and become head of the art department at [[Verde Valley School]]. In Southern Arizona in the early and mid-twentieth century, the Historic [[Fort Lowell]] enclave outside of [[Tucson, Arizona]], became an artistic epicenter. The adobe ruins of the abandoned nineteenth century [[United States Cavalry]] fort had been adapted by [[Mexican-Americans]] into a small village called "El Fuerte." During the 1920s, 30s and 40s, artists, writers and intellectuals, attracted by the rural elegance and stark landscape of the [[Sonoran Desert]], and romanticism of the [[adobe]] ruins began buying, redesigning and building homes in this small community. Notable artists included Dutch-born artist [[Charles Bolsius]], [[Black Mountain College]] instructor and photographer [[Hazel Larson Archer]], architectural designer and painter [[Veronica Hughart]], early modernist [[Jack Maul]], French writers and artists [[René Cheruy]] and [[Germaine Cheruy]], and noted anthropologists [[Edward H. Spicer]] and [[Rosamond Spicer]].

The [[MacDowell Colony]] in Peterborough, N. H., was founded in 1907 by composer [[Edward MacDowell]] and his wife, [[Marian MacDowell|Marian]]. MacDowell was inspired by his knowledge of the American Academy in Rome, and its mission to provide American artists with a home base at the centre of classical traditions and primary sources. MacDowell, who was a trustee of the American Academy, believed that a rural setting, free from distractions, would prove to be creatively valuable to artists. He also believed that discussions among working artists, architects and composers would enrich their work.

In upstate New York on Lake George [[Golden Heart Farm]] art colony the summer residence of Thomas and [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] of the [[Art Students League]] of New York opened in the summer of 1921. The colony and artists in residence activity were at the center of the American modernist movement as important artists from Manhattan traveled to Golden Heart Farm to escape the city and study with the couple&lt;ref&gt;The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint Bernard Weber, {{ISBN|0-9851601-0-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Maryland, the Mid-Atlantic Plein Aire Company, most notable for the involvement of artist William David Simmons, is to this day active in its mission to bring local artists in touch with classical painting traditions.

Another famous colony, [[Yaddo]] in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., soon followed. [[Spencer Trask]] and his wife [[Katrina Trask]] conceived the idea of Yaddo in 1900, but the first residency program for artists did not formally initiate until 1926.

[[Ox-Bow School of Art and Artists' Residency]] was founded in 1910 by Frederick Fursman and Walter Marshall Clute, two faculty members from the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). Fursman and Clute's vision was to create a respite where faculty and students could immerse themselves completely in artmaking, surrounded by a supportive community of artists and an inspired landscape of natural dunes, woods and water. Ox-Bow is located in [[Saugatuck, Michigan]].

In [[Delray Beach, Florida]], a seasonal [[Delray Beach, Florida#Early years|Artists and Writers Colony]] existed during the winter months from the mid-1920s until the early 1950s. The Delray Beach enclave was noted for attracting many famous [[cartoonist]]s of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Credle-Rosenthal |first=McCall |date=2003 |title=Images of America: Delray Beach |url=http://www.arcadiapublishing.com |location=Charleston, South Carolina |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |pages=43–60 |isbn=978-0-7385-1570-0 |accessdate=2015-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sandy Simon|year=1999|title=Remembering: A History of Florida's South Palm Beach County 1894-1998|publisher=The Cedars Group|isbn= 0-9669625-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]]'s sister Norma created the [[Millay Colony for the Arts]] at the historic site of [[Steepletop]] in [[Austerlitz, NY]].

The [[Taos art colony]] in [[Taos, New Mexico]] is an example of more spontaneous development. Once artists began settling and working in Taos, others came, [[art gallery|art galleries and museums]] were opened and the area became an artistic center—though not a formal, funded art colony providing artists with aid, as Yaddo and MacDowell do.&lt;ref name="AAC"&gt;{{cite book

An influential art colony in [[New York (state)|New York]] was the [[Roycroft]] community. Nearby was the cabin of the Saturday Sketch Club used by Buffalo art students who specialized in outdoor oil painting.

[[Jerome, Arizona]] is a town of 400 people that was once a thriving copper mining town of 15,000. When the mines closed, Jerome became a ghost town in the 1950s. In the 1960s hippies discovered Jerome and settled there atop the Mingus Mountains, with a sweeping view of Sedona and the Verde Valley. Today, much of the population is working artists, writers, and musicians with a very eclectic mix of art galleries and working studios, open to the public.

The artists at [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]] coalesced in 1905 and incorporated their art gallery and meeting rooms a year later as the Carmel Arts and Crafts Club. They staged annual and special exhibitions, which attracted distinguished visiting artists from across the country, and provided professional instruction in painting, sculpture, and crafts. At the urging of his former student [[Jennie V. Cannon]], [[William Merritt Chase]] was persuaded to teach his last summer school here in 1914. Between 1919 and ca.1948 it was the largest art colony on the Pacific Coast of the United States. In 1927 the Carmel Art Association replaced the Arts and Crafts Club and thrives today as the nexus of for the art community on the Peninsula of [[Monterey, California]] and [[Big Sur]]. The Carmel Art Institute was established in 1938 and included among its illustrious instructors [[Armin Hansen]] and [[Paul Dougherty]].&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V.

==Eastern European colonies in the 20th and 21st century==
&lt;!-- This does not belong in artists collective as they run as colonies not collectives --&gt;
Many art colonies continue across Eastern Europe in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia. They are organised by a range of bodies including city councils, monasteries, private collectors and artists. Generally the colonies only exist for a few weeks each year as many of the participants work on an academic calendar. Some of the colonies (Stumista) have been in existence for over 40 years and their reputation allows them to attract a range of international artists. Some examples of these groups may be found at:
* [[Gamzigrad]] - Serbia
* [[Ohrid]] [[Colony Ramazzoti]] - [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]
* [[Strumitsa]] - [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]
* [[Veles (city)|Veles]] - [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]

'''''Before Night Falls''''' ({{lang-es|Antes que anochezca: autobiografía}}) is the 1992 [[autobiography]] of [[Cubans|Cuban]] writer [[Reinaldo Arenas]], describing his early life in Cuba, his time in prison, and his escape to the United States in the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980. It received a favorable review from ''[[The New York Times]]'' and was on the newspaper's list of the ten best books of 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gonzalez Echevarria |first=Roberto |work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/arenas-night.html  |title=An Outcast of the Island  |date=October 24, 1993 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into a [[Before Night Falls (film)|film]] of the same name in 2000, starring [[Javier Bardem]] and [[Johnny Depp]].

==Opera adaptation==
On May 29, 2010 the premiere performance of ''Before Night Falls'', an opera by [[Jorge Martín (composer)|Jorge Martín]], took place at the [[Fort Worth Opera]]. The opera follows the book by Reinaldo Arenas closely.

On March 29, 2017, [[Florida Grand Opera]] premiered ''Before Night Falls'' in [[Miami]] with five performances at the [[Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts]].

'''Briton Rivière''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (14 August 1840 in [[London]]{{snd}}20 April 1920 in [[London]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://ann-lauren.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/19-20th-cent-briton-riviere.html Ann Lauren: Biography of Rivière]&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[artist]] of [[Huguenot]] descent. He exhibited a variety of paintings at the [[Royal Academy]], but devoted much of his life to animal paintings.

==Biography==
Briton's father, [[William Rivière]] (1806–1876), was for some years drawing-master at [[Cheltenham College]], and then an art teacher at the [[University of Oxford]]. Briton was educated at Cheltenham College and Oxford, where he took his degree in 1867. For his art training he was indebted almost entirely to his father.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Riviere, Briton |volume=23 |page=387  }} This cites [[Walter Armstrong (art historian)|Sir Walter Armstrong]], "Briton Riviere, R.A.: His Life and Work", ''Art Annual'' (1891).&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal uncle [[Henry Parsons Rivière]] (1811–1888) was also a noted watercolourist, exhibiting works at the [[Royal Watercolour Society]], London and the [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]].

His first pictures appeared at the [[British Institution]], and in 1857 he exhibited three works at the [[Royal Academy]], but it was not until 1863 that he became a regular contributor to the Academy exhibitions. In that year he was represented by ''The eve of the [[Spanish Armada]]'', and in 1864 by a ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. However, subjects of this kind did not attract him long, for in 1865 he began, with ''Sleeping Deerhound'', a series of paintings of animal-subjects which occupied much of the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In a lengthy interview in ''[[Chums Boys Annual]]'', entitled "How I paint animals", Rivière explained some of the practicalities of painting both tame and wild animals:

{{quote|I have always been a great lover of dogs but I have worked at them so much that I've grown tired of having them about me. However, you can never paint a dog unless you are fond of it. I never work from a dog without the assistance of a man who is well acquainted with animals ... Collies, I think, are the most restless dogs ...[[greyhounds]] are also very restless, and so are [[fox terriers]] ... The only way to paint wild animals is to gradually accumulate a large number of studies and a great knowledge of the animal itself, before you can paint its picture ... I paint from dead animals as well as from live ones. I have had the body of a fine lioness in my studio ... I have done a great deal of work in the dissecting rooms at the Zoological Gardens from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;"How I paint animals", ''Chums Boys Annual'', No. 256, Vol. V, 4 August 1897&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early in his career, Rivière made some mark as an illustrator, beginning with ''[[Punch magazine]]''. He was elected an [[Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1878, and a [[Royal Academician]] in 1881, and received the degree of [[Doctor of Civil Law]] at Oxford in 1891.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; He was narrowly defeated in the election for President of the Royal Academy in 1896. His wife, Mary Alice Rivière (née Dobell; 1844–1931) whom he married in 1867, was a painter and exhibited briefly at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1869–70. After his death she presented the [[British Museum]] with four of his drawings (and an etching "The king drinks"), which complements the dozens of prints made after his work housed there, especially by [[Frederick Stacpoole]] and [[William Henry Simmons]]. The artist and his wife had seven children; five sons and two daughters. One of the sons, [[Hugh Goldwin Rivière]] (1869–1956), became a portraitist; another son (Evelyn) married the eminent psychoanalyst and translator of Sigmund Freud known as [[Joan Riviere]].

'''Christopher Hills''' (April 9, 1926 – January 31, 1997) was an English-born author, philosopher, and scientist, popularly described as the "Father of Spirulina"&lt;ref&gt;''San Jose Mercury News'' obituary, February 2, 1997:- "Spirulina Czar"&lt;/ref&gt; for popularizing [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] [[cyanobacteria]] as a food supplement. He also wrote 30 books on consciousness, [[meditation]], [[yoga]] and spiritual evolution, [[divining]], [[world government]], [[aquaculture]], and personal health.

Hills was variously headlined by the press as a "Western Guru Scientist",&lt;ref&gt;Western Guru Scientist – ''Holistic Health &amp; Medicine'' magazine, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; "Natural Foods Pioneer",&lt;ref&gt;Natural Foods Pioneer – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Feb 10, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; "Evolutionary Revolutionary"&lt;ref&gt;"Evolutionary Revolutionary" – ''Monterey Peninsula Herald'', Jan 29, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and a "Modern Merlin".&lt;ref&gt;Modern Merlin, Hills Seeks Answers in the Mountains – ''Oakland Tribune'', 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

As a successful commodities trader and art patron in Jamaica, he retired from business at an early age to follow a spiritual quest that took him around the world as a speaker, author, entrepreneur and pioneer of algae as one of the most efficient sources of food and fuel for humanity.

==Early biography==
Born in Grimsby, England to a family of fishermen, Hills grew up sailing the bleak and turbulent [[North Sea]]. In 1940 he enrolled as a cadet in nautical school and joined the [[British Merchant Navy]] during [[World War II]]. At sea, Hills had several life and death experiences that formed his views on [[karma]], divinity and destiny. On one occasion a rogue wave swept him off the deck hundreds of yards (metres) away from the vessel, but another wave picked him up and threw him back onto the ship,&lt;ref&gt;''The Movie of Life'' – Early Morning Meditations series, volume MM3&lt;/ref&gt; cutting open his forehead but saving him from freezing to death. As German [[U-boat]]s sank 2,828 merchant ships, he watched tanker crew colleagues incinerated in the flaming oil-slicked Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Thirty thousand men of the British Merchant Navy were killed. ''Battle of Wits'', p. 280, {{ISBN|0-684-85932-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war, as navigating officer for an [[Esso]] oil tanker, Hills found himself docked in [[Curaçao]], where he set up shop as a [[commodities trader]] with branch offices in [[Venezuela]] and [[Aruba]].

Encountering problems with South American contract law when a client reneged on a deal, Hills moved to [[Jamaica]], where business was conducted under the [[British judicial system]]. There with the help of plantocrat philanthropist Percy Junor&lt;ref&gt;"Indisputably one of Jamaica's most successful self-made men" - ''Sunday Gleaner'', March 8, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; he founded commodity companies specializing in sugar, bananas, insurance, telegraph communications and agricultural spices pimento, [[nutmeg]]s and [[ginger]]. Financing for the first export corporation came from British businessman Andrew Hay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/18/nyregion/andrew-mackenzie-hay-73-trade-expert.html| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Andrew Mackenzie Hay, 73, Trade Expert | date=18 May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then husband of best-selling motivational author [[Louise Hay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04Hay-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=The Queen of the New Age | date=4 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who in the 1950s was a high-fashion model and Hills family friend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2007/04/23/hlouise123.xml Louise Hay Interview] www.telegraph.co.uk, 23 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Christopher Hills married a young English woman, Norah Bremner, deputy headmistress of [[Wolmer's School]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Her father, Bernard E. Bremner B.E.M.,&lt;ref&gt;"32 Years in Civil Defence" Mr. Bremner a leading figure in civil defence since 1930 awarded the  [[British Empire Medal]], ''Eastern Daily Press'', pg 5, Oct 11, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; was the Magistrate, Chief of Customs, and Mayor&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. and Mrs. B.E. Bremner, Mayor and Mayoress of Lynn" ''Lynn News'', July 27, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; of [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]] who in 1951 co-founded the King's Lynn Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.kingslynncivicsociety.co.uk/history.asp| title=History of King’s Lynn Civic Society | }}&lt;/ref&gt; with concert pianist&lt;ref&gt;The Times (London), Thursday, 8 July 1993; p. 4 col.

The family frequently sailed to England for events such as the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] and Mayor Bremner's presenting Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] with Freedom of the Borough,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/queen-elizabeth-the-queen-mother-signing-a-declaration-of-news-photo/3366713| work=[[Getty Images]] | title=Kings Lynn Ceremony | date=26 July 1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which encompassed the royal family's home at nearby [[Sandringham, Norfolk|Sandringham]].

==Jamaica business leader==
From 1949 to 1967, Christopher and Norah Hills became influential forces in Jamaica's commerce, art, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Music Awards, Christopher Hills Challenge Cup - ''The Daily Gleaner'', July 4, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jamaica Governor with Kapo and Christopher Hills.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.10|Governor of Jamaica Sir [[Hugh Foot]] opening a 1957 Hills Galleries exhibition showing works by Mallica "Kapo" Reynolds with Christopher Hills]]
Believing that Jamaica's strength lay in its agriculture, Christopher Hills co-founded the Jamaica Agriculture &amp; Industrial Party (AIP)&lt;ref&gt;"Statistics Support Call for Third Party" - ''Daily Gleaner'', September 13, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to the two major political parties: [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and [[People's National Party]] (PNP), both of which he felt were too busy warring with each other to look out for the middle class and the country people who were the backbone of Jamaica's rural economy. Despite competing vigorously in the polls, the Hills couple were nevertheless close friends with JLP leader Sir [[Alexander Bustamante]] and [[Norman Manley]], head of the PNP, who both served as [[Jamaican Prime Minister]]s. Norman Manley in fact had been best man at the Hills' wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Given in Marriage by Mr. N. W. Manley K.C. - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 31, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 Christopher and Norah Hills founded Hills Galleries Ltd, which, in cooperation with the Prime Minister's wife [[Edna Manley]],&lt;ref&gt;"She changed Jamaica for the better" - ''Globe and Mail'', June. 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Edna Manley: The Mother of Modern Jamaican Art" - ''Woman's Art Journal'', Vol. 7, No. 2 (Autumn 1986 - Winter 1987) pp. 36-40&lt;/ref&gt; became a nexus of the [[Jamaican art]] movement. The Gallery &amp; Antiques showroom&lt;ref&gt;Hills Galleries - ''Daily Gleaner'' March 3, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; at 101 Harbour Street, Kingston was built on the site of [[Simon Bolivar]]'s Jamaica residence where, in 1815, the revolutionary wrote his famous letter [[Carta de Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://faculty.smu.edu/bakewell/BAKEWELL/texts/jamaica-letter.html| work=The Colonial Press Inc. | title=The Selected Writings of Simón Bolívar | date=1951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Hills Galleries supplied and exhibited local celebrity artists [[Ian Fleming]] and [[Noël Coward]], enjoyed the patronage of British royals&lt;ref&gt;"Queen Mother and Lady Fermoy visit Jamaica" - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 22, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lady Morley opens Hills Galleries exhibition" - ''Daily Gleaner'', November 21, 1962, p 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Of Beauty and Majesty", Princess Margaret's visit - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 24, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and such high-profile clients as [[Sadruddin Aga Khan]], [[Winthrop Rockefeller]],&lt;ref&gt;Knodler Gallery New York - "Jamaican Paintings Join Top Bracket" - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 15, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;"Hills Dine with Elizabeth Taylor, Eddie Fisher" - ''[[Sunday Gleaner]]'', March 31, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Elizabeth Taylor buys three Gaston Tabois paintings from Hills Galleries: "Village Street", "Rock River", "Rio Cobre Dam" - ''Daily Gleaner'', March 26, 1960, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Bird Johnson]], [[Grace Kelly]] and [[Errol Flynn]]. Hills Galleries was also the main agent for [[George Rowney|Rowney's]], [[Grumbacher]] and [[Winsor &amp; Newton]] art supplies in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;"Dealer's Art" - ''Daily Gleaner'', February 22, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Through multiple exhibitions, the Hillses nurtured or launched the careers of a plethora of talented Jamaican artists, such as Gaston Tabois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20121202/arts/arts4.html | work=''Daily Gleaner'', | title=Gaston Tabois First Solo Show at Hills Galleries, 1955 | date=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Abendana Spencer]], [[Carl Abrahams]], [[Barrington Watson]],&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Scott-Williams, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Barrington-Watson--A-life-in-paint_9905483 "Barrington Watson: A life in paint"], ''Jamaica Observer'', 16 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Huie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20001224/arts/arts2.html | work=The Jamaica Gleaner, | title=Albert Huie, First solo exhibition at Hills Galleries 1955 | date=24 December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Huie More Than a Superb Craftsman" - ''Sunday Gleaner Magazine'', October 28, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Escoffery]], Karl Parboosingh, Vernon Tong and the revivalist preacher/painter/sculptor [[Mallica Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;Hills Galleries "This Is Jamaica" exhibit - ''Daily Gleaner'', July 31, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Hills opened a Hills Galleries branch on Jamaica's north coast at [[Montego Bay]], mooring his yacht, the ''Robanne''&lt;ref&gt;"Artists sail to Round Hill exhibit aboard Christopher Hills' yacht the 40-ton Robanne" - ''Daily Gleaner'', April 17, 1956, p 12&lt;/ref&gt; at Round Hill, a popular resort for foreign leaders and industrialists vacationing in the Caribbean. It was there he met then Vice President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and CBS president [[William S. Paley]], who in 1956, sponsored a Hills Galleries exhibition of Jamaican art at Barbizon Plaza&lt;ref&gt;New York Socialites Appreciate Jamaica's "Intuitive Art" - ''Sunday Gleaner'', March 3, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Artists - ''New York Times'', March 2, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City, which awoke U.S. art collectors to Jamaica's dynamic sphere of artistic talent. The exhibition was described by the Daily Gleaner as "Epochal in the establishment of a market for West Indian art."&lt;ref&gt;A World of Glory to Record. Review by George Campbell - ''Daily Gleaner'', March 26, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The Hills family spent weekends and holidays at [[Port Antonio]] visiting friends and clients including their neighbor, novelist [[Robin Moore]] at Blue Lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;"Robin Moore's Big Marlin Bet" Telepathy experiment, ''Supersenonics - The Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', 0-916438-18-X (1975) p 593&lt;/ref&gt; There Hills met [[Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza]] who asked Hills to curate part of his art collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/28/nyregion/baron-thyssen-bornemisza-industrialist-who-built-fabled-art-collection-dies-81.html | work=The New York Times | title=Industrialist Who Built Fabled Art Collection, Dies at 81 | date=28 April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For five years many classic works of the baron's international art acquisitions decorated the walls of the Hills' home. Von Thyssen also granted Hills' children access to his private island at San San near Port Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jamentrust.org | work=Jamaica Environment Trust | title=Pellew Island | date=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Hills had just returned from sailing the ''Robanne'' to Havana when he met [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] who had given a speech honoring a visit to Jamaica by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]]. At the gallery Stevenson fell in love with Hills' George III period Sheraton bow-fronted desk,&lt;ref&gt;"Jamaican Mementoes" - ''Daily Gleaner'', September 18, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; immediately purchasing it for his own office in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Adlai Stevenson paid $328.00 with [[Northern Trust]] Company personal check No.5162 ($2,884 in today's dollars)&lt;/ref&gt; Over dinner, Hills shared his observations of simmering revolution in Cuba, while he and Stevenson compared their concepts of justice, democracy, conflict and dictatorships — a conversation that inspired Hills to publish his ideas for uplifting the world's underprivileged masses in his landmark volume ''Rise of the Phoenix''.&lt;ref&gt;''Rise of the Phoenix - Universal Government by Nature's Laws'', 0-916438-04-X (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rastafari movement==

Hills also became an advocate for Jamaica's [[Rastafari movement]], who were being oppressed in the late fifties.&lt;ref&gt;"Rasta Spirit Knows no Boundaries" - ''Daily Gleaner'', June 22, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; He gave Rastafarians jobs as [[woodcarver]]s, free paints to poor artists, such as the now-famed Ras Dizzy and bailed them out of [[Spanish Town Prison]] while encouraging rasta brethren to sustain themselves through art and music. Christopher and Norah Hills were personally thanked for their years of support for struggling rastas by [[Mortimo Planno]], the Rasta teacher of [[Bob Marley]] and one of the few Rastafarian elders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mortimer-planno-6102816.html | work=[[The Independent]] | title=Revered Rastafarian leader | date=25 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have met with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

Hills also "reasoned" [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhian]] non-violence with [[Leonard Howell]], the original "Gong"&lt;ref&gt;Bob Marley named his record label [[Tuff Gong]] after Leonard "The Gong" Howell&lt;/ref&gt; activist who founded Pinnacle, a Rastafarian community farm at [[Sligoville]], a few miles from Hills' home. In 1958 Pinnacle was raided in a brutal crackdown by the authorities, ostensibly for growing [[marijuana]], but in fact Rastafarianism at that time was regarded by The Crown as a threat to social harmony. Hills interceded with the Prime Minister but, with an election coming, law &amp; order politics prevailed and many sustainable farming families had to leave the land. For his support, Hills was given the moniker "The First White Rasta". Unlike his skeptical friends and business colleagues, he saw Rastafarian spirituality as a righteous way of life, indeed growing out his hair and beard in solidarity and also in keeping with his emerging interest in the [[sadhu]]s and enlightened sages of India who had much in common with the vegetarian mystical Rastafarians.&lt;ref&gt;"Back to Africa" movement, Christopher Hills' speech at Addis Ababa - ''Kingston Gleaner'' July 22, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual awakening==
By 1960 Christopher Hills had accumulated a large [[Supernatural|metaphysical]] library on frequent trips to [[Samuel Weiser Books]] in New York, while writing his own books, ''Kingdom of Desire'', ''Power of the Doctrine'' and ''The Power of Increased Perception''. At 30 he retired from business&lt;ref&gt;"The Business of Art" - ''Business Sketch Magazine'', July 1961&lt;/ref&gt; and began to research multiple spiritual paths and the physics of what [[Einstein]] called [[Unified field theory]]. Prolific research papers and lectures came out of Hills' laboratory in the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)]] on subjects such as [[bioenergetics]], [[hypnosis]], tele-thought, [[biophysics]], effects of solar radiation on living organisms, resonant systems of [[ionosphere]], and capacitor effects of human body on static electricity and electron discharge of the nervous system. In 1960 he began a 30-year project to document the effects of sound and color on human consciousness and states of health.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-916438-12-0}}, pp. 108, 190, 431&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global outreach ==

With Norah Hills running the galleries, Hills set forth on a two-year journey travelling in Asia, Europe, Pakistan and India, meeting with members of the [[United Nations|UN]] and calling on politicians, scientists and religious leaders. [[UNESCO]] hired him to shoot 1,000 photographs of their projects in faraway countries, which appeared in an exhibit at [[United Nations headquarters]].

Hills' global odyssey's itinerary grew out of publishing his views on [[conflict resolution]] and alternative government in a manifesto, ''Framework for Unity'', that was circulated to The Commission for Research in the Creative Faculties of Man, a network he had founded of thinkers around the world which, in 1961, included Prof. Oliver Reiser, [[Humphry Osmond]], Dr. [[Andrija Puharich]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], and Lady [[Isobel Cripps]], among its 500 members.

After teaming up with his good friend and noted lawyer [[Luis Kutner]] (co-founder of [[Amnesty International]]), Hills decided to search the world for a spot to establish a Center where a dedicated community could live and test his ''World Constitution for Self-Government by Nature's Laws'', which he published in a book with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christ Yoga of Peace'' - Centre Publications, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friendship with Nehru ==

Working his way on a speaking tour through Europe in the direction of India, Hills decided to make a precarious expedition to the remote Himalayan [[Hunza Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hunza – Dreamland of the Hillside Farmer". ''Sunday Gleaner'', Feb. 3, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; where he had long been curious about the diet and extraordinary longevity of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], [[Balti people|Balti]] and [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] hill tribes. In Pakistan, Hills was the guest of Professors Duranni and Walid Uddin at [[Peshawar's College of Engineering]]. Visiting Sufi holy men and Islamic scholars in [[Karachi]], he met [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] to discuss possible Indo-Pakistan cooperation in [[algae]] cultivation in the climatically suitable Gujrat-Sind border region, which is where Bhutto and his ancestors were from. Later, when Bhutto was overthrown in a military coup, Hills orchestrated urgent appeals to General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] for clemency, but, like many westerners protesting Bhutto's imprisonment, was ignored, and Bhutto was hanged.

In the 1950s Hills became known to Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Nehru I Knew" – ''Sunday Gleaner'', full page, May 31, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; through his friend the Deputy leader of India's Congress Party, Surendra Mohan Ghose, a Bengali revolutionary and relative of [[Sri Aurobindo]]. Hills invited Ghose to Jamaica,&lt;ref&gt;S.M. Ghose, Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference – ''Daily Gleaner'', Nov 7, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; to speak at the 1961 [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference]], and together they formed a partnership to promote World Union and global famine relief through [[algae aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;''Food from Sunlight - Planetary Survival for Hungry People'', 0-916438-13-9 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; S.M. Ghose&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Leader to announce World Centre project" – ''Daily Gleaner'', November 4, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the founders of [[Auroville]], an experimental sustainable-living International Village in [[Tamil Nadu]]. In 1962 Ghose took Hills to [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] for a personal audience with Aurobindo's successor, spiritual head of the ashram, [[Mirra Alfassa]], known as "The Mother". Later Ghose arranged for Christopher Hills' son, John Hills, to give the keynote address at the World Parliament of Youth in [[Puducherry]] in 1971.
[[File:Christopher Hills Nehru Delhi.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90| Christopher Hills with Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] at [[Teen Murti Bhavan]], New Delhi]]

In 1959 Hills had lobbied Nehru to approve a government in exile for the [[Dalai Lama]] fleeing persecution in [[Tibet]] and to grant full refugee status to exiled Tibetans. He had become connected to the Tibetans through his study of [[Buddhism]] and in 1960 provided funding for the [[Young Lama's Home School]]&lt;ref&gt;Cave in the Snow: A Western Woman's Quest for Enlightenment, [[Vicki Mackenzie]], 1999, {{ISBN|1-58234-045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh]] founded by his English friend [[Freda Bedi]], one of Gandhi's handpicked [[satyagrahi]]s&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rawlinson, "The Book of Enlightened Masters". Open Court, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8126-9310-8}}, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; who became Gelongma Karma Kechog Palmo,&lt;ref&gt;The Revolutionary Life of Freda Bedi, [[Vicki Mackenzie]], 2017, {{ISBN|9781611804256}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Western woman to take ordination in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/saving-private-anushka/16096162#sthash.qqXeW0Rc.dpuf | work=Mid-Day Magazine | title=Remembering Freda | date=27 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freda Bedi is the mother of film and television star [[Kabir Bedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001934/?ref_=nv_sr_1| work=IMDb | title=Internationally acclaimed Indian actor | date=1971–2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Hills contributed to Freda Bedi's building of the Karma Drubgyu Thargay Ling nunnery at [[Tilokpur]] in the [[Kangra Valley]] and helped organize her journey to the West with the [[16th Gyalwa Karmapa]], Rangjung Rigpe Dorje in 1974.

When Hills arrived in India, he found Nehru besieged by [[Sino-Indian border dispute|border disputes with China]] and discussion inevitably turned to Hills' theories of [[conflict resolution]] and how to avoid war.&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Conflict - The Secret of Heart-to-Heart Communication'', 0-916438-36-8 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Their connection also evolved out of the fact that India was experiencing famine in some states. With dependence on wheat shipments from the United States, Hills helped lobby President [[Lyndon Johnson]] for an increase in wheat aid, which was granted. But when Hills mentioned his research with algae as a food source, then Nehru became interested and offered to support cultivation in India. (PDF will be posted)

While in New Delhi, Hills spent time with the prime minister at [[Teen Murti Bhavan]], enjoying Jawaharlal Nehru's rose gardens and meeting his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]]. Hills was the guest of Indian industrialist [[G.D. Birla]], where on his first day in India, he had met [[Swami Shantananda]], an enlightened sage and a remarkably politically connected guru with whom Hills would travel throughout India for two years, much like a roaming [[sanyassin]]. On one of his "pilgrimages", Hills was taken by Shantanananda and Nehru's Parliamentary Secretary [[S.D. Upadhyaya]] to [[Brindavan]] for a private audience with India's highest female [[yogini]] [[Sri Anandamayi Ma]], from whom he felt a "genuine sublime holiness" and received one of the most significant blessings in his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The One I Love'', {{ISBN|0-916438-51-1}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Patna]], [[Bihar]], Hills, along with Dr [[Raynor Johnson]], were the only Europeans to attend the 1961 Science &amp; Spirituality Conference, where seeds were sown for Hills' decade of cooperation with hundreds of Indian scientists and yogis, many of whom eventually journeyed to visit Hills' centers in the West and who comprised many of the delegates for a 1970 Yoga conference Hills staged in New Delhi.

In 1963, the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] and [[Gandhi Peace Foundation]] sponsored another conference in Patna, hosted by Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s longtime right-hand disciple and first [[President of India]]. Prasad was supposed to speak at the conference but became ill, and Hills' guru Shantananda was leading prayers for him every day at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna. Prasad requested to meet Hills, whose goals for World Union he had heard about from Nehru. Hills considered Prasad the most spiritual of the founders of Independent India, and their meeting was a profound encounter in which Prasad gave his blessing for Hills' global endeavors, but then the president lost consciousness, tightly holding onto Hills' hand.&lt;ref&gt;''The President's Last Words – The One I Love'', {{ISBN|0-916438-51-1}}, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Prasad never recovered, and at the time, there was a controversy that the man who, through [[satyagraha]], had resisted multiple British governments and Viceroys and been jailed by them for so many years, had said his last words to an Englishman.

== Microalgae International ==
In earlier travels from Jamaica to Japan, Hills had formed an [[aquaculture]] research company with his friend and colleague, biologist Dr Hiroshi Nakamura, Dean of [[Tokyo Women's University]]. Dr Nakamura was a noted scientist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=dr+hiroshi+nakamura&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gL-Se-olT7&amp;sig=eqhGViSlNxrXr4kafgW76OL0s3E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8RrUTsXIFOKoiALq74C5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dr%20hiroshi%20nakamura&amp;f=false | work=Yoga Journal | title=SPIRULINA - Food From The Sun's Light | page= 44 |date= May–June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a colleague of Emperor [[Hirohito]] (himself a marine biologist) who asked Nakamura to research alternative food sources for Japan after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had devastated food supplies. The goal of Hills and Nakmura's organization Microalgae International Union, was to develop strains of algae as a way of harnessing the sun's energy for [[biofuel]]s and human nutrition and as a solution to World Hunger.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World'', 0-916438-47-3 - Micro Algae International Union, pp. 5, 69, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Presented with M.I.U.'s [[feasibility studies]], Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed Hills' proposal for bringing the cultivation of protein-rich [[Chlorella]] algae to the villages of India.&lt;ref&gt;''Food from Sunlight'', 0-916438-13-9, pp. 103–109&lt;/ref&gt;

With India's Home Minister, [[Gulzari Lal Nanda]], Hills had co-founded the Institute of Psychic and Spiritual Research in New Delhi. A devout Gandhian, Nanda feared social upheaval and possible communal violence if poor and hungry villagers started migrating to India's cities so he threw his support behind Hills' plan for developing rural economies via small footprint aquaculture that could help villages become sustainable. A detailed plan for a pilot project in the [[Rann of Kutch]] was approved by the Indian government. However, the initiative became mired in bureaucracy when Nehru died in 1964. Nanda became acting prime minister but only until the new Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] was nominated to succeed Nehru. Shastri continued working with Hills and had his staff prepare a budget request for Parliament to fund the [[chlorella]] algae project. However, because it competed with traditional agricultural interests, the aquaculture project became victim to political jockeying as well as an outbreak of war with Pakistan. With Shastri's mysterious death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/43-years-on-mystery-shrouds-postmortem-of-shastri/497076/ | work=Indian Express | title=Mystery of Prime Minister Shastri's Death | date=2 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Tashkent Declaration|1966 India-Pakistan peace conference]] in [[Tashkent]], the project lost its key sponsor.

Nevertheless, the networks Hills had established with the founders of modern India proved valuable when his son, John Hills, was introduced by Nanda and S.M. Ghose to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], who helped the younger Hills&lt;ref&gt;"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet", ''Hindustan Times'', Sept 17, 1970, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; garner support among India's Congress party and religious leaders for India's largest conference of Western scientists and Indian yogis.&lt;ref&gt;"World Conference on Scientific Yoga" – ''Times of India'', Nov. 30, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centre House, London ==

[[File:BKS Iyengar Centre House.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.70|Members of Centre House community with Hatha Yoga teacher Malcolm Strutt and Yoga Master [[B.K.S. Iyengar]]]]
Three years after [[History of Jamaica#Independent Jamaica|Jamaica's 1962 declaration of Independence]] from Britain, the Hills family moved to London, at the suggestion of two of his mentors, Bertrand Russell and [[Sir George Trevelyan, 4th Baronet]]. They helped Hills find and purchase a six-story Edwardian building in London's leafy [[Kensington]]. There Christopher Hills and others, including Kevin Kingsland, founded Centre House, a self-discovery and human-potential community&lt;ref&gt;"The Superman Project", ''News of the World'', Dec 5, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; known as a nucleus of yoga and spirituality in the emerging [[New Age]] movement throughout the late sixties and seventies. Seekers came from all over the world to study with visiting gurus, such as [[Swami Satchidananda]], [[Muktananda]], [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], [[Sangharakshita]] and [[John G. Bennett]] as well as Sanskrit scholar Dr. Rammurti Mishra,&lt;ref&gt;Rammurti S. Mishra - ''Yoga Sutras: The Textbook of Yoga Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christmas Humphreys]], Tibetan [[lama]]s, chief [[Druids]], [[homeopathic]]  doctors and scientists studying meditation, telepathy and [[neuroplasticity]] in Hills' Yoga Science laboratory. It was here Christopher Hills wrote his magnum opus, ''Nuclear Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Evolution: Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-916438-12-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; - recognized as a definitive treatise on the [[chakra]]s as they relate to the human [[endocrine system]], light frequencies and human personality. [[Yoga Journal]] described the book as, "Synthesizing a vast amount of information ranging from the structure of [[DNA]] to the [[metaphysics]] of consciousness" and also as, "A giant step forward in integrating science with religion in a meaningful way."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yoga Journal]] '' magazine - The Rainbow Body, March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Centre House was an experiment in group consciousness where the majority of residents were well-educated students, teachers and scientists interested in the convergence of [[science and spirituality]]. For a while the large basement kitchen was a [[macrobiotic]] restaurant, first run by [[Craig Sams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Days In The Life: Voices from the English Underground 1961-1971 | first = Jonathon | last = Green | author-link = Jonathon Green | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=am6TOJ9tNscC&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;vq=february%2014&amp;dq=days%20in%20the%20life&amp;pg=PT190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | date = 1988 | publisher = Heinemann | isbn = 978-1-448-10444-4 | quote = "I remember Christopher Hills, who ran the Centre House, calling down one day, 'Can you please not smoke marijuana - we can smell it on the third floor.'

Its founder, Muz Murray (Ramana Baba),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mantra-yoga.com/| title=Gandalf's Garden publisher Muz Murray aka Ramana Baba | }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the early residents of Centre House and there published the first issues of ''[[Gandalf's Garden]]'' magazine, a publication chronicling the vitality of London's New Age scene. Kevin Kingsland went on to found the [[Centre for Human Communication]] in Devon and Grael Associates (a [[The Community Company|Community Company]])..

== World Conference on Scientific Yoga, New Delhi ==

In December 1970 Christopher Hills, his son John, and Kevin Kingsland organized the world's first World Conference on Scientific Yoga (WCSY)&lt;ref&gt;"World Yoga Conference" – ''Times of India'', Nov. 30, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; in New Delhi, bringing 50 Western scientists together with 800 of India's leading swamis, yogis and lamas to discuss their research and establish a network for the creation of a World Yoga University.
[[File:John Hills with Dhirendra Bramachari and Amrit Desai.jpg|right|thumb|250px|John Hills discusses the World Conference on Scientific Yoga program with [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] and [[Amrit Desai]] in New Delhi]]

The conference generated some controversy&lt;ref&gt;"Masters of Emotions – Yogis Wind Up Parley By Losing Tempers", ''Los Angeles Times'', Dec 24, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; when Indian politics intersected with religion,&lt;ref&gt;"Yogis Act Unyogalike", ''The Daily Herald'', Dec 24, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the concept of ''Christ Yoga'', a book Hills had written linking Christ's teachings to those of [[Buddha]] and the [[Vedas]]. But the conclave nevertheless emerged as a milestone in the soon-to-be-booming migration of Indian yogis to the West. John Hills,&lt;ref&gt;"Young British Yogi Plans World Meet", ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', Sept 17, 1970, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; helped by his father's prior relationship with Nehru, worked with India's Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and the Nehrus' yoga master [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] to steer a fractious committee of MPs, ministers and often competitive spiritual leaders from disparate religions and castes into creating a uniquely diverse and widely hailed program of events.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, Dec 27, 1970 – "World Conference on Scientific Yoga"&lt;/ref&gt; Presenters from the West included [[transpersonal psychology]] pioneer Dr. [[Stanislav Grof]] and Dr. [[Sidney Jourard]] who compared their research in lively sessions with Indian scholars, scientists, philosophers and yogis such as [[B.K.S. Iyengar]], Shri [[K. Pattabhi Jois]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Swami Satchidananda]], Padma Bhushan [[Murugappa Channaveerappa Modi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec202005/spectrum1291520051219.asp | work=[[The Deccan Herald]] | title=Man With A Vision | date=20 December 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212072444/http://archive.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec202005/spectrum1291520051219.asp | archivedate=12 February 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; R.R.

The actor [[James Coburn]], a yoga and martial arts practitioner, described the World Conference on Scientific Yoga as "Very rewarding for me, definitely worth the time and money getting here."&lt;ref&gt;"Yogi Film Moghul" – ''[[Times of India]]'', Dec 23, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the conference, Dhirendra Brahmachari presided over the wedding of organizer Kevin Kingsland and yoga teacher Venika Mehra. James Coburn also attended. Kevin and Venika Kingsland went on to establish various Centres for Human Communication in the UK, USA and India, teaching yoga, human communication and promoting community consciousness.

Post-conference, the select delegates' presentations were published in ''CHAKRA'' magazine, founded with the help of [[Tantra]] scholar Ajit Mookerjee and Indian art patron Virendra Kumar and edited by John Hills whose first venture in publishing was mentored by [[Baburao Patel]] M.P., editor of ''[[Filmindia]]'' and ''[[Mother India (magazine)|Mother India]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor's Welcome" - ''CHAKRA Magazine'', Vol 1, March–May, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was deemed a success and Christopher Hills was elected by a majority of the delegates to establish a World Yoga University somewhere on the planet. A mission that would take him from the United Kingdom to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Yoga University Seeks Site" - ''San Mateo Times'', March 4, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of the Trees ==

As the spiritual axis shifted to America, Christopher Hills visited his friend [[Laura Huxley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/17/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries | work=[[The Guardian]], | title=Laura Huxley Obituary | date=17 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who urged him to move to the United States where he settled in [[Boulder Creek, California]], and became a U.S. citizen. There, amidst the ancient [[redwoods]], he founded in 1973,&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"/&gt; an accredited college, University of the Trees, an alternative education and research center for the social sciences to study the laws of nature and their relation to [[human consciousness]].&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"/&gt; Students lived on campus and studied subjects as diverse as [[Radionics]] and [[dowsing]] (Hills was a well-known diviner&lt;ref&gt;"Incredible Feat" – ''[[National Enquirer]]'', June 22, 1976, p. 14 (Diviner finds stolen loot for Santa Cruz Police)&lt;/ref&gt;), meditation, [[hatha yoga]], [[the Vedas]], and early forms of social networking he called "Group Consciousness".

The campus housed University of the Trees Press which published Christopher Hills' writings and the research of a number of resident students who obtained degrees at the university and wrote books on light &amp; color frequencies and the science of [[Radionics]]. A small workshop produced [[pendulums for dowsing]] and a line of [[negative ion generators]]. With the buildup of the vitamin business surrounding discoveries that spirulina had significant weight loss benefits University of the Trees became one of the largest employers in the [[San Lorenzo Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;"From Counterculture to Mainstream" – ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'' (Cover), Aug 19, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and leased more than 10 buildings in Boulder Creek for housing students and warehousing for Light Force,&lt;ref&gt;"Spirulina – Miracle Pill or Mind Pill? " – ''[[The Press Democrat]]'', September 24, 1981, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; a burgeoning nutritional products brand based on spirulina.

From this base in California, Hills extended his hospitality to a pantheon of visiting scientists, writers, philosophers and scholars such as [[Alan Watts]], [[Edgar Mitchell]], [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Thelma Moss]], [[Hiroshi Motoyama]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], Sri Lanka president Ranasinghe Premadasa, [[Menninger Foundation]]'s [[Swami Rama]], Dr. [[Evarts G. Loomis]], [[Viktoras Kulvinskas]], [[Max Lüscher]], [[Marcia Moore]], Bernard Jensen and countless others in the fields of human potential, holistic health, aquaculture, religion, quantum physics and [[alternative medicine]].

== Supersensonics ==

Within the campus, Hills founded an experimental laboratory, managed by physicist Dr. Robert Massy,&lt;ref&gt;"Revealing Look Into World Of Luminous Revelations" - ''The Times, San Mateo'', September 22, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; to develop his theories on the Electro Vibratory Body – documenting what Hills' colleague Stanford University's [[William A. Tiller]] Ph.D,&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117924009/ | title=''What the #$*! Do We Know!?'' (Film review) |author=Robert Koehler |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=June 2, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls "subtle energies" or "psychoenergetics". Shortly before he died [[radionics]] pioneer [[George de la Warr]] donated a substantial portion of his research files, library and instruments to Christopher Hills. In 1975 Hills wrote the book ''Supersensonics — the Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', widely considered "The Bible of dowsing"&lt;ref&gt;''Supersenonics - The Science of Radiational Paraphysics'', 0-916438-18-X (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The book sheds new light on divining, telepathy, [[The I Ching]], [[Egypt's Pyramids]], [[Biblical miracles]] and discusses the value of low level extrasensory phenomena vs higher levels of insight, wisdom and consciousness. ''[[New Age Journal]]'' magazine called ''Supersensonics'' "A short course in miracles for scientist and seeker alike."&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Age Journal]]'', July/August, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

== International philanthropy ==

With the [[Cold War]] in full swing liberation from the evils of totalitarianism was a constant theme in Hills writings. He lobbied hard against the [[KGB]]'s persecution of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the internal exile with police surveillance of [[Andrei Sakharov]] and the denial of an exit visa for [[Natan Sharansky]]'s emigration to Israel.[[File:Afghan Award to Christopher Hills.jpg|right|thumb|220px| Award presented to Christopher Hills for his humanitarian services during the [[Afghan-Soviet war]]]] Christopher Hills' lifelong crusade against dictatorships and Man's inhumanity was manifested in the book ''Rise of the Phoenix'' while his passionate beliefs against deficit spending were set forth in a book on the global economy — ''The Golden Egg''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Egg'' - 0-916438-32-5 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme throughout all Christopher Hills' approaches to world, local and family problems was a process he developed called "Creative Conflict" — the same principles of solving differences between individuals, political parties and even nations that Hills had debated with Adlai Stevenson, Nehru and Luis Kutner.

Throughout the seventies and eighties Hills focused on international affairs, particularly the emergence of democracy in the Soviet Republics, eventually traveling to Russia to meet with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] where he joined the [[Soviet Peace Committee]]. U.S. Presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] bestowed awards on Hills for his commitment to democratic freedom and his humanitarian support for victims of oppression.

The Christopher Hills Foundation donated more than $9 million worth of spirulina products to charitable organizations in the U.S. and abroad. When the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet Union had occupied Afghanistan]], Hills learned from his friends in Peshawar that Afghan freedom fighter [[Ahmad Shah Masoud]]'s mujahadeen troops as well as Tajik and [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribals were starving because supply routes had been cut by Russian forces. Hills donated and shipped $300,000 worth of spirulina, which was packed in by mules with help from Senator [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] to sustain the Afghans.&lt;ref&gt;Hills received a Humanitarian Award from the Afghan National Islamic Council, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Sri Lanka president [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]], struggling to find a formula to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], traveled to Boulder Creek to meet with Hills and learn more about his conflict resolution concepts. The two men shared a spiritual connection and established a close friendship. Premadasa then brought the Ceylon conflict closer to a democratic solution than any other Sri Lankan president had. However, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] hierarchy had split and in 1993 a faction assassinated Premadasa in a suicide bombing that killed 23 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-03/news/mn-30648_1_tamil-rebels | work= Los Angeles Times| title=Assassination Clues Point to Tamil Rebels | date=3 May 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirulina: food from sunlight==

Hills and Nakamura had a vision of feeding the world from lakes, seas and backyard aquaculture and in 1975 they authored a book, ''Food from Sunlight'' which published all their proprietary research as open source for the world to use in the cause against global famine and malnutrition. Their company, Microalgae International, invested in research and technology to find a super food for solving World Hunger. Early research focused on [[chlorella]] but its cellular structure was too small to be collected without expensive centrifuges. However, in 1967, while Dr Nakamura was living at Centre House, they discovered that women at [[Lake Chad]] were harvesting an algae in baskets to make dihé, a highly nutritious sun-baked biscuit. After studying the lakes of Africa, Hills and Dr Nakamura developed seed culture for a strain of 70% protein algae called [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] that they had collected from Lake Aranguachi in [[Ethiopia]]. Later, in 1981, Dr Hills made an expedition to Lake Chiltu at the invitation of Mr. Wollie Chekal, Minister of Trade for the Ethiopian Revolutionary Government and brought back a new set of spirulina samples to his California laboratory for hybridizing an optimal strain for commercial cultivation.

For millennia spirulina had been a food staple for natives of Lake Chad and also for the [[Aztecs]] but Hills funded much of the early experimentation needed for its successful modern day mass cultivation, described in Dr Nakamura's book ''Spirulina: Food for a Hungry World''.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirulina - Food for a Hungry World'', 0-916438-47-3&lt;/ref&gt;

To manufacture spirulina nutritional products Hills started the Light Force company in Santa Cruz, California, which was one of the early models for [[multi-level marketing]]. Customers began reporting weight loss and health benefits from spirulina and the success story was featured in ''[[The National Enquirer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Doctors Praise Safe Diet Pill" – ''National Enquirer'' (Cover), June 2, 1981, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Sales skyrocketed into the millions of dollars propelling Light Force to 50,000 distributors worldwide. To grow that much spirulina Hills formed joint ventures with Koor Foods in [[Eilat]], [[Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;Hills-Koor Red Sea Negev Algae Partnership - How to Feed the Hungry, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan Aqua in [[Taipei]] and Sosa Texcoco at [[Lake Texcoco]] in [[Mexico]]. Hills also had an association with Cyanotech on the [[Big Island of Hawaii]] which grew a very pure Pacifica brand of spirulina. By 1995 more than 5000 tons of spirulina a year were being imported for Light Force products. To encourage domestic research and production Hills purchased a 150-acre farm and built raceway ponds filled from the land's own natural geothermal aquifer in [[Desert Hot Springs, California]]. Professor Nakamura's student and protégé Dr Kotaro Kawaguchi relocated from Japan as chief research scientist and working with Sebastian Thomas, an algae cultivation expert from India, they refined desert-grown spirulina into consumable powder using the world's first {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} [[Solar dryer|solar heated dryer]].

While a staff of 40 ran the Southern California "Green Gold Farms," harvesting its own U.S.-grown spirulina for Light Force, Hills built a {{convert|13000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home/laboratory on a mountain in the redwoods of Boulder Creek, California, dedicated to researching [[neutraceuticals]] and as a gathering place for scientists, innovators and spiritual "map makers". Three years after moving to the new home Norah Hills died from [[Alzheimers]] eliciting an outpouring of affection from the many who had seen her as the "divine mother" and a significant force in all that Christopher Hills had achieved.

At the property he built a [[Hollywood]] quality video production studio to produce films on Enlightenment and, through new media, to inspire people to celebrate what he called the "Divine Goddess".&lt;ref&gt;''The Visionary State'' - 0-811848-35-3 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The studio is run today by his second wife, artist/producer [[Penny Slinger|Penny Slinger Hills]].

In 1996, after three decades of globetrotting, Hills visited [[Vietnam]] to invest in a naturally carbonated underground spring water venture. He contracted an obscure virus which caused a deterioration of his health. Light Force and the research company Biogenics were sold to Royal Body Care which continued to market the products.

Christopher Hills died at home January 31, 1997&lt;ref name="LA Times Obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-10/news/mn-27264_1_christopher-hills| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| title=Christopher Hills; Natural Foods Pioneer, Microbiologist | date=Feb 10, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving his wife Penny Slinger Hills, two sons, John Hills and Anthony Hills and four grandchildren. He believed that "Algae biomass was God's way of providing an inexhaustible source of energy from the sun". Today millions of health conscious people enjoy the health benefits of spirulina in myriad products worldwide. Recent innovations have moved algae to the front burner as researchers recognize its efficiency as a carbon sequestration mechanism and alternative biofuel.

Hills' legacy of bio-innovation and commitment to hunger relief is being carried forward by the Christopher Hills Foundation.

Beethoven's and Bruckner's copyists --&gt;
[[File:Art-students and copyists in the Louvre gallery, Paris.jpg|thumb|270px|Art-students and copyists in the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre gallery]], [[Paris]], 1868.]]A '''copyist''' is a person who makes copies. 
The term is sometimes used for artists who make copies of other artists' paintings.  However, the modern use of the term is almost entirely confined to music copyists, who are employed by the [[music industry]] to produce neat copies from a [[composer]] or arranger's manuscript.

==Music copyists==
Until the 1990s, most copyists worked by hand to write out scores and individual instrumental parts neatly, using a [[calligraphy]] pen, [[manuscript paper]], and often a ruler. Producing parts for an entire [[orchestra]] from a full score was a huge task. In the 1990s, copyists began using [[scorewriter]]s - computer programs which are the music notation equivalent of a [[word processor]]. (Such programs include ''[[Sibelius (computer program)|Sibelius]]'', ''[[Finale (computer program)|Finale]]'', ''[[MuseScore]]'' or ''[[GNU LilyPond]]''). Scorewriters allow the composer or songwriter to "enter" the melodies, rhythms and lyrics to their compositions into the computer using a mouse or by playing the notes on a [[MIDI]]-equipped keyboard. Once a composition is fully entered into a scorewriting program, the computer can be instructed to print out the parts for all of the different instruments.

Both handwritten and computer-based copying require significant understanding of [[musical notation]], [[music theory]], the musical styles and conventions of different styles of music (e.g., regarding appropriate ornamentation, [[harmony]] rules pertaining to [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s, etc.), and strong attention to detail and past conventions. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] had a contentious relationship with his copyists, who often made mistakes that remained uncorrected until the advent of [[Urtext edition]]s; some [[musicologist]]s have devoted a lot of effort to identifying Beethoven's copyists.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Alan (1970). Autumn. "Notes on Five of Beethoven's Copyists" '''23''' 3 ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was the recipient of the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize|Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education]] in 1994 in the category of “the Arts”.&lt;ref name="Queen"/&gt;

==History==
By the early 1990s, it was recognized that older adults, in particular adults over 50, were becoming an increasingly significant portion of the population, while improvements in nutrition and medicine were enabling these older adults to remain active. This demographic shift was thought to be permanent.
However, the fact that the younger population represented a shrinking market and older population a growing one was largely ignored by the design profession. In response to the lack of understanding of these issues and the design community’s lack of understanding of their implications, in 1991 DesignAge was founded to investigate the needs of the older population, to interpret the results of the research in a way relevant to designers and industry, and to develop new methodologies in design and design education in response to this demographic shift.&lt;ref name="RSA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutDA&gt;{{cite web|title=About DesignAge |url=http://designage.rca.ac.uk/DA/aboutDA.html |publisher=DesignAge |accessdate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000819052351/http://designage.rca.ac.uk/da/aboutDA.html |archivedate=August 19, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DesignAge argued that older adults were [[Social model of disability|“rendered disabled” by]] public spaces and transportation systems that had not been designed for this segment of the population, and therefore design had an influential role to play in shaping the future, in that improvements of the life for older adults, as well as the job market and national economy could be realized if designers, manufacturers, and retailers could shift their attitudes towards aging so as to collaborate to create age-friendly products and services. By pointing out that designing for the aging population was designing for their own aging, effectively reframing aging as an issue of self-interest, DesignAge was able to engage younger designers to design for older people.&lt;ref name=DesignResearchForOurFutureSelves&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Roger|title=Design Research for Our Future Selves|url=http://researchonline.rca.ac.uk/404/1/coleman_design_research_for_our_future_selves_1994.pdf|publisher=Royal College of Art|year=1994|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, R.; Clarkson, J.; Dong, H.; Cassim, J. (2007). ''Design for Inclusivity''. Ashgate Publishing Company. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways that DesignAge used to engage design students was to hold an annual design competition, called the DesignAge Competition, held between 1992 and 1998, to challenge design students to design for their “future selves.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/cp/competition/desage.html "The DesignAge Competition".] The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

DesignAge also engaged the industry at large by approaching the [[Design Business Association]] (formed in 1986 by the [[Chartered Society of Designers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.org.uk/index.aspx?id=42 "Key Dates in CSD History"]. Chartered Society of Designers. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) and suggesting a “product challenge” to their member agencies; these were small-scale&lt;ref&gt;Cassim, Julia (April 2008).

Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; events where they would work with older users to design products on a speculative basis for the aging population.&lt;ref name="RaisingOurGame"/&gt;

In 1999 DesignAge became the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre and extended into the research of Inclusive Design.

==Selected publications==
DesignAge produced a number of publications, including the seminal ''Designing For Our Future Selves'' published in 1993.
Other publications include the “Designing for our future selves” special issue (volume 24, issue 1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Ergonomics, Volume 24, Issue 1, Pages 2-69 (February 1993)  – sciencedirect.com|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00036870/24/1|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the journal ''Applied Ergonomics'' published in 1993; ''Once in a Lifetime: An Evaluation of Lifetime Homes in Hull,'' published in 1995; and ''Working Together, A New Approach To Design,'' published in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980111033134/http://designage.rca.ac.uk/DA/publications.html DesignAge Publications]. DesignAge. Retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Within three years of its existence DesignAge reported that it was able to raise awareness of the issue within the design profession, in related disciplines including ergonomics, in education, and also among major retailers, manufacturers, and the age lobby.&lt;ref name="DesignResearchForOurFutureSelves"/&gt;

In 1994, DesignAge was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in the category of “the Arts” in recognition of its contribution to the shift in perception towards designing for older adults and for working with corporations to design products for older adults and people incapacitated by illness.&lt;ref name="Queen"/&gt;

==Notable collaborations==

===Design for Ageing Network===
In 1994, DesignAge established a Europe-wide research network on design and aging called the DAN (Design for Ageing Network), funded until 1997 by [[Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities (European Commission)|DG V]] of the European Commission (then the Directorate-General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/bepa/european-group-ethics/archive-mandates/mandate-1991-1997/index_en.htm "Mandate 1991–1997"], European Commission. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;). The network’s goal was to “develop the necessary expertise, know-how and understanding to enable design and industry to respond to the growing population of over-50’s in Europe in appropriate and life-enhancing ways” through the use of “in-depth collaboration with older people” that went “beyond simple measuring and questioning.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981206174133/http://dan.interact.nl/DAN/INFO/homepop1.html "What is the DAN?"]. Design for Ageing Network. Retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After DesignAge was subsumed into the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre, DAN continued to exist until early 2004 when it was superseded by the Include Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/designage/DAN/index.html "The Design for Ageing Network"]. The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence project===
DesignAge also participated in an EU-funded project called Presence,&lt;ref name="AARL"/&gt; which ran from 1997 to 1999&lt;ref&gt;[http://hookerandkitchen.com/presence/ The Presence Project]. Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose aim was “enhancing activity and presence of older people in communities”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presenceweb.i3net.org/ Presence]. Presence. Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''detachment of wall paintings''' involves the removal of a [[Mural|wall painting]] from the structure of which it formed part. Once a common practice, with the move towards preservation ''in situ'', detachment is now largely restricted to cases where the only alternative is total loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projekte.hawk-hhg.de/ewaglos/pages/download.php|title=EwaGlos.

These operations are, therefore, only justifiable in extreme cases when all options of in situ treatment are not viable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.international.icomos.org/charters/wallpaintings_e.pdf |title=Principles for the Preservation and Conservation-Restoration of Wall Paintings (Article 6: Emergency Measures) |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] |year=2003 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Vitruvius]] records how in [[Sparta]], in 59 BC, "paintings have been taken out of certain walls by cutting through the bricks, enclosed in wooden frames, and brought to the [[Comitium]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0072%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D9 |title=Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'' II.8.9 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, apprised of paintings of [[Atalanta]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] without drapery and "enflamed with lust", [[Caligula]] attempted to carry them off, but was prevented by the makeup of the [[Plaster#In art|plaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D6 |title=Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XXXV.6.17-18 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amedeo Maiuri|Maiuri]] cites examples of wall paintings in wooden frames excavated at [[Pompeii]], a precursor to [[Pompeii#Rediscovery|what was to follow]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation==
In their study, Mora, Mora, and Philippot cite four reasons for the "over-use" of detachment: the 19th-century division of [[the arts]] that privileged a "painting" divorced from its architectural and historical context; insensitivity to the [[aesthetic]] consequences, often partially concealed by [[Conservation-restoration|restorers]]; the curiosity of [[Art history|art historians]] looking for ''[[Sinopia|sinopie]]''; or perceived savings relating to the initial cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |pages=245f |ISBN=0-408-10812-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gain and exploitation as consumer goods by collectors, dealers and restorers provides another possible incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=64f |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This process enables nowadays' companies to offer their customers an authentic fresco, created in their laboratory according to the ancient technique and transferred onto a canvas to be shipped to the place of installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italian-frescos.com/come-nasce-un-affresco-strappato-da-muro/?lang=en How is a fresco detached from a wall? - Fresco Blog] by Italian Fresco Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Minimum intervention and reversibility are core [[Conservation-restoration#Definition|conservation ethics]] that favour preservation ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transfer of Wallpaintings; based on Danish experience |author=Brajer, Isabelle |publisher=Archetype Publications |year=2002 |ISBN=978-1-873132-43-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mosaics make a Site: The conservation ''in situ'' of mosaics on archaeological sites |chapter=Philosophies favouring ''in situ'' conservation |pages=17–29 |publisher=ICCM |editor=Michaelides, Demetrios |year=2003 |ISBN=92-9077-179-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detachment breaks the intrinsic link between wall paintings and architecture; causes irreversible physical damage to the texture, topography, and tone of the painting; leaves a void in the stripped interior; with the introduction of new materials, typically leads to a cycle of retreatment; and has resulted in "many transfers in terrible condition that serve as examples of serious, albeit unintentional, maltreatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=63–71 (p. 65 for quote) |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fruit Dish and Glass''''' (1912) is the first [[papier collé]],&lt;ref name="Zurcher"&gt;pg 95-96 Bernard Zurcher [Georges Braque Life and Work] 0-8478-0986-2 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Georges Braque]], a technique which Braque invented.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Philip. ''Cubism''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 14. {{ISBN|0714832502}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Braque was inspired to create this piece after visiting an [[Avignon]] shop where he purchased a roll of [[faux bois]] paper, simulating oak paneling and consisting of two kinds of printed motifs on a dark beige background.&lt;ref name="Zurcher"/&gt;  Braque may have been drawn to this paper because he was trained in a technique called [[trompe-l'oeil]]; which allowed him to create pictorial effects that resemble [[woodgrain]] and marble finishes, but are made with paint and a special wide comb.  Braque then may have found it amusing to incorporate the woodgrain paper in his piece.  He may also have wished to use the paper to create a [[visual pun]] about the nature of representation. He noticed that because the paper looks realistic and yet it is flat, and pasted on, it undermines spatial relationships. It can act as the foreground, the background, or both. 

In ''Fruit Dish and Glass'' the glass filled with grapes and pears are flattened and distorted versions of actual objects.  Braque used [[texture (visual arts)|textures]], [[shape]]s, and [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] to construct a painting that is half recognizable and half symbolic.

==Process==
The piece is based on the interaction of wallpaper glued to the support and charcoal lines, which evoke both objects and words.  The subject matter is a glass bowl, pears, and grapes, between what looks like a dish and a wine glass, or perhaps a candlestick.  Braque probably began the work by cutting out pieces of [[wallpaper]] and moving them around a flat surface to imagine his composition.  He then might have positioned two strips of the wood grain wallpaper vertically on a large sheet of white paper to signify the walls of a café.  He also put a small horizontal piece of wallpaper at the bottom of the paper to represent a table top.  Then, he drew the glass, pears, grapes and the words ‘ALE’ and ‘BAR’ in charcoal and added black lines in ink to the wallpaper, and a circular knob to the horizon piece of wallpaper at the bottom to make it look like the drawer of a table. The work has a variety of textures that add confusion to spatial relations of the objects in the composition.  For example, in addition to the oak wallpaper, Braque used a comb to add an additional element of trompe-l'oeil to give the piece even more perceptual distortion.  Braque also adds texture, applying a mix of sand and [[gesso]]to the background.  This texture brings the background forward, making it more difficult to interpret the perspective.  Braque’s process was deliberately mystifying. His technique is full of subtleties that one doesn't notice at first.  Both the physical and logical relationships of the objects are often difficult to construct.  The painting is a visual puzzle which challenges the viewer to understand what is shown from clues and fragments.

==Interpreting==
In some places, the [[charcoal]] drawing overlaps the large vertical pieces of wallpaper so that the viewer can’t tell what is in the [[foreground]] and what is in the background. In doing so Braque is making a pun about the way objects are contained in space.  In Braque’s world, objects can float next to the table and be all in one plane and in a third dimension all at once. In reality, the individual pieces are flat and meaningless, and then are built on one another to become somewhat dimensional and visually meaningful.

==History==
Braque first thought of creating these sorts of logical paradoxes after spotting a roll of faux-bois paper printed like oak paneling.  He saw the paper in an Avignon shop while traveling with [[Picasso]] and his companion, [[Eva Gouel]], in [[Sorgues]].&lt;ref name="Zurcher"/&gt;  Braque said that he eyed the paper but waited to act on his ideas until Picasso gone to [[Paris]]. Picasso was going to [[Paris]] for a week to organize his move to a new apartment on 242 Boulevard Raspail.&lt;ref name="Zurcher"/&gt;  After Picasso had left, Braque bought the paper and made several works starting with ''Fruit Dish and Glass''. When Picasso returned, Braque showed him his work; later, Picasso copied the technique.  The work was purchased by one of Braque’s first collectors, [[Wilhelm Uhde]].  The piece remained with Uhde until 1921, when it was sold to a private collection.&lt;ref name="Zurcher"/&gt;  The use of collage is usually credited with changing the face of cubism from analytic to synthetic.  Analytic cubism used lines or tones to represent the world, while synthetic often used collage or painted areas resembling collage.  These new devices created a constant tension between illusion and the use of real objects.

A glossary of terms used in [[glass art]]

*'''Annealing''',&lt;ref name="Whitehouse1993" /&gt; The process of slowly cooling a blown or cast object to prevent the stresses of rapid cooling from cracking or damaging the object.
* '''Cane''', '''rods''' of glass with color, either single or multiple (see also zanfirico/twisted cane)
* '''Casting''',&lt;ref name="Whitehouse1993"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Whitehouse| editor-first = David| title = Glass: A Pocket Dictionary of Terms Commonly Used to Describe Glass and Glassmaking| publisher = Corning Museum of Glass| date = 1993| location = Corning, New York| isbn = 0-87290-132-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glass Today" /&gt; Any of several methods of forming glass in a mold, including the pouring of molten glass into a sand mold (''sand casting'') and the melting of glass cullet in a mold placed in a [[kiln]] (''kiln casting'').  
*'''Cullet''', broken chunks of glass or waste glass suitable for melting or remelting.
* '''[[Flameworking]]''', alternate name '''lampworking''',&lt;ref name=Whitehouse1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glass Today" /&gt; the technique of forming glass, from rods and tubes, using a bench top or handheld heat source, formerly lamps, more often today a bench-mounted oxy/propane torch, to shape and form the glass by glassblowing and with the use of tongs, forceps, knives and other small tools. [[Borosilicate glass]] is the most common form of glass to be manipulated using this technique.
* '''[[Frit]]''', crushed glass often melted onto other glass to produce patterns and color
* '''Incalmo''', the grafting or joining together, while still hot, of two separately blown glass [bubbles] to produce a single [bubble].&lt;ref name=Gable2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Gable| first = Carl I.| title = Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists| publisher = Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.| date = 2004| location = Atglen, Pennsylvania| isbn = 0-7643-1946-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Glass art#Knitted Glass|Knitted glass]]''', incorporates the techniques of [[knitting]], [[lost-wax casting]], [[Molding (process)|mold-making]], and [[Glass casting#Kiln casting|kiln-casting]].
* '''Latticino''', Italian decorative [[glassblowing]] technique.  Latticino refers to any glass piece created using colored glass canes.
* '''Latticello''' A decorative [[glassblowing]] technique. A ''latticello'' is a complicated design where the glass artist uses a ''latticino'' to create a ''reticello'' like pattern. Although the ''latticino" and the ''reticello'' are both classic Italian techniques, the ''latticello'' is a modern-day twist on classic design.
* '''[[Lehr (glassmaking)|Lehr]]''', a specialized, temperature-controlled kiln for annealing glass.&lt;ref name = Collins1921&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Collins|first1= E.F.|date= 1921|title= Electrically heated glass annealing Lehr|journal= Journal of the American Ceramic Society|volume= 4 |issue= 5|pages= 335–349|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1921.tb18664.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Mandrel''', metal rod used to construct a [[glass bead]] around.  When cooled and removed,  the space occupied by the mandrel creates the hole through the bead.
* '''Marver''', a tool used in [[glassblowing]]  A marver is a large flat table.  The glass piece is rolled across is surface.  It is used to not only shape the glass, but to remove heat as well.  The rapid absorption of heat by the marver creates a stronger skin (surface tension) than the use of a wooden tool.  Marver is derived from the word "marble."  Marble was originally used in the construction of this specialized table.  Modern marvers are made of steel, typically stainless steel.  Lampworkers use small graphite marvers mounted on or near their torches.
* '''Millefiori''',&lt;ref name="Glass Today"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fairbanks
  | first = Jonathan L.
  |author2=Pat Warner
  | title = Glass Today by American Studio Artists
  | publisher = Museum of Fine Arts Boston
  | date = 1997

  | isbn = 0-87846-447-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian term (a thousand flowers) describing a style of murrine defined by internal patterns made by layering a number of colors and shaping each with an optic mold while molten.  This style of murrine results in designs that are often flower-like.

* '''[[Murrine]]''', Italian term for patterns or images made in a glass cane (long rods of glass) that are revealed when cut or chopped in cross-sections.
* '''Pate de verre''',&lt;ref name="Glass Today" /&gt; a paste of ground or crushed glass, and the technique of casting this material into a mold; also applied to a more general range of cast-glass objects.
* '''[[Prunt]]''', a small blob of glass fused to a piece of glass, often impressed with a pattern or stamp
*'''[[Punty]]''', occasionally '''pontil''', a solid metal rod, around 5 feet long, used to hold an object being blown or hot-worked after it is removed from the blowpipe.

* '''Reticello''', Italian decorative [[glassblowing]] technique.  This involves the merging of two cane bubbles (one inside the other) in which the straight canes were twisted in opposite directions.  Once merged, the opposingly twisted canes cross each other creating a net like pattern.  If done the traditional way,  small air bubbles will be trapped in a grid pattern between the crossing canes.

{{nihongo|'''Gocco'''|プリントゴッコ|Purinto Gokko|"Print Gocco"}} is a self-contained compact color printing system invented in 1977 by Noboru Hayama. Gocco became immensely popular in Japan and it is estimated that one-third of Japanese households own a Print Gocco system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Gocco sets included the materials and tools to both make the screens, and to use these screens for printing. As the Gocco screens are quite small, they were most widely used for printing [[greeting card]]s, a popular need within Japanese culture. Gocco could also print to fabrics, although only across a small area. The Gocco printing screens did offer good [[printing registration|registration]], so two or more colour printing was practical and popular.

The name "print gocco" is derived from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word {{nihongo|''gokko''|[[:ja:ごっこ遊び|ごっこ]]}}, loosely translated as make-believe play. Riso Kagaku president Noboru Hayama explained, "We [as kids] learned rules and knowledge through make-believe play. The spirit of play is an important cultural asset. I thought that I wanted to leave "play" in the product's name."

== Printing method ==
The Gocco process was scaled down, but otherwise very similar to large commercial screen printing techniques. The equipment included simple plastic holders for screen making and printing.

[[Screen printing]] uses a mesh screen that is coated with an impermeable paint-like material to make a stencil of the design. The ink can pass through the bare mesh, but is stopped by the impermeable stencil material. These screens are made by the printer before use, either by painting the stencil material only where it is needed or more commonly, as with the Gocco, by a simple photographic process.

=== Screen making ===
Artwork was prepared as a simple black and white illustration on paper. This could be done by hand, with ink, paint or pencil, or by computer printing (although the original Gocco pre-dated home computer printing). A translucent lightweight paper and a solidly opaque illustration gave better results and sharper prints. It was also possible to use [[photogram]]s, using a natural material such as a [[leaf]] as an artwork of found-materials.

The raw screen was first coated overall with a stencil material. This was then sandwiched with the artwork and the Gocco's simple battery-powered lightbox was used to expose the screen. This used [[Flash (photography)|flash bulbs]] similar to those found in old cameras. The exposed screen could then be developed to wash away the unexposed areas (i.e. those shielded by the artwork), producing a stencil screen.

Where multiple colours were to be printed, a separate screen was made for each colour.

Gocco screens could be used repeatedly. The original patent cites a potential lifetime of 2000 prints, although few Gocco users were interested in such volumes. If cleaned of ink after printing, a screen could also be stored for future printing.

Used screens could be washed clean of the stencil afterwards, re-coated and re-used with new designs.

=== Printing ===
Printing was as for conventional screen printing. The screen and the paper to be printed were sandwiched in the Gocco printing frame. A [[squeegee]] was then used to work a viscous ink around the screen, passing through the mesh in the bare parts of the stencil and onto the paper.

== Decline ==
In December 2005, Gocco’s parent company, [[Riso Kagaku Corporation]], announced it would end production of the Gocco system due to low sales in Japan. An Internet campaign was started to find a new home for the product.

As of June 2007, Riso Kagaku Corporation had resumed production of several lines of Print Gocco units and they were available in Japan and through limited import retail stores in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May 30, 2008, the [[Riso Kagaku Corporation]] announced that it would stop shipping Gocco printers in June 2008.

The '''Great Torc from Snettisham''' or ''Snettisham Great Torc'' is a large, Iron Age [[electrum]] [[torc]] or neck-ring that is the most spectacular object in the [[Snettisham Hoard]] of [[Iron Age]] torcs and other metalwork found near the village of [[Snettisham]] in [[Norfolk]], [[East Anglia]].  The perfectly intact torc is outstanding for its high level of craftsmanship and superb artistry. Soon after its discovery this elaborate collar was acquired by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_great_torc_from_snettisham.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The [[torc]] was accidentally found in 1950 by a farmer ploughing a field at Ken Hill near the village of Snettisham. It had been buried with a bracelet and coin, which helped to date the torc to around 75&amp;nbsp;BC. Many other Iron Age hoards have since been found in the vicinity, but the Great Torc is considered by archaeologists to be the most important find from Snettisham. Declared [[treasure trove]] soon after its discovery, the torc was purchased by the British Museum with the support of the [[National Art Collections Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=828315&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Torc+snettisham&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The Great Torc from Snettisham, which weighs just over a kilogram, is mostly made of gold alloyed with a small part of silver. The torc was made in two ways: complex threads of metal were grouped into ropes and twisted around each other to create the [[crescent]] shaped necklace; the ends of the torc were cast in moulds with [[La Tène]] designs and [[welded]] onto the metal ropes to create the whole composition. Given the large amount of precious metals found at the site, in addition to the sophisticated design of luxurious jewellery such as this, it has been conjectured that the area around Snettisham may have been connected with royalty from the [[Iceni]] tribe, that was based in this part of England at the time.

The '''Gänseliesel''' (English: Goose Girl, Goose Lizzy ('''Liesel''' as pet name of Elisabeth)) is a fountain which was erected in 1901 in front of the mediaeval town hall of [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]]. Although rather small in size, the fountain is the most well-known landmark of the city. Today, it is an essential part of graduation celebrations, for every student who finishes a [[doctorate]] at the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|George August University Göttingen]] has to climb the fountain and kiss the statue of the goose girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.gateway-to-germany.de/german/print/4.21.3.11.html Stadtporträt Göttingen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910201654/http://www.gateway-to-germany.de/german/print/4.21.3.11.html |date=2012-09-10 }}. Retrieved 2007-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gänseliesel is also situated in [[Monheim am Rhein]], [[Hanover]]'s Steintor Square and [[Berlin]]'s Nikolsburger Square.

== History ==

Since the 18th century, a fountain was located on the site of the Gänseliesel. However, the old fountain was partially pulled down in the early 19th century due to deterioration. In 1898, the city council decided to construct a new fountain, for which sculptors from all over Germany presented their proposals. From all designs, the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothical]] proposal "Im Geiste der Alten/Tugendbrunnen" ("In the Spirit of the Ancients/Fountain of Virtue") by the sculptors Mehs and Jehs was favoured while the goose girl design by the architect Heinrich Stöckhardt was only ranked second place. However, after the official ranking the three best designs were put on exhibition. The citizens of Göttingen widely preferred the simpler design of the goose girl, probably because the simple girl image best represents the common people - in contrast to the numerous statues of famous university scientists found in the city. After long discussion, the Gänseliesel, then designed by the architect [[Friedrich Heinrich Stöckhardt|Heinrich Stöckhardt]] and created by the sculptor Paul Nisse, was finally put up in 1901 without any official ceremony. The Gänseliesel fountain does not have any particular connection to the history of the town. The Original of the sculpture is today in the Town Museum (''Städtisches Museum'')

==Traditions==

Soon after the fountain was erected, newly enrolled students of the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Georgia Augusta university]] began to climb up the fountain and to kiss the statue which rapidly became a university tradition. Because the climbing of the fountain was usually celebrated with excessive consumption of alcohol and loud cheers of fellow students and because the number of students largely increased after [[World War I]], police issued a decree in 1926 that officially forbade the climbing and kissing of the statue. A law student who was prosecuted for kissing the goose girl in the same year, took the case to court. However, the superior court of justice in [[Berlin]] legitimated the edict.

The tradition itself has changed over time, and today it is unusual for first year students to kiss the statue; it is now more common to bring a bouquet of flowers to the Gänseliesel and to give her a kiss after one's official reception of the [[doctorate]] degree. It is for this reason that the fountain is decorated with flowers very frequently, and throughout the year. Until recently, climbing and kissing of the monument remained officially forbidden although both the city of Göttingen and the university advertise themselves with pictures of PhD graduates kissing the girl.

As the fountain has been subject to vandalism, the original statue of the goose girl can today be seen in the Stadtmuseum while the fountain only carries a copy. After a severe assault during the winter of 2004 (malicious arson), the fountain needed to be disassembled and underwent major restoration.

Since 1995, each year on a weekend in September the city of Göttingen stages the so-called "Gänselieselfest" in honor of the goose girl. Main event of these festivities is the election of a young woman from Göttingen as the Gänseliesel, representing the town and the statue for one year.

The '''Kammerzell House''' ([[Alsatian language|Alsatian]]: ''Kammerzellhüs'', [[French language|French]]: ''Maison Kammerzell'', [[German language|German]]: ''Kammerzellhaus'') is one of the most famous buildings of [[Strasbourg]] and one of the most ornate and well preserved [[Middle Ages|medieval]] civil housing buildings in late [[Gothic architecture]] in the areas formerly belonging to the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Built in 1427 but twice transformed in 1467 and 1589, the building as it is now historically belongs to the [[German Renaissance]] but is stylistically still attached to the [[Rhineland]] black and white timber-framed style of civil (as opposed to administrative, clerical or noble) architecture.

It is situated on the ''Place de la Cathédrale'', north-west of the [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], with whose rosy colour it contrasts in a picturesque way when seen from the opposite direction.

The building's inside has been decorated on all floors by lavish [[fresco]]es by Alsatian painter [[Léo Schnug]] (1878-1933). It now houses a restaurant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2568">The '''Kaosikii''' or '''Kaos'ikii dance''' is a dance invented on September 6, 1978 by the [[India]]n [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and social reformer [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] aka Shrii Shrii Anandamurti (1921–1990).

Sarkar claims the ''kaos'ikii'' dance is a psycho-physical exercise which would benefit the mind by developing mental stamina and strength. Some hints to this dance are also contained in the speech "The Cosmic Father Has a Special Responsibility" given in [[Madras]] ([[India]]) on December 4, 1978 and later published in "''Ánanda Vacanámrtam'' Part 6, Chapter 5"{{sfn|Anandamurti|1979}}&lt;ref&gt;The ''Ánanda Vacanámrtam'' ("Blissful Discourses") series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by P. R. Sarkar aka Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Discourses on ''Tantra'' Volume Two, Chapter 23".{{sfn|Anandamurti|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;This book, a compilation of discourses of the author, is the second of two volumes and discloses much about the actual practice of Tantra.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

“The name Kaoshikii comes from the Sanskrit word kosha, meaning “layer of mind”. Kaoshikii develops the subtler layers of mind, cultivating the feeling of mysticism – the endeavour to establish a link between the finite and the infinite – in one’s consciousness. It instils self-confidence and encourages self-expression."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.anandamarga.org/ideology/self-realization/kaoshikii/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khosrow and Shirin''' ({{lang-fa|خسرو و شیرین}}) is the title of a famous [[Persian people|Persian]] tragic romance by the poet [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141–1209), who also wrote [[Layla and Majnun]]. It tells a highly elaborated fictional version of the story of the love of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrau II|Khosrow II]] for the [[Armenians|Armenian]] princess [[Shirin]], who becomes queen of [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin "Ḵosrow o Širin"] ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', Paola Orsatti)"'''''Two traditions''' soon formed around the figure of Širin: one in her favor, '''with its roots in Armenia and in the Christian regions of the Caucasus, where, as we have seen, Neẓāmi found his source;''' and the second, represented in the Šāh-nāma, where Širin is shown as a woman of humble origin and ill repute, who makes merciless use of poison (in Ferdowsi, Širin, wrought with jealousy, poisons Maryam).''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) "Farhad"] ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', Heshmat Moayyad)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Khuzistan Chronicle'', written by a Syriac Christian from Khuzistan (Beth Huzaye in Aramaic/Syriac) [Iran], probably in 680, is described as the Syriac counterpart of the Armenian work of Sebeos. We read about the relationship between the bishop Isho Yahb and the Persian king Khosrau II Parvez (590–628): "Isho Yahb was treated respectfully throughout his life, by the king himself and his two Christian wives Shirin the Aramean and Mary the Roman". (Theodor. Nöldeke: ''Die von Guidi herausgegebene syrische Chronik'', Wien 1893, p. 10.) The ''Chronicle of Séert'' (Siirt) is an anonymously authored historiographical text written by the Nestorian Church in Persia and the Middle East, possibly as early as the 9th century AD. The text deals with ecclesiastical, social, and political issues of the Christian church giving a history of its leaders and notable members. LVIII.&amp;nbsp;– History of Khosrau Parvez, son of Hormizd "Khosrau, by gratitude for Maurice, ordered to rebuild churches and to honor the Christians. He built himself two churches for Marie (Maryam) and a large church and a castle in the country of Beth Lashpar for his wife Shirin, the Aramean." (''Patrologia Orientalis'', Tome VII.&amp;nbsp;– Fascicule 2, Histoire Nestorienne (Chronique de Séert), Seconde Partie (1), publiée et traduite par Mgr Addai Scher, Paris 1911, Published Paris : Firmin-Didot 1950 p. 467.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Christoph Burgel &amp; Christine van Ruyuymbeke, "Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim ", Amsterdam University Press, 2011. pg 145: "Shirin is presented as an Armenian princess&lt;/ref&gt; The essential narrative is a love story of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin which was already well-known from the great epico-historical poem the [[Shahnameh]] and other Persian writers and popular tales, and other works have the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Chelkowski, P. "Nezami's Iskandarnameh:"in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma,1977). pp 10: "The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a "mission-impossible" but especially concerning the nature of his career. In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion. Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world."" pp 13: "Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture. He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world. His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators". pg 17: "In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times. In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians". pp 19: "Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam. To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's "koine" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind. In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well". pg 21: "However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature. pg22: "It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi's monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings)". pg 22: "In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life. In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians. He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women. He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince&amp;nbsp;– not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed. Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock."&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the story were also told under the titles '''"Shirin and Farhad"''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شیرین و فرهاد).

==Plot==
Nezami's version begins with an account of Khosrow's birth and his education. This is followed by an account of Khosrow's feast in a farmer's house; for which Khosrow is severely chastised by his father. Khosrow asks forgiveness and repents his offence. [[Hormizd IV]], who is now pleased with his son, forgives him. That very night, Khosrow sees his grandfather [[Khosrau I|Anushirvan]] in a dream and Anushirvan gives him glad tidings of a wife named [[Shirin]], a steed named [[Shabdiz]], a musician named [[Barbad]], and a great kingdom, that is [[Persia]].

Shapur, Khosrow's close friend and a painter, tells Khosrow of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] queen [[Mahin Banu]] and her niece Shirin. Hearing Shapur's descriptions of Shirin's flawless features, the young prince falls in love with Shirin, the Armenian princess. Shapur travels to [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]] to look for Shirin. Shapur finds Shirin and shows the image of Khosrow to Shirin. Shirin falls in love with Khosrow and escapes from Armenia to Khosrow's capital [[Mada'in]]; but meanwhile, Khosrow also flees from his father's anger and sets out for Armenia in search of Shirin.

On the way, he finds Shirin unclothed bathing and washing her flowing hair; Shirin also sees him; but since Khosrow was traveling in peasant clothes, they do not recognize one another. Khosrow arrives in Armenia and is welcomed by [[Shamira]] the queen of Armenia - yet he finds out that Shirin is in Mada'in. Again, Shapur is sent to bring Shirin. When Shirin reached Armenia again, Khosrow&amp;nbsp;– because of his father's death- has to return to Mada'in. The two lovers keep going to opposite places till finally Khosrow is overthrown by a general named [[Bahrām Chobin]] and flees to Armenia.

In Armenia, Khosrow finally meets Shirin and is welcomed by her. Shirin, however, does not agree to marry Khosrow; unless Khosrow first claims his country back from Bahram Chobin. Thus, Khosrow leaves Shirin in Armenia and goes to [[Constantinople]]. The Caesar agrees to assist him against Bahram Chobin on condition that he marry his daughter Mariam. Khosrow is also forced to promise not to marry as long as Mariam is alive. Khosrow succeeds in defeating his enemy and reclaims his throne. Mariam, due to her jealousy, keeps Khosrow away from Shirin.

Meanwhile, a sculptor named [[Farhad (Persian literature)|Farhad]] falls in love with Shirin and becomes Khosrow's love-rival. Khosrow cannot abide Farhad, so he sends him as an exile to [[Behistun]] mountain with the impossible task of carving stairs out of the cliff rocks. Farhad begins his task hoping that Khosrow will allow him to marry Shirin. Yet, Khosrow sends a messenger to Farhad and gives him false news of Shirin's death. Hearing this false news, Farhad throws himself from the mountaintop and dies. Khosrow writes a letter to Shirin, expressing his regret for Farhad's death. Soon after this incident, Mariam also dies. According to [[Ferdowsi]]'s version, it was Shirin who secretly poisoned Mariam. Shirin replies to Khosrow's letter with another satirical letter of condolences.

Khosrow, before proposing marriage to Shirin, tries to have intimacy with another woman named Shekar in [[Isfahan]], which further delays the lovers' union. Finally, Khosrow goes to Shirin's castle to see her. Shirin, seeing that Khosrow is drunk, does not let him in the castle. She particularly reproaches Khosrow for his intimacy with Shekar. Khosrow, sad and rejected, returns to his palace.

Shirin eventually consents to marry Khosrow after several romantic and heroic episodes. Yet, [[Kavadh II|Shiroyeh]], Khosrow's son from his wife Mariam, is also in love with Shirin. Shiroyeh finally murders his father Khosrow and sends a messenger to Shirin conveying that after one week, she would have to marry him. Shirin, in order to avoid marrying Shiroy, kills herself. Khosrow and Shirin were buried together in one grave.

==Popularity in Persian literature==
[[File:Khosrow and Shirin-page0085.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Khosrau II|Khosrow Parviz]] and [[Shirin]] in an 18th-century miniature]]
There are many references to the legend throughout the poetry of other Persian poets including Farrokhi, Qatran, Mas'ud-e Sa'd-e Salman, Othman Mokhtari, Naser Khusraw, Anwari and Sanai. [[Nizam al-Mulk]] mentioned that the legend was a popular story in his era.&lt;ref name="iranica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1)|author=Heshmat Moayyad|title=Farhad |work=Encyclopedia Iranica |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nizami's version===

Although the story was known before [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], it was brought to its greatest romantic height by him. Unlike the ''Shahnameh'', which focuses on the history, kingship and battles of Khosrow, Nizami decided to focus on the romantic aspect of the story.

When the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] Sultan Arsalan Shah requested a love epic from the poet without specifying the subject further, Nizami picked on the story of lovers Khosrow and Shirin, a theme set in his own region and based on at least partly historical facts, though an aura of legend already surrounded it.

[[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141–1209) himself considered it the sweetest story in the world:

{{cquote|The tale of Khosraw and Shirin is well known&lt;br /&gt;
And by Truth, there is no sweeter story than it.}}

It is believed to be one of the best works of Nizami. His first wife Afaq died after it was completed. Many versions of Nizami's work have been retold. The story has a constant forward drive with exposition, challenge, mystery, crisis, climax, resolution, and finally, catastrophe.

Besides Ferdowsi, Nizami's poem was influenced by [[Asad Gorgani]] and his "[[Vis and Rāmin]]".&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dick Davis |date=2005-01-06 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=Vis o Rāmin |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica  |accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is of the same meter and has similar scenes. Nizami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in the elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''. Nizami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nizami's epic poetry.

==Influence==
According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'': "The influence of the legend of Farhad is not limited to literature, but permeates the whole of Persian culture, including folklore and the fine arts. Farhad's helve supposedly grew into a tree with medicinal qualities, and there are popular laments for Farhad, especially among the Kurds (Mokri)."&lt;ref name="iranica.com"/&gt;

In 2011, the Iranian government's censors refused permission for a publishing house to reprint the centuries-old classic poem that had been a much-loved component of Persian literature for 831 years. While the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance offered no immediate official explanation for refusing to permit the firm to publish their eighth edition of the classic, the Islamic government's concerns reportedly centered on the "indecent" act of the heroine, Shirin, in embracing her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iranian_censors_heavy_hand_falls_on_a_persian_classic/24299532.html|title=Iranian Censors' Heavy Hand Falls On A Persian Classic|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orhan Pamuk]]'s novel ''[[My Name Is Red]]'' (1998) has a plot line between two characters, Shekure and Black, which echoes the Khosrow and Shirin story, which is also retold in the book. The novel uses the Turkish spelling of Khosrow's name, Hüsrev.

==Other versions==

The tale has been retold by countless [[Sufi]] poets and writers in areas which were previously part of the Persian Empire or had Persian influences, such as the northern parts of the neighboring [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Europe, the story was told by Hungarian novelist [[Mór Jókai]]. However, the story is usually told under the name of "Shirin Farhad". It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]]. The story has been filmed five times:
1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0239979|Shirin Farhad (1926)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0234717|Shirin Farhad (1931)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0387590|Shirin Farhad (1945)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1956 starring [[Madhubala]] and [[Pradeep Kumar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0129370|Shirin Farhad (1956)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0318690|Shirin Farhad (1975)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale was used as the inspiration for a 2008 Iranian film, ''[[Shirin (film)|Shirin]]'', made by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. In this formally unusual film, the story is told via the reactions of an audience of Iranian women as they sit watching the film in a cinema. The viewer has to divine the story by only ever seeing these emoting faces and listening to the film's soundtrack.

The story was also referenced in the [[Jonathan Richman]] song "Shirin and Farhad"

The tale was also an inspiration for the 2012 Bollywood romantic comedy ''[[Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi]]''.

==Criticism==
During the book's initial release, Rae Emerson, the deputy superintendent of [[Ford's Theatre National Historic Site]], conducted a review of the book's text and discovered a number of inaccuracies, which she described as "factual errors" and listed as numbering ten, each different and one additionally occurring multiple times.&lt;ref name="SalonNov11-11"&gt;

'''''La haine''''' ({{IPA-fr|la ʔɛn}}, ''Hate'') is a 1995 French [[black-and-white]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, co-edited, and directed by [[Mathieu Kassovitz]]. It is commonly released under its French title in the [[English-speaking world]], although its U.S. VHS release was titled '''''Hate'''''. It is about three young friends and their struggle to live in the ''[[banlieue]]s'' of Paris. The title derives from a line spoken by one of them, Hubert, ''"La haine attire la haine!"'', "hatred breeds hatred."

==Plot==
The film depicts approximately 20 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French [[housing project]] (a ZUP{{snd}}''{{lang|fr|zone d'urbanisation prioritaire}}'') in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. [[Jew]]ish Vinz ([[Vincent Cassel]]) is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a police officer, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, also to individual police officers who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert ([[Hubert Koundé]]) is an [[Afro-French]] boxer and small-time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to leave his world of violence and hate behind, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. Saïd{{snd}}Sayid in some English subtitles{{snd}}([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]) is an [[Arab]] [[Maghrebis|Maghrebi]] who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.

A friend of theirs, Abdel Ichaha, has been brutalized by the police shortly before the riot and lies in a coma. Vinz finds a police officer's [[.44 Magnum]] revolver, lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop, and when he hears of Abdel's death he fantasizes carrying out his vengeance.

The three go through an aimless daily routine and struggle to entertain themselves, frequently finding themselves under police scrutiny. After Vinz nearly shoots a riot police officer and the group narrowly escapes, they take a train to Paris but encounter many of the same frustrations, and their responses to interactions with both benign and malicious Parisians cause several situations to degenerate to dangerous hostility. A run-in with sadistic [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] police, during which Saïd and Hubert are humiliated and racially as well as physically abused, results in their missing the last train home and spending the night on the streets. They sleep in a shopping mall and wake to a news broadcast informing them that Abdel is dead. They travel to a roof-top from which they insult skinheads and policemen, before encountering the same group of racist anti-immigrant skinheads who begin to beat Saïd and Hubert savagely, now that the balance of power has shifted. Vinz arrives, and his gun allows him to break up the fight; all the skinheads flee except one (portrayed by Kassovitz himself) whom Vinz is about to execute in cold blood. His dream of revenge is thwarted by his reluctance to go through with the deed, and, cleverly goaded by Hubert, he is forced to confront the fact that his true nature is not the heartless gangster he poses as, and he lets the skinhead flee.

Early in the morning, the trio returns to the [[banlieue]] and split up to their separate homes, and Vinz turns the gun over to Hubert. However, Vinz and Saïd encounter a plainclothes police officer, whom Vinz had insulted earlier in the day whilst with his friends on a local rooftop. He grabs and threatens Vinz, making reference to the earlier incident on the roof. Hubert rushes to their aid, but as the police officer holding Vinz taunts him with a loaded gun held to Vinz's head, the gun accidentally goes off, killing Vinz instantly. Hubert and the police officer slowly and deliberately point their guns at each other, and as the film cuts to Saïd closing his eyes and cuts to black, a shot is heard on the soundtrack, with no indication of who fired or who may have been hit. This stand-off is underlined by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines ("It's about a society in free fall..."), underlining the fact that, as the lines say, ''jusqu'ici tout va bien'' ("so far so good"); all seems to be going relatively well until Vinz is killed, and from there no one knows what will happen, a microcosm of French society's descent through hostility into pointless violence.

==Production==
Kassovitz has said that the idea came to him when a young [[Zaire|Zairian]], Makome M’Bowole, was shot in 1993. He was killed at point blank range while in police custody and handcuffed to a radiator. The officer was reported to have been angered by Makome's words, and had been threatening him when the gun went off accidentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Kevin|last=Elstob|title=Hate (La Haine) review|journal=[[Film Quarterly]]|volume=51|issue=2 (Winter, 1997-1998)|pages=44–49|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley, California|issn=0015-1386|jstor=3697140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kassovitz began writing the script on April 6, 1993, the day M'Bowole was shot. He was also inspired by the case of [[Malik Oussekine]], a 22-year-old student protester who died after being badly beaten by the riot police after a mass demonstration in 1986, in which he did not take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/international/europe/30smashers.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|first=Elaine|last=Sciolino|title=Violent Youths Threaten to Hijack Demonstrations in Paris|date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oussekine's death is also referred to in the opening montage of the film.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/642-la-haine-and-after-arts-politics-and-the-banlieue|title=La haine and after: Arts, Politics, and the Banlieue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu Kassovitz included his own experiences; he took part in riots, he acts in a number of scenes and includes his father [[Peter Kassovitz|Peter]] in another.

The majority of the filming was done in the Parisian suburb of [[Chanteloup-les-Vignes]]. Unstaged footage was used for this film, taken from 1986–96; riots still took place during the time of filming. To actually film in the projects, Kassovitz, the production team and the actors, moved there for three months prior to the shooting as well as during actual filming.&lt;ref name="dvdbeaver1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/dvdreviews5/hate.htm|title=la HAINE|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the film's controversial subject matter, seven or eight local French councils refused to allow the film crew to film on their territory. Kassovitz was forced to temporarily rename the script Droit de Cité.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/why-the-prime-minister-had-to-see-la-haine-1578297.html| location=London| work=The Independent| first=Sheila| last=Johnston| title=Why the prime minister had to see La Haine| date=October 19, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the actors were not professionals. The film has a documentary feel and includes many situations that were based on real events.&lt;ref name="dvdbeaver1"/&gt;

The music of the film was handled by French hardcore rap group [[Assassin (rap crew)|Assassin]], whose song "Nique La Police" (translated as "Fuck The Police") was featured in one of the scenes of the film. One of the members of Assassin, [[Rockin' Squat|Mathias "Rockin' Squat" Crochon]], is the brother of Vincent Cassel, who plays Vinz in the film.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"/&gt;

The film is dedicated to those who died while it was being made.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Reception==
Upon its release, ''La haine'' received widespread critical acclaim and was well received in France and abroad. The film was shown at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]] where it enjoyed a standing ovation. Kassovitz was awarded the Best Director prize at the festival.&lt;ref name="criterion.com"/&gt; The film had a total of 2,042,070 admissions in France where it was the 14th highest-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref name="JPBox Office" /&gt; Based on 25 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 100%, with an average score of 8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Haine (1996)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_haine/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "raw, vital and captivating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Compelling, Bleak Look at 'Hate'|first=Kevin|last=Thomas|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-08/entertainment/ca-44396_1_mathieu-kassovitz|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=8 March 1996|accessdate=7 July 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zzKlcUKj?url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-08/entertainment/ca-44396_1_mathieu-kassovitz|archivedate=7 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Ide of ''[[The Times]]'' stated that ''La haine'' is "One of the most blisteringly effective pieces of urban cinema ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Haine|first=Wendy|last=Ide|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article471243.ece|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=19 August 2004|accessdate=7 July 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zzKyBCst?url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article471243.ece|archivedate=7 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film was well received upon its release in France, [[Alain Juppé]], who was Prime Minister of France at the time, commissioned a special screening of the film for the cabinet, which ministers were required to attend. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that, despite resenting some of the anti-police themes present in the film, Juppé found ''La haine'' to be "a beautiful work of cinematographic art that can make us more aware of certain realities."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

It was ranked #32 in ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's "The 100 Best Films of World Cinema" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema &amp;#124; 32.

'''Margaret Elvire, Baroness Forrest of Bunbury''' (22 October 1844 &amp;ndash; 13 June 1929 in Picton, [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]]), born '''Margaret Elvire Hamersley''', was the wife of Sir [[John Forrest]].&lt;ref name="Debrett's Peerage (1920)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage Knightage, and Companionage. 1920|date=1920|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNc7AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Baroness+Forrest%22&amp;dq=%22Baroness+Forrest%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Born in [[Le Havre]], [[France]], she was a member of the prominent and wealthy [[Hamersley family]]; her father was [[Edward Hamersley (Snr)|Edward Hamersley]] (Senior), and amongst her brothers were [[Edward Hamersley (Jnr)|Edward Hamersley]] (Junior) and [[Samuel Hamersley]].  She married Forrest in 1876 and enjoyed many years in public life, as John Forrest became the first [[Premier of Western Australia]], and later a federal politician. Their family homestead was called ''Wilberforce''.&lt;ref name=awr&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0327b.htm | title = Forrest, Margaret Elvire (1844 - 1929) | accessdate = 16 Aug 2013 | work = The Australian Women's Register | publisher = The National Foundation for Australian Women }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Forrest had a great interest in fine arts. She had an interest in native plants, and was an accomplished painter of wildflowers. She was a founding member of the [[Wilgie Club]], the first artists' society in [[Western Australia]], and exhibited six wildflower watercolours in the Wilgie First Annual Exhibition of Paintings in 1890.  After her death in 1929, her collection was bequeathed to the [[Art Gallery of Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=awr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Bernard H | last = Woodward | title = The Wilgie Sketching Club | date = 11 Dec 1889 | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3130496 | work = [[The West Australian]] | pages = 3 | accessdate = 16 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1889 [[Ellis Rowan]] joined Margaret Forrest in a painting tour. At Boolantha Station, north of [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]], and [[Geraldton]], they painted desert flowers. Their joint exhibition at the [[Perth Railway Station]] Reading Room on 5 November is thought to have been the first art exhibition ever held in the colony.&lt;ref name=awr/&gt;

Both the [[Margaret River (Kimberley region, Western Australia)|Margaret River]] and the [[Elvire River]] in the Western Australian [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region were named after her.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15610">The '''non-canonical books referenced in the Bible''' includes [[pseudepigrapha]], writings from [[Hellenistic]] and other non-Biblical cultures, and lost works of known or unknown status. By the "Bible" is meant those books recognised by most Christians and Jews as being part of [[Old Testament]] (or [[Tanakh]]) as well as those recognised by Christians alone as being part of the [[Biblical apocrypha]] or of the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanon]]. 

It may also include books of the Anagignoskomena ({{section link|Deuterocanonical books|Eastern Orthodoxy}}) that are accepted only by [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Christians]]. For the purposes of this article, "referenced" can mean direct quotations, paraphrases, or allusions, which in some cases are known only because they have been identified as such by ancient writers, or the citation of a work or author.

== Hebrew Bible ==
{{cleanup|reason=Dead links; please re-link the following external links to currently active, stable pages|date=April 2016}}

The following are mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]:
* The [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]] is mentioned in {{bibleref|Joshua|10:13}} and {{bibleref|2 Samuel|1:18}} and also referenced in {{bibleref|2 Timothy|3:8}}.&lt;ref name="oble lase"&gt;{{Citation|last=oble lase|title=Ancient Book of Jasher/Audio Version|date=2014-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKxHiZAYUAk|accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the context in the Book of Samuel, it is implied that it was a collection of poetry. [[Sefer haYashar (disambiguation)|Several books]] have claimed to be this lost text, some of which are discounted as [[pseudepigrapha]]. Certain members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] secured the copyright to a particular English translation of [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|one of these]] and republished it in 1887 in Salt Lake City.
* The [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes called ''The Book of the Wars of Yahweh''. One source says "The quotation is in lyrical form, so it is possibly a book of poetry or a hymnal...Moses quoted it, so the date of its composition must have been prior to the completion of the Pentateuch, perhaps during the wanderings in the wilderness. Nothing else is known about it, and it survives only in Moses’ quotation."[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/42]&lt;/ref&gt; Referenced at {{bibleref|Numbers|21:14}} with possible association with [[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]. The Book of the Wars of the Lord is also cited in the medieval Book of Jasher (trans. Moses Samuel c. 1840, ed. J. H. Parry 1887) Chapter 90:48 as being a collaborative record written by Moses, Joshua and the children of Israel.
* The [[Chronicles of the Kings of Israel]] and [[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah]] are mentioned in the [[Books of Kings]] ({{bibleref|1 Kings|14:19,29}}). They are said to tell of events during the reigns of Kings [[Jeroboam]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Rehoboam]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], respectively. The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel is again mentioned in {{bibleref|1 Kings|16:20}} regarding King [[Zimri (king)|Zimri]], and many other times throughout 1 and 2 Kings.
* The "[[Book of Shemaiah the Prophet|Book of Shemaiah]], and of [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo the Seer]]" (also called [[Story of the Prophet Iddo]] or ''The Annals of the Prophet Iddo'') is mentioned in the [[Books of Chronicles|2nd Book of Chronicles]]. ({{bibleref|2 Chronicles|9:29}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|12:15}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|13:22}}). Iddo was a seer who lived during the reigns of Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijah. His deeds were recorded in this book, which has been completely lost to history, save for its title. The prophet Zechariah was "the son of Iddo", but this was likely not the same [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo]]. ({{bibleref|Ezra|5:1}}, {{bibleref|Zechariah|1:1}})
* The Manner of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Also called ''The Book of Statutes'' or ''3 Samuel''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Samuel|10:25}}''.
* The [[Acts of Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icwseminary.org/lostbooks.htm Also called ''The Book of the Acts of Solomon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623175757/http://icwseminary.org/lostbooks.htm |date=2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Kings|11:41}}''.
* The [[Annals of King David]].&lt;ref&gt;Also called ''The Book of the Annals of King David'' or ''The Chronicles of King David'', which could be a reference to the rest of 1 Chronicles.[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/42]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|1 Chronicles|27:24}}''.

* The [[Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Also called ''The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced in {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|16:11}}, {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|27:7}} and {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|32:32}}''. Might be the same as [[Books of Kings|1 &amp; 2 Kings]].
* The [[Book of Jehu]],&lt;ref&gt;Also called ''The Book of Jehu the son of Hanani''&lt;/ref&gt; could be a reference to 1 Kings 16:1–7. &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|20:34}}''.
* The [[Story of the Book of Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/42 Also called ''Midrash on the Book of Kings'']&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|24:27}}''.
* The [[Acts of Uziah]]. Also called ''The Book by the prophet Isaiah''. Perhaps the same as the [[Book of Isaiah]].&lt;ref name="apologeticspress.org"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Referenced at {{bibleref|2 Chronicles|26:22}}''.

== New Testament ==
Some suggest that [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle's Greek New Testament]] lists some 132 New Testament passages that appear to be verbal allusions to [[apocrypha|paracanonical]] books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZmcEQDwpbgC&amp;pg=PA77|title=A General Introduction to the Bible: From Ancient Tablets to Modern Translations|first=David|last=Ewert|date=1 July 1990|publisher=Zondervan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Book of Jasher (2 Timothy 3:8, 2 Samuel 1:18, Joshua 10:13&lt;ref name="oble lase"/&gt;)
*[[Epistle to the Laodiceans]] ([[Colossians]] 4:16 "read the epistle from Laodicea")
*[[Life of Adam and Eve]] (2 Corinthians 11:14 "Satan as an angel of light", 12:2 "Third Heaven")&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ralph P. 2 Corinthians Word Biblical Commentary 40,&lt;/ref&gt;
*A lost section of the [[Assumption of Moses]] (2 Timothy 3:8, Jude 9 "Michael.. body of Moses")
*[[Martyrdom of Isaiah]] (Hebrews 11:37 "they were sawn in two")
*Paul's letter to the Corinthians before 1 Corinthians (1 Corinthians 5:9 "I wrote to you in my letter...")
*An unknown messianic prophecy possibly from a non-canonical source, quoted in [[Matthew 2:23]] that states "...he will be called a Nazorian." ("ὅτι Ναζωραῖος κληθήσεται"). "Nazorian" is typically rendered as "Nazarene" ("from Nazareth"), as in Acts 24:5, where Christians are referred to as "the sect of the Nazorians/Nazarenes" ("τῶν Ναζωραίων αἱρέσεως"). This is speculated to be a vague allusion to a quote by Samson in Judges 13:5 that uses a similar-sounding word: "the child shall be a Nazirite" (ναζιρ)
*An unknown version of Genesis (possibly a targum, midrash or other commentary), quoted by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:45, as a reference to Christ's being "the [[Last Adam]] who became a life-giving spirit" (οὕτως καὶ γέγραπται· Ἐγένετο ὁ πρῶτος ἄνθρωπος Ἀδὰμ εἰς ψυχὴν ζῶσαν· ὁ ἔσχατος Ἀδὰμ εἰς πνεῦμα ζῳοποιοῦν.). It has been speculated that Paul is simply paraphrasing Genesis 2:7, but there is no clear indication that this is not a complete quote.
*An unknown text quoted by Paul in 1 Corinthians 2:9, suggested by Origen to be a lost apocryphal book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_corinthians/2-9.htm|title=1 Corinthians 2:9 Commentaries: but just as it is written, "THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM."|author=|date=|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;: "But as it is written, 'No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined the things that God has prepared for those who love him." This may also be an allusion to the similar Isaiah 64:4, "For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear, nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who acts in behalf of the one who waits for Him.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-4.htm|title=Isaiah 64:4 Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.|author=|date=|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*An unknown messianic prophecy, possibly from a non-canonical source, quoted in Luke 24:46, speculated to be a vague allusion to Hosea 6:2 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=6&amp;article=778|title=Did Jesus Err when He Spoke of Prophecies about His Resurrection?|author=|date=|website=apologeticspress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;: "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day."
*An unknown messianic prophecy, possibly from a non-canonical source, quoted in Mark 9:12, speculated to be a vague allusion to Isaiah 53: "and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought."

The '''Northern Renaissance''' was the [[Renaissance]] that occurred in Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Before 1497, [[Italian Renaissance]] [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] had little influence outside Italy. From the late 15th century, its ideas spread around Europe. This influenced the [[German Renaissance]], [[French Renaissance]], [[English Renaissance]], [[Renaissance in the Low Countries]], [[Polish Renaissance]] and other national and localized movements, each with different characteristics and strengths.

In [[France]], [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] imported [[Italian art]], commissioned Italian artists (including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]), and built grand palaces at great expense, starting the [[French Renaissance]]. Trade and commerce in cities like [[Bruges]] in the 15th century and [[Antwerp]] in the 16th increased cultural exchange between Italy and the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]], however in art, and especially architecture, late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] influences remained present until the arrival of [[Baroque]] even as painters increasingly drew on Italian models.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Janson |first=H.W. |author2=Anthony F. Janson  |year=1997 |title=History of Art |edition=5th, rev. |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-8109-3442-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University|Universities]] and the printed book helped spread the spirit of the age through France, the Low Countries and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and then to [[Scandinavia]] and finally [[Early Modern Britain|Britain]] by the late 16th century. Writers and humanists such as [[Rabelais]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Desiderius Erasmus]] were greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance model and were part of the same intellectual movement. During the [[English Renaissance]] (which overlapped with the [[Elizabethan era]]) writers such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] composed works of lasting influence. The Renaissance was brought to [[Poland]] directly from Italy by artists from [[Florence]] and the Low Countries, starting the [[Polish Renaissance]].

In some areas the Northern Renaissance was distinct from the Italian Renaissance in its [[centralization]] of political power. While Italy and Germany were dominated by independent [[city-state]]s, most of [[Europe]] began emerging as [[nation-state]]s or even unions of countries. The Northern Renaissance was also closely linked to the [[Protestant Reformation]] with the resulting long series of internal and external conflicts between various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] having lasting effects.

==Overview==
Feudalism had dominated Europe for a thousand years, but was on the decline at the beginning of the Renaissance.  The reasons for this decline include the post-plague environment, the increasing use of money rather than land as a [[medium of exchange]], the growing number of serfs living as freemen, the formation of nation-states with [[Monarchy|monarchies]] interested in reducing the power of feudal lords, the increasing uselessness of feudal armies in the face of new military technology (such as [[gunpowder]]), and a general increase in agricultural productivity due to improving farming technology and methods. As in Italy, the decline of feudalism opened the way for the cultural, social, and economic changes associated with the Renaissance in Europe.

Finally, the Renaissance in Europe would also be kindled by a weakening of the Roman Catholic Church. The slow demise of feudalism also weakened a long-established policy in which church officials helped keep the population of the manor under control in return for tribute. Consequently, the early 15th century saw the rise of many secular institutions and beliefs. Among the most significant of these, [[humanism]], would lay the philosophical grounds for much of [[Renaissance art]], [[Renaissance music|music]], and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]]. [[Desiderius Erasmus]], for example, was important in spreading humanist ideas in the north, and was a central figure at the intersection of classical humanism and mounting religious questions. Forms of artistic expression which a century ago would have been banned by the church were now tolerated or even encouraged in certain circles.

The velocity of transmission of the Renaissance throughout Europe can also be ascribed to the invention of the [[printing press]]. Its power to disseminate information enhanced [[research|scientific research]], spread political ideas and generally impacted the course of the Renaissance in northern Europe. As in Italy, the printing press increased the availability of books written in both [[vernacular]] languages and the publication of new and ancient [[classical language|classical texts]] in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. Furthermore, the [[Bible]] became widely available [[Bible translations|in translation]], a factor often attributed to the spread of the Protestant Reformation.

==Age of Discovery==
{{main|Age of Discovery}}
One of the most important technological development of the Renaissance was the invention of the caravel. This combination of European and African ship building technologies for the first time made extensive trade and travel over the [[Atlantic]] feasible.  While first introduced by the Italian states and the early captains, such as [[Giovanni Caboto]], [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], who were Italian explorers, the development would end Northern Italy's role as the trade crossroads of Europe, shifting wealth and power westwards to [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[England]], and the [[Netherlands]].  These states all began to conduct extensive trade with [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], and in the [[Americas]] began extensive colonisation activities.  This period of exploration and expansion has become known as the [[Age of Discovery]].  Eventually European power spread around the globe.

==Art==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[History of painting]] --&gt;

[[Saint Bavo Cathedral]], [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. Early Netherlandish painting often included complicated [[iconography]], and art historians have debated the "hidden symbolism" of works by artists like Hubert and [[Jan van Eyck]].]]
{{see also|Early Netherlandish painting|Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Northern Mannerism}}
The detailed realism of [[Early Netherlandish painting]], led by Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the 1420s and 1430s, is today generally considered to be the beginning of the early Northern Renaissance in painting.  This detailed realism was greatly respected in Italy, but there was little reciprocal influence on the North until nearly the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;  Although the notion of a north to south-only direction of influence arose in the scholarship of [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] and was continued by [[Erwin Panofsky]], art historians are increasingly questioning its validity: Lisa Deam, "Flemish versus Netherlandish: A Discourse of Nationalism," in Renaissance Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 1 (Spring, 1998), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite frequent cultural and artistic exchange, the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]] (1500–1530)—chronologically overlapping with but unrelated to Italian [[Mannerism]]—were among the first artists in the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]] to clearly reflect Italian formal developments.  

Around the same time, [[Albrecht Dürer]] made his two trips to Italy, where he was greatly admired for his [[old master print|prints]]. Dürer, in turn, was influenced by the art he saw there and is agreed to be one of the first Northern High Renaissance painters. Other notable northern painters, such as [[Hans Holbein the Elder]] and [[Jean Fouquet]], retained a [[Gothic art|Gothic]] influence that was still popular in the north, while highly individualistic artists such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] developed styles that were imitated by many subsequent generations. Later in the 16th century Northern painters increasingly looked and travelled to Rome, becoming known as the [[Romanism (painting)|Romanists]]. The [[High Renaissance]] art of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]] and the late Renaissance stylistic tendencies of Mannerism that were in vogue had a great impact on their work.

[[Renaissance humanism]] and the large number of surviving classical artworks and monuments encouraged many Italian painters to explore Greco-Roman themes more prominently than northern artists, and likewise the famous 15th-century German and Dutch paintings tend to be religious. In the 16th century, [[mythological]] and other themes from history became more uniform amongst northern and Italian artists. Northern Renaissance painters, however, had new subject matter, such as [[landscape painting|landscape]] and [[genre painting]]. 
 
As Renaissance art styles moved through northern Europe, they changed and were adapted to local customs. In England and the northern Netherlands the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|brought religious painting almost completely to an end]]. Despite several very talented [[Artists of the Tudor Court]] in England, portrait painting was slow to spread from the elite. In France the [[School of Fontainebleau]] was begun by Italians such as [[Rosso Fiorentino]] in the latest [[Mannerist]] style, but succeeded in establishing a durable national style. By the end of the 16th century, artists such as [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Hendrik Goltzius]] collected in [[Haarlem]] in a brief but intense phase of [[Northern Mannerism]] that also spread to [[Flanders]].

==The Renaissance==
The Renaissance is one of the most interesting and disputed periods of European history. Many scholars see it as a unique time with characteristics all its own. A second group views the Renaissance as the first two to three centuries of a larger era in European history usually called early modern Europe, which began in the late fifteenth century and ended on the eve of the French Revolution (1789) or with the close of the Napoleonic era (1815). Some social historians reject the concept of the Renaissance altogether. Historians also argue over how much the Renaissance differed from the Middle Ages and whether it was the beginning of the modern world, however defined. It is also said that group views the Renaissance as the first two to three centuries of a larger era in European history usually called early modern Europe.

The '''OpenStreetMap Foundation''' is a [[company limited by guarantee]], registered in England and Wales on 22 August 2006.&lt;ref name=companieshouse /&gt;

It is a [[Foundation (non-profit)|non-profit foundation]] whose aim is to support and enable the development of freely-reusable geospatial data. As its name suggests, it is closely connected with the [[OpenStreetMap]] project, although its constitution does not prevent it supporting other projects.

== Structure ==
OSMF is a [[membership organisation]], with all members entitled to vote at a general meeting on foundation activities. OSMF members do not determine how OpenStreetMap itself operates, only the foundation.{{clarify|reason=It can be interpreted in two opposite meanings.|date=June 2018}} Membership is open to all on payment of the membership fee of £15 per year. {{Asof|2015|12}}, there were 701 members.&lt;ref name=membership /&gt;

The foundation is funded by a combination of membership fees and specific larger donations. Notably [[MapQuest]] donated $50,000 to the foundation in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coast|first=Hurricane|title=Donation to OSMF by MapQuest/AOL|url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2011/01/26/donation-to-osmf-by-mapquestaol/|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Esri]] donated an undisclosed amount in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donation from Esri|url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/03/19/esri-donation/|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2013, the foundation accepted corporate memberships in a "associated member" (non-voting) category. Founding corporate members are Geofabrik, [[Geotab]], [[Naver]], NextGIS and [[Mapbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Corporate Members|url=http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Corporate_Members|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is run by a board of seven members, including the foundation's officers: chairman, secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

In December 2015, the current board was announced:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officers &amp; Board|url=https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Officers_%26_Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Peter Barth
* Kate Chapman (Chairperson)
* Martijn van Exel
* Mikel Maron
* Paul Norman (Secretary)
* Frederik Ramm (Treasurer)
* Ilya Zverev

The foundation works in partnership with local chapters which coordinate the mapping communities of various countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Local Chapters|url=https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Local_Chapters|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Alumni ==
The society was founded in 1981 by [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]], Peter Schwabach and [[Rick Stevenson]].  Its first production was the 1982 feature film ''[[Privileged (1982 film)|Privileged]]'', starring [[Hugh Grant]], [[James Wilby]], [[Imogen Stubbs]] and [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]. The film was directed by Michael Hoffman with [[John Schlesinger]], produced by Rick Stevenson and [[Mark Bentley]] with a score by [[Rachel Portman]].

Some of the original founders of the Oxford Film Foundation, including Rick Stevenson, Michael Hoffman, [[Andy Paterson]] and [[Mark Bentley (film producer)|Mark Bentley]], went on to form the [[Oxford Film Company]] in 1984. The [[Oxford Film Company]] instituted [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] first national screenwriting competition sponsored by [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] and later produced a series of feature films, including [[Hilary and Jackie]], while the revived and renamed Oxford University Film Foundation continues to produce films with the students of [[Oxford University]].

'''Pech Merle''' is a cave which opens onto a hillside at [[Cabrerets]] in the [[Lot (département)|Lot département]] of the [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]] region in [[France]], about 35 minutes by road east of [[Cahors]]. It is one of the few [[pre-historic art|prehistoric]] [[cave painting]] sites in France that remain open to the general public. Extending for over a kilometre and a half from the entrance are caverns, the walls of which are painted with dramatic murals dating from the [[Gravettian]] culture (some 25,000 years BC). Some of the paintings and engravings, however, may date from the later [[Magdalenian]] era (16,000 years BC).

This area once had a great river flowing through it, cutting underground channels which were later used by humans for shelter and eventually for mural painting.

The cave art located in the deeper areas of the cave was discovered in 1922 by Marthe David, her brother Andre David and Henri Dutetre, three teenagers who had been exploring the cave for two years. Like other children of the area, these three had been encouraged and assisted in their exploration by Father Amedee Lemozi, the curate of Cabrerets and an amateur archaeologist who had discovered other cave paintings in the region.&lt;ref name=Lawson/&gt;

The walls of seven of the chambers at Pech Merle have fresh, lifelike images of [[woolly mammoth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.donsmaps.com/images3/mammothpechmerle.jpg |title=Mammoth, Pech Merle |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; spotted horses,&lt;ref name=Pruvost/&gt; single colour horses, bovids, reindeer, handprints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Laurie|title=Art Across Time|publisher=Mc-Graw Hill|page=34|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some humans. Footprints of children, preserved in what was once clay, have been found more than half a mile underground. In 2013 the [[Tracking in Caves|Tracking in Caves-project]] tested experience based reading of prehistoric footprints by specialised trackers of [[San people|Ju/'hoansi San]] with great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130603113353.htm |title='Tracking in caves': On the trail of pre-historic humans -- ScienceDaily |publisher=sciencedaily |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tracking-in-caves-online.de/start/projekt/ |title=project – Tracking in Caves |publisher=Tracking-in-caves-online.de |date=  |author= |accessdate= February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a six-mile radius of the site are ten other caves with prehistoric [[paleolithic art|art]] of the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period, but none of these are open to the public. During the [[Ice Age]] the caves were very probably used as places of refuge by prehistoric peoples when the area had an Arctic climate, very cold temperatures, and native animal species very different from those of the present day. It is supposed that, at some point in the past, rain and sliding earth covered the cave entrances with an airtight seal until the 20th century.

Experimental reconstruction work by French archaeologist Michel Lorblanchet has suggested that the application of the paint for some of the paintings was probably by means of a delicate spitting technique.&lt;ref name=Lorblanchet/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nova/&gt;

The cave at Pech Merle has been open to the public since 1926.&lt;ref name=PechMerleCentre/&gt; Visiting groups are limited in size and number so as not to destroy the delicate artwork with the excessive humidity, heat and [[carbon dioxide]] produced by breathing.

[[File:Masopust držíme 10.jpg|upright=1.2|thumbnail|Peruehty in [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. 1910]]
'''Perchta''' or '''Berchta''' (English: '''[[Bertha]]'''), also commonly known as '''Percht''' and other variations, was once known as a [[goddess]] in [[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions|Alpine paganism]] in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the [[Alps]]. Her name may mean "the bright one" ([[Old High German]] ''beraht, bereht'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''brehtaz'') and is probably related to the name ''Berchtentag'', meaning [[Epiphany (holiday)|the feast of the Epiphany]]. [[Eugen Mogk]] provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name ''Perchta'' to the [[Old High German]] verb ''pergan'', meaning "hidden" or "covered".&lt;ref&gt;Mogk according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perchta is often identified as stemming from the same [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] goddess  as [[Holda]] and other female figures of German folklore (see [[Frija-Frigg]]). According to [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Lotte Motz]], Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of "guardian of the beasts" and appear during the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]], when they oversee [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HiltonMotz"&gt;Motz according to Hilton 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grimm says Perchta or Berchta was known "precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria."&lt;ref name=Grimm272&gt;Grimm, 1882:272.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Erika Timm]], Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably [[Celts|Celtic]], traditions of the Alpine regions after the [[Migration Period]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Timm according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names of Perchta ==
Perchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names ''Perahta'' and ''Berchte'' as the main names (in his heading), followed by ''Berchta'' in Old High German, as well as ''Behrta'' and ''Frau Perchta''. In [[Baden]], [[Swabia]], [[Switzerland]] and Slovenian regions, she was often called ''Frau Faste'' (the lady of the [[Ember days]]) or [[Pehta]] or 'Kvaternica', in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Elsewhere she was known as ''Posterli,'' ''Quatemberca'' and ''Fronfastenweiber''.&lt;ref name="Ginzburg"&gt;&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;Ginzburg&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern [[Austria]], in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as ''Quantembermann'', in German, or ''Kvaternik'', in Slovene (the man of the four [[Ember days]]). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is ''[[Berchtold]].''&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional variations of the name include ''Berigl'', ''Berchtlmuada'', ''Perhta-Baba'', ''Zlobna Pehta'', ''Bechtrababa'', ''Sampa'', ''Stampa'', ''Lutzl'', ''Zamperin'', ''Pudelfrau'', ''Zampermuatta'' and ''Rauweib''.

==Depiction==
In some descriptions, Perchta has two [[shapeshifting|forms]]; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.

In many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could [[shapeshift]] to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German "Berhte mit dem fuoze", French "Berthe au grand pied", Latin "Berhta cum magno pede", Italian " Berta dai gran piè", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): "It is apparently a [[swan maiden]]'s foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the [[treadle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:280&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

== Traditional narratives ==
Initially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30035166?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Smith, John B. "Perchta the Belly-Slitter and Her Kin: A View of Some Traditional Threatening Figures, Threats and Punishments." ''Folklore'' 115.2 (2004): 167-86]&lt;/ref&gt; In the folklore of [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]], Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles.  She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of [[flax]] or wool during the year.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"&gt;Frazer 1920:240.&lt;/ref&gt; She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.&lt;ref name=Grimm272/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

The cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for ''Fraw Percht'' and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the ''Thesaurus pauperum'' (1468) and by [[Thomas Ebendorfer]] von Haselbach in ''De decem praeceptis'' (1439).

Later canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: [[Holda]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Herodias]], [[Richella]] and [[Abundia]].

== Related beings ==
[[Image:Perchtenmaske.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A ''Perchten'' mask]]

Grimm thought [[Holda]] is her equivalent while the [[Weisse Frauen]] may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.

The word ''[[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions#Perchten|Perchten]]'' is plural for '''Perchta''', and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to "bring luck and wealth to the people." The other form is the ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer 1920:242-243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;Wagner 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, ''[[The Devil|der Teufel]]'' is viewed as the most ''schiach'' ("ugly") ''Percht''  and ''Frau Perchta'' as the most ''schön'' ("beautiful") ''Percht''.

In Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with [[Befana|La Befana]], who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are good or a lump of coal if they are bad.&lt;ref&gt;Illes, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
According to [[Jacob Grimm]] (1882), Perchta was spoken of in [[Old High German]] in the 10th century as '''Frau Berchta''' and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of [[Holda]].  He believed she was the feminine equivalent of [[Berchtoldstag|Berchtold]], and was sometimes the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]]. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hopkin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7A_XAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=perchta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0u82l3ozOAhXKaD4KHVgXCJkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Hopkin, David. "Folklore and the Historian", ''The Folklore Historian'', Vol. 17, Simon Bronner, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern celebrations==
In contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a "rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children".&lt;ref name=Hopkin/&gt;
  
Today in Austria, particularly [[Salzburg]], where she is said to wander through [[Hohensalzburg Castle]] in the dead of night,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tBM6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=perchta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Yfmva8mcM&amp;sig=BsxUJZK-txAVoOjjm5mGzJ5TVUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV-Pnl2ozOAhXGbj4KHaVRDoU4MhDoAQgpMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Vivian, Mrs. Herbert. "The Perchten Dancers of Salzburg", ''The Wide World Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly of True Narrative, Adventure, Travel, Customs and Sport'', Vol. 21, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival [[Fastnacht]]). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called ''Perchten''.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt;

In the [[Pongau]] region of Austria large processions of ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten") and ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref name=Gallon&gt;[http://www.iga.stir.ac.uk/showblog.php?id=186 Gallon, Stephanie. "Christmas Demons II - Krampus and Perchta", International Gothic Association, December 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other regional variations include the ''Tresterer'' in the Austrian [[Pinzgau]] region, the stilt dancers in the town of [[Unken]], the ''Schnabelpercht'' ("trunked Percht") in the [[Unterinntal]] region and the ''Glöcklerlaufen'' ("bell-running") in the [[Salzkammergut]]. A number of large [[Ski resort|ski-resort]]s have turned the tradition into a [[tourist]] attraction drawing large crowds every winter.

'''''Port Ruysdael''''' is an 1826 [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the English painter [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It is in the collection of the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in New Haven.

Turner painted this as a tribute to [[Dutch Golden Age]] painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]. There is no port by the name of Port Ruysdael. In 1844 he painted another tribute to Ruisdael, named ''Fishing Boats bringing a Disabled Ship into Port Ruysdael'' which is at the [[Tate Gallery]] in London. {{sfn|Bachrach|1981}}

A '''production team''' is the group of technical staff who produce a play, [[television show]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]], or film.  Generally the term refers to all individuals responsible for the technical aspects of creating of a particular product, regardless of where in the process their expertize is required, or how long they are involved in the project.  For example, in a theatrical performance, the production team includes not only the [[running crew]], but also the [[theatrical producer]], [[designer]]s and [[theatre direction]].

A [[production company]] in [[filmmaking]] is composed of a [[film crew]] and a [[television crew]] in [[video production]].

In music, the term ''production team'' typically refers to a group of individuals filling the role of "[[record producer]]" usually reserved for one individual. Some examples of musical production teams include [[Matmos]] and [[D-Influence]].

'''Chumash rock art''' is a genre of paintings on caves, mountains, cliffs, or other living rock surfaces, created by the [[Chumash people]] of southern California. [[Pictograph]]s and [[petroglyph]]s are common through interior California, the rock painting tradition thrived until the 19th century. Chumash rock art is considered to be some of the most elaborate rock art tradition in the region.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}}

The Chumash are probably best known for the pictographs. Which were brightly colored paintings of humans, animals, and abstract circles. They were thought to be part of a religious ritual.

==Chumash people==
{{main|Chumash people}}
The Chumash lived in the present-day counties of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], and [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] in southern California for 14,000 years. They were a maritime, [[hunter-gatherer]] society whose livelihood was based on the sea. They developed excellent skills for catching fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. Beyond fishing, however, they were also skilled in creating rock art. Hudson and Blackburn define rock art as "an aesthetic, symbolic representation of significant concepts and entities that is painted on or carved into a rock surface." Rock art may have been created by [[shamanism|shamans]] during [[vision quest]]s, most commonly in the form of [[pictogram|pictographs]] (paintings on rock), but sometimes [[petroglyph]]s (engravings on rock) as well. No one is absolutely certain about the meaning of the Chumash Rock art, but scholars generally agree that it is connected with religion and astronomy.

==Locations==
[[File:PaintedCaveParkCA.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of Painted Cave]]

Chumash rock art is almost invariably found in caves or on cliffs in the mountains, although some small, portable painted rocks have been recorded by [[Campbell Grant]]. The rock art sites are always found near streams, springs, or some other source of permanent water. In his research of southern California rock art, Grant recorded numerous sites from different areas that were all close to a water source. He found twelve painted sites in the highest parts of the mountainous Chumash territory, the [[Ventureno|Ventureño]] area. The [[Ventura River|Ventura]] and [[Santa Clara River (California)|Santa Clara]] Rivers and several coastal streams flow through this area. He also recorded forty-one painted rock art sites in the [[Cuyama Valley]] region (north of the Ventureño area), where the [[Sisquoc River]] flows between the [[San Rafael Mountains]] and the [[Sierra Madre Mountains (California)|Sierra Madre Mountains]]. The most easily accessible example is at [[Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park, California|Painted Cave State Historic Park]], which is located in canyons above [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}}

[[File:Aerial-OverPaintedRock.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Painted Rock]]
[[Painted Rock (San Luis Obispo County, California)|Painted Rock]] is a free-standing rock on the [[Carrizo Plain]] near the Sierra Madre Mountains at the southern tip of the [[Great Central Valley]].{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}} The interior alcove of the horseshoe-shaped rock features pictographs by Chumash, neighboring tribes, and non-Native Americans. 

The [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]] petroglyphs are located in the [[Simi Hills]] in [[Ventura County]]. They are on the private land of [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne|Rocketdyne's]] [[Santa Susana Field Laboratory]] (SSFL), which has protected them from public harm since 1947. The SSFL is closed and in the initial stage of a significant toxins and radionuclides site investigation and cleanup. [[Boeing]], U.S. DOE, and NASA (current property owners and responsible parties) and the [[California Department of Toxic Substances Control]] (DTSC) are responsible to protect Chumash and other historical elements during the extensive SSFL work.{{sfn|Guttenberg|Corbett|Knight|2010}}

==Religious aspects of art==
[[File:PaintedCaveArtCA.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Interior of Painted Cave]]
[[Chumash traditional narratives]] in oral history say that religious specialists, known as '''alchuklash'' created the rock art.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=129}} Non-Chumash people call these practitioners [[medicine men]] or [[shaman]]s.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=130}} 
According to David Whitley, shamanism is "a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) and the supernatural (or sacred realm and its spirits)." In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shaman's village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a "portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural." The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or [[altered state of consciousness]]. In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or [[jimsonweed]], shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears. Spirit helpers almost never took the form of an animal that was an important source of food, because it was 'taboo for a shaman to eat meat from the species of his helper.'

==Subject matter and materials==
Chumash rock art depicts images like humans, animals, celestial bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably and appear to be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained [[hematite]] or [[iron oxide]], while yellow came from [[limonite]], blue and green from [[copper]] or [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], white from [[kaolin clay]]s or [[gypsum]], and black from [[manganese]] or [[charcoal]]. Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.

==Interpretations==
[[File:ChildAdultSun.jpg|thumb|Color enhanced Chumash glyphs]]
In the early 20th century, non-Natives began studying California rock art, including a number of archaeologists, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Alfred Kroeber]]. Because of some commonly occurring symbols in paintings, it was believed that at least portions of the rock art depicted themes of fertility, water, and rain; however, the Native California Indians are very reluctant to talk to anyone about the rock art and some deny any knowledge of it altogether. The natives' hesitancy to discuss the art led archaeologists to believe that they had no idea of the origin of the pictographs. Kroeber recorded some of his thoughts on the origins of the rock art in 1925.

"The cave paintings of [Southern California]...represent a particular art, or local style or cult. This can be connected, in all probability, with the technological art of the Chumash. [An] association with...religion is also to be considered, although nothing positive is known in the matter. Many of the pictures may have been made by shamans; and it is quite possible that medicine men were not connected with the making of any."{{sfn|Grant|1965|p=80}}

Kroeber was unsure about what specific associations could be made between the paintings and the artists. Julian Steward researched California rock art as well, and in 1929 he deduced that the only way to understand the meanings of the petroglyphs and pictographs was to compare them with the art and symbolism of the different Indian groups and their respective culture areas. In his book ''Petroglyphs of California'', Steward wrote: 
"It has frequently been stated that the petroglyphs and pictographs are meaningless figures made in idle moments by some primitive artist. The facts of distribution, however, show that this cannot be true. Since design elements and style are grouped in limited areas, the primitive artist must have made the inscriptions with something in mind. ... He executed, not random drawings, but figures similar to those made in other parts of the same area."{{sfn|Steward|1929|pp=224–225}}{{sfn|Grant|1965|p=91}}

At Painted Cave, a circle enclosing five spokes surrounded by other circles–some spoked, some rayed–is thought to represent the [[solar eclipse]] of November 24, 1677. Pinwheel shapes, dots, and concentric circles are believed to be celestial bodies. Figures combining human and animal features represent states of transformation the '''alchuklash'' experienced. Certain animals, such as rattlesnakes and frogs, are believed to represent spirit helpers.{{sfn|Penney|2004|p=130}}

== Arborglyph ==
{{Main|Arborglyph}}

In 2006, an arborglyph on an oak tree in the [[Santa Lucia Range]] in San Luis Obispo County was discovered to be Chumash art. The tree, locally known as the "scorpion tree," was originally believed to have been the work of cowboys. However, archaeologists believe it to be the only known Native American arborglyph in the western United States. The work on the tree is theorized to be correlated to the movement of celestial bodies. If true, it would demonstrate that Chumash art was likely used as astronomical calendars.{{sfn|Saint Onge|Johnson|Talaugon|2009}}

==Dating==
Concerning the age of the paintings, Grant says "a [[radiocarbon test]] on pigment from a Santa Barbara area pictograph site showed that the sample was 'not over 2,000 years old.'"{{sfn|Grant|1965|p=123}}

'''Sophistication''' has come to mean a few things, but its original definition was "to denature, or simplify". Today it is common as a measure of refinement—displaying [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], [[wisdom]] and subtlety rather than crudeness, [[stupidity]] and [[vulgarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OjwEQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Sophistication |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History |author=Faye Hammill|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the perception of [[social class]], sophistication can be linked with concepts such as [[social status|status]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] and [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;

== Scope of sophistication ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class.  Sophistication can be seen as "a form of snobbery," or as "among the most desirable of human qualities."&lt;ref&gt;

A study of style conveys an idea of the range of possible elements through which one can demonstrate sophistication in [[elegance]] and [[fashion]], covering the art of "[...] the shoemaker, the hairdresser, the cosmetologist, the cookbook writers, the chef, the diamond merchant, the couturieres, and the fashion queens, the inventors of the folding umbrella ... and of champagne."&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], ''sophia'' was the special [[insight]] of [[poet]]s and [[prophet]]s.  This then became the wisdom of [[philosophers]] such as [[sophists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sophistication |author=Mark Backman |chapter=The Roots of Our Sophistication |isbn=978-0-918024-91-6 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But their use of [[rhetoric]] to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading.

The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King [[Louis XIV]] (reigned 1643–1715).&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last       = DeJean
| first      = Joan
| title         = The essence of style: how the French invented high fashion, fine food, chic cafes, style, sophistication, and glamour

| publisher = Free Press
| location  = New York
| isbn      = 978-0-7432-6413-6
| page      = 3
| quote         = In the sixteenth century, the French were not thought of as the most elegant or the most sophisticated European nation. By the early eighteenth century, however, people all over Europe declared that 'the French are stylish' or 'the French know good food,' just as they said, 'the Dutch are clean.' France had acquired a sort of monopoly on culture, style, and luxury living, a position that it has occupied ever since. [...] Beginning in the late seventeenth century, travelers were saying what novelists and filmmakers are still repeating: travel to Paris was guaranteed to add a touch of magic to every life. [...] [F]rom this moment on, that touch of magic became widely desired: elegance, luxury, and sophistication became factors to be reckoned with.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic [[sensibility|sensibilities]] and refined elegance of Regency [[dandy|dandies]] such as [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840) became fashionable and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=413279&amp;sectioncode=26 |journal=[[Times Higher Education]] |author=Deborah Longworth |date=2 Sep 2010 |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of sophistication ==

Recognised varieties of sophistication include:

* cultural sophistication&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

| pages      = 91–92
| quote         = The pursuit of cultural sophistication (Bourdieu's cultural capital) was until recently a niche phenomenon in America. It existed mainly in 'old-money' families, which dominated elite breeding grounds (prep schools, Ivy league universities, elite liberal arts colleges), and in the small Bohemian circles in the country's biggest cities. [...] The transformation of the American class dynamic from a single-minded striving for economic abundance to a multi-dimensional striving for sophistication in addition to abundance – a mixture of status pursuits more typical of Europe – was seeded in the 1960s.                   = adam markovich
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;(or culturedness)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7015">[[File:Avery Fisher Hall.jpg|thumb|Philharmonic Hall (today Avery Fisher Hall), Lincoln Center, where Chávez's Sixth Symphony was premiered in 1964]]
'''Symphony No. 6''' is an orchestral work by [[Carlos Chávez]], composed in 1961–62.

==History==
The Sixth Symphony was commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] in celebration of their 1962–63 opening season in [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]. Composition was completed in 1962 and a date was scheduled for the symphony's premiere in the spring of 1963, but Chávez continued revisions to the score and the date had to be postponed. It was finally premiered in New York on 7 May 1964 in Philharmonic Hall, Lincoln Center, by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and the New York Philharmonic, to whom the score is dedicated ({{harvnb|Klein|1964}}; {{harvnb|Orbón|1987c|loc=80}}).

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, percussion (two players), and strings.

==Analysis==
The work is in three movements:
#Allegro energico
#Adagio molto cantabile
#Con anima

Far from the experimental approaches Chávez  adopted in his earlier symphonies, the Sixth accepts the classical forms. The first movement is a [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], beginning with a C-major theme recalling the symphonic style of the Romantic era. A bitonal transition leads to the second theme, in the dominant key of G. After extensive development, the recapitulation is followed by a developmental coda, including a strict mirror canon on the first theme. The movement fades to nothing in a constant march in [[Tuplet (music)|triplets]] {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=75–77}}.

The second movement functions as a short but intense interlude between the outer movements. It falls into two sections, the first beginning in the brass and woodwinds, finally giving way to the violins. This is followed, after a descending transitional passage in the low brass, by the second section, where the double basses present the theme that will form the basis of the finale. There is a suggestion of the contrapuntal atmosphere, and even an anticipation of the two counterthemes of the first variation of the following movement {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=77}}.

The symphony closes with a magisterial [[passacaglia]]. After the announcement of the bass ostinato in the tuba, there follow thirty-four variations, a [[fugue]] with two expositions, and then a further seven variations to conclude. The twenty-ninth variation evokes a [[Johannes Brahms|Brahmsian]] sound as a culmination, reflecting the illustrious antecedent Chávez has accepted as his model, and the main theme from the first movement returns in the thirtieth. The last statement of the bass theme brings the movement to an imposing close in C major {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=77–78}}.

[[File:Bihari Sándor Önarckép.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1880s?)]]
'''Sándor Bihari''' (19 May 1855, [[Rézbánya]] - 28 March 1906, [[Budapest]]) was a [[Jewish]] Hungarian [[Genre art|genre]] painter.

== Life ==
Born to a [[Jewish]] family, Sándor spent his childhood in [[Nagyvárad]]. Originally, he worked with his father as a decorative painter. In 1874, he moved to Budapest, where he did [[photo manipulation|retouching]] at a photography studio while attending a drawing school operated by [[Bertalan Székely]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.mke.hu/lyka/05/353-365-bihari.htm Béla Fónagy: Bihari Sándor] @ Művészet (from 1906)&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he used his meager resources on a move to Vienna, where he hoped to enroll in the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]]. At first he had to find work as a retoucher again and might have remained in that position, had he not received a gift of 600 [[Forint]]s from Székely, which enabled him to quit his job and enter the Academy.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt;

He returned to his hometown, where he spent three years struggling as a portrait painter until a benefactor who liked his work provided the means for him to study in Paris. He travelled there in 1883, where he studied at the [[Académie Julian]] with [[Jean-Paul Laurens]]&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; and improved his technique by copying the [[Old Masters]] at the [[Louvre]]. While there, he became acquainted with [[plein-air]] painting and [[Impressionism (art)|Impressionism]], which had a decisive influence on his style. Upon returning to Hungary, he settled in [[Szolnok]], a popular gathering place for painters, and would later become one of the founders of an art colony there.

He continued to travel, making lengthy visits to Italy especially, until his health began to fail in 1893.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; During his final years, he lived in Budapest but continued to spend his summers in Szolnok. In 1896, he was awarded the [[Order of Franz Joseph]].

'''Tendril perversion''', often referred to in context as simply '''perversion''', is a geometric phenomenon found in [[helix|helical]] structures such as plant [[tendril]]s, in which a helical structure forms that is divided into two sections of opposite [[chirality]], with a transition between the two in the middle.&lt;ref name=MacMillan2002/&gt; A similar phenomenon can often be observed in kinked helical cables such as [[telephone handset]] cords.&lt;ref name="LiuEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0093183| pmid = 24759785| title = Structural Transition from Helices to Hemihelices| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = e93183| year = 2014| last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Huang | first2 = J. | last3 = Su | first3 = T. | last4 = Bertoldi | first4 = K. | last5 = Clarke | first5 = D. R. | pmc=3997338|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...993183L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phenomenon was known to [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref name=Goriely2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/research/researchgroups/applied/siam/resources/SIAM_Day_2013_AGoriely_lecture.pdf|title=Inversion, Rotation, and Perversion in Mechanical Biology: From Microscopic Anisotropy to Macroscopic Chirality | author=Alain Goriely | date = 2013 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote in 1865,

{{cquote|
A tendril ... invariably becomes twisted in one part in one direction, and in another part in the opposite direction...
This curious and symmetrical structure has been noticed by several botanists, but has not been sufficiently
explained.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, "On the movements and habits of climbing plants", ''Journal of the Linnean Society'', 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The term "tendril perversion" was coined by Goriely and Tabor in 1998 based on the word ''perversion'' found in the 19th Century science literature. "Perversion" is a transition from one chirality to another and was known to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who attributed it to the [[topologist]] [[J. B. Listing]].&lt;ref name=Goriely2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise of Electricity and Magnetism|author=James Clerk Maxwell|year=1873|publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford|page=|quote=The operation of passing from one system to the other is called by Listing, ''Perversion''. The reflection of an object in a mirror image is a perverted image of the object.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tendril perversion can be viewed as an example of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], in which the strained structure of the tendril adopts a [[minimum total potential energy principle|configuration of minimum energy]] while preserving zero overall twist.&lt;ref name="MacMillan2002" /&gt; 

Tendril perversion has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Gerbode et al. have made experimental studies of the coiling of [[cucumber]] tendrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1223304| pmid = 22936777| title = How the Cucumber Tendril Coils and Overwinds| journal = Science| volume = 337| issue = 6098| pages = 1087–91| year = 2012| last1 = Gerbode | first1 = S.

Generalized tendril perversions were put forward by Silva et al., to include perversions that can be intrinsically produced in elastic filaments, leading to a multiplicity of geometries and dynamical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Pedro E.

'''''The Beacon Light''''' is a painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]]. It was given to the [[National Museum of Wales]] by the Davies sisters ([[Gwendoline Davies|Gwendoline]] and [[Margaret Davies|Margaret]]). For some time it was regarded as a fake, but is now accepted as authentic.

==Provenance==
''Beacon Light'' was among a number of works that were said to have been given by Turner to his mistress, Mrs Booth. It was sold at Christie's by her son, John Pound (her son by her first marriage).

In 1922, it was sold as a genuine Turner and the Davies sisters (Gwendoline and Margaret) spent £2,625 to buy it.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Luke; "The Davies sisters' Turners in Cardiff"; ''British Art Journal'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ Museum of Wales] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011163636/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/industry-to-impressionism/ |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Gwendoline Davies, it was among seven works by Turner that were donated to the National Museum of Wales.

==Doubts as to authenticity==
Shortly after the donation, doubts were raised about its authenticity and that of two other Turners donated by the sisters.

Butlin and Joll dated the work to c1835-40 and suggest that it is a fragment of a larger canvas 'which has certainly been worked on by a hand other than Turner's'.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Martin, and Evelyn Joli. ''The Paintings of J. M. W. Turner''&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it was believed to depict the Needles on the Isle of Wight

It was removed from display, but did appear in a 2007 exhibition. It returned to display in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/art/online/?action=show_item&amp;item=1836 National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fake or Fortune?''==
It was featured on the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' Scientific analysis showed that the paint used was consistent with Turner's known usage and that the same paint had been used for the whole of the picture. An X-ray showed that a lighthouse at the summit of the bluff had been painted over. [[Philip Mould]] and [[Bendor Grosvenor]] were able to establish that the scene was near [[Margate]] and not on the [[Isle of Wight]] as had been previously believed. The evidence for the painting's authenticity was presented to [[Martin Butlin]], the co-author of the Turner ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'', who accepted that the work was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Turner: A Miscarriage of Justice?|series = Fake or Fortune?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n39kg|accessdate = 10 December 2012|network = BBC|date = 23 September 2012|seriesno=2|number=2|transcript =| transcripturl =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bird of Peace''''' is a [[porcelain]] [[statue]] of [[Mute Swan|mute swans]] gifted by [[Richard Nixon]] to [[China|The People's Republic of China]] during his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 diplomatic visit]] to the country. The statue was designed and crafted by [[Helen Boehm]] and [[Edward Marshall Boehm|E. M. Boehm Studios]].&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/02/26/page/2/article/swan-gift-to-mao-is-peace-bird|title=Swan Gift to Mao is Peace Bird|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Nixon and China===
The swans were originally commissioned by Nixon in 1969 to join his [[oval office]] collection of works by the late [[Edward Marshall Boehm]]. [[Helen Boehm]], Edward's [[widow]] and operator of his business posthumously, was the organizer of this collection for Nixon. One day, after presenting a selection of 18 porcelain birds for Nixon's choosing (intended as gifts to heads of state for his upcoming [[NATO]] tour), he expressed fatigue toward [[dove]]s and hawks. Helen suggested finding a new bird to be an updated symbol of peace, one with less political baggage than say the dove, to which Nixon said "That's a fine idea."&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aparch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Priceless-Sculpture-Returns-From-Moscow-Exhibit-Shattered/id-ed48b0f11cc86d0ed3f76087de5a24a6|title=Priceless Sculpture Returns From Moscow Exhibit Shattered|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helen subsequently wrote to [[ornithology|ornithologists]] around the world, seeking suggestions for what that new peace bird ought to be. Among the responses, and her own research, both gathered over several months, the mute swan was most mentioned, frequently having been cited for its tranquility, even over the traditional [[dove]]. Helen decades later would express that the mute swan captures "serenity and purity, [and is] a bird that had been associated with peace throughout history and in mythology. [...] The mute swan's range is worldwide; it came to the shores of America during the nineteenth century. Perhaps its most important characteristic is that it speaks with a soft voice."&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aparch"/&gt;

Boehm and a team of 14 porcelain artists and craftsmen then worked for two years to produce the [[sculpture]], using 10 tons of plaster to create the master [[Molding (process)|molds]]. The sculpture featured a male and female mute swan, three infant swans, a natural setting of rocks and grass. Formed from roughly 60,000 sculpted lines, it weighed roughly 250 lbs, and stood over 42 inches high on a 3 foot base. The softness and detail in the feathers of the swans make it  "hard to believe [they] are made of porcelain".&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chinadaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2008-09/17/content_7032905.htm|title=History seen through gifts|publisher=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aparch"/&gt;

Upon Boehm notifying the [[White House]] of the completion of the statue in 1971, she was asked to make one additional change: because Nixon had decided to present the swans to [[Mao Zedong]] as a gift during the U.S President's upcoming visit to China, that a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] and [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]] should be added to the statue. This request was fulfilled.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;

During Nixon's visit the following year, he presented the swans to [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] in a gift-giving ceremony, and introduced the sculpture's artist (presumably Helen Boehm).&lt;ref name="chinadaily"/&gt;

===Original Copies===
A total of two other copies were made before the molds were destroyed in 1974.

The first copy was made for the [[White House Historical Association|White House Historical Society]], finished in 1975. This copy was later loaned to a six-week exhibit in Russia, opened May 16, 1987 and organized by Helen Boehm, [[Raisa Gorbacheva]], [[Vassili Zakharon]] (Russian Minister of Culture), and sponsored by [[Armand Hammer]] (longtime friend of Helen). During transit back to the U.S. and upon inspection, the statue was found permanently damaged, with one of the necks severed, and the feathers broken into hundreds of pieces. Helen described the situation as "The Peace Birds are in pieces. They're completely busted. I've been crying for two days." The statue was one of half of 48 damaged in transit. The statue was packed by Boehm employees, shipped via [[Lufthansa]] and [[Finnair]], arrived at [[JFK Airport]], and was insured for an unknown amount. "One cannot place a value on them. They are priceless because they are not replaceable," Helen remarked further.&lt;ref name="aparch" /&gt;

The second copy was later auctioned in 1976 for a wildlife benefit, selling for $150,000. The donor subsequently gifted the statue to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. At the time, this was the highest price paid for a porcelain sculpture.&lt;ref name="aparch" /&gt;

== Present Day ==
Today, the original statue of swans reside at the '''State Gifts''' exhibit in the [[National Museum of China]], viewable behind glass box to museum visitors. The only other extant copy remains in the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chnmuseum.cn/tabid/236/Default.aspx?ExhibitionLanguageID=276|title=State Gifts:Historical Testament to Friendly Exchanges}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aparch" /&gt;

'''''The Egg and I''''', first published in 1945, is a humorous [[memoir]] by American author [[Betty MacDonald]] about her adventures and travels as a young wife on a chicken farm on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. The book is based on the author's experiences as a newlywed in trying to acclimate and operate a small chicken farm with her first husband Robert Heskett from 1927 to 1931 near [[Chimacum, Washington]]. On visits with her family in [[Seattle]], she told stories of their tribulations, which greatly amused them. In the 1940s, MacDonald's sisters strongly encouraged her to write a book about these experiences. ''The Egg and I'' was MacDonald's first attempt at writing a book.

==Plot==
MacDonald begins her book with a summary description of her childhood and family.  Her father was an engineer, and moved frequently with his family throughout the West.  Her mother's theory that a wife must support her husband in his career comes into play when the author marries a friend of her brother ("Bob") who soon admits that his dream is to leave his current office job and start a chicken [[ranch]].  Knowing nothing about ranching, but eager to support her husband, the author encourages the dream but is unprepared for the primitive conditions that exist on the ranch he purchases.

From this "set up" the book turns to anecdotal stories that rely upon the proverbial "fish out of water" tales that pit MacDonald against her situation and her surroundings, such as the struggle to keep up with the need for water, which needs to be hand carried from a pond to the house until a tank is installed or keeping a fire going in "Stove" or the constant care that chicks need.  At one point a guest expresses envy of MacDonald and her husband, as she thinks they live a life full of fresh air and beautiful scenery, which is then followed by MacDonald pointing out that while the guest had lounged in bed that morning, she and her husband had been up before sunrise working for several hours, and then again the couple had stayed up long into the night after the guest had gone to bed.

==Release==
First published by the [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|J. B. Lippincott Company]] on October 3, 1945, ''The Egg and I'' received laudatory reviews and soon appeared on the best-seller list.  The book was a blockbuster success as a novel, being reprinted on a nearly monthly basis for the next two years.

On September 12, 1946, the specially-bound one-millionth copy of the book was presented to MacDonald by [[Washington (state)|Washington]] [[Governor of Washington|Governor]] [[Monrad Wallgren]] at a luncheon in [[Seattle]].

==Adaptations==
[[Image:Egg &amp; i.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the 1947 film|alt=Film poster featuring Betty and Bob, and Ma and Pa Kettle]]
In April 1946 [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]] announced the purchase of the film rights for ''[[The Egg and I (film)|The Egg and I]]'' for $100,000, plus a percentage of profits.&lt;ref name=Universal&gt;''The New York Times'', April 19, 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;26. "'EGG AND I' BOUGHT FOR COLBERT FILM; International Pays $100,000 Down to Betty MacDonald — Three Openings Today of Local Origin".  (Accessed 20 March 2007, via ProQuest, ''New York Times (1857–Current File)'', Document ID 84635734)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudette Colbert]] and [[Fred MacMurray]] were cast in the lead roles, with [[Marjorie Main]] and [[Percy Kilbride]] cast in the roles of Ma and Pa Kettle. The film, loosely based on the book, was released in 1947. Main received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and the film inspired eight subsequent ''[[Ma and Pa Kettle]]'' features.

A 15-minute daytime TV series based on the book aired on CBS from September 3, 1951 to August 1, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeil |first=Alex |date=1991 |title=Total Television |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |page=231 |isbn=0-14-015736-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program starred Bob Craven and Patricia Kirkland.

=={{anchor|Post publishing lawsuits}}Post-publication lawsuits==
Following the success of the book and film, lawsuits were filed by members of the [[Chimacum, Washington|Chimacum]] community. They claimed that characters in ''The Egg and I'' had been based on them, and that they had been identified in their community as the real-life versions of those characters, subjecting them to ridicule and humiliation. The family of Albert and Susanna Bishop claimed they had been negatively portrayed as the Kettles. Their oldest son Edward and his wife Ilah Bishop filed the first lawsuit, which was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

The second lawsuit was filed against MacDonald, publisher J. B. Lippincott Company, and [[The Bon Marché]] (a Seattle department store which had promoted and distributed the book) for total damages of $975,000, as sought by nine other members of the Bishop family ($100,000 each) and Raymond H. Johnson ($75,000), who claimed he had been portrayed as the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] "Crowbar." The case was heard before a jury in Judge William J. Willkins' (who was also one of the presiding judges at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]) courtroom in [[King County Superior Court]] beginning February 6, 1951. MacDonald testified that the characters in her book were composite sketches of various people she had met. The defense produced evidence that the Bishop family had actually been trying to profit from the fame the book and movie had brought them, including testimony that son Walter Bishop had had his father Albert appear onstage at his [[Belfair, Washington]], dance hall with chickens under his arm, introducing him as "Pa Kettle."  On February 10, 1951, the jury decided in favor of the defendants.&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;''The New York Times'', February 22, 1951, p.&amp;nbsp;40. "'Egg and I' Author Wins Suit",  (Accessed 20 March 2007, via ProQuest, ''New York Times (1857–Current File)'', Document ID 87109916)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One reviewer noted that her treatment of the [[rural]] [[working class]] "spawned a perception of Washington as a land of eccentric country bumpkins like Ma and Pa Kettle."&lt;ref name=HistoryLink&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=156 |title=MacDonald, Betty (1908–1958) |website=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Recordings of the theme song from the film were made by [[Sammy Kaye]] for Victor and [[Dinah Shore]] for Columbia.

The road leading west from Beaver Valley Road ([[Washington State Route 19|State Route 19]]) to the former site of MacDonald's farm is now named "Egg and I Road".

"The Egg and I" is the title of a song performed by [[The Seatbelts]] for the [[anime]] ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''.

The Egg and I is the name of a breakfast restaurant with around 100 locations nationwide. The owners were inspired by the book. &lt;ref&gt;https://theeggandirestaurants.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

It was incorporated as a not-for-profit in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.vtape.org/history|website=www.vtape.org|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vtape provided organizational assistance for independent art exhibitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s during conditions of intensive censorship of artists' film and video works by the Government of Ontario.&lt;ref name="AGOSteele"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vtape’s Toronto New Work Shows Revisited - Program 1 {{!}} AGO Art Gallery of Ontario|url=https://www.ago.net/vtape1|website=www.ago.net|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal Collection==
Vtape began a dedicated collection of video works by Aboriginal artists in 1994, after being approached by [[Zachary Longboy]]. It is the only specialized collection within the organization, and the only collection at Vtape that will accept works on film and works by first-time artists. Longboy helped develop the collection as Vtape's Aboriginal outreach coordinator, and was succeeded by [[Cynthia Lickers-Sage]]. As outreach coordinator, Lickers-Sage broadened the collection's reach through the establishment of the [[ImagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival|imagineNative Film Festival]] in 1998. The foundation of the [[Aboriginal Digital Access Project]] in 2012 broadened access to this special collection by allowing curators from around the world to preview video and film works online, rather than at the archive in person.&lt;ref name="Quanz" /&gt;
