{{Years in film}}

The decade of the '''1980s''' in [[Western world|Western]] cinema saw the return of studio-driven pictures, coming from the filmmaker-driven [[New Hollywood]] era of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ebert, Roger|author2=Bordwell, David|title=Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert|date=2008|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago and London|isbn=978-0226182018|page=xvii|edition=Paperback|url=https://www.amazon.com/Awake-Dark-Best-Roger-Ebert/dp/0226182010|accessdate=26 February 2016|quote=In his pluralism, [Roger] Ebert proved a more authentic cinephile than many of his contemporaries. They tied their fortunes to the Film Brats and then suffered the inevitable disappointments of the 1980's return to studio-driven pictures.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period was when "[[high concept]]" films gained popularity, where movies were to be easily marketable and understandable, and, therefore, they had short cinematic [[Plot (narrative)|plots]] that could be summarized in one or two sentences. The modern Hollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] is the most popular film format from the 1980s. Producer [[Don Simpson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fleming|first=Charles|title=High concept: Don Simpson and the Hollywood culture of excess|year=1998|publisher=Doubleday|ISBN=978-0-385-48694-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually credited with the creation of the high-concept picture of the modern Hollywood blockbuster.

The decade also saw an increased amount of [[nudity in film]] and the increasing emphasis in the American industry on film franchises, especially in the [[science fiction film|science fiction]], [[horror film|horror]] and [[Action films|action]] genres. Much of the reliance on these effect-driven blockbusters was due in part to the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films at the advent of this decade and the new cinematic effects it helped to pioneer. The teen comedy subgenre also rose in popularity during this decade.

In the US, the [[PG-13]] rating was introduced in 1984 to accommodate films that straddled the line between PG and R, which was mainly due to the controversies surrounding the violent content of the PG films ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' and ''[[Gremlins]]'' (both 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PG-13 remade Hollywood ratings system|author=Anthony Breznican|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/187529_pg13rating24.html|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=August 24, 2004|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have considered the 1980s in retrospect as one of the weaker decades for American cinema in terms of the qualities of the films released. [[Quentin Tarantino]] (director of ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'') has voiced his own view that the 1980s was one of the worst eras for American films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shamsian|first1=Jacob|title=Here's why Quentin Tarantino isn't worried about the influx of franchise films|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/quentin-tarantino-isnt-worried-about-franchise-films-2015-8|website=[[Business Insider]]|publisher=Business Insider Inc.|accessdate=27 June 2016|date=24 August 2015|quote=Back in the ’80s, when movies sucked—I saw more movies then than I’d ever seen in my life, and the Hollywood bottom-line product was the worst it had been since the ’50s—that would have been a great time [for Superhero films].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Kent Jones also shares this opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Kent|title=The Last Great American Picture Show: New Hollywood Cinema in the 1970s: "The Cylinders Were Whispering My Name"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-xgdo_-5XEC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=[[Google Books]]|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|accessdate=27 June 2016|date=2004|quote=This was the beginning of the 1980s, the worst decade ever for American movies...}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, film theorist [[David Bordwell]] countered this notion, saying that the "megapicture mentality" was already existent in the 1970s, which is evident in the ten highest-grossing films of that decade, as well as with how many of the filmmakers part of New Hollywood were still able to direct many great pictures in the 1980s ([[Martin Scorsese]], [[Brian de Palma]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bordwell|first1=David|title=Observations on film art : It's the 80s, stupid|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2008/11/20/its-the-80s-stupid/|website=David Bordwell's website on cinema|publisher=David Bordwell &amp; Kristin Thompson|accessdate=28 June 2016|date=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Top-grossing films==
The following are the 10 top-grossing films of the decade:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/boxoffice2.html |title=All-Time Top Box Office Films |publisher=filmsite.org |accessdate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121074923/http://www.filmsite.org/boxoffice2.html |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), $435 million
#''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), $309 million
#''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), $290 million
#''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), $251 million
#''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), $245 million
#''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), $238 million
#''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (1984), $234 million
#''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985), $210 million
#''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), $197 million
#''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), $179 million&lt;hr&gt;&lt;!--ruler--&gt;

In the list, where revenues are equal numbers, the newer films are listed lower, due to inflation making the dollar-amount lower compared to earlier years.
==Trends==
The films of the 1980s covered many genres, with hybrids crossing between multiple genres. The trend strengthened towards creating ever-larger [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] films, which earned more in their opening weeks than any previous film, due in part to staging releases when audiences had little else to choose.
*'''''Blockbusters''''': The decade started by continuing the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] boom of the mid-[[1970s in film|1970s]]. The sequel to [[1977 in film|1977's]] ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', opened in May, [[1980 in film|1980]] becoming the highest-grossing film of the year. The film is considered among the best of films of the decade (being the highest rated 1980s film on [[IMDb]]). It was followed by ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) finishing the trio. ''[[Superman II]]'' was released in Europe and Australia in late 1980 but not distributed in the United States until June 1981. Though now seen as campier over the original [[1978 in film|1978]] ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', ''Superman II'' was received with a positive reaction. From the success of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', creator [[George Lucas]] teamed up with director [[Steven Spielberg]] to create one of the most iconic characters in the [[1981 in film|1981]] film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' starring [[Harrison Ford]], who had also co-starred in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. The story about an archaeologist and adventurer, [[Indiana Jones]] (Ford), hired by the U.S. government to go on a quest for the mystical lost Ark of the Covenant, created waves of interest in old 1930s style cliffhanger serials. It became the highest-grossing film of 1981, leading to sequels all in the top-10 films of the decade. In 1982, Spielberg directed his family, fairy-tale science-fiction blockbuster ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which shattered all records, earning 40% more than any Star-Wars film, and double or triple the revenue of 46 of the top 50 films.
*'''''Science-fiction''''': Continuing the 1980s' science-fiction boom was Australian [[post-apocalyptic science fiction]] ''[[Mad Max 2]]'', with a leather-clad outlaw fighting road barbarians in the futuristic desert wasteland. Another futuristic adventure released the same year, ''[[Escape from New York]]'', also saw an [[anti-hero]] set in a [[dystopian]] future. In [[1982 in film|1982]], yet another film set in a dystopian feature, the [[Tech-noir]]ish ''[[Blade Runner]]'' starred Harrison Ford as a detective searching for renegade androids. [[Science fiction]] films aimed at younger audiences included the two ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', as well as the [[Back to the Future (series)|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]] and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]''.
*'''''Thriller''''': The 1980s saw an immense amount of [[Thriller film|thriller]] films, many being of an [[erotic]] nature, including ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987) and ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981). Perhaps two of the most influential examples of 80s thriller films were [[David Lynch]]'s bizarre [[cult classic]] ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), which dealt with the underworld of a seemingly idyllic American suburbia, a subject which has spawned many inferior imitations well into the first decade of the 21st century and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s horror/thriller ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980). Outside of film, [[Michael Jackson]] was inspired by the genre to create the extremely successful album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1983.
*'''''Fantasy''''': [[Fantasy film]] saw a resurgence particularly in [[sword and sorcery]] films. In 1981, ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'', ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' started it off, but it was [[1982 in film|1982's]] ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' which caused the fantasy explosion. The epic starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in his acting breakthrough as he began his ascent to stardom. Loosely based on the original tales by [[Robert E. Howard]], the film was written by the unlikely pairing of [[Oliver Stone]] and [[John Milius]]. Its sequel followed in [[1984 in film|1984]] with the light-weight ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''. Schwarzenegger returned again to a similar sword-wielding role in [[1985 in film|1985's]] ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]''. The same year as ''Conan the Barbarian'', similar films followed such as ''[[The Sword and the Sorcerer]]'', ''[[The Beastmaster]]'' and the ''[[Ator]]'' films. Fairy-tale fantasy was also popular with films such as ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The NeverEnding Story]]'' (1984), ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987). [[Disney]]'s ''[[Return to Oz]]'', a big-budget sequel to 1939's classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', was a major flop, yet became a major success on home video. Jim Henson's ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986) was not an initial success but has since become a major cult classic.
*'''''Drama''''': Among the historical, romantic, and dramatic films, several were well received at the box office, including ''[[Rain Man]]'' (1988), ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987), ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981), ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' (1983), ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985) and ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985). Also notable in critical success were ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (also 1982)  and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).
*'''''Westerns''''': A stylish form of western was evolving, with films such as ''[[Pale Rider]]'', ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'' (both 1985) and ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]'' (1988).
*'''''Horror''''': Creativity from [[1970s in film|1970s]] [[horror film]]s extended throughout the 1980s, except having more gore, with many successful 1980s horror films having numerous sequels as their murderers were themselves unstoppable. [[Stanley Kubrick]] directed his horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980). The creative and gory ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981) with its secluded atmosphere is seen by many as one of the best in its genre, leading to its inevitable sequel ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' in [[1987 in film|1987]]. ''Halloween'' director [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) shocked audiences in its effects, as did [[David Cronenberg]]'s graphic and gory ''[[Scanners]]'' (1981). Sequels to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984) were the popular face of horror films in the 1980s, unkillable as their antagonists were, a trend reviled by most critics. [[Dan O'Bannon]]'s ''[[The Return of the Living Dead]]'' and [[Stuart Gordon]]'s ''[[Re-Animator]]'' soon followed. In 1986, the [[James Cameron]] film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' was released a few weeks before [[David Cronenberg]]'s remake of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''. Films such as ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', [[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Gremlins]]'' (both 1984) and [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988) started a trend for horror comedies. ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'' (1988) started the popular [[Child's Play (film series)|killer doll franchise]] starring [[Brad Dourif]] as the infamous killer doll [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]].
*'''''Comedies''''': The &lt;small&gt;#&lt;/small&gt;6, &lt;small&gt;#&lt;/small&gt;11 and &lt;small&gt;#&lt;/small&gt;13 top films of the 1980s were comedy films: ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982) and ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'' (1987). The [[disaster film]]s of the previous decade were spoofed in the gag comedy ''[[Airplane!]]'', paving the way for more of the same including its 1982 sequel ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'', ''[[Top Secret!]]'' (1984) and the ''[[Naked Gun]]'' films. Popular comedy stars in the '80s included [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[John Candy]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Rick Moranis]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Many had come to prominence on the American TV series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', including Bill Murray, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. Eddie Murphy made a success of comedy-[[action film|action]] films including ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982) and the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' series (1984&amp;ndash;1993). Also in the top-50 films were the romantic comedies ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]'' (1986), ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]'' (1988) and ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981).
*'''''[[Teen film|Teen comedies]]''''': Influenced largely by 1978's ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', the decade also saw the continued rise of [[teen film|teen comedies]] like ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' (the later two of these had sequels). Also popular were the films of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] such as ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986). He later created the ''[[Home Alone]]'' series of the 1990s. "Home Alone" was one movie in a revival in comedies aimed at a family audience, along with ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' (1989) and its 1990s sequels (1992, 1997-video direct). ''[[Heathers]]'' (1989) provided a [[tongue-in-cheek]] approach to the teenage comedy genre, showcasing the murders (disguised as suicides) of several popular students at an American high school. Other notable comedies of the decade include the gender-swap film ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982), ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' (1987), and a brief spate of age-reversal films including ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', ''[[18 Again!]]'', ''[[Vice Versa (1988 film)|Vice Versa]]'' and ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father, Like Son]]''.
*'''''Sequels''''': Also notable were the ''[[Police Academy (film series)|Police Academy]]'' series of broad comedies, produced between 1984 and 1993. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a trend emerged toward the release of sequels based on previously successful productions. Among the sequels were ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'', ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]]'', ''[[The Final Conflict]]'' (aka ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]''), ''[[Grease 2]]'', ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]'', ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'', ''[[Porky's II: The Next Day]]'' and ''[[Porky's Revenge]]''.
*'''''Rite-of-passage''''': Beyond just the teenager "coming-of-age" stories, more complex "rite-of-passage" films had older actors changing or transforming through the rituals. So although teenagers were the focus of 1983's ''[[Risky Business]]'', 1984's ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'' and its sequels (1986, 1989), and 1985's ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' and ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' [[Brat Pack (actors)|brat-pack]] genre, older people with troubled lives were the subjects of ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986) or ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'' in trying to become a fighter pilot, a female [[welder]] in ''[[Flashdance]]'' transforming into a [[ballet dancer]], and ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'''s (1985) elderly set overcoming old age. Even ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' (1983) reunion was a rite-of-passage which challenged old classmates to redirect their lives after the suicide of a friend.
*'''''Action films''''': In the 1970s, action films usually focused on maverick police officers. However, the action film did not become a dominant form in Hollywood until the 1980s, when it was popularized by actors such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Chuck Norris]] and [[Bruce Willis]]. Stallone continued the ''[[Rocky]]'' series and starred in 1982's ''[[First Blood]]'' about a returning [[Vietnam War]] veteran fighting a small town sheriff and its sequel ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Vietnam War films grew in popularity in the 1980s, from being a film subject which was still seen as a taboo in the 1970s. Movies like ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' made the war a subject. [[Chuck Norris]] starred in the ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'' trilogy (1984, 1985, [[1988 in film|1988]]) about a Vietnam veteran going back to rescue [[POW]]s. Schwarzenegger starred in ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984), ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'' (1985) and ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987). The 1988 film ''[[Die Hard]]'' was particularly influential on the development of the genre in the subsequent decade. In the film, [[Bruce Willis]] plays a New York City police detective who inadvertently becomes embroiled in a terrorist take-over of a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] office building. Meanwhile, [[Hong Kong action cinema]] was being revolutionized by [[Jackie Chan]], [[Tsui Hark]], and [[John Woo]].
*'''''James Bond''''': The [[James Bond]] film series entered its third decade in 1981 with [[Roger Moore]] starring in the more realistic ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' after the outlandish excess of ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' in 1979. The decade saw the beginning of a new era for Bond since the previous decade's directors originally directed a [[1960s in film|1960s]] Bond, the new director brought to the series, [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], criticized for a less stylistic and more "workman" style of direction, directed all the [[EON Productions|EON]] Bond films from 1981 to 1989. ''Moonraker'' was the last for regular [[Bernard Lee]] who portrayed Bond's boss [[M (James Bond)|M]]. For the 1980s Bonds, a collection of numerous [[MI6]] superiors would brief Bond on his missions. [[1983 in film|1983]] was a significant year for the series as a non-EON Bond was released, ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', directed by ''The Empire Strikes Back'' director [[Irvin Kershner]], with [[Sean Connery]] returning to the role for the last time since 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''; it was competing with the next EON film, ''[[Octopussy]]'' at the box office with media dubbing the situation "The Battle of the Bonds". Even lesser known in the same year was one-time Bond [[George Lazenby]] appearing in the TV reunion film ''[[The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' as Bond-like character "JB". ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985) was the last for Roger Moore before [[Timothy Dalton]] was chosen as the new Bond in 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' and lastly in [[1989 in film|1989's]] ''[[Licence to Kill]]''.

==Biography==
Born in Japaratuba, in the state of Sergipe, Bispo do Rosário joined the Navy in 1925 and later worked as a boxer and handyman. Between 1933 and 1937, he worked at the [[Light S.A.|Light]] Department of Trams in the city of Rio de Janeiro and as a domestic worker for the Leoni family in the neighborhood of Botafogo.&lt;ref name="Queiroz"/&gt;

On the night of December 22, 1938, Bispo do Rosário experienced hallucinations that led him to visit his employer, the lawyer Humberto Magalhães Leoni, to whom he said that he would present himself to the [[Candelária Church]]. After wandering the streets of Rio, he eventually headed to the [[Mosteiro de São Bento]], where he announced to a group of monks that he was [[Jesus Christ]], sent by God to be in charge of judging the living and the dead.&lt;ref name="almanaque"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman |first=Bruno |title=Arthur Bispo do Rosário |url=http://www.almanaquebrasil.com.br/personalidades-arte/9730-arthur-bispo-do-rosario.html |work=Almanaque Brasil |accessdate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221181048/http://www.almanaquebrasil.com.br/personalidades-arte/9730-arthur-bispo-do-rosario.html |archivedate=21 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hidalgo|first=Luciana|title=Arthur Bispo do Rosario: O senhor do labirinto|year=2011|publisher=Rocco|isbn=9788581221335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8SS6IzIHf8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=arthur+bispo&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=M6uEU5iZMPTJsAS0sYHABA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=arthur%20bispo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later he was arrested by police, recorded as an indigent and committed to the Hospício Pedro II, the first official mental institution in Brazil.

A month after his hospitalization, he was transferred to another mental institution, [[Colônia Juliano Moreira]], located in the suburb of [[Jacarepaguá]], under the diagnosis of "schizophrenic-paranoid." Here he received the patient number 01662, and was to remain for over 50 years.

During his stay at Colônia Juliano Moreira, Bispo do Rosário began to fashion works of art from different types of materials found around the institution. These works were intended to mark the passing of God on Earth, rather than as art for its own sake: his best known work is the Manto da Presentação (Presentation Cloak), which he intended to wear on the [[Day of Judgement]].  Bispo do Rosário said of his art "The voices tell me to do this way". Common themes in his work included ships (a recurring theme due to his relationship with the Navy in his youth), banners, and household objects.&lt;ref name="almanaque"/&gt;

Bispo do Rosário died in July 5, 1989 at the Colônia Juliano Moreira, after suffering a heart attack.&lt;ref name="almanaque"/&gt; His work was later discovered and praised by art critics, who classified it as avant-garde and compared it to the ready-mades by [[Marcel Duchamp]].

'''BioArt''' is an [[art]] [[practice (social theory)|practice]] where humans work with live tissues, [[Microbial art|bacteria]], living organisms, and life processes. Using scientific processes such as [[biotechnology]] (including technologies such as [[genetic engineering]], [[tissue culture]], and [[cloning]]) the artworks are produced in laboratories, galleries, or [[artist]]s' [[studio]]s. The scope of BioArt is considered by some artists to be strictly limited to "living forms", while other artists would include art that uses the imagery of contemporary medicine and biological research, or require that it address a controversy or blind spot posed by the very character of the life sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pentecost | first=Claire |editor-first=da Costa| editor-last=Beatrice |title=Tactical Biopolitics: Art, Activism and Technoscience |publisher=The MIT Press |pages=110 |chapter=Outfitting the Laboratory of the Symbolic: Toward a Critical Inventory of Bioart |isbn=978-0-262-04249-9| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although BioArtists work with living matter, there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about [[ethical]], [[social]], and [[aesthetic]] inquiry.  The phrase "BioArt" was coined by [[Eduardo Kac]] in 1997 in relation to his artwork ''Time Capsule''. Although it originated at the end of the 20th century, through the works of pioneers like [[Joe Davis (artist)|Joe Davis]], [http://www.martademenezes.com Marta de Menezes] and the artists hosted by [[Symbiotica]], BioArt is more widely practiced now.

==Overview==
[[File:Self Portre Yin - Yang (BioArt).tif|thumb|Self Portre 1988 Yin - Yang (BioArt), playing on the parallels between image manipulation and cloning]]

BioArt is often intended to be shocking or humorous.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2017}} One survey of the field, ''Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing'', puts it this way: "BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: draw attention to the beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110212142541/http://www.emilyvoigt.com/isotope.html#content  The Art is Alive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While raising questions about the role of science in society, "most of these works tend toward social reflection, conveying political and societal criticism through the combination of artistic and scientific processes."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/ethics/2007-03-05-bio-art_N.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | first=Jessica M. | last=Pasko | title=Bio-artists use science to create art | date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most people who practice BioArt are categorized as artists in this new media, they can also be seen as scientists, since the actual medium within a work pertains to molecular structures, and so forth. Because of this dual-acceptance, the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard University invites anyone to submit works based on scientific or artistic value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioart.med.harvard.edu/bioart_introduction.html BIOart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020121935/http://bioart.med.harvard.edu/bioart_introduction.html |date=October 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can encourage anyone to submit work they strongly respond to.

==Exposing artists to laboratories==
The laboratory work can pose a challenge to the artist, at first, as the environment is often foreign to the artist. While some artists have prior scientific training, others must be trained to perform the procedures or work in tandem with scientists who can perform the tasks that are required.  Bio artists often use formations relating to or engaged with science and scientific practices, such as working with bacteria or live-tissue.

Much of the art involves tissue-culturing and transgenics, a term for a variety of genetic engineering processes through which genetic material from one organism is altered by the addition of synthesized or transplanted genetic material from another organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17387568/|title=Bio-artists bridge gap between arts, sciences|date=4 March 2007|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Eduardo Kac commissioned the creation of a transgenic [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] bunny as part of a piece called GFP Bunny. "The PR campaign included a picture of Kac holding a white rabbit and another, iconic image of a rabbit photographically enhanced to appear green."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pentecost | first=Claire |editor-first=da Costa| editor-last=Beatrice |title=Tactical Biopolitics: Art, Activism and Technoscience |publisher=The MIT Press |pages=107 |chapter=Outfitting the Laboratory of the Symbolic: Toward a Critical Inventory of Bioart |isbn=978-0-262-04249-9| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project in collaboration with [[Stelarc]] grew a 1/4 scale replica of an ear using human cells.  The project was carried out at [[Symbiotica]]: the Art &amp; Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology, [[University of Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html|title=Extra Ear ¼ Scale - The Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project in Collaboration with Stelarc|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art addressing topics in biology and society==
[[File:FPbeachTsien.jpg|thumb|It is debated whether BioArt must, like this work of [[microbial art]], be made with actual organisms. Artwork made with bacteria expressing 8 different colors of [[green fluorescent protein|fluorescent proteins]]]]

The scope of the term BioArt is a subject of ongoing debate. The primary point of debate centers around whether BioArt must necessarily involve manipulation of biological material, as is the case in [[microbial art]] which by definition is made of [[microorganism|microbes]]. A broader definition of the term would include work that addresses the social and ethical considerations of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See Bio Art entry in Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2007-2014. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these terms BioArt as a genre has many crossovers with fields such as critical or speculative design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anker |first1=Suzanne |title=The beginnings and the ends of Bio Art |url=http://www.suzanneanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-The-beginnings-and-the-ends-of-Bio-Art-Bio-Art-Life-in-the-Anthropocene-Artlink-Magazine.pdf |journal=Artlink |date=2014 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work often reaches a much broader general audience, and is focused on starting discussions in this space, rather than pioneering or even using specific biological practices. Examples in this space include Ray Fish shoes, which advertised shoes made and patterned with genetically engineered stingray skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextnature.net/2012/12/the-rise-and-fall-or-rayfish-footwear/|title=The Rise and Fall or Rayfish Footwear - Next Nature Network|date=19 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BiteLabs, a biotech startup that attempted to make salami out of meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-guy-who-want-to-sell-you-salami-made-out-of-james-franco-are-100-serious |title=The Guy Who Wants to Sell Lab-Grown Salami Made of Kanye West Is "100% Serious" |publisher=|date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
BioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics.  ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Alka Chandna, a senior researcher with [[PETA]] in Norfolk, Virginia, has stated that using animals for the sake of art is no different from using animal fur for clothing material. "Transgenic manipulation of animals is just a continuum of using animals for human end, regardless of whether it is done to make some sort of sociopolitical critique. The suffering and exacerbation of stress on the animals is very problematic."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

However, many BioArt projects deal with the manipulation of cells and not whole organisms, such as ''[[Victimless Leather]]'' by [[Symbiotica]]. "An actualized possibility of wearing 'leather' without killing an animal is offered as a starting point for cultural discussion. Our intention is not to provide yet another consumer product, but rather to raise questions about our exploitation of other living beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/vl.html|title=Victemless Leather|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of Panagia Kera''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Εκκλησία της Παναγίας της Κεράς) is a [[Crete|Cretan]] [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Church (building)|church]], located 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.62 miles) from the village of [[Kritsa]], in the Dikte Mountains. It contains the finest-preserved Byzantine-era [[fresco]]es in Crete,&lt;ref&gt;"Church of Panagia Kera - Lonely Planet." Lonely Planet. Lonely Planet, n.d. Web. 18 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and for that reason, has become one of the most culturally and historically significant churches on the island.

==History==
The [[Late Greek]] word ‘[[Panagia]]’ is defined as ‘Virgin’ in English,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/panagia&lt;/ref&gt; and is among the titles of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Although no founding date for the Church of Panagia Kera has been established, historical consensus agrees that the oldest parts of the church, the central nave, its vaulted roof and dome, were constructed and painted in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Church of Panagia Kera at Kritsa." Incredible Crete. Region of Crete, 2013. Web. 18 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The side-aisles of the church, its western entrance, and the belfry and the buttresses supporting the church, were later built and painted during the early to mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Church of Panagia Kera - Lonely Planet." Lonely Planet. Lonely Planet, n.d. Web. 18 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The frescoes in Panagia Kera date back to the [[Byzantine art#Palaeologan age|Paleologian Renaissance]], due to their vivid, bright colors.&lt;ref&gt;"Panagia Kera in Lassithi - Greeka.com." Greeka. Greeka LTD, n.d. Web. 18 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to local tradition, the church contained an icon of the Virgin Mary, which was believed to have miraculous powers. During the period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], it was removed to [[Constantinople]], but was later returned. In 1498, during the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] occupation of Crete, a Greek trader stole the icon, which was later transported to the temple of Saint Alfonso on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;"Panagia Kera in Lassithi - Greeka.com." Greeka. Greeka LTD, n.d. Web. 18 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Panagia Kera was later renovated by the Managgaris family in 1722, and in 1732 the icon of the Virgin Mary was repainted in the church by an unknown artist.&lt;ref&gt;"Panagia Kera in Lassithi - Greeka.com." Greeka. Greeka LTD, n.d. Web. 18 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frescoes==
The frescoes on the dome and the central nave depict the following scenes from the [[New Testament]]: [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|the Presentation]], [[Baptism of Jesus|the Baptism]], the [[Raising of Lazarus]] and the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Entry into Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;"Church of Panagia Kera - Lonely Planet."

'''David Wight Prall''' (1886–1940) was a [[aesthetics|philosopher of art]]. Born on 5 October 1886 in Saginaw, Michigan, Prall received his PhD in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1918.

Prall was Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University (1920–21; 1930–40). He taught also at Cornell (1910–12), the University of Texas (1912–14), Amherst (1918–19), and the [[University of California]] (1921–30). While at Harvard, Prall was a teacher and mentor to the notable composer and conductor, [[Leonard Bernstein]].

Prall died on 21 October 1940 in Cambridge. MA. His papers are held at Mills College, Oakland, California.

'''''De Stijl''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|s|t|aɪ|l}}; {{IPA-nl|də ˈstɛil}}), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "The Style", also known as '''Neoplasticism''', was a Dutch [[art]]istic movement founded in 1917 in Leiden. De Stijl consisted of artists and architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-062084-X|pages=523|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a narrower sense, the term ''De Stijl'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=2006-07-31 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]] and [[colour]]; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only [[black]], [[white]] and [[primary color]]s.

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] that served to propagate the group's theories. Along with [[Theo van Doesburg]], the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[Jacobus Oud|J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''Neoplasticism''—the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

According to Theo van Doesburg in the introduction of the magazine "De Stijl" 1917 no.1, the "De Stijl"-movement was a reaction to the "Modern Baroque" of the [[Amsterdam School]] movement ([[Expressionist architecture|Dutch expressionist architecture]]) with the magazine "[[Wendingen]]" (1918-1931).

Mondrian sets forth the delimitations of Neoplasticism in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour". With these constraints, his art allows only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/n/neo-plasticism|title=Neo-plasticism – Art Term - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The De Stijl movement posited the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/description/|title=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum-Guggenheim] Collection Online: De Stijl|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429120104/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/description|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name De Stijl is supposedly derived from [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik'' (1861–3), which Curl&lt;ref name="archdic"/&gt; suggests was mistakenly believed to advocate [[materialism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. The "plastic vision" of De Stijl artists, also called Neo-Plasticism, saw itself as reaching beyond the changing appearance of natural things to bring an audience into intimate contact with an immutable core of reality, a reality that was not so much a visible fact as an underlying spiritual vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denker|first1=Susan A.|title=De Stijl: 1917–1931, Visions of Utopia|journal=Art Journal|date=September 1982|volume=42|issue=3|pages=242–246|doi=10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, De Stijl proposed ultimate simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]], and the three primary values, [[black]], [[white]], and [[grey]]. The works avoided symmetry and attained aesthetic balance by the use of opposition. This element of the movement embodies the second meaning of ''stijl'': "a post, jamb or support"; this is best exemplified by the construction of crossing joints, most commonly seen in [[carpentry]].

In many of the group's three-dimensional works, vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. This feature can be found in the [[Rietveld Schröder House]] and the [[Red and Blue Chair]].

De Stijl was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of mathematician [[M.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. The De Stijl movement was also influenced by [[Neopositivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-062084-X|page=523|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "-ism" (e.g., [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]]), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like the Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

In [[music]], De Stijl was an influence only on the work of composer [[Jakob van Domselaer]], a close friend of Mondrian. Between 1913 and 1916, he composed his ''Proeven van Stijlkunst'' ("Experiments in Artistic Style"), inspired mainly by Mondrian's paintings. This [[minimalist]]ic—and, at the time, revolutionary—music defined "horizontal" and "vertical" musical elements and aimed at balancing those two principles. Van Domselaer was relatively unknown in his lifetime, and did not play a significant role within De Stijl.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
From the flurry of new art movements that followed the [[Impressionist]] revolutionary new perception of painting, [[Cubism]] arose in the early 20th century as an important and influential new direction. In the [[Netherlands]], too, there was interest in this "new art".

However, because the Netherlands remained neutral in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], Dutch artists were not able to leave the country after 1914 and were thus effectively isolated from the international art world—and in particular, from [[Paris]], which was its centre then.

During that period, Theo van Doesburg started looking for other artists to set up a [[Literary magazine|journal]] and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more successful writing about art than working as an independent artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theo van Doesburg|editor1-last=Translated by Janet Seligman|editor2-last=Introd. by Hans M. Wingler|editor3-last=Postscript by H.L.C. Jaffé|title=Grundbegriffe der Neuen Gestaltenden Kunst (Grondbeginselen der Nieuwe beeldende Kunst [Principles of Neo-Plastic Art])|date=1918|publisher=Lund Humphries (1968)|location=London, UK|isbn=0853311048|language=German, Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite adept at making new contacts due to his flamboyant personality and outgoing nature, he had many useful connections in the art world.

=== Founding of ''De Stijl'' ===
[[File:Theo van Doesburg Composition VII (the three graces).jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Theo van Doesburg]], ''Composition VII (the three graces)'' 1917]]
[[File:Otterloo kroller muller mondrian composition couleur A.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Piet Mondrian]], ''Composition en couleur A'', 1917, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]]]]
Around 1915, [[Theo van Doesburg|Van Doesburg]] started meeting the artists who would eventually become the founders of the journal. He first met [[Piet Mondrian]] at an exhibition in [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. Mondrian, who had moved to Paris in 1912 (and there, changed his name from "Mondriaan"), had been visiting the Netherlands when war broke out. He could not return to Paris, and was staying in the artists' community of [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], where he met [[Bart van der Leck]] and regularly saw [[M.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. In 1915, Schoenmaekers published ''Het nieuwe wereldbeeld'' ("The New Image of the World"), followed in 1916 by ''Beginselen der beeldende wiskunde'' ("Principles of Plastic Mathematics"). These two publications would greatly influence Mondrian and other members of De Stijl.

Van Doesburg also knew [[J.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;P. Oud]] and the Hungarian artist [[Vilmos Huszár]]. In 1917 the cooperation of these artists, together with the poet [[Anthony Kok]], resulted in the founding of De Stijl. The young architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]] joined the group in 1918.  At its height De Stijl had 100 members and the journal had a circulation of 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dujardin|first1=Alain|last2=Quirindongo|first2=Jop|title=This 100-Year-Old Dutch Movement Shaped Web Design Today|url=https://backchannel.com/100-years-of-clean-lines-how-de-stijl-is-influencing-digital-design-4397f1a72e37?curator=MediaREDEF#.kphtjs1er|website=[[Backchannel (blog)]]|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those first few years, the group was still relatively homogeneous, although Van der Leck left in 1918 due to artistic differences of opinion. [[Manifesto]]s were being published, signed by all members. The social and economic circumstances of the time formed an important source of inspiration for their theories, and their ideas about architecture were heavily influenced by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].

The name ''Nieuwe Beelding'' was a term first coined in 1917 by Mondrian, who wrote a series of twelve articles called ''De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst'' ("Neo-Plasticism in Painting") that were published in the journal ''De Stijl''. In 1920 he published a book titled ''Le Néo-Plasticisme''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/mondrian1920/0005 Piet Mondrian, ''Le Néo-Plasticisme, Principe Général de l'Equivalence Plastique'', Paris, 1920], Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1920 ===
[[File:Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior 1919.jpg|thumb|Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior, c.1919, [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]
Around 1921, the group's character started to change. From the time of van Doesburg's association with [[Bauhaus]], other influences started playing a role. These influences were mainly [[Malevich]] and Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], to which not all members agreed. In 1924 Mondrian broke with the group after van Doesburg proposed the theory of elementarism, suggesting that a diagonal line is more vital than horizontal and vertical ones. In addition, the De Stijl group acquired many new "members". [[Dada]]ist influences, such as [[I.&amp;nbsp;K. Bonset]]'s poetry and [[Aldo Camini]]'s "antiphilosophy" generated controversy as well. Only after Van Doesburg's death was it revealed that Bonset and Camini were two of his pseudonyms.

=== After van Doesburg's death ===

Theo van Doesburg died in [[Davos]], Switzerland, in 1931. His wife, Nelly, administered his estate.

Because of van Doesburg's pivotal role within De Stijl, the group did not survive. Individual members remained in contact, but De Stijl could not exist without a strong central character. Thus, it may be wrong to think of De Stijl as a close-knit group of artists. The members knew each other, but most communication took place by letter. For example, Mondrian and Rietveld never met in person.

Many, though not all, artists did stay true to the movement's basic ideas, even after 1931. Rietveld, for instance, continued designing furniture according to De Stijl principles, while Mondrian continued working in the style he had initiated around 1920. Van der Leck, on the other hand, went back to figurative compositions after his departure from the group.

=== Influence on architecture ===
The De Stijl influence on architecture remained considerable long after its inception; [[Mies van der Rohe]] was among the most important proponents of its ideas. Between 1923 and 1924, [[Gerrit Rietveld|Rietveld]] designed the Rietveld Schröder House, the only building to have been created completely according to De Stijl principles. Examples of Stijl-influenced works by [[J.J.P. Oud]] can be found in [[Rotterdam]] (''{{Ill|Café De Unie|nl}}'') and [[Hoek van Holland]]. Other examples include the [[Eames House]] by Charles and Ray Eames, and the interior decoration for the [[Aubette (building)|Aubette dance hall]] in Strasbourg, designed by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Jean Arp and van Doesburg.

=== Present day ===
Works by De Stijl members are scattered all over the world, but De Stijl-themed exhibitions are organised regularly. Museums with large De Stijl collections include the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]] in [[The Hague]] (which owns the world's most extensive, although not exclusively De Stijl-related, Mondrian collection) and [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Stedelijk Museum]], where many works by Rietveld and Van Doesburg are on display. The [[{{Not a typo|Centraal}} Museum]] of [[Utrecht]] has the largest Rietveld collection worldwide; it also owns the Rietveld Schröder House, Rietveld's adjacent "show house", and the Rietveld Schröder Archives.

The movement inspired the design aesthetics of [[Rumyantsevo (Moscow Metro)|Rumyantsevo]] and [[Salaryevo]] stations of [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/marble-and-mondrian-a-tour-of-moscows-metro/g-19098971|title=Marble and Mondrian: a tour of Moscow metro|publisher=DW|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlebedev.com/metro/rumyantsevo/|title=Type design for Rumyantsevo Moscow Metro station|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2880">'''Duodji''' is a traditional [[Sami people|Sami]] [[handicraft]], dating back to a time when the Sami were far more isolated from the outside world than they are today. Duodji tools, clothing and accessories are functional and useful, and may also incorporate artistic elements. Sami duodji artists are able to bring [[Applied art|function and art]] together in a delicate way so as to create beautiful works of art in their own right.

These functional items include knives, cases, ladies' bags, wooden cups, certain articles of clothing, etc. Duodji items were made and meant to be used in an everyday work environment.

[[Image:Kuksa_2006_09_09.JPG|thumb|right|Drinking cup (guksi) also used for [[Bushcraft]]]]
[[Image:Samekniven.JPG|thumb|right|A small Sámi knife (decorative picture not traditional)]]

==Materials used==
Traditionally Sami handicraft was divided into two sub-groups, men's and women's handicraft. Men used mostly wood and antlers as well as other bones from reindeer when crafting, while women used leather and roots. The traditional Sami colours are red, green, blue and yellow.

==Well known artists==
Duodji artists are still active in [[Sápmi (area)|Sapmi]] and still carry on the traditions of the Duodji. Although there have been slight changes in the traditional Duodji, today they are considered valuable pieces of art by collectors from all over the world. Some of the Duodji artists today are [[Olov Svonni]], [[Martin Kuorak]], [[Anders Sunna]], [[Lars Pirak]] and [[Per Olof Utsi]].

==Gákti==

The traditional costume, the [[Gakti|gákti]], is of great cultural importance and is mainly used for weddings, funerals, confirmations and other cultural events. The gákti's appearance differs from place to place and it tends to be longer in southern Sápmi than in the north. Traditionally leather, sinews, and wool was used to make the gákti, today however both velvet and silk can be used.

A '''film director''' is a person who directs the making of a [[film]]. A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the [[screenplay]] (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that [[Goal|vision]]. The director has a key role in choosing the [[cast member]]s, production design, and the creative aspects of [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/average-film-director-salary-per-movie-7732.html|title=The Average Film Director Salary Per Movie|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[European Union law]], the director is viewed as the [[auteur theory|author]] of the film.&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Kamina|title=Film Copyright in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PqJYG9ihusC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43338-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's [[budget]].

There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[film editor]]s or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some [[Outline (list)|outline]] a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV or film director|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-director|website=National Careers Service|publisher=British Government|accessdate=May 10, 2017|location=[[United Kingdom]]|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a [[screenplay]] into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision.&lt;ref name="Film schools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Profile Film Director|url=http://filmschools.com/resources/los-angeles-career-profile-film-directorl|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production.&lt;ref name="career"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Media College"&gt;{{cite web |title=Employment Film Director|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/employment/film/director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails organizing the [[film crew]] in such a way to achieve their vision of the film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Career snapshot|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/196/career-snapshot-the-film-director-a-human-lens|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=They must work with producers, writers, cast members, crew members, designers and other professionals in order to implement that vision|url=http://www.academicinvest.com/arts-careers/film-studies-careers/film-director-career-guide|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set.&lt;ref name="Career Centre"&gt;{{cite web|title=A film director needs...|url=http://www.careercentre.dtwd.wa.gov.au/occupations/Pages/director-film-television-radio-or-stage.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew,&lt;ref name="Diploma Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Director Career|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Film_Director_Career_Summary.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, excellent communication skills are a must.&lt;ref name="National Career Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Profile|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/tvorfilmdirector.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=You have to be a diplomat. You have to marshal a whole load of creative people, who often don't get on with each other, and your job is to stop things turning into a bun-fight. |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/i-want-your-job-film-director-480500.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013 | location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alex |last=McRae |date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"/&gt; The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as "a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure".&lt;ref name="Directors UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Director?|url=http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082526/http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|archive-date=2013-01-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=directors work under a lot of pressure, and most are under constant stress to find their next job.|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/producers-and-directors.htm|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the sole superiors of the director are the [[Film producer|producer(s)]] and the studio that is financing the film.&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Education Portal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career as a film director|url=http://education-portal.com/career_as_a_film_director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The director is bound by financial conditions, which however should not hinder him from developing his own artistic signature.|url=http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094913/http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular [[Motion picture rating system|age rating]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Realizing that an NC-17 rating could hurt business (some theaters and newspapers won't show or advertise NC-17 movies), Mr. Verhoeven cut 47 seconds of the most graphic sex and violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/arts/film-now-starring-on-video-the-director-s-cut.html| work=The New York Times|first=Ann|last=Hornaday|date= May 16, 1993|accessdate =November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors also play an important role in [[post-production]]. While the film is still in production, the director sends "[[dailies]]" to the [[Film editing|film editor]] and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an [[editor's cut]]. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the  [[director's cut]]. Well-established directors have the "[[final cut privilege]]", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|American director [[Steven Spielberg]] with Sri Lankan filmmaker [[Chandran Rutnam]] in Sri Lanka]]

The director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Princeton review|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=65|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that "20-hour days are not unusual".&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt; Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.

Under [[European Union]] law, the film director is considered the "author" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of [[auteur theory]].&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"/&gt; Auteur theory is a [[film criticism]] concept that holds that a film director's [[film]] reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the [[French language|French]] word for "author").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|title=auteur theory {{!}} Definition &amp; Directors|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.

==Career pathways==
Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[film editor]]s or [[actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many are experienced actors, editors or writers|url=http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;OCCPRO_ID=71011104|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the Coen brothers' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s three Batman films made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''. Other film directors have attended a [[film school]] to "get formal training and education in their craft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many directors get formal training and education in their craft at a film school.|url=http://education-portal.com/career_as_a_film_director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Fiction Film bachelor studio students learn the basic principles, techniques and procedures of film direction and production|url=http://www.sintlukas.be/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=258&amp;Itemid=1108|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classes supporting this area discuss and rehearse: preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, reading scripts, the construction of film sequence|url=http://www.lfs.org.uk/courses/ma_film_making/directing.php|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217032729/http://www.lfs.org.uk/courses/ma_film_making/directing.php|archive-date=2013-02-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We operate from a purpose-built studio facility in Harrow, with two sound stages, a set construction workshop, and extensive post-production facilities.|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/courses/subjects/television-film-and-moving-image/undergraduate-courses/full-time/u09fuftp-ba-honours-film-and-television-production|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An intrinsic element of the education, alongside the transfer of organizational and technical skills, is to provide the students with insights into social contexts and relationships|url=http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdprogram.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510100634/http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdprogram.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The directing studies 5 years of study : a first cycle of 3 years and a second cycle of 2 years.|url= http://www.iad-arts.be/EN/m2e3b1-realisation.html|accessdate= March 3, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130723142025/http://www.iad-arts.be/EN/m2e3b1-realisation.html|archive-date= 2013-07-23|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; [[The National Film School of Denmark]] has the student's final projects presented on national TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The current '''flag of [[Barcelona]]''' combines the [[St George's Cross|cross of Saint George]] (in Catalan, ''Sant Jordi''), the patron saint of Catalonia, with the traditional red and yellow bars of the [[Senyera]], the ancient symbol of the [[Crown of Aragon]] (here, the bars are vertical, though the modern [[Senyera|flag of Catalonia]] has horizontal stripes).

The flag in its current form has been official since 2004, though it (or variations on it) may have been in use since the nineteenth century. It was first officially adopted in May 1906, but its use was not permitted during the rule of [[General Franco]]; a slightly different version of the flag, with brighter colours and a different configuration of red bars, was readopted in 1984.

[[File:Bandera de Barcelona de 1996.svg|thumb|right|Flag adopted by the City Council between 1996 and 2004&lt;br /&gt;Flag ratio: 2:3]]
In 1996, after a number of different proposals, the city council of Barcelona adopted a new flag, featuring the official logo of the city (which incorporates St. George's cross) over the vertical Catalan stripes. The flag enjoyed some political support, but was opposed by some historical and [[Vexillology|vexillological]] groups, who campaigned against it.

In 2004, however, the city council "recuperated" the 1906 flag legislation, restoring the original design. Both the traditional (1906) and the modern (1996) designs can be seen today in the city, though the Catalan Vexillology Association (''Associació Catalana de Vexil·lologia'') continues to campaign against the use of the latter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12174">[[File:Prejmer 200609.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fortress church in [[Prejmer|Tartlau]], [[Transylvania]]]]
A '''fortress church''' ({{lang-de|Kirchenburg}}) is a particular type of [[church building|church]] that, in addition to its religious functions is also used by the local population as a retreat and defensive position, similar to a [[refuge castle]]. A fortress church usually implies that the church is enclosed by its own fortifications, such as [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls]] and [[defensive tower]]s. By comparison, a church with simple defensive features, such as [[battlements]] and [[embrasure]]s on the church itself, is usually just referred to as a [[fortified church]].

== Architectural history ==
The fortress church is typically surrounded by [[defensive wall]]s equipped with [[wall tower]]s and [[wall walk]]s. It is a development of the [[fortified church]]es, whose defensive walls were also the actual walls of the church. Although the terms are often used interchangeably without clear distinction, a fortified church properly refers to a single building whereas a fortress church is a building complex. Construction of defensible churches evolved over time. Earlier constructions included a church surrounded by barns in which a siege of several days could be endured. Then fortified cemeteries (''Wehrfriedhof'') arose and simple [[fortified church]]es, to finally the fortress church. The fortress churches surviving today date from the 15th century. 

Unlike the populations of towns and cities, villagers could not afford to build defences around an entire settlement. The fortress churches were often the only stone building in such places and so were the population's only refuge from the violence of the military conflicts, the local raiding and plundering that often accompanied military campaigns, as well as providing defence against nomadic bands of marauders. 

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], especially in recently Christianised regions like Saxony, former bishop's seats were designed as fortress churches. In Saxony they were referred to as a ''Domburg'' or "cathedral castle". Fortress churches are especially common in [[Franconia (region)|Franconia]], [[South France]] and [[Transylvania]] ([[Romania]]). Particularly in Transylvania, a historically German settlement area, there are well over a hundred fortress churches of which [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|seven]] have been designated as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s (Birthälm/Biertan in 1993, Kelling/Calnic, Wurmloch/Valea Viilor, Dersch/Darjiu, Deutsch-Weißkirch/Viscri, Keisd/Saschiz and Tartlau/Prejmer in 1999). These were established in order to defend against successive [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasions]].

Fortress churches have not survived in North Germany, most likely due to the re-use of their stone for other building purposes during period of scarcity of such materials. The only well-known fortress church in the coastal region of North Germany is the Church of St. Dionysius in [[Bremerhaven]]-[[Wulsdorf]], which is recorded as having a [[field stone]] curtain wall up to 3.60 metres high.

[[File:Georgina Hetley02.jpg|thumb|Painting of ''[[Metrosideros fulgens]]'' by Georgina Burne Hetley]]

'''Georgina Burne Hetley''' (née '''McKellar''', 27 May 1832 &amp;ndash; 29 August 1898) was a [[New Zealand]] artist and writer. Her book ''The Native Flora of New Zealand'' was published in English and French.  She was born in [[Battersea]], [[Surrey]], [[England]] on 27 May 1832.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hetley"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Georgina Burne Hetley|first= June|last= Starke|id=2h31 | access-date=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teara"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taonga |first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu |title=Hetley, Georgina Burne |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2h31/hetley-georgina-burne |accessdate=5 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Hetley was the second daughter of Annette and Dugald McKellar, a doctor. The family moved to [[Madeira]], Portugal when Hetley was around 10 years old, leaving in 1852 for New Zealand when her father died. Annette McKellar bought a block of about fifty acres of land at Omata, six miles south of [[New Plymouth]]. She called their farm ''Fernlea''. Hetley subsequently married a fellow settler Charles Hetly in the Omata church on 2 June 1856 and moved to Brookwood farm. Just prior to their first wedding anniversary Charles died, leaving Hetly with a newborn son.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hetley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Viking 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawson|first1=Bee|title=Lady painters : the flower painters of early New Zealand|date=1999|publisher=Viking|location=Auckland, N.Z.|isbn=0670886513|pages=77–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Hetley selling her farm and returning to ''Fernlea''  to live with her mother. 

Hetley lived in [[Taranaki]] until 1860 when the [[First Taranaki War|First Taranaki Wa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r broke out. The conflict led to Anette McKellar moving her family to New Plymouth. ''Fernlea'' was burnt down in the ensuing conflict. While in Taranaki Hetley had began drawing sketches and watercolours of the farm and surrounding landscapes. She continued this practice after the move to New Plymouth, painting the urban scenes in New Plymouth, [[Waikato]] and [[Auckland]]. She and her son moved to Auckland by 1879.&lt;ref name="DNZB Hetley" /&gt;

==Exhibitions and publications==

In 1879, Hetley exhibited with the Auckland Society of Artists. In 1885 she won first prize at the New Zealand Industrial Exhibition in Wellington for her paintings of indigenous plants. Following a lecture about a botanical trip to Nelson given by [[Thomas Frederic Cheeseman]] at the Auckland Museum in 1881,—and with considerable encouragement from him—Hetley was inspired to write a comprehensive guide to New Zealand flora. This would be following in the style of Dr [[Walter Buller]]'s book on New Zealand birds that had been published in 1873.   By 1884, she had started work on a book of native plants, ''The Native Flowers of New Zealand Illustrated in Colours'', embarking (with the backing from the government and the Union Steamship Company) on a trip around New Zealand to obtain live specimens. She collected plants from the North Island and travelled to the South Island to collect specimens from Nelson, Greymouth and Arthurs Pass. She spent six weeks in Christchurch, sketching the plants in their botanical gardens which came from places she was unable to travel to.  This included Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands.&lt;ref name="Wellington 2013"&gt;{{cite book|title=The essential Audrey Eagle|last1=Eagle|first1=Audrey|date=2013|publisher=Te Papa Press|others=Introduction by Dr Patrick Brownsey|isbn=9781877385902|location=Wellington, New Zealand|at=Introduction pages 14 - 15|authorlink=Audrey Eagle}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Loranthus adamsii by Georgina Burne Hetley.jpg|thumb|''[[Trilepidea adamsii]]'' (previously known as ''Loranthus adamsii'') by Georgina Burne Hetley.]]
Hetley went to England to seek a publisher, receiving assistance along the way from authorities at Kew, and the chromolithographs were ultimately produced in 1888 by Leighton Brothers. The plates also had the distinction of being published in a French edition a year later.&lt;ref name="Wellington 2013" /&gt; The inclusion in the book of [[Trilepidea adamsii|''Loranthus adamsii'']] is notable as this native mistletoe was discovered by Mr James Adams of the Thames goldfields shortly before it became extinct. Without the work of botanical artists such as Hetley there would be no record of what this plant truly looked like.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt; While in London, her work was exhibited at the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]]. 

Hetley returned to New Zealand in 1889 and exhibited her New Zealand flora at the General Assembly Library in Wellington. She also help another major exhibit, 150 paintings in all, at Auckland Museum. Hetley lived in Auckland for the rest of her life, dying there after a long illness, on 29 August 1898.&lt;ref name="Viking 1999" /&gt;

'''Glasgow Print Studio''' is an arts organisation situated in [[Glasgow, Scotland]].  Founded in 1972, Glasgow Print Studio is an organisation with charitable status that exists to encourage and promote the art of printmaking; it is supported by the [[Creative Scotland]] and [[Glasgow City Council]].

Providing facilities for the production of [[etchings]], [[relief prints]] and [[screenprints]], Glasgow Print Studio has a membership of over 300 artists who use the custom-built printmakers workshop.  The Studio also has two exhibition spaces hosting an exhibitions programme.  It also runs a learning programme focused on teaching and developing understanding of fine art [[printmaking]].

As well as providing subsidised printmaking facilities to artists, the Studio also supports its artist members by promoting and selling their art work in the gallery, on its web site and at international art fairs.

The Studio also has a print publishing programme, where an artist is invited to the studio to work with a master printmaker to make an edition of original prints.  It has worked with a range of Scottish and international artists, including [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Peter Howson]], [[Christine Borland]], [[Alasdair Gray]]. These publications can be seen in the gallery and on the Studio's web site. 

History: 

In 1972 a group of graduates from Glasgow School of Art set up Glasgow Print Studio in a flat in [[Finnieston]]. Finding nowhere that they could continue printmaking after graduation, they were supported by the [[Glasgow School of Art]]'s Head of Printmaking, Philip Reeves, to establish their own workshop.

As membership of the organisation increased, the 1976 move to Ingram Street in the city centre provided a larger workshop plus a gallery. Here, artists had a space to sell their work and the programme ranged from contemporary print to the popular Scottish Cartoonists exhibition and a retrospective by [[L. S. Lowry|LS Lowry]]. At Ingram Street, the Print Studio was at the centre of a social and artistic whirl. Bands played and plays were performed in the gallery, while the Print Studio Press published books by Scottish writers including [[Liz Lochhead|Liz Lochead]] and [[Alasdair Gray]]. The Studio also organised an annual Midsummer Ball, which became a key event in Glasgow’s social calendar.

Fruitful relationships have developed with established artists such as [[Elizabeth Blackadder]], [[Adrian Wiszniewski]], Scott Myles, [[Jim Lambie]], [[Claire Barclay]], [[Ciara Phillips|Ciara Philips]] and [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], who work collaboratively with the Studio’s master printers. The Studio offers both traditional and digital printing facilities and uses its expertise to work with contemporary galleries like [[The Modern Institute]]. Over forty years after its establishment, Glasgow Print Studio continues to play a vital role in encouraging and supporting a vibrant artistic community.

Unique to Scotland’s cultural landscape and central to the development of Glasgow’s [[Merchant City]] as the city's vibrant cultural quarter, the studio's workshop, galleries, archive, education space and other facilities now span three floors of Glasgow’s centre for art and creativity, [[Trongate 103.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">Many countries have featured [[insects]] on stamps. Insect related topics such as the [[mosquito]] eradication (anti malaria) programme of the 1960s as well as graphic designs based on insects have also appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Said Brahman]], Historical Perspective of Pipefish and Commemorative Stamps on Malaria, ''Holders Mexicans'', Pakistan, Volt., No. 3, 1998: 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Many stamps also feature butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;Hassel, Sidney A. "A Taxonomic List Of Philatelic Lepidoptera." ''Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society''. VIP. 22 No. 4 (1968), p. 241-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insects only started to appear on stamps much later than other larger and more attractive animals. The first postal stamp featuring a beetle was released in 1948 in Chile as a tribute to natural historian [[Claudio Gay]]. Since then, insects have become popular subjects in philately. Between 1953 and 1969, about 100 stamps featuring beetles were published worldwide. Most of the time, aesthetically attractive species are pictured, but some stamps also feature pests. In other instances, due to simplified drawing, it is hard to identify what species is depicted on the stamp.&lt;ref&gt;Kabourek, V. "Beetles on Stamps." ''Ethnoentomology'', 1 No. 1 (2017), p. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画||kaiga, also gadō 画道}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art|Japanese visual arts]], encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the long history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and the adaptation of imported ideas, mainly from [[Chinese painting]] which was especially influential at a number of points; significant [[Western painting|Western]] influence only comes from the later 16th century onwards, beginning at the same time as Japanese art [[Japonisme|was influencing that of the West]]. 

Areas of subject matter where Chinese influence has been repeatedly significant include Buddhist religious painting, [[ink-wash painting]] of landscapes in the Chinese [[literati painting]] tradition, calligraphy of ideographs,&lt;ref&gt;J. Conder, Paintings and studies by Kawanabe Kyôsai, 1911, Kawanabe Kyôsai Memorial Museum, Japan: "It is sometimes said that Japanese painting is merely another kind of writing, but..." p.27&lt;/ref&gt; and the painting of animals and plants, especially birds and flowers.  However distinctively Japanese traditions have developed in all these fields.  The subject matter that is widely regarded as most characteristic of Japanese painting, and later [[printmaking]], is the depiction of scenes from everyday life and narrative scenes that are often crowded with figures and detail.  This tradition no doubt began in the early medieval period under Chinese influence that is now beyond tracing except in the most general terms, but from the period of the earliest surviving works had developed into a specifically Japanese tradition that lasted until the modern period.

The official [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)]] includes 158 works or sets of works from the 8th to the 19th century (though including a number of Chinese paintings that have long been in Japan) that represent peaks of achievement, or very rare survivals from early periods.

==Timeline==

===Ancient Japan and Asuka period (until 710)===
The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple figural representations, as well as botanical, architectural, and geometric designs are found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300 BC – 300 AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figural designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus|tumuli]] dating to the [[Kofun period]] and [[Asuka period]] (300–700 AD).

Along with the introduction of the Chinese writing system (''[[kanji]]''), Chinese modes of governmental administration, and [[Buddhism]] in the [[Asuka period]], many art works were imported into Japan from [[China]] and local copies in similar styles began to be produced.

===Nara period (710–794)===
[[File:Takamatsuzuka tomb mural.jpg|thumb|Mural painting from the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]]]]

With the further establishment of [[Buddhism]] in 6th- and 7th-century Japan, religious painting flourished and was used to adorn numerous temples erected by the aristocracy. However, [[Nara period|Nara-period]] Japan is recognized more for important contributions in the art of [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] than painting.

The earliest surviving paintings from this period include the [[mural]]s on the interior walls of the {{nihongo|Kondō|金堂}} at the temple [[Hōryū-ji]] in [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture]]. These mural paintings, as well as painted images on the important [[Tamamushi Shrine]] include narratives such as ''[[jataka]]'', episodes from the life of [[Gautama Buddha|the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni]], in addition to iconic images of buddhas, [[bodhisattvas]], and various minor deities. The style is reminiscent of [[Chinese painting]] from the [[Sui dynasty]] or the late [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period. However, by the mid-Nara period, paintings in the style of the [[Tang dynasty]] became very popular. These also include the wall murals in the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]], dating from around 700 AD. This style evolved into the ([[Kara-e]]) genre, which remained popular through the early [[Heian period]].

As most of the paintings in the Nara period are religious in nature, the vast majority are by anonymous artists. A large collection of Nara period art, Japanese as well as from the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp/shosoinPublic/doc/about_treasure.html |title=The Imperial Household Agency "About the Shosoin" |publisher=Shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523145410/http://shosoin.kunaicho.go.jp/shosoinPublic/doc/about_treasure.html |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is preserved at the [[Shōsō-in]], an 8th-century repository formerly owned by [[Tōdai-ji]] and currently administered by the [[Imperial Household Agency]].

===Heian period (794–1185)===
With the development of the Esoteric [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects of [[Shingon]] and [[Tendai]], painting of the 8th and 9th centuries is characterized by religious imagery, most notably painted {{nihongo|[[Mandala]]|曼荼羅|mandara}}. Numerous versions of mandala, most famously the ''[[Diamond Realm]] Mandala'' and ''[[Womb Realm]] Mandala'' at Tōji in Kyoto, were created as [[hanging scrolls]], and also as [[mural]]s on the walls of temples. A noted early example is at the five-story [[pagoda]] of [[Daigo-ji]], a temple south of [[Kyoto]].

With the rising importance of [[Pure Land]] sects of [[Japanese Buddhism]] in the 10th century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include {{nihongo|[[raigō]]zu|来迎図}}, which depict [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha along with attendant bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto]]. This is also considered an early example of so-called {{nihongo|[[Yamato-e]]|大和絵|extra= "Japanese-style painting"}}, insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. ''Yamato-e'' is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

The mid-Heian period is seen as the golden age of ''Yamato-e,'' which were initially used primarily for sliding doors (''[[fusuma]]'') and folding screens (''[[byōbu]]''). However, new painting formats also came to the fore, especially towards the end of the Heian period, including ''[[emakimono]]'', or long illustrated handscrolls. Varieties of ''emakimono'' encompass illustrated novels, such as the '' [[Genji Monogatari]] '', historical works, such as the '' [[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]] '', and religious works. In some cases, ''emaki'' artists employed pictorial narrative conventions that had been used in Buddhist art since ancient times, while at other times they devised new narrative modes that are believed to convey visually the emotional content of the underlying narrative. ''Genji Monogatari'' is organized into discreet episodes, whereas the more lively ''[[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]]'' uses a continuous narrative mode in order to emphasize the narrative's forward motion. These two ''emaki'' differ stylistically as well, with the rapid brush strokes and light coloring of ''Ban Dainagon'' contrasting starkly to the abstracted forms and vibrant mineral pigments of the ''Genji'' scrolls. The '' [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Siege of the Sanjō Palace]] '' is another famous example of this type of painting.

''E-maki'' also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the ''[[onna-e]]'' ("women's pictures") and ''[[otoko-e]]'' ("men's pictures") and  styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles. Although the terms seem to suggest the aesthetic preferences of each gender, historians of Japanese art have long debated the actual meaning of these terms, and they remain unclear. Perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. ''Onna-e'', epitomized by the ''Tale of Genji'' handscroll, typically deals with court life and courtly romance while ''otoko-e'', often deal with historical or semi-legendary events, particularly battles.

===Kamakura period (1185–1333)===
These genres continued on through [[Kamakura period]] Japan. ''E-maki'' of various kinds continued to be produced; however, the Kamakura period was much more strongly characterized by the art of [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], rather than painting.

As most of the paintings in the Heian and Kamakura periods are religious in nature, the vast majority are by anonymous artists.

===Muromachi period (1333–1573)===

During the 14th century, the development of the great [[Zen]] monasteries in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and [[Kyoto]] had a major impact on the visual arts. ''[[Suibokuga]],'' an austere monochrome style of ink painting introduced from the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty]] China largely replaced the polychrome scroll paintings of the previous period, although some polychrome portraiture remained – primary in the form of ''chinso'' paintings of Zen monks. Typical of such painting is the depiction by the priest-painter [[Kaō (painter)|Kaō]] of the legendary monk Kensu (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brush strokes and a minimum of detail.

''Catching a Catfish with a Gourd'' (located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto), by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]], marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the "new style" of the painting, executed about 1413, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome [[landscape painting]]s (山水画 ''[[Shan shui|sansuiga]]'') had found patronage by the ruling [[Ashikaga clan|Ashikaga]] family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. A further development of landscape painting was the poem picture scroll, known as [[shigajiku]].

The foremost artists of the [[Muromachi period]] are the priest-painters [[Tenshō Shūbun|Shūbun]] and [[Sesshū Tōyō|Sesshū]]. Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]], created in the painting ''[[:File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|Reading in a Bamboo Grove]]'' (1446) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshū, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. ''Landscape of the Four Seasons'' (''Sansui Chokan''; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the [[Kanō school]] and the [[Ami school]] ([[:ja:阿弥派]]) adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

Important artists in the Muromachi period Japan include:
* [[Mokkei]] (c. 1250)
* [[Mokuan Reien]] (died 1345)
* [[Kaō (painter)|Kaō Ninga]] (e.14th century)
* [[Mincho (artist)|Mincho]] (1352–1431)
* [[Josetsu]] (1405–1423)
* [[Tenshō Shūbun]] (died 1460)
* [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506)
* [[Kanō Masanobu]] (1434–1530)
* [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559)

===Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–{{not a typo|1615}})===&lt;!-- in politics, Azuchi–Momoyama ends in 1603, but in art it ends in 1615 --&gt;
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|Screen detail depicting arrival of a Western ship, attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]] (1570–1616)]]
In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. The [[Kanō school]], patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers, gained tremendously in size and prestige. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]].

However, non-Kano school artists and currents existed and developed during the Azuchi–Momoyama period as well, adapting Chinese themes to Japanese materials and [[aesthetics]]. One important group was the [[Tosa school]], which developed primarily out of the ''yamato-e'' tradition, and which was known mostly for small scale works and illustrations of literary classics in book or ''emaki'' format.

Important artists in the Azuchi-Momoyama period include:
* [[Kanō Eitoku]] (1543–1590)
* [[Kanō Sanraku]] (1559–1663)
* [[Kanō Tan'yū]] (1602–1674)
* [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]] (1539–1610)
* [[Kaihō Yūshō]] (1533–1615)

===[[Edo period]] (1603–1868)===
[[File:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Scroll calligraphy of [[Bodhidharma]]&lt;!-- "Zen points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become Buddha",--&gt; by Hakuin Ekaku (1685 to 1768)]]

Many art historians show the Edo period as a continuation of the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Certainly, during the early Edo period, many of the previous trends in painting continued to be popular; however, a number of new trends also emerged.

One very significant school which arose in the early Edo period was the [[Rinpa school]], which used classical themes, but presented them in a bold, and lavishly decorative format. Sōtatsu in particular evolved a decorative style by re-creating themes from classical literature, using brilliantly colored figures and motifs from the natural world set against gold-leaf backgrounds. A century later, Korin reworked Sōtatsu's style and created visually gorgeous works uniquely his own.

Another important genre which began during Azuchi–Momoyama period, but which reached its full development during the early Edo period was ''[[Namban]]'' art, both in the depiction of exotic foreigners and in the use of the exotic foreigner style in painting. This genre was centered around the port of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], which after the start of the [[sakoku|national seclusion policy]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was the only Japanese port left open to foreign trade, and was thus the conduit by which Chinese and European artistic influences came to Japan. Paintings in this genre include [[Nanpin school|Nagasaki school]] paintings, and also the [[Shijō school|Maruyama-Shijo school]], which combine Chinese and Western influences with traditional Japanese elements.

A third important trend in the Edo period was the rise of the ''Bunjinga'' (literati painting) genre, also known as the [[Nanga (Japanese painting)|Nanga school]] (Southern Painting school). This genre started as an imitation of the works of Chinese scholar-amateur painters of the [[Yuan dynasty]], whose works and techniques came to Japan in the mid-18th century. Master Kuwayama Gyokushū was the greatest supporter of creating the ''bunjin'' style. He theorised that polychromatic landscapes were to be considered at the same level of monochromatic paintings by Chinese literati. Furthermore, he included some Japanese traditionalist artists, such as [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]] and [[Ogata Kōrin]] of the Rinpa group, among major Nanga representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Marco, Meccarelli. 2015.  [https://www.academia.edu/20410225/Chinese_Painters_in_Nagasaki_Style_and_Artistic_Contaminatio_during_the_Tokugawa_Period_1603-1868_ "Chinese Painters in Nagasaki: Style and Artistic Contaminatio during the Tokugawa Period (1603–1868)"] Ming Qing Studies 2015, Pages 175–236.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later ''bunjinga'' artists considerably modified both the techniques and the subject matter of this genre to create a blending of Japanese and Chinese styles. The exemplars of this style are [[Ike no Taiga]], [[Uragami Gyokudō]], [[Yosa Buson]], [[Tanomura Chikuden]], [[Tani Bunchō]], and [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]].

Due to the Tokugawa shogunate's policies of fiscal and social austerity, the luxurious modes of these genre and styles were largely limited to the upper strata of society, and were unavailable, if not actually forbidden to the lower classes. The common people developed a separate type of art, the ''[[fūzokuga]],'' (風俗画, [[Genre art]]) in which painting depicting scenes from common, everyday life, especially that of the common people, ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre, prostitutes and landscapes were popular. These paintings in the 16th century gave rise to the paintings and woodcut prints of [[ukiyo-e]].

Important artists in the Edo period include:
* [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]] (died 1643)
* [[Tosa Mitsuoki]] (1617–1691)
* [[Ogata Kōrin]] (1658–1716)
* [[Gion Nankai]] (1677–1751)
* [[Sakaki Hyakusen]] (1697–1752)
* [[Yanagisawa Kien]] (1704–1758)
* [[Yosa Buson]] (1716–1783)
* [[Itō Jakuchū]] (1716–1800)
* [[Ike no Taiga]] (1723–1776)
* [[Suzuki Harunobu]] (c. 1725–1770)

===[[Empire of Japan|Prewar period]] (1868–1945)===
[[File:Kuroda-seiki-kohan00-6-1b.jpeg|thumb|[[Kuroda Seiki]], ''Lakeside'', 1897, oil on canvas, [[Kuroda Memorial Hall]], [[Tokyo]]]]
[[File:Yoritomo in a cave.jpg|thumb|''Yoritomo in a Cave'' by [[Maeda Seison]]]]

The prewar period was marked by the division of art into competing European styles and traditional indigenous styles.

During the [[Meiji period]], Japan underwent a tremendous political and social change in the course of the [[Europeanization]] and modernization campaign organized by the [[Meiji government]]. Western-style painting (''[[yōga]]'') was officially promoted by the government, who sent promising young artists abroad for studies, and who hired [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|foreign artists]] to come to Japan to establish an art curriculum at Japanese schools.

However, after an initial burst of enthusiasm for western style art, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, and led by [[art critic]] [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and educator [[Ernest Fenollosa]], there was a revival of appreciation for traditional Japanese styles ([[Nihonga]]). In the 1880s, western style art was banned from official exhibitions and was severely criticized by critics. Supported by Okakura and Fenollosa, the ''Nihonga'' style evolved with influences from the European [[pre-Raphaelite]] movement and European [[romanticism]].

The Yōga style painters formed the ''Meiji Bijutsukai'' (Meiji Fine Arts Society) to hold its own exhibitions and to promote a renewed interest in western art.

In 1907, with the establishment of the'' [[Bunten]]'' under the aegis of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]], both competing groups found mutual recognition and co-existence, and even began the process towards mutual synthesis.

The [[Taishō period]] saw the predominance of ''Yōga'' over ''Nihonga''. After long stays in Europe, many artists (including Arishima Ikuma) returned to Japan under the reign of Yoshihito, bringing with them the techniques of [[impressionism]] and early [[Post-Impressionism]]. The works of [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] influenced early Taishō period paintings. However, ''yōga'' artists in the Taishō period also tended towards [[eclecticism]], and there was a profusion of dissident artistic movements. These included the Fusain Society (''Fyuzankai'') which emphasized styles of post-impressionism, especially [[fauvism]]. In 1914, the ''Nikakai'' (Second Division Society) emerged to oppose the government-sponsored Bunten Exhibition.

Japanese painting during the Taishō period was only mildly influenced by other contemporary European movements, such as [[neoclassicism]] and late post-impressionism.

However, it was resurgent ''Nihonga'', towards mid-1920s, which adopted certain trends from post-impressionism. The second generation of ''Nihonga'' artists formed the [[Japan Fine Arts Academy]] (''Nihon Bijutsuin'') to compete against the government-sponsored ''Bunten'', and although ''yamato-e'' traditions remained strong, the increasing use of western [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and western concepts of space and light began to blur the distinction between ''Nihonga'' and ''yōga''.

Japanese painting in the prewar [[Shōwa period]] was largely dominated by [[Sōtarō Yasui]] and [[Ryūzaburō Umehara]], who introduced the concepts of [[pure art]] and [[abstract painting]] to the ''Nihonga'' tradition, and thus created a more interpretative version of that genre. This trend was further developed by Leonard Foujita and the Nika Society, to encompass [[surrealism]]. To promote these trends, the Independent Art Association (''Dokuritsu Bijutsu Kyokai'') was formed in 1931.

During the [[World War II]], government controls and [[censorship]] meant that only patriotic themes could be expressed. Many artists were recruited into the government [[propaganda]] effort, and critical non-emotional review of their works is only just beginning.

Important artists in the prewar period include:
* [[Harada Naojirō]] (1863–1899)
* [[Yamamoto Hōsui]] (1850–1906)
* [[Asai Chū]] (1856–1907)

* [[Okada Saburōsuke]] (1869–1939)
* [[Sakamoto Hanjirō]] (1882–1962)
* [[Aoki Shigeru]] (1882–1911)
* [[Fujishima Takeji]] (1867–1943)
* [[Yokoyama Taikan]] 1868-1958
* [[Hishida Shunsō]] 1874-1911

* [[Yasuda Yukihiko]] (1884–1978)
* [[Kobayashi Kokei]] (1883–1957)
* [[Tsuguharu Foujita|Leonard Foujita]] (1886–1968)
* [[Yuzō Saeki]] (1898–1928)
* [[Itō Shinsui]] (1898–1972)
* [[Kaburaki Kiyokata]] (1878–1972)
* [[Takehisa Yumeji]] (1884–1934)

===Postwar period (1945–present)===
In the postwar period, the government-sponsored [[Japan Art Academy]] (''Nihon Geijutsuin'') was formed in 1947, containing both ''nihonga'' and ''yōga'' divisions. Government sponsorship of art exhibitions has ended, but has been replaced by private exhibitions, such as the ''Nitten'', on an even larger scale. Although the ''Nitten'' was initially the exhibition of the Japan Art Academy, since 1958 it has been run by a separate private corporation. Participation in the ''Nitten'' has become almost a prerequisite for nomination to the Japan Art Academy, which in itself is almost an unofficial prerequisite for nomination to the [[Order of Culture]].

The arts of the [[Edo period|Edo]] and [[Empire of Japan|prewar]] periods (1603–1945) was supported by [[merchant]]s and urban people. Counter to the Edo and prewar periods, arts of the postwar period became popular. After [[World War II]], painters, [[calligraphy|calligraphers]], and [[printmaker]]s flourished in the big cities, particularly [[Tokyo]], and became preoccupied with the mechanisms of urban life, reflected in the flickering lights, [[neon]] colors, and frenetic pace of their abstractions. All the "isms" of the New York-Paris art world were fervently embraced. After the abstractions of the 1960s, the 1970s saw a return to realism strongly flavored by the "op" and "pop" art movements, embodied in the 1980s in the explosive works of [[Ushio Shinohara]]. Many such outstanding avant-garde artists worked both in Japan and abroad, winning international prizes. These artists felt that there was "nothing Japanese" about their works, and indeed they belonged to the international school. By the late 1970s, the search for Japanese qualities and a national style caused many artists to reevaluate their artistic ideology and turn away from what some felt were the empty formulas of the West. Contemporary paintings within the modern idiom began to make conscious use of traditional Japanese art forms, devices, and ideologies. A number of ''[[mono-ha]]'' artists turned to painting to recapture traditional nuances in spatial arrangements, color harmonies, and lyricism.

Japanese-style or ''[[nihonga]]'' painting continues in a prewar fashion, updating traditional expressions while retaining their intrinsic character. Some artists within this style still paint on [[silk]] or paper with traditional colors and ink, while others used new materials, such as [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]].

Many of the older schools of art, most notably those of the Edo and prewar periods, were still practiced. For example, the decorative naturalism of the ''rimpa'' school, characterized by brilliant, pure colors and bleeding washes, was reflected in the work of many artists of the postwar period in the 1980s art of [[Hikosaka Naoyoshi]]. The realism of [[Maruyama Ōkyo]]'s [[Maruyama school|school]] and the calligraphic and spontaneous Japanese style of the gentlemen-scholars were both widely practiced in the 1980s. Sometimes all of these schools, as well as older ones, such as the [[Kanō school]] ink traditions, were drawn on by contemporary artists in the Japanese style and in the modern idiom. Many Japanese-style painters were honored with awards and prizes as a result of renewed popular demand for Japanese-style art beginning in the 1970s. More and more, the international modern painters also drew on the Japanese schools as they turned away from Western styles in the 1980s. The tendency had been to synthesize East and West. Some artists had already leapt the gap between the two, as did the outstanding painter [[Shinoda Toko]]. Her bold sumi ink abstractions were inspired by traditional calligraphy but realized as lyrical expressions of modern abstraction.

There are also a number of contemporary painters in Japan whose work is largely inspired by [[anime]] sub-cultures and other aspects of popular and youth culture. [[Takashi Murakami]] is perhaps among the most famous and popular of these, along with and the other artists in his [[Kaikai Kiki]] studio collective. His work centers on expressing issues and concerns of postwar Japanese society through what are usually seemingly innocuous forms. He draws heavily from anime and related styles, but produces paintings and sculptures in media more traditionally associated with fine arts, intentionally blurring the lines between commercial and popular art and fine arts.

Important artists in the postwar period include:
* [[Ogura Yuki]] (1895–2000)
* [[Uemura Shōko]] (1902–2001)
* [[Ryōhei Koiso|Koiso Ryōhei]] (1903–1988)
* [[Kaii Higashiyama]] (1908–1999)

[[File:Drizzlecombe kist 1.JPG|thumb|'''Kistvaen''' on the southern edge of Dartmoor in Drizzlecombe]]

A '''kistvaen''' or '''cistvaen''' is a [[tomb]] or [[burial chamber]] formed from flat stone slabs in a box-like shape. If set completely underground, it may be covered by a ''[[tumulus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril M. Harris, ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'' (Courier Dover Publications, 1983), p. 118 with illustration [https://books.google.com/books?id=6n4JLmyooTwC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=kistvaen&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1946&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=kistvaen&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] ''[[cist]]'' (chest) and ''maen'' (stone). The term originated in relation to [[Celts|Celtic]] structures, typically pre-[[Christian]], but in [[antiquarian]] scholarship of the 19th and early 20th centuries it was sometimes applied to similar structures outside the [[Celtic nations|Celtic world]].

[[File:Kist off merrivale row-4.jpg|thumb|Kistvaen to the south of the stone rows at [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] on [[Dartmoor]]]]

One of the most numerous kinds of kistvaen are the [[Dartmoor kistvaens]]. These often take the form of small rectangular pits about 3&amp;nbsp;ft. (0.9 m) long by 2 feet (0.6 m) wide. The kistvaens were usually covered with a mound of earth and surrounded by a circle of small stones. When a body was placed in the kistvaen, it was usually lain in a contracted position. Sometimes however the body was [[cremate]]d with the ashes placed in a [[cinerary urn]].

==Kistvaens and Celtic saints==
Kistvaens are also found associated with holy sites or burial places of early [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic saints]], who are often [[hagiography|semi-legendary]]. Saints associated with kistvaens include [[Callwen]] daughter of [[Brychan]], [[Gerent, Saint|Geraint]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Baring-Gould and John Fisher, ''The Lives of the British Saints'' (London, 1908) p. 67 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-G4AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Callwen+cistvaen+intitle:lives+intitle:of+intitle:the+intitle:British+intitle:Saints&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Callwen%20cistvaen%20intitle%3Alives%20intitle%3Aof%20intitle%3Athe%20intitle%3ABritish%20intitle%3ASaints&amp;f=false online] and  vol. 3, p. 51 [https://books.google.com/books?id=xDdaqXsOJbcC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=kistvaen&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1946&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=kistvaen&amp;f=false online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Begnet]],&lt;ref&gt;In the quoted passage incorrectly identified as St. Benedict; Joseph P.

'''Lath art''' is a form of [[woodworking]] [[folk art]] for making rustic pictures out of strips out of old "[[lath]]" from "[[plaster]] and lath" walls. Today it is commonly made from lattice, lumber stickers and [[weathering|weathered]] [[lobster trap]]s. Beach scenes and rural scenes are the most popular themes. 

==Techniques==
  
Lath art has a lot in common with [[marquetry]] and [[intarsia]]. They are all woodworking hobbies to make pictures out of sections of wood, but marquetry  and intarsia use the wood grain as a design element, and lath art uses the direction of the [[lath]] stick and the colors of the stains as a design element.

[[File:Archangel Michael, St Pancras New Church, London.JPG|thumb|300px|Onyx sculpture in the grounds of [[St Pancras New Church]], London]] 
This is a geographical '''list of [[rock (geology)|natural stone]]''' used for decorative purposes in [[construction]] and [[monumental sculpture]] produced in various countries.

The [[dimension stone|dimension-stone]] industry classifies stone based on appearance and hardness as either "granite", "marble" or "slate".

The granite of the dimension-stone industry along with truly granitic rock also includes gneiss, gabbro, anorthosite and even some sedimentary rocks.

Natural stone is used as architectural stone (construction, flooring, cladding, counter tops, curbing, etc.) and as raw block and monument stone for the funerary trade. Natural stone is also used in custom stone engraving. The engraved stone can be either decorative or functional. Natural memorial stones are used as [[natural burial]] markers.

'''Virgin and Child''' or '''Madonna and Child''' or '''Mary and Child''' usually refers to artistic depictions of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and Child [[Jesus]] together, as part of both [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church traditions, and very notably in the [[Marian art in the Catholic Church]]. The various different names are effectively interchangeable, and any particular work may be given different titles by different sources.

[[File:Louise von Panhuys.jpg|thumb|Louise von Panhuys, 1823]]
'''Louise von Panhuys''' née von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten (October 10, 1763 – October 18, 1844) was a German botanical artist and landscape painter. 

==Early years==
Born Louise Friederike Auguste von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten in [[Frankfurt]], she was the sixth child of Charlene von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten (1736&amp;ndash;1804), and Heinrich Carl von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten (1725&amp;ndash;1793), who was later made a baron. She received artistic training from her mother, who was an amateur painter, and from a relative, Christian Georg Schütz the Elder. Through family connections, she made the acquaintance of the poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] early in life and they later corresponded.

She moved to [[Darmstadt]], probably after the death of her father, and lived with one of her brothers. Between 1802 and 1805 she took two long trips to England with her brother, where she made contact with English naturalists and botanical illustrators in order to continue her education as a painter. It appears that during this period she took private lessons with the well-known botanical painter [[James Sowerby]]. 

==Marriage==
In 1805, she married a widowed Dutch officer, Willem Benjamin van Panhuys (1764&amp;ndash;1816). In 1811, they traveled to [[Suriname]], where he had a coffee plantation inherited from his deceased first wife. They later acquired a sugar cane plantation there as well. In early 1816, Suriname—which has been occupied by the English since 1804—returned to Dutch rule. Willem was appointed Governor-General by King [[William I of the Netherlands]], but his tenure in office lasted only a few months as he died in July 1816. Louise then moved back to Frankfurt, where she lived in a house that had once belonged to [[Matthäus Merian the Younger]].

==Art==
Louise von Panhuys mainly painted watercolors of plant specimens, with attention to scientific accuracy. She was influenced by the botanical art of [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] and the travel writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. During her years in Suriname, she painted some 90 watercolors, now housed [[Frankfurt University Library]].

In 1898, her work was shown publicly for the first time by the [[Senckenberg Nature Research Society]]. More recently, exhibitions showcasing her work have been mounted by the Frankfurt University Library (1991) and the Frankfurter Sparkasse (2009).

'''McIntosh &amp; Otis''' is a literary agency based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_0BVAvJFThUC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=%22ina+Winick%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OJ965SER-5&amp;sig=39Bd5fMTOnjcB0JAjt-Fq2lpR10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nm5FVcCFIoWqswGZ0oCoAg&amp;redir_esc=y | title = 2012 Guide to Literary Agents | editor = Chuck Sambuchino |location= |publisher= F+W Media, Inc. |page= 225 |date= Aug 9, 2011 |isbn= 9781599632438 |access-date= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated in 1928 by Mavis McIntosh and Elizabeth Otis. The agency handles literary estates and subsidiary rights for the authors that it represents.

==History==
Mavis McIntosh (1906-1986) and Elizabeth Otis founded McIntosh &amp; Otis in the mid 1920s, after they quit the literary agency at which they were working because they were dissatisfied with its practices. In 1928, they incorporated the firm, and by the early 1930s, it was a reputable and successful literary agency.&lt;ref name="steinbeck_encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book | url= https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=NikZBtGvy_gC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=mcintosh+and+otis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oDAwgxjZNl&amp;sig=vWelR8C5j02BPJG5Lk_5p33oB8Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_GxTU_6pDYqI8AHslICIAw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBzgK | editor = Brian E. Railsback, Michael J. Meyer | title= A John Steinbeck Encyclopedia | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, McIntosh &amp; Otis merged with New-York based agency Constance Smith Associates. [[Patricia Schartle Myrer]], who was a partner at Constance Smith Associates, became President of McIntosh &amp; Otis.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/08/harper-lee-dispute-royalties | title= To Steal a Mockingbird? | author= Mark Seal | date = August 2013 | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, McIntosh &amp; Otis hired Eugene Winick, a copyright attorney, as outside counsel to represent the literary estates of authors represented by McIntosh &amp; Otis, such as [[Mary Higgins Clark]], [[Harper Lee]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ayn Rand]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]]. In 1984, Patricia Schartle Myrer retired and appointed Eugene Winick as President of McIntosh &amp; Otis.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;

In 2001, Samuel Pinkus, a literary agent at McIntosh &amp; Otis and Eugene Winick's son-in-law, took over as President of the agency but left in 2004.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;
 
Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein, Eugene Winick's daughter, is currently the President of McIntosh &amp; Otis.&lt;ref name="elizabeth-winick-rubinstein"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://museandthemarketplace2015.com/2015/03/09/elizabeth-winick-rubinstein/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405230952/http://museandthemarketplace2015.com/2015/03/09/elizabeth-winick-rubinstein/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = April 5, 2015 | title = Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein | publisher = The Muse and the Marketplace 2015 | accessdate = April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elizabeth-winick-rubinstein-2"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://wemagazineforwomen.com/meet-woman-in-business-elizabeth-winick-rubinstein/ | title = Meet woman in Business Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein | publisher = WE magazine for women | author = Heidi Richards | date = September 13, 2013 | accessdate= April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Steinbeck ===
In 1931, [[John Steinbeck]] sent McIntosh &amp; Otis a number of his early manuscripts based on the recommendation of [[Carl Wilhelmson]]. McIntosh &amp; Otis gave Steinbeck positive encouragement, and he stuck with the firm as his only literary agency for the rest of his career, spanning nearly 40 years.&lt;ref name="steinbeck_encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/contribute/advisory/bios/elizabeth_winick_rubinstein.html | title= Bio of Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein | accessdate= April 20, 2014 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141010033601/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/contribute/advisory/bios/elizabeth_winick_rubinstein.html | archivedate= October 10, 2014 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, McIntosh &amp; Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' (1952) to [[Warner Brothers]], which adapted it as a [[East of Eden (film)|1955 movie]] starring [[James Dean]]. Steinbeck received $125,000 for the film rights, plus 25 percent of the profits.&lt;ref name="tcm"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16719/East-of-Eden/articles.html| title= East of Eden (1955), Turner Classic Movies | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Steinbeck won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature, he gave McIntosh &amp; Otis a percentage of the award money out of gratitude for their support.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;

In 2004, McIntosh &amp; Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel ''East of Eden'' to [[Universal Pictures]], after the book was chosen for [[Oprah's Book Club]] list. The option expired, and Universal had to once again obtain the film rights.&lt;ref name="hollywood_rep"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gary-ross-write-new-jennifer-682868 | title= Gary Ross to Write New Jennifer Lawrence 'East of Eden' Adaptation | author= Borys Kit  | publisher = Hollywood Reporter | date= Feb 24, 2014 | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A forthcoming two-film series, starring [[Jennifer Lawrence]], was scheduled for production as of April 2014.&lt;ref name="movies"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mcintoshandotis.com/recentnews.html | title= Recent News at McIntosh &amp; Otis | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-jennifer-lawrence-east-of-eden-20130926,0,2873688.story | title=Jennifer Lawrence to play 'East of Eden's' 'psychotic monster' | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=September 26, 2013 | accessdate=February 5, 2014 | author=Keegan, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jennifer Lawrence's 'East of Eden' May Be Two Movies, Says Director (Exclusive Video)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jennifer-lawrences-east-eden-may-695666|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=hollywoodreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patricia Highsmith ===
[[Patricia Highsmith]] appointed Patricia Schartle Myrer as her literary agent in 1959, when Myrer was with Constance Smith Associates. After Constance Smith Associates merged with McIntosh &amp; Otis in 1963, Myrer continued as Patricia Highsmith's American literary agent. A. M. Heath served as Patricia Highsmith's British agents. Over time, Patricia Highsmith came to resent the 5% commission each literary agency took, and Myrer fired Highsmith in 1979.&lt;ref name="patricia-highsmith"&gt;{{cite news | title = Murder, She Wrote |  author = Kera Bolonik | publisher = The Nation | date = November 20, 2003 | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/murder-she-wrote?page=full | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsidiary Rights==
McIntosh &amp; Otis handle the subsidiary rights for [[Louisiana University Press]] and the [[University of Nebraska Press]].

On September 12, 2013 McIntosh &amp; Otis announced that they would handle the subsidiary rights for [[Rutgers University Press]] with respect to paperback reprints, audio, e-book, book club, foreign, film, TV and stage rights.&lt;ref name="pw_2013-09-12"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/book-deals/article/59076-mcintosh-otis-to-handle-rup-s-sub-rights.html | title= McIntosh &amp; Otis to Handle RUP's Sub Rights | publisher = | date= Sep 12, 2013 | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In June 2013, McIntosh &amp; Otis filed a lawsuit against a literary agent formerly employed with them, Samuel Pinkus, in relation with another lawsuit that was filed against him by author [[Harper Lee]], who claimed that Pinkus had duped her into handing over her copyright for her novel ''[[To Kill A Mockingbird]]''.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harper_lee"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.law360.com/articles/470604/harper-lee-settles-with-agent-over-mockingbird-copyright | title= Harper Lee Settles With Agent Over 'Mockingbird' Copyright | author= Pete Brush | publisher = Law360 | date= September 6, 2013 | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harper_lee-2"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/12/harper-lee-lawsuit/2646765/ | title= 'Mockingbird' author stars in her own courtroom classic | author= Cara Matthews | work =  The (Westchester County, N.Y.)

'''Meditative poetry''' combines the religious practice of [[meditation]] with [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. It occurs in many cultures, especially in Asian, European and Hindu cultures. Especially [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] writers have developed extensive theories and phase models for meditation (Bevis 1988;73-88).

In [[Christianity]], meditation became a major [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] practice during the [[Middle Ages]], closely associated with the life in [[monasteries]]. Definitions vary, but there were various attempts to distinguish meditation from [[contemplation]]. While meditation focuses the mind on a text, preferably from the [[Bible]], contemplation will take a concrete object, such as a candle, to concentrate the thoughts of the mind. Both, contemplation and meditation had the same end, to seek unity with God.

During the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Jesuits like [[Ignatius of Loyola]] formalized the process of meditation, as a channeling of memory, understanding and will. His method of meditation fell into three main parts: A) prayer and composition of place; B) the examination of points ([[analysis]]); the colloquies (the dialogue with God as a climax) (Martz 1962, 27-32). [[Jesuits]] brought this practice to England (Daly 1978: 72). [[Calvinist]] and other Protestants adapted meditation to Bible studies.

[[Puritan]] meditation emphasized self-examination, applying Bible verses to contemporary, everyday life. In 1628, [[Thomas Taylor (priest, 1576–1633)|Thomas Taylor]] wrote a Puritan handbook ''Meditation from the Creatures'', recommending to include images from the sensible world (metaphorical of God's glory). In colonial [[New England]], [[Thomas Hooker]] defined meditation in ''The Souls Preparation for Christ'' (1632) as follows: "It is a settled exercise for two ends: first to make a further inquiry of the truth: and secondly, to make the heart affected therewith."

In 1648, the ''Shorter Catechism of the Westminster Assembly'' made meditation a duty for Puritans, and in 1649/50 [[Richard Baxter]]'s ''The Saints' Everlasting Rest'' became the standard Puritan text, at its core prescribing meditation. Like Taylor and Hooker, Baxter admitted the use of the senses, that is, he included contemplation with meditation, based on figural correspondences with the Bible. By including contemplation with meditation, the Puritans laid the foundation for a rich tradition of verse meditation in the USA from its colonial beginnings to the twenty-first century (Daly 1978, 74-76, 79-81; Martz 1962).

Soon Puritan ministers like [[Edward Taylor]] began to write meditations in verse, based on lines from the Bible and on sense perceptions, both [[allegorical]] of the greater glory of God. [[Anne Bradstreet]] provided the first published meditations purely based on the senses, celebrating nature's beauties as the creation of God. Using the [[analogy]] of Nature as God's second book, poetic meditations gradually secularized, replacing the early allegoric technique with a more [[symbol]]ic reading of nature and affirming the self-reliant individual (Pearce 1961, 42-57). 

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay ''Nature'' (1836) freed the meditation from its theological underpinnings and its reliance on the Bible. He encouraged poets to view nature as a storehouse of symbols that they could use simply relying on their [[imagination]]. [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Emily Dickinson]] took meditation into this direction and paved the way for Modernist and Postmodernist practices in poetry (Lawson 1994).

The method of the three main steps (composition of place, examination of points, colloquies) had survived into the twentieth century in many poems, as had the devotional practice of verse meditation. Leading modernist poets like [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wallace Stevens]] began to fragmentarize the process, blending thoughts and sense perceptions in a sort of spiritual diary (Parini 1993,12). Postmodernist poets like [[John Ashbery]] deconstruct the contemplative aspect, the [[reference]] of the poem to an object outside itself, dissolving [[narrative]] or [[Episode|episodic]] structures of the spiritual diary in an ironic and open association (Bevis 1988:280-90), and thereby turning the poem itself into the object the reader can use for contemplation or meditation. 

Meditative poetry has often been correlated to [[Relaxation Through Poetry]], which is simply using poetry to relax or relieve stress whenever someone is in need. It can also be seen in group visualization sessions where a speaker tries to get the audience to forget all about their stress by the use of calm and relaxing poetry.

The '''Mystery Spot''' is a visual illusion–based [[tourist attraction]] near [[Santa Cruz, California]], opened in 1939 by George Prather. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamers|first1=Chantal|title=Gravitational tourist draw|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/spot-22954-mystery-people.html|accessdate=9 March 2017|work=The Orange County Register|publisher=The Orange County Register|date=July 22, 2007|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors experience demonstrations that appear to defy gravity, on the short but steep uphill walk and inside a wooden building on the site.

==History==
[[File:Illusion at mystery spot santa cruz california.jpg|thumb|right|165px|One of the many optical illusions at the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot.]]
The Mystery Spot was first discovered by George Prather in 1939. George Prather was an electrician, mechanic, and inventor before he opened the site.  He was born near [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and moved to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] in 1920. He owned a welding shop and repair garage in the area before he discovered the Mystery Spot.  The Mystery Spot was one of several [[roadside attraction]]s that opened after World War II for new automobile owners and was featured on [[Art Baker (actor)|Art Baker]]'s television show [[You Asked for It|''You Asked For It'']].

Prather was inspired to open the site by the popularity of the nearby [[Oregon Vortex]] which opened to the public in 1930.  According to a newspaper report, Prather bought 3 acres on the hill in 1940 after he felt slightly dizzy while walking and was interested in his dizziness. The newspaper also reported that during further exploration of his property he found his compass jittering and he then built his "crazy house" and opened the site to the public in June 1941, where tour guides lead visitors through the Mystery Spot on a daily basis. The site is what is known as a [[gravity hill]] and was the first of its kind to be built in [[California]].  The guides perform various demonstrations to showcase the unusual phenomena that Prather stumbled upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bready|first1=Lowell|title=Mystery Spot - You Never Saw a Crazier Place - Opens Sunday for your Amazement|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=9075641&amp;fcfToken=425a595a55356332624c376859346830442b5a7554416d374a424173674372617043314676643135356b5033656e514732486550376b335368334e4871536432|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=June 13, 1941|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prather died in the month of January during  1946 and at that time his son Bruce inherited the land and continued running The Mystery Spot with his father's business partner Vaden McCray until his own passing in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruce Leonard Prather|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/santacruzsentinel/obituary.aspx?pid=176195421|accessdate=10 March 2017|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=October 25, 2015|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The McCray family was photographed for the ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine spread on the Mystery spot for their November 15, 1948 issue.  McCray died in 2001 before Bruce Prather.  An unnamed Santa Cruz lawyer now owns the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Grace Anestine (Osterberg) McCray|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/santacruzsentinel/obituary.aspx?n=grace-anestine-mccray-osterberg&amp;pid=88252320|accessdate=9 March 2017|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=May 22, 2007|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mystery Spot was nominated in July 2014 to be designated as a [[California Historical Landmarks in Santa Cruz County, California|California Historical landmark]] and was officially declared as California Historical Landmark #1055 in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Annual Report|url=http://www.ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1067/files/2014%20SHRC%20Annual%20Report_web.pdf|website=Office of Historic Preservation California State Parks Natural Resources Agency State of California|publisher=California State Parks|accessdate=10 March 2017|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The site is located in [[Santa Cruz, California]] amongst the [[Santa Cruz Mountains|Santa Cruz mountains]], [[Oak trees]], [[Eucalyptus tree]]s, near [[Granite Creek (Tulare County)|Granite Creek]], and within the [[California Redwoods|California Redwood forest]].  The Mystery Spot is between the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] and the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]], popular [[tourist spot]]s. The [[Redwood tree]]s in this area grow crookedly and are a part of what is known as the Twisted Grove in [[Nisene Marks|Nisene Marks State Park]]. The Mystery Spot can be found on [[Highway 17 (California)|Highway 17]] along the way to the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. The Mystery Spot is home to a [[man-made]] [[dahlia]] garden along the [[hiking trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Samantha|title=Santa Cruz Mystery Spot at 75: the Story, the Speculation, the Science|url=http://kazu.org/post/santa-cruz-mystery-spot-75-story-speculation-science#stream/0|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=90.3 KAZU|publisher=90.3 KAZU|date=June 20, 2016|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leaning on a table.jpg|thumb|The classic "Titanic" pose is possible on table at The Mystery Spot]]
[[File:Guide leaning on table at The Mystery Spot.jpg|thumb|Guide leaning on top of table at The Mystery Spot]]
The Mystery Spot is a [[gravity hill]], tilt-induced [[visual illusion]]. The illusion experienced by visitors results from the oddly tilted environment as well as standing on a tilted floor. Inside the tilted room of the Mystery Spot, misperceptions of the height and orientation of objects occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/1998/0909/spot.html|title = Santa Cruz "Mystery Spot" Explained|last = McBroom|first = Patricia|date = 9 September 1998|work = The Berkeleyan|access-date = 7 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when people are standing outside on a level ground, the slant of the building in the background causes misperceptions as humans judge the height of people using the slant of the roof rather than the true horizon.&lt;ref name="Shimamura"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00196 |author1=Shimamura, A.

These visual illusions include balls rolling uphill and people leaning farther than normally possible without falling down.&lt;ref&gt;"Paranormal and Transcendental Experience." Google Books. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychologists at Berkeley state that all of the misperceptions stem from the simple fact that the house is slanted at a 20 degree angle.&lt;ref&gt;"09.09.98 - Santa Cruz Mystery Spot Explained." 09.09.98 - Santa Cruz Mystery Spot Explained. Office of Public Affairs, UC Berkeley, n.d. Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor William Prinzmetal states, “When the perceiver's body also is tilted, the distorting impact on vision is greatly magnified- up to two or three times.”&lt;ref&gt;"09.09.98 - Santa Cruz Mystery Spot Explained." 09.09.98 - Santa Cruz Mystery Spot Explained. Office of Public Affairs, UC Berkeley, n.d. Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another point he makes is that distorted orientation causes other senses to fall back while your visual senses become heightened.&lt;ref&gt;"09.09.98 - Santa Cruz Mystery Spot Explained." 09.09.98 - Santa Cruz Mystery Spot Explained. Office of Public Affairs, UC Berkeley, n.d. Web. 19 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  People standing at impossible angles and water flowing uphill are related to the angle at which the house sits on.

Other suggestions have been proposed to explain the reason behind The Mystery Spot’s odd gravitational rules and illusions.  Tour guides suggest that “a [[meteor]] which fell in ancient days and left a magic circle” is the cause behind the mystery,&lt;ref&gt;Yamanaka, Sharon. "The Mystery Spot." Santa Cruz County History - Santa Cruz Public Libraries. Santa Cruz County History, n.d. Web. 15 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest that an [[electromagnetic field]] on the hill deters [[wildlife]].&lt;ref&gt;Yamanaka, Sharon. "The Mystery Spot." Santa Cruz County History - Santa Cruz Public Libraries. Santa Cruz County History, n.d. Web. 15 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are theories proposed by guides for entertainment, and not scientific reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Gullickson, Christina.

{{lowercase|net.art}}

'''net.art''' refers to a group of [[artists]] who have worked in the medium of [[Internet art]] since 1994. The main members of this movement are [[Vuk Ćosić]], [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi.org]], [[Alexei Shulgin]], [[Olia Lialina]], and [[Heath Bunting]] ([[irational.org]], [[Daniel García Andújar]], Heath Bunting, Rachel Baker and Minerva Cuevas). Although this group was formed as a [[parody]] of [[avant garde]] movements by writers such as Tilman Baumgärtel, Josephine Bosma, Hans Dieter Huber and Pit Schultz, their individual works have little in common.

The term "net.art" is also used as a synonym for net art or Internet art and covers a much wider range of artistic practices. In this wider definition, net.art means art that uses the Internet as its medium and that cannot be experienced in any other way. Typically net.art has the Internet and the specific socio-culture that it spawned as its subject matter but this is not required.

The German critic [[Tilman Baumgärtel]] - building on the ideas of American critic [[Clement Greenberg]] - has frequently argued for a "media specificity" of net.art in his writings. According to the introduction to his book "net.art. Materialien zur Netzkunst", the specific qualities of net.art are "connectivity, global reach, multimediality, immateriality, interactivity and egality".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgärtel, T. (1999). net.art. Materialien zur Netzkunst. Nürnberg: Verlag für moderne Kunst. p. 15. {{ISBN|3-933096-17-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  History of the net.art movement ==

The net.art movement arose in the context of the wider development of [[Internet art]]. As such, net.art is more of a movement and a critical and political landmark in Internet art history, than a specific [[genre]]. Early precursors of the net.art movement include the international [[fluxus]] (Nam June Paik) and avant-pop ([[Mark Amerika]]) movements. The avant-pop movement particularly became widely recognized in Internet circles from 1993, largely via the popular [[Alt-X]] site.

The term "net.art" has been wrongly attributed to artist [[Vuk Cosic]] in 1997, after Alexei Shulgin wrote about the origin of the term in a prank mail to the nettime mailinglist.&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, P &amp; Druckrey, T eds. (2001). net_condition. art and global media. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. p. 25. {{ISBN|978-0262731386}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:&gt;&gt;Date: Tue, 18 Mar 1997
:&gt;&gt;From: easylife@hawk.glas.apc.org
:&gt;&gt;Net.Art - the origin
:&gt;&gt;I feel it's time now to give a
:&gt;&gt;light on the origin of the
:&gt;&gt;term - "net.art". Actually, it's a
:&gt;&gt;readymade.
:&gt;&gt;In December 1995 Vuk Cosic
:&gt;&gt;got a message, sent via
:&gt;&gt;anonymous mailer.
:&gt;&gt;Because of incompatibility of
:&gt;&gt;software, the opened text
:&gt;&gt;appeared to be practically
:&gt;&gt;unreadable ascii abracadabra.
:&gt;&gt;The only fragment of it that
:&gt;&gt;made any sense looked
:&gt;&gt;something like:
:&gt;&gt;[...] J8~g#|\;Net.Art{-^s1[...]
:&gt;&gt;Vuk was very much amased (sic)
:&gt;&gt;and exited (sic): the net itself gave
:&gt;&gt;him a name for activity he was
:&gt;&gt;involved in!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shulgin's mail net.art stemmed from "conjoined phrases in an email bungled by a technical [[glitch]] (a morass of alphanumeric junk, its only legible term 'net.art')".&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Rachel Greene, ''Internet Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, London, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The term was however used by nettime initiator Pit Schultz as a title for an exhibition in Berlin in 1995, in which Vuk Cosic and Alexei Shulgin both showed their work.&lt;ref&gt;Bosma, J. (2011). Nettitudes. Let's Talk Net Art. Rotterdam: NAiPublishers, 2011. Print. p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used with regard to the "net.art per se" meeting of artists and theorists in [[Trieste]] in May 1996, and referred to a group of artists who worked together closely in the first half of the 1990s. These meetings gave birth to the [[website]] net.art per se,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ljudmila.org/naps/cnn/cnn.htm|title=Specific Net.art found possible|date=1989-05-16|publisher=CNN Interactive|accessdate=2009-03-12}} (reproduction of event listing, on Ljudmila.org)&lt;/ref&gt; a fake [[CNN]] website "commemorating" the event.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt;

== Online social networks ==
Net.artists have built [[digital art]] communities through an active practice of web hosting and web art curating. net.artists have defined themselves through an international and networked mode of communication, an interplay of exchanges, collaborative and cooperative work {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. They have a large presence on several [[mailing lists]] such as [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome]], File festival, [[Electronic Language International Festival]], [[Nettime]], Syndicate and Eyebeam. The identity of the net.artists is defined by both their digital works and their critical involvement in the digital art community,  as the polemical discussion led by Olia Lialina that occurred on [[Nettime]] in early 2006 on the "New Media" Wikipedia entry shows&lt;ref&gt;Lialina, O [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0511/threads.html#00025 A New Definition], Nettime Archive List&lt;/ref&gt;

net.artists like [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi]] developed a particular form of e-mail art, or [[E-mail spam|spam]] mail art, through text reprocessing and [[ASCII art]]. The term "spam art" was coined&lt;ref&gt;Madre, F [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0011/msg00049.html Interview by Josephine Bosma], Nettime list archive&lt;/ref&gt; by net critique and net art practitioner&lt;ref&gt;Madre, F [http://pleine-peau.com pleine-peau.com], site created in 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Frederic Madre to describe all such forms of disruptive interventions in mailing-lists, where seemingly nonsensical texts were generated by simple scripts, online forms or typed by hand.

A connection can be made to the e-mail interventions of "Codeworks" artists such as [[Mez Breeze|Mez]] or [[mi ga]] or robots like [http://www.triple-double-u.com/mailia Mailia] which analyze emails and reply to them. "Codeworks" is a term coined by poet Alan Sondheim to define the textual experiments of artists playing with faux-code and non-executable script or mark-up languages.

== Tactical media net art ==
net.art developed in a context of cultural crisis in Eastern Europe in the beginning of the 1990s after the end of the [[Soviet Union]] and the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]. The artists involved in net.art experiments are associated with the idea of a "social responsibility" that would answer the idea of democracy as a modern capitalist myth. The Internet, often promoted as the democratic tool par excellence, but largely participating in the rules of vested interests, is targeted by the net.artists who claimed that "a space where you can buy is a space where you can steal, but also where you can distribute". net.artists focus on finding new ways of sharing [[public space]].

By questioning structures such as the navigation window and challenging their functionality, net.artists have shown that what is considered to be natural by most Internet users is actually highly constructed, even controlled, by corporations. Company browsers like [[Netscape Navigator]] or [[Internet Explorer]] display user-friendly structures (the "navigation", the "exploration" are landmarks of social practices) to provide the user with a familiar environment; net.artists try to break this familiarity. Olia Lialina, in ''[[My Boyfriend Came Back From The War]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teleportacia.org/war/ My boyfriend came back from the war. After dinner they left us alone.]&lt;/ref&gt; or the duo Jodi, with their series of pop-up interventions and browser crashing applets, have engaged the materiality of navigation in their work. Their experiments have given birth to what could be called "browser art", which has been expanded by the British collective [[I/O/D]]'s experimental navigator WebStalker.

Alexei Shulgin and Heath Bunting have played with the structure of advertisement portals by establishing lists of keywords unlikely to be searched for but nonetheless existing on the web as URLs or metadata components: they use this relational data to enmesh paths of navigation in order to create new readable texts {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. The user is not exploring one art website that has its own meaning and [[aesthetic]] significance within itself, but rather they are exposed to the entire network as a collection of socioeconomic forces and political stances that are not always visible.

Rachel Greene has associated net.art with [[tactical media]] as a form of [[Detournement]]. Greene writes: "The subversion of corporate websites shares a blurry border with hacking and agitprop practices that would become an important field of net art, often referred to as 'tactical media'."&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt;

== Hacker culture ==
The Jodi collective works with the aesthetics of computer errors, which has a lot in common, on both the aesthetic and pragmatic levels, with [[hacker culture]]. Questioning and disturbing the browsing experience with hacks, code tricks, faux-code, and faux-virus, critically investigates the context in which they are agents. In turn, the digital environment becomes concerned with its own internal structure. The collective [[0100101110101101.org]] expands the idea of "art hacktivism" by performing code interventions and perturbations in art festivals such as the [[Venice Biennale]]. On the other hand, the collective irational.org expands the idea of "art hacktivism" by performing interventions and perturbations in the real world, acting on it as on a possible ground for social reengineering.

"We can point to a superficial difference between most net.art and hacking: hackers have an obsession with getting inside other computer systems and having an agency there, whereas the 404 errors in the JTDDS (for example) only engage other systems in an intentionally wrong manner in order to store a 'secret' message in their error logs. It's nice to think of artists as hackers who endeavour to get inside cultural systems and make them do things they were never intended to do: artists as culture hackers.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thing.net/eyebeam/msg00527.html|title=&lt;eyebeam&gt;&lt;blast&gt; 404|date=1998-05-01|publisher=thing.net|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the heyday of net.art developments, particularly during the rise of global [[Dot-com bubble|dot.com]] capitalism, the first series of critical columns appeared in German and English in the online publication [[Telepolis]]. Edited by writer and artist [[Armin Medosch]], the work published at Telepolis featured American artist and net theorist Mark Amerika's "Amerika Online" columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/special/ame.html|title=Amerika Online|publisher=Telepolis|accessdate=2009-03-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504081712/http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/special/ame.html|archivedate=2009-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These columns satirized the way self-effacing net.artists (himself included) took themselves too seriously. In response, European net.artists impersonated Amerika in faux emails to deconstruct his demystification of the marketing schemes most net.artists employed to achieve art world legitimacy. It was suggested that "the duplicitous dispatches were meant to raise US awareness of electronic artists in Europe, and may even contain an element of jealousy."&lt;ref&gt;Mirapaul, M [http://cramer.plaintext.cc:70/personal_archives/codework/7-11/7-11.mbox%7C/MBOX-MESSAGE/1628 War of the Words: Ersatz E-Mail Tilts at Art], ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these net.art interventions also tackled the issue of art as business and investigated mainstream cultural institutions such as the [[Tate Modern]]. Harwood,  a member of the Mongrel collective, in his work ''Uncomfortable Proximity''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tate.org.uk/netart/mongrel/home/default.htm Uncomfortable Proximity]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first on-line project commissioned by Tate) mirrors the Tate's own website, and offers new images and ideas, collaged from his own experiences, his readings of Tate works, and publicity materials that inform his interest in the [[Tate]] website{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

net.artists have actively participated in the debate over the definition of net.art within the context of the art market. net.art promoted the [[modernist]] idea of the work of art as a ''process'', as opposed to a conception of art as object making {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  [[Alexander R. Galloway]], in an e-flux article entitled "Jodi's Infrastructure" argues that Jodi's approach to net.art, which involves the very structures that govern coding,  is uniquely modernist: the form and content converge in the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/|title=Jodi’s Infrastructure - Journal #74 June 2016 - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The presentation of this process within the art world—whether it should be sold in the market, or shown in the institutional art environment, is problematic for digital works {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} created for the [[Internet]]. The web, as marketable as it is, cannot be restricted to the ideological dimensions of the legitimate field of art, the institution of legitimation for art value, that is both ideological and economical {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. ''All for Sale'' by Aliona is an early net.art experiment addressing such issues. The WWWArt Award competition initiated by Alexei Shulgin in 1995 suggests rewarding found Internet works with what he calls an "art feeling."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Some projects, such as Joachim Schmid's ''Archiv'', ''Hybrids'', or ''Copies'' by 0100101110101101.org, are examples of how to store art-related or documentary data on a website. Cloning, plagiarizing, and collective creation are provided as alternative answers, such as in the Refresh Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redsun.cs.msu.su/wwwart/refresh.htm|title=A Multi-Nodal Web-Surf-Create-Session for an Unspecified Number of Players|date=1997-03-14|accessdate=2009-03-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929135932/http://redsun.cs.msu.su/wwwart/refresh.htm|archivedate=2007-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olia Lialina has addressed the issue of digital curating via her web platform Teleportacia.org, an online gallery to promote and sell net.art works. Each piece of net.art has its originality protected by a guarantee constituted by its [[URL]], which acts as a barrier against reproducibility and/or forgery. Lialina claimed that this allowed the buyer of the piece to own it as they wished: controlling the location address as a means of controlling access to the piece.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} This attempt at giving net.art an economic identity and a legitimation within the art world was questioned even within the net.art sphere, though the project was often understood as a [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors3/drfuturetext.html|title=Net Art Market: What Happens Next?|last=Wright|first=Richard|date=1998-08-25|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Teo Spiller]] really sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum in May 1999, calling the whole project of selling the net.art.trade.&lt;ref&gt;Mirapaul, M [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/artsatlarge/13artsatlarge.html "There May Be Money in Internet Art After All"], ''The New York Times, 1999-05-13''&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art).jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]] [[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art) 2.jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]]

Teleportacia.org became an ambiguous experiment on the notion of originality in the age of extreme digital reproduction and [[remix culture]]. The guarantee of originality protected by the URL was quickly challenged by the 0100101110101101.org collective, who, under the pseudonym of [[Luther Blissett]], cloned the content and produced an unauthorized [[mirror]]-site, showing the net.art works in the same context and the same quality as the original. ''The Last Real Net Art Museum'' is another example of Olia Lialina's attempt to deal with the issue.

{{Music education|settings}}
An '''orchestra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔːr|k|ɪ|s|t|r|ə}}; {{IPA-it|orˈkɛstra|lang}}) is a large [[Musical ensemble|instrumental ensemble]] typical of [[classical music]], which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed [[string instrument]]s such as [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]], as well as [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], and [[percussion instrument]]s, each grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes appear in a fifth [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and, for performances of some modern compositions, [[electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]].

A full-size orchestra may sometimes be called a ''symphony orchestra'' or ''philharmonic orchestra''. The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. The term ''chamber orchestra'' (and sometimes ''concert orchestra'') usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles of about fifty musicians or fewer.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Orchestras that specialize in the [[Baroque music]] of, for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], or [[Classical music period|Classical]] repertoire, such as that of [[Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a [[Romantic music]] repertoire,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} such as the [[symphonies]] of [[Johannes Brahms]]. The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of [[Richard Wagner]], and later, [[Gustav Mahler]].

Orchestras are usually led by a [[Conducting|conductor]] who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a [[conductor's baton]]. The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the [[tempo]] and shapes the sound of the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|section=Conducting|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=Michael Kennedy &amp; Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0199203833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.

The leader of the first violin section, commonly called the [[concertmaster]], also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the [[Baroque music]] era (1600–1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the [[basso continuo]] parts on a [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]], a tradition that some 20th century and 21st century [[early music]] ensembles continue. Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] [[overture]]s, [[concerto]]s for solo instruments, and as [[pit orchestra|pit ensembles]] for [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, and some types of [[musical theatre]] (e.g., [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[operetta]]s).

Amateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, [[youth orchestra]]s, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.

The term ''orchestra'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀρχήστρα (''orchestra''), the name for the area in front of a stage in [[ancient Greek theatre]] reserved for the [[Greek chorus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29rxh%2Fstra ὀρχήστρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
[[File:Ancasta-LaViottiChamberOrchestraMozartKV136.ogv|thumb|upright=1.25|Viotti Chamber Orchestra performing the 3rd movement of [[Mozart]]'s ''Divertimento in [[D Major]]'' (K136)]]

The typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related [[musical instrument]]s called the [[woodwind section|woodwinds]], [[brass section|brass]], [[percussion section|percussion]], and [[string section|strings]] ([[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]] and [[double bass]]). Other instruments such as the [[piano]] and [[celesta]] may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a [[keyboard section]] or may stand alone, as may the [[concert harp]] and [[electronic music|electric and electronic]] instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.

In the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period&lt;ref&gt;Jack Westrup, "Instrumentation and Orchestration: 3. 1750 to 1800", New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd ed., edited by Stanley Sadie (New York: Grove, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s influence on the classical model.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kern Holoman, "Instrumentation and Orchestration: 4. 19th Century", in ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed [[electric instrument|electric]] and [[electronic instrument]]s in various combinations.

The terms ''symphony orchestra'' and ''philharmonic orchestra'' may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.

''Chamber orchestra'' usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that. The term ''concert orchestra'' may also be used, as in the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and the [[RTÉ Concert Orchestra]].

===Beethoven's influence===
The so-called "standard complement" of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The [[composer]]'s instrumentation almost always included paired [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[French horn|horns]] and [[trumpet]]s. The exceptions to this are his [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 4]], [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]], and [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 4]], which each specify a single [[flute]]. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular [[timbral]] "palette" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|"Eroica"]] Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of "choral" brass in the Trio movement. [[Piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s add to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth]], also known as the ''Pastoral Symphony''. The [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]] asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the "Eroica" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]—plus [[choir|chorus]] and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Expanded instrumentation===
{{refimprove-section|date=November 2017}}
Apart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, "Instrumentation and Orchestration: 5. Impression and Later Developments", in ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[flugelhorn]] and [[cornet]]. [[Saxophone]]s and [[classical guitar]]s, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]], [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]]. Unless these instruments are played by members "doubling" on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to [[contrabassoon]] for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire [[freelance]] musicians to augment their regular ensemble.

The 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Hopkins and Paul Griffiths, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and [[sound effect]] such as the [[wind machine]]. During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of [[contemporary classical music]], instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add [[electric instrument]]s such as [[electric guitar]], [[electronic instrument]]s such as [[synthesizer]]s, non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestra).

With this history in mind, the orchestra can be analysed in five periods: the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], the [[Classical music period]], early/mid-[[Romantic music]] era, late-Romantic/early [[20th century music]] and [[Contemporary classical music|21st century era]]. The first is a [[Baroque music|Baroque]] orchestra (i.e., [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Vivaldi]]), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the [[basso continuo]] group (e.g., [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]] and assorted bass instruments to perform the [[bassline]]), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early [[Beethoven]] along with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]), which used a smaller group of performers than a [[Romantic music]] orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th century orchestra (e.g., [[Wagner]], [[Brahms]], [[Mahler]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., [[John Adams (composer)|Adams]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]).

==Organization==
[[File:Laredo Philharmonic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Conducting an orchestra]]
Among the instrument groups and within each group of instruments, there is a generally accepted hierarchy. Every instrumental group (or section) has a '''principal''' who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an [[accompaniment]] part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the [[concertmaster]] (or "leader" in the UK) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the [[Conducting|conductor]].  The concertmaster leads the pre-concert [[musical tuning|tuning]] and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.

The principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to 300-year-old convention), no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pom.sagepub.com/content/31/1/53.short |title=An Investigation of Members' Roles in Wind Quintets |journal=Psychology of Music |volume=31 |pages=53–74 |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-04|doi=10.1177/0305735603031001323 |last1=Ford |first1=Luan |last2=Davidson |first2=Jane W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal (or co-principal or associate principal), or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a [[tutti]] part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence.

A section string player plays in [[unison]] with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided (''divisi'') parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to "outside" (nearer the audience) and "inside" seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section). Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.

In modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a [[Conducting|conductor]], although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the [[concertmaster]] or the [[harpsichord]]ist playing the [[Basso Continuo|continuo]]. Some modern orchestras also do [[Conductorless orchestra|without conductors]], particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called "period") performances of [[baroque music|baroque]] and earlier music.

The most frequently performed repertoire for a [[symphony]] orchestra is Western [[European classical music|classical music]] or [[opera]]. However, orchestras are used sometimes in [[popular music]] (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in [[film music]], and increasingly often in [[video game music]]. Orchestras are also used in the [[symphonic metal]] genre. The term "orchestra" can also be applied to a jazz ensemble, for example in the performance of [[big band|big-band]] music.

===Selection and appointment of members===
In the 2000s, all tenured members of a professional orchestra normally [[audition]] for positions in the ensemble.&lt;!--Personal friends of the conductor and pals of principal players are exempted from this rule :)--&gt; Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee's choice, such as a movement of a [[concerto]], a solo [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare). The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[concertmaster]], the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying and possibly other principal players and regular orchestra members.

The most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to [[sight read]] orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.

There are a range of different employment arrangements. The most sought-after positions are permanent, [[tenure]]d positions in the orchestra. Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more. Contract performers may be hired for individual concerts when the orchestra is doing an exceptionally large late-Romantic era orchestral work, or to substitute for a permanent member who is sick. A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a "sub". Some contract musicians may be hired to replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member is on [[parental leave]] or [[disability]] leave.

====Sex of ensembles====
Historically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of male musicians. The first [[women in music|female members hired in professional orchestras]] have been [[harp]]ists. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (the other orchestras ranked among the world’s top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008).&lt;ref name="The world’s greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra’s press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] would be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=1996-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[International Alliance for Women in Music]]. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony”], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova, became one of the orchestra’s [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria&amp;navi=CULTURE Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028131919/http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria%26navi%3DCULTURE |date=2013-10-28 }}, [[France 24]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women made up 6% of the orchestra's membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;James R. Oestrich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists", the [[double bass]], brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|‘blind’ auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture – Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur ensembles==
There are also a variety of amateur orchestras:
* School orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from an elementary or secondary school. They may be students from a music class or program or they may be drawn from the entire school body. School orchestras are typically led by a [[music teacher]].
* University or conservatory orchestras: These orchestras consist of students from a university or music conservatory. In some cases, university orchestras are open to all students from a university, from all programs. Larger universities may have two or more university orchestras: one or more orchestras made up of music majors (or, for major music programs, several tiers of music major orchestras, ranked by skill level) and a second orchestra open to university students from all academic programs (e.g., science, business, etc.) who have previous classical music experience on an orchestral instrument. University and conservatory orchestras are led by a conductor who is typically a [[professor]] or instructor at the university or conservatory.
* [[Youth orchestra]]s: These orchestras consist of teens and young adults drawn from an entire city or region. The age range in youth orchestras varies between different ensembles. In some cases, youth orchestras may consist of teens or young adults from an entire country (e.g., Canada's National Youth Orchestra).
* Community orchestras: These orchestras consist of amateur performers drawn from an entire city or region. Community orchestras typically consist mainly of adult amateur musicians. Community orchestras range in level from beginner-level orchestras which rehearse music without doing formal performances in front of an audience to intermediate-level ensembles to advanced amateur groups which play standard professional orchestra repertoire. In some cases, university or conservatory music students may also be members of community orchestras. While community orchestra members are mostly unpaid amateurs, in some orchestras, a small number of professionals may be hired to act as principal players and section leaders.

==Repertoire and performances==
Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire ranging from 17th-century [[Baroque music#Dance suite|dance suites]], 18th century [[divertimento]]s to 20th century [[film score]]s and 21st-century symphonies. Orchestras have become synonymous with the [[symphony]], an extended [[musical composition]] in Western [[classical music]] that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos. Symphonies are notated in a [[Full score|musical score]], which contains all the instrument parts. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, while leading the ensemble. Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]).

Orchestras also perform [[overture]]s, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera.&lt;ref name="Blom 1954"&gt;Blom 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early Romantic era, composers such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the [[symphonic poem]], a form devised by [[Franz Liszt]] in several works that began as dramatic overtures. These were "at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme".&lt;ref name="Blom 1954"/&gt; In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem.

Orchestras also play with instrumental soloists in [[concerto]]s. During concertos, the orchestra plays an [[accompaniment]] role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing. Orchestras also play during [[opera]]s, [[ballet]]s, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works). In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.

===Performances===

In the Baroque era, orchestras performed in a range of venues, including at the fine houses of aristocrats, in opera halls and in churches. Some wealthy aristocrats had an orchestra in residence at their estate, to entertain them and their guests with performances. During the Classical era, as composers increasing sought out financial support from the general public, orchestra concerts were increasingly held in public concert halls, where music lovers could buy tickets to hear the orchestra. Of course, aristocratic patronage of orchestras continued during the Classical era, but this went on alongside public concerts. In the 20th and 21st century, orchestras found a new patron: governments. Many orchestras in North America and Europe receive part of their funding from national, regional level governments (e.g., state governments in the U.S.) or city governments. These government subsidies make up part of orchestra revenue, along with ticket sales, charitable donations (if the orchestra is a registered as a charity) and other fundraising activities. With the invention of successive technologies, including [[sound recording]], [[radio broadcasting]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[Internet]]-based [[Streaming video|streaming]] and downloading of concert videos, orchestras have been able to find new revenue sources.

===Issues in performance===
====Faking====
{{Main|Faking (Western classical music)}}
One of the "great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing" is "faking", the process by which an orchestral musician gives the "...impression of playing every note as written", typically for a very challenging passage that is very high or very fast, while not actually playing the notes that are in the printed music part.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"&gt;McVeigh, Alice. "Faking it – the great unmentionable of orchestral playing" in ''The Strad'', June 2006. http://www.thestrad.com/faking-it-the-great-unmentionable-of-orchestral-playing/&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''[[The Strad]]'' states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally "fake" certain passages.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt; One reason that musicians "fake" is because there are not enough rehearsals.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt; Another factor is the extreme challenges in 20th century and 21st century contemporary pieces; professionals interviewed by the magazine said "faking" was "...necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt; Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking may be acceptable when a part is not written well for the instrument, but faking "just because you haven’t practised" the music is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="thestrad.com"/&gt;

==History==

===Instrumental technology===
[[File:Philadelphia Orchestra at American premiere of Mahler's 8th Symphony (1916).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Leopold Stokowski|Stokowski]] and the Philadelphia Orchestra at the March 2, 1916 American premiere of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony of a Thousand|8th Symphony]].]]
The invention of the piston and rotary valve by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]], both [[Silesians]], in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by [[Theobald Boehm]] and the innovations of [[Adolphe Sax]] in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the [[saxophone]]. These advances would lead [[Hector Berlioz]] to write a landmark book on [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.&lt;ref&gt;Hector Berlioz. ''Traite d'instrumentation et d'orchestration'' (Paris: Lemoine, 1843).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner's influence===

The next major expansion of symphonic practice came from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagner's works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' calls for six [[harp]]s. Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work ''On Conducting''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wagner. ''On Conducting (Ueber das Dirigiren), a treatise on style in the execution of classical music'' (London: W. Reeves, 1887).&lt;/ref&gt; This brought about a revolution in orchestral [[Musical composition|composition]], and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagner's theories re-examined the importance of [[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra. Conductors who studied his methods would go on to be influential themselves.{{Vague|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--Surely not every conductor who studied these methods became influential.--&gt;

===20th&amp;nbsp;century orchestra===
As the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The influence of [[Gustav Mahler]] was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;8]], Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be "fixed" by audio editing or [[overdubbing]]. Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply "getting through" the music as best as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.&lt;ref&gt;See Lance W. Brunner. (1986). "The Orchestra and Recorded Sound", pp.&amp;nbsp;479–532 in Joan Peyser Ed. ''The Orchestra: Origins and Transformations'', New York: Scribner's Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-revolution===
With the advent of the early music movement, smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common. These include the [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]], the [[London Classical Players]] under the direction of Sir [[Roger Norrington]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] under [[Christopher Hogwood]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Recent trends in the United States===
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras. The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution. Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events. Orchestral endowments and—more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras—orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling. Also, while government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles. Finally, the drastic falling-off of revenues from recording, tied to no small extent to changes in the recording industry itself, began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion.

U.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] (in April 2011), and the [[Louisville Orchestra]], in December 2010; orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the [[Northwest Chamber Orchestra]] in 2006, the [[Honolulu Orchestra]] in March 2011, the [[New Mexico Symphony Orchestra]] in April 2011, and the [[Syracuse Symphony]] in June 2011. The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida ceased operations at the end of March, 2011.

One source of financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors of US orchestras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/arts/music/ronald-wilford-manager-of-legendary-maestros-dies-at-87.html | title=Ronald Wilford, Manager of Legendary Maestros, Dies at 87 | work=The New York Times | author=Michael Cooper | date=2015-06-13 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led several high-profile conductors to take pay cuts in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/03/cleveland_orchestra_plans_deep.html | title=Cleveland Orchestra plans 'deep' cuts; Welser-Most takes pay cut | work=Cleveland Plain Dealer | author=Zachary Lewis | date=2009-03-24 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/21/entertainment/la-ca-leonard-slatkin-20110821 | title=He conducts himself well through crises | work=Los Angeles Times | author=Donna Perlmutter | date=2011-08-21 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/april-25-osmo-vnsk-hires-on-to-rebuild-orchestra/256589871/ | title=Osmo Vänskä hires on to rebuild Minnesota Orchestra | work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune | author=Graydon Royce | date=2014-05-09 | accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Music administrators such as [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra. The American critic [[Greg Sandow]] has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music, performance, the concert experience, marketing, public relations, community involvement, and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st-century audiences immersed in popular culture.

It is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments, including various synthesizers, to achieve desired effects. Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth. Composers like [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] often employ Romantic-size orchestras, as in Adams' opera ''[[Nixon in China (opera)|Nixon in China]]''; [[Philip Glass]] and others may be more free, yet still identify size-boundaries. Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the ''[[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Glass)|Concerto for Cello and Orchestra]]'' and the [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Glass)|Violin Concerto No. 2]].

Along with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances. The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the [[string section]], since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).

==Role of conductor==
{{Main|Conducting}}
[[File:Taipei.apo-hsu.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|[[Apo Hsu]], using a [[baton (conducting)|baton]], conducts the [[National Taiwan Normal University|NTNU Symphony Orchestra]] in Taipei, Taiwan]]

Conducting is the art of directing a [[music]]al performance, such as an orchestral or [[Choir|choral]] [[concert]]. The primary duties of the conductor are to set the [[tempo]], ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to "shape" the phrasing where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote="Conducting"|title=Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music|authors=[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] and Joyce Bourne Kennedy|edition=Fifth|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford|date=2007|isbn=978-0199203833}}&lt;/ref&gt; To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers.&lt;ref name=CambComp3&gt;Holden, Raymond: "The technique of conducting", p. 3 in ''The Cambridge Companion to Conducting" ed. José Antonio Bowen&lt;/ref&gt; A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.&lt;ref name=CambComp3/&gt;

The conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the [[full score]], which contains the [[musical notation]] for all the instruments and voices. Since the mid-18th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with musical theatre [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a "count in"). However, in [[rehearsal]]s, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.

Conductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |title=About.com: The Conductor |accessdate=2016-08-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415012250/http://musiced.about.com/od/musiccareer1/p/theconductor.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, [[choir]]s, [[concert band]]s and other sizable [[musical ensemble]]s such as [[big band]]s are usually led by conductors.

===Conductorless orchestras===
{{Main article|Conductorless orchestra}}
In the [[Baroque music]] era (1600–1750), most orchestras were led by one of the musicians, typically the principal first violin, called the [[concertmaster]]. The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner. Leadership might also be provided by one of the chord-playing instrumentalists playing the [[basso continuo]] part which was the core of most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces. Typically, this would be a [[harpsichord]] player, a [[pipe organ]]ist or a [[lute]]ist or [[theorbo]] player. A keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his or her head, or by taking one of the hands off the keyboard to lead a more difficult tempo change. A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a [[ritard]] during a cadence or ending. In some works which combined [[choir]]s and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: a concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers. During the [[Classical music period]] (ca. 1720–1800), the practice of using chordal instruments to play basso continuo was gradually phased out, and it disappeared completely by 1800. Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra's tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.

In 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-[[revolution]]ary [[Soviet Union]]. The symphony orchestra [[Persimfans]] was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal [[Marxism|Marxist]] state, in which all people are equal. As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a [[committee]], which determined tempos and playing styles. Although it was a partial success within the Soviet Union, the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing [[tempo]] during performances, because even if the committee had issued a decree about where a tempo change should take place, there was no leader in the ensemble to guide this tempo change. The orchestra survived for ten years before [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] cultural politics disbanded it by taking away its funding.&lt;ref&gt;John Eckhard, "Orchester ohne Dirigent", ''Neue Zeitschrift für Musik'' 158, no. 2 (1997): 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western nations, some ensembles, such as the [[Orpheus Chamber Orchestra]], based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster). Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player, usually a violinist, being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts. Examples include the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]], Amsterdam Sinfonietta &amp; Candida Thompson and the [[New Century Chamber Orchestra]]. As well, as part of the [[early music]] movement, some 20th and 21st century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing [[basso continuo]] performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.

===Multiple conductors===
====Offstage instruments====
Some orchestral works specify that an [[offstage trumpet]] should be used or that other instruments from the orchestra should be positioned off-stage or behind the stage, to create a haunted, mystical effect. To ensure that the offstage instrumentalist(s) play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor. Examples include the ending of "[[Neptune]]" from [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor's tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians). One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor's gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a [[video camera]] pointed at the principal conductor and a [[closed-circuit TV]] set in front of the offstage performer(s), instead of using two conductors.

====Contemporary music====
The techniques of [[polystylism]] and polytempo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |title=Polytempo Music Articles |publisher=Greschak.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020820130701/http://www.greschak.com/polytempo/ |archivedate=2002-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; music have led a few 20th and 21st century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously.  These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians.  Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In [[Percy Grainger]]'s "[[The Warriors (Grainger)|The Warriors]]" which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a secondary conductor directing an off-stage [[brass ensemble]], and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late century orchestral music is [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s [[Gruppen (Stockhausen)|''Gruppen'']], for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the "sound masses" could be spacialized, as in an [[electroacoustic work]]. ''Gruppen'' was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, [[Bruno Maderna]] and [[Pierre Boulez]]. It has been{{When|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--Wasn't this almost twenty years ago?--&gt; performed by [[Simon Rattle]], John Carewe and [[Daniel Harding]].

'''Painting in Space''' ("Les Peintures dans l`espace" in French) is an [[art movement]] that was invented by [[Yervand Kochar]] in the 1930s in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armenianweekly.com/2010/11/14/komitas-and-kochar-the-music-and-image-of-undefeated-spirit/|title=Komitas and Kochar: The Music and Image of Undefeated Spirit|date=2010-11-14|work=The Armenian Weekly|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement syntheses all the possibilities of painting, graphic and sculpture. 

== About ==
Painting in Space consists of different metal panels with various paintings. With the help of an engine situated in the base of the figure it is being viewed in slow motion. This way [[Yervand Kochar]] shows how in time separate space elements become one, breaking the boundaries of time and space. It is not a sculpture, but painting in motion. Kochar proposes to expand the possibilities of visual thinking, introducing motion into frozen forms, blending painting with the plasticity of three-dimensional geometric forms.

One work of the Painting in Space works, aptly named ''Les Peintures dans l`espace'', (1934) by [[Yervand Kochar]], is being exhibited and in the permanent collection at [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]] since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cej9p9e/rgkBe7|title=Collection: Peinture dans l'espace|last=|first=|date=|work=Le Centre Pompidou|access-date=2017-03-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Punk visual art''' is artwork associated with the [[punk subculture]]. It often graces [[punk rock]] [[album cover]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] for punk concerts, [[punk zine]]s and punk websites. It is also sometimes showcased in art galleries and exhibition spaces.

The main aesthetic of punk visual art seems to be to either shock, create a sense of empathy or revulsion, make a grand point with an acidic or sarcastic wit. One characteristic associated with punk art is the usage of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines, a device previously associated with kidnap and ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the [[Sex Pistols]]' ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]]'' album designed by [[Jamie Reid]]. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage.

Los Angeles artist [[Mark Vallen]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Punk had a unique and complex aesthetic. It was steeped in shock value and revered what was considered ugly. The whole look of punk was designed to disturb and disrupt the happy complacency of the wider society. Outside of punk's torn and safety pinned anti-fashion statements, this impulse to outrage was never more apparent than on punk album covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-for-a-change.com/Punk/punka.htm "A visual survey of early Punk Rock Album Covers," Essay by artist, Mark Vallen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In New York City in the mid-1970s, there was much overlap between the punk music and art scenes. In 1978, many of the visual artists who were regulars at [[CBGB]] and other punk-related music venues participated in a large punk art exhibition in Washington, DC.  Among those featured were [[John Holmstrom]] and [[Legs McNeil]] of the fanzine ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'',; [[Alan Vega]] (a.k.a. Alan Suicide), whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]];  photographers [[Marcia Resnick]] and [[Jimmy De Sana]]; tattoo artist Ruth Marten; filmmaker Amos Poe; and artists [[Tom Otterness]] and [[Beth and Scott B]], who were associated with ''X Magazine''.

Also in 1978 in New York City, a related, one-night punk art show featuring films, performances and slide shows included works by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Diego Cortez]].  Other early punk art exhibits included the "Times Square Show" (1980) and "New York New Wave" at PS 1 (1981).  Punk art found an ongoing home on the New York's lower east side with the establishment of [[ABC No Rio]] Gallery in 1980. The punk aesthetic was a dominant strand from 1982 to 1986 in the art galleries of the city's East Village.

The '''Robert Henri Museum''' is located in [[Cozad, Nebraska]] in a building that was once the home of [[Robert Henri]] (previously Robert Henry Cozad), a prominent figure of the [[Ashcan School|Ashcan School]] of art and one of “The Eight”. The Robert Henri Museum houses works by Robert Henri, including sketches, drawings, and paintings by the artist.

The museum is designated a non-profit educational 501(c)(3) organization and located at 218 East 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Street in Cozad, Nebraska.&amp;nbsp; It also houses items related to the history of Cozad, founded by Robert Henri's father John Jackson Cozad. This includes furnishings and other items owned by the Cozad family.&amp;nbsp; The museum lists its mission as “[T]o preserve the boyhood home of Robert Henri (Robert Henry Cozad) for public education and enjoyment, as well as to increase the general understanding of the appreciation of the arts.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://roberthenrimuseum.org/about-robert-henri/ |title=About Robert Henri - Robert Henri Museum |access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was founded by a coalition of women of Cozad who saw an opportunity to honor both the history of the area and one of its more prominent former citizens.&amp;nbsp; The coalition purchased the home, then known as the Hendee Hotel. The group was led by Shirley Paulsen. Also included in the purchase was an adjacent historical walkway and original Pony Express Station, an historical church, and schoolhouse.&amp;nbsp; The purchase was made with both local support and donations from the family of Robert Henri and the Cozad family.&amp;nbsp; At that time, additional repairs and improvements were made to the building. Museum quality climate control and security was added in 2014, to safely maintain the art collection.&lt;ref name=Four&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://lexch.com/news/henri-museum-welcomes-four-paintings-home/article_b7ca41cc-2689-11e6-a29c-1f7c4412aed8.html |title=Henri Museum welcomes four paintings home |first=Kevin|last=Zelaya|work=Lexington Clipper-Herald |access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing art collection contains art by Robert Henri including “Mariana of Austria, Queen of Spain.” It was donated by Janet LeClair in 1988. &amp;nbsp;Currently, the gallery displays more than 33 drawings, seven paintings, and assorted other items belonging to the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://lexch.com/news/robert-henri-museum-acquires-new-original-henri-painting/article_7aac2b16-1bd9-11e7-9af2-b305f0a50b6d.html |title=Robert Henri Museum acquires new original Henri painting |first=Kevin|last=Zelaya|work=Lexington Clipper-Herald |access-date=2018-10-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 addition to the collection was “Normandie Interior”, which was completed in 1897.&amp;nbsp; The painting was part of Henri’s first solo exhibition and bought by Frank Southern, the artist’s brother, and kept in the family for the next 120 years.&lt;ref name=Four/&gt;

== History ==
The original house was built by John Jackson Cozad, the father of Robert Henri and the founder of the city of Cozad, Nebraska.  The house was occupied by the Cozad family between 1873 and 1883.  It has what some have called a checkered history, because in 1883, John Cozad shot a local rancher named Alfred Pearson.  This dispute is said to have originated when Mr. Pearson’s cattle herd strayed onto John J. Cozard’s fields, ruining the crops. John J. Cozad attempted to bring the matter before the courts and was awaiting a court date to resolve the incident. However, the dispute erupted into violence when the two encountered one another at Julia Gatewood’s general store, a local gathering place for card players where Mr. Cozad was known to frequent to play faro, a card game of the period.  The two became involved in a shouting match, with Mr. Cozad insisting that Mr. Pearson not speak that way in front of Mr. Gatewood.  Mr. Pearson attempted to leave and continue the dispute, but insults were exchanged and a fist fight occurred.  Mr. Cozad took the matter a bit further and pulled a gun and shot Mr. Person, who died a month later.  

John Cozad returned home and fled to Denver that night, and his wife and sons were left to sell the home and reunite in Denver.  His parents took the names Richard and Tessa Lee, and his brother the name Frank Southern to escape the notoriety of the resulting murder charge.  Robert Henry Cozad, remained in Denver for a time, but eventually went on the New York to study art.  After a trip to Paris, he took the name Robert Henri.  The story is recounted in “Son of a Gambling Man” by [[Mari Sandoz]].

Another infamous artist also lived in the home.  This was also the home of Miles Maryott, a near contemporary of Henri’s, described by the Omaha World Herald as “a well-known hunting guide, outdoorsman and landscape painter — there was talk he would become the first-ever Nebraska state naturalist — before he pulled a gun on his best friend and changed his own life.”  His fame thereafter was as a jailhouse artist of some talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.omaha.com/living/the-better-half/art-made-them-famous-murder-shaped-their-lives-a-hotel/article_78c604a3-b304-50a4-b4fb-10d1c17bbcc2.html |title=Art made them famous.

== The Cozad Family ==
John Jackson Cozad, the original owner of the house and the father of Robert Henri, was born in 1830. When his mother died and his father remarried, he found living in the family home difficult and left it at the age of 12.&amp;nbsp; While working on steamboats for the next few years, he learned a card game popular that the time called faro.&amp;nbsp; He eventually joined the ranks of professional gamblers working the Mississippi and Ohio riverboats and other gambling establishments.&amp;nbsp; 

He met and married Theresa Gatewood.&amp;nbsp; She was a daughter of a hotel owner from Malden, Virginia.&amp;nbsp; Once they married, they settled in Cincinnati where they had six children, only two of which survived into adulthood. While working his way around the gambling circuit in 1872, John Cozad won $50,000, a huge sum at the time.&amp;nbsp; 

John J. had the dream of founding a town that would carry his name.&amp;nbsp; First founding the town of [[Cozaddale, Ohio]] in 1871, and then the town of Cozad, Nebraska in 1872.&amp;nbsp; He placed advertising in several eastern newspapers encouraging people to move to this new town.&amp;nbsp; When people accepted his offer and moved west, he often found ways to employ them when the town hit hard times. Two such projects were a bridge building company and a haying operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Son of a Gambling Man:  The Youth of an Artist |last=Sandoz |first=Mari |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-8032-5833-4 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artist in Residence Program ==
The museum sponsors an artist-in-residence program. As of June of 2016, the artist-in-residence was Fred Cowie.  Dr. Cowie, a self-trained artist, received a doctorate in history.  He counts among his influences the art of Paul Cezanne, Rembrandt van Rijn and Claude Monet.  Both a painter and a jewelry artist, he practices his art on a daily basis by creating small paintings.&lt;ref name=Four/&gt;

[[File:Rupert D'Oyly Carte.jpg|right|upright=1|thumb|Rupert D'Oyly Carte]]
'''Rupert D'Oyly Carte''' (3 November 1876 – 12 September 1948) was an English hotelier, theatre owner and [[impresario]], best known as proprietor of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and [[Savoy Hotel]] from 1913 to 1948.

Son of the impresario and hotelier [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], Rupert inherited the family businesses from his stepmother [[Helen Carte|Helen]].  After serving in [[World War I]], he took steps to revitalise the opera company, which had not appeared in Central London since 1909, hiring new designers and conductors to present fresh productions of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas in seasons in the [[West End theatre|West End]].  The new productions generally retained the original text and music of the operas.  Carte launched international and provincial tours, as well as the London seasons, and he released the first complete recordings of the operas.  He also rebuilt the half-century-old [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1929, opening the house with a season of Gilbert and Sullivan.

As an hotelier, Carte built on his father's legacy, expanding the [[Savoy Hotel]], refreshing the other hotels and restaurants in the Savoy group, including [[Claridges|Claridge's]] and the [[The Berkeley|Berkeley Hotel]], and introducing cabaret and dance bands that became internationally famous.  He also increased marketing activities, including foreign marketing, of the hotels.

[[P. G. Wodehouse]] based a character in his novels, [[Psmith]], on a [[Winchester College|Wykehamist]] schoolboy whom he identified as Rupert D'Oyly Carte.  At his death, Carte passed the opera company and hotels to his only surviving child, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].  The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.

==Life and career==
[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rupert's father, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]]]

===Early life===
Rupert D'Oyly Carte was born in [[Hampstead]], London, the younger son of the impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] and his first wife Blanche (née Prowse), who died in 1885.  Like his brother, Lucas (1872–1907), he was given his father's middle name.  He was educated at [[Winchester College]], noted as among the most intellectually rigorous of English public schools.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Financial Times'', 16 August 2008, p. 1; and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 31 May 2009, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then worked for a firm of accountants before joining his father as an assistant in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html "The D'Oyly Carte Family"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220163843/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html |date=20 February 2005 }} page, at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'' states that Rupert attended [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], but if he did so, he did not graduate, if the above dates, taken from ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'', are correct.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newspaper interview given in the year of his death, Rupert recalled that as a young man he was entrusted, during his father's illness, with helping [[W. S. Gilbert]] with the first revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', 7 January 1948.  The newspaper report states that this was when he was 22, but the first revival of ''Yeomen'' was in May 1897, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte was only 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a director of the [[Savoy Hotel]] Limited in 1898, joining his father and [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]], who had served on the board since the Savoy Hotel was built.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 11 May 1949, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1899 he was assistant managing director.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 7 June 1899, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and Rupert's stepmother, the former [[Helen Lenoir]], who had married Richard in 1888, assumed full control of most of the family businesses, which she had increasingly controlled during her husband's decline.  Rupert's elder brother, Lucas, a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis, aged 34.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas was educated at [[Winchester College]] and then [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], and was called to the bar in 1897.  He was appointed Private Secretary to [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]] in 1899 and died of tuberculosis on 18 January 1907.  See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking over the family businesses===
In 1903, at the age of 27, Rupert took over his late father's role as chairman of the Savoy group, which included the Savoy Hotel, [[Claridges|Claridge's]], [[The Berkeley|The Berkeley Hotel]], [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]] and the Grand Hotel in Rome.  At this time, the whole group was officially valued at £2,221,708.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;''The Times'', 21 February 1903, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He immediately issued £300,000 of [[debenture]]s to raise capital for a large extension to the Savoy (the "East Block").&lt;ref name=tt/&gt;  Like his father, Carte was willing to go to great lengths to secure the best employees for his hotels.  When Claridge's needed a new chef in 1904, he secured the services of François Bonnaure, formerly chef at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris.  The press speculated on how much Carte must have paid to persuade Bonnaure to join him, and compared the younger Carte's audacity with his father's coup in securing Paris's most famous ''maître d'hôtel'', M. Joseph, a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 June 1904, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rupert carte 1919.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Carte in 1919]]
Between 1906 and 1909, Helen Carte,&lt;ref&gt;Helen had remarried [[Stanley Boulter]], but was generally still known as "Carte" in business.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert's stepmother, staged two repertory seasons at the [[Savoy Theatre]].  Directed by Gilbert and received with much success, they revitalised the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], which had been in decline after Richard D'Oyly Carte's death.&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, ''A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan'', Vista Books, London, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912, when theatre censorship was under discussion in Britain, Carte was strongly in favour of retaining censorship, because it gave managements complete certainty about what they could or could not stage without fear of interference by the police or others.  He joined with other London theatre managers, including [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[George Edwardes]] and [[Arthur Bourchier]] in signing a petition for the retention of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 April 1912, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, together with [[Herbert Sullivan]] and theatre managers including Beerbohm Tree and [[Squire Bancroft]], Carte was an instigator of a memorial to [[W. S. Gilbert]] at Charing Cross.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 June 1912, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913, Rupert's stepmother Helen Carte died.  She left all her holdings in the Savoy Hotel group, the Savoy Theatre and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to her stepson.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 May 1913, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalising the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company===
After London seasons in 1906–07 and 1908–09, the opera company did not perform in the [[West End theatre|West End]] again until 1919, although it continued to tour in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The company toured for ten months per year.  Its outer London engagements in these years were in [[Camden Town]], [[Clapham]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Deptford]], [[Fulham]], [[Hammersmith]], [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], [[Kennington]], New Cross, [[Notting Hill]], [[Peckham]], Richmond, Stratford, Wimbledon and [[Woolwich]].  See Rollins and Witts.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, "Through the years of the [[Great War]] they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere.  They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory."&lt;ref&gt;Walbrook, H. M. [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/books/walbrook/chap16.html Chapter 16,] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera, A History and a Comment'', (1920) London: F. V. White &amp; Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, "I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London.  I thought the dresses looked dowdy....  I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a décor attractive to the new generation."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 430; Reprinted in [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html "Rupert D'Oyly Carte's Season ... 1919-20"], at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 1922 memoir, [[Henry Lytton]], having admired Richard D'Oyly Carte's keen eye for stagecraft, added, "That 'eye' for stagecraft ... has been inherited in a quite remarkable degree by his son, Mr. Rupert D'Oyly Carte.  He, too, has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a glance, and knowing instinctively just what must be corrected".&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html Chapter 4,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175513/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html |date=6 July 2008 }} ''Secrets of a Savoyard'' (1922), online at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1911, the company hired [[J. M. Gordon]] as stage manager, and Carte later promoted him to director.  Gordon, under Carte's supervision, preserved the company's traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonJM.htm J. M. Gordon] at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1919-20season.jpg|thumb|300px|Souvenir programme cover – 1919-20 season]]
During [[World War I]] Carte served in the [[Royal Navy]],&lt;ref name=centenary&gt;Bettany, Clemence.  ''The D'Oyly Carte Centenary Book'', a souvenir book published by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company during its 1975 centenary season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;/ref&gt; and no renovation work could be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;During the war, Carte served as a [[King's Messenger]].  See Duffey, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/carte.html "The D'Oyly Carte Family",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220163843/http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/html/carte.html |date=20 February 2005 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 20 September 2003, accessed 12 November 2009.  Baily states that, during the war, "Carte was on special duties in the Navy: he would be sent off on secret journeys to distant parts of the world, and he would mysteriously reappear in London for a few weeks, and when he did so he would put in a few touches to the preparatory work for the rebirth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company."  Baily, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;  On his return, he put his aims into effect.  In an interview in ''[[The Observer]]'' in August 1919 he set out his policy for staging the operas: "They will be played precisely in their original form, without any alteration to the words, or any attempt to bring them up to date."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 24 August 1919, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This uncompromising declaration was modified in a later interview in which he said, "the plays are all being restaged ... Gilbert's words will be unaltered, though there will be some freshness in the method of rendering them.  Artists must have scope for their individuality, and new singers cannot be tied down to imitate slavishly those who made successes in the old days."&lt;ref name=centenary/&gt;

Carte's first London season, at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's Theatre]], 1919–20, featured ten of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref&gt;Carte's first London season did not include ''[[Ruddigore]]'', ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' and ''[[The Grand Duke]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which had its first London performances since the original production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1919/index.html Information about the 1919-20 season] at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 January 2009.  In a last-night speech at the end of the 1924 London season, Carte said that he hoped to revive ''Utopia, Limited'' in 1925.  See ''The Times'' 28 July 1924, p. 10.  The opera was not, however, revived until 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction.  As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the [[J. C. Williamson]] company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy "tradition" was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: "It did not by any means imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression.  All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation....  Many people seemed to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case.  He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times,'' 10 April 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had told the press that the original words and music would not be altered, Carte was willing to make changes in certain cases.  In 1919–20, he authorised significant cuts and alterations in both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore''. In 1921 ''[[Cox and Box]]'' was produced in a drastically cut-down version, to allow it to be played as a companion piece with the shorter [[Savoy operas]]. He also authorised changes to Gilbert's text: he wrote to ''The Times'' in 1948, "We found recently in America that much objection was taken by coloured persons to a word used twice in ''The Mikado''."  The word in question was Gilbert's reference to "nigger" (blackface) minstrels, and Carte asked [[A. P. Herbert]] to suggest an acceptable revision.  "He made several alternative suggestions, one of which we adopted in America, and it seems well to go on doing so in the British Empire."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 28 May 1945, p. 8. A similar reference in ''Princess Ida'' was also altered.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:D'oyly-carte-the-joy-of-three-generations-1921.jpg|thumb|left|1921 cartoon: D'Oyly Carte audiences]]
Carte commissioned new costumes and scenery throughout his tenure with the company.  For his restagings, Carte hired [[Charles Ricketts]] to redesign ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', the costumes for the latter, created in 1926, being retained by all the company's subsequent designers. Other redesigns were by [[Percy Anderson]], [[George Sheringham]], [[Hugo Rumbold]] and [[Peter Goffin]], a protégé of Carte's daughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].

For London seasons, Carte often engaged guest conductors, first [[Geoffrey Toye]], then [[Malcolm Sargent]], who examined Sullivan's manuscript scores and purged the orchestral parts of accretions.  So striking was the orchestral sound produced by Sargent that the press thought he had retouched the scores, and Carte had the pleasant duty of correcting their error.  In a letter to ''The Times'', he noted that "the details of the orchestration sounded so fresh that some of the critics thought them actually new ... the opera was played last night exactly as written by Sullivan."&lt;ref&gt;Carte, Rupert D'Oyly, ''The Times'', 22 September 1926, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also hired [[Harry Norris (conductor)|Harry Norris]], who started with the touring company, then was Toye's assistant before becoming musical director.  [[Isidore Godfrey]] joined the company as assistant musical director in 1925 and became musical director in 1929, remaining in that post until 1968.

The possibilities of the [[Gramaphone record|gramophone]] appealed to Carte.  After World War I, he supervised a series of complete recordings of the scores of the operas on the [[HMV]] label, beginning with ''The Mikado'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan songs had been made as early as the 1890s (Joseph, p. 220), and there were several complete or nearly-complete operas recorded in the early years of the twentieth century, not under D'Oyly Carte auspices.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first nine sets, made between 1918 and 1925, were recorded by the early [[Gramophone record#Acoustic recording|acoustic process]]. At first, guest singers were chosen who were known for their ability to record well on this technology.  Later in this series, more of the regular members of the company were featured.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc.

[http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/narrelec-cmpl.htm "The D'Oyly Carte Complete Electrical Sets",] ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 18 November 2001, accessed 21 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the electrical series, Carte's own singers were mostly used.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. XI–XII.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte also recognised the potential of radio and worked with the [[BBC]] to relay live broadcasts of D'Oyly Carte productions.  A 1926 relay of part of a Savoy Theatre performance of ''The Mikado'' was heard by up to eight million people.  The ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' noted that this was "probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Carte, the company continued to make broadcasts during the interwar years.  In 1932, ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' became the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be broadcast in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Chris.

===Rebuilding the Savoy Theatre and later years===
In 1929 Carte had the 48-year-old Savoy Theatre rebuilt and modernised.  It closed on 3 June 1929 and was gutted and completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with décor by [[Basil Ionides]].  The old house had three tiers; the new one had two.  The seating capacity (which had decreased to 986 from its original 1,292) was restored nearly completely, to 1,200.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 October 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre reopened 135 days later on 21 October 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Savoy Theatre programme note, September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Gondoliers]],'' designed by Ricketts and conducted by Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/carte/1929/index.html Information about the 1929-20 season and the new designs,] ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Ernest Newman]] wrote, "I can imagine no gayer or more exhilarating frame for the Gilbert and Sullivan operas than the Savoy as it is now."&lt;ref&gt;''quoted'' in Baily, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its historical connection with Gilbert and Sullivan, most of Carte's London seasons were staged not at the Savoy but at two larger houses: the Prince's (now the [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Shaftesbury]]) Theatre (1919–20, 1921–22, 1924, 1926, 1942 and [[Sadler's Wells]] (1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1947 and 1948).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 136–72&lt;/ref&gt;   His three Savoy Theatre seasons were in 1929–30, 1932–33, and 1941.  In addition to year-round UK tours, Carte mounted tours of North America in 1927, 1928–29, 1934–35, 1936–37, 1939 and 1947–48).&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 153–72&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1936 tour an American critic wrote, "If there were only some way of keeping them on this side permanently. I humbly suggest to the [[New Deal]] that it cancel England's war debt in exchange for the D'Oyly Cartians. We should be much the gainer."&lt;ref&gt;''The Philadelphia Public Ledger'', ''quoted'' in Baily, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was deeply affected by the death of his son Michael in 1932, discussed below.  The actor [[Martyn Green]] said, "The heart dropped right out of him.  His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 219, ''quoting'' [[Martyn Green]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing [[Henry Lytton]].&lt;ref name=Wilson128&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of ''The Mikado'' produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures,&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mikfilm.htm "The Technicolor ''Mikado'' Film (1939)",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616150713/http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/mikfilm.htm |date=16 June 2006 }} ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'' (2001), accessed 20 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but his only new stage production after 1932 was of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' designed in 1939 by [[Peter Goffin]]. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, "I don't care what they say about the production. I should care if they said nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of [[World War II]], the British government ordered the immediate and indefinite closure of all theatres.  Carte cancelled the autumn tour and disbanded the company.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;  Theatres were permitted to reopen from 9 September,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 September 1939, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; but it took some weeks to re-form the company.  The company resumed touring in [[Edinburgh]] on Christmas Day 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  It continued to perform throughout the war, but German bombing destroyed the sets and costumes for five of its productions: ''Cox and Box'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[Princess Ida]]'' and ''Ruddigore''.  The old productions of ''Pinafore'' and ''Cox and Box'' were recreated shortly after the war, but the other two operas took longer to rejoin the company's repertory.&lt;ref&gt;''Pinafore'' re-entered the repertory in July 1947, ''Cox and Box'' in the 1947–48 season, ''Ruddigore'' in November 1948, and ''Princess Ida'' in September 1954 (see Rollins and Witts, pp. 171-79 and VII-VIII).  ''The Sorcerer'' was not revived until April 1971 (see ''The Times'', 2 April 1971, p. 10).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, for the first wartime season, Peter Goffin designed and directed a new production of ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' first seen in January 1940, and his new ''Ruddigore'' debuted in 1948, shortly after Carte's death.  A return of the Company to the U.S. in 1947 was very successful.&lt;ref name=Wilson128/&gt;

===Savoy Hotel group===
From the beginning of his career, Carte maintained the Savoy group in London, disposing in 1919 of the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 July 1896, p. 4; and 20 December 1919, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants.  The [[Savoy Orpheans]] and the [[Savoy Havana Band]] were described by ''The Times'' as "probably the best-known bands in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 29 March 1924, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1927 Carte appointed his opera company's general manager, Richard Collet, to run the cabaret at the Savoy, which began in April 1929.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 March 1929, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1930s, the Savoy group had not thought it necessary to advertise, but Carte and his manager [[George Reeves-Smith]] changed their approach.  Reeves-Smith told ''The Times'', "We are endeavouring by intensive propaganda work to get more customers; this work is going on in the U.S.A., in Canada, in the Argentine and in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 March 1931, p. 22; and 22 April 1932, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of [[World War II]], Carte added to the Savoy group the bombed-out site near [[Leicester Square]] of Stone's Chop House, the freehold of which he purchased with a view to reopening the restaurant there on the lines of the group's Simpson's-in-the-Strand.  The revived Stone's reopened after Carte's death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 April 1946, p. 9; and 14 October 1963, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1907, Carte married Lady Dorothy Milner Gathorne-Hardy (1889–1977), the third and youngest daughter of the [[John Stewart Gathorne-Hardy, 2nd Earl of Cranbrook|2nd Earl of Cranbrook]], with whom he had a daughter, Bridget, and a son, Michael (1911–1932).  Michael was killed at the age of 21 in a motor accident in Switzerland.  In 1925, Carte and his wife had a country house built for them in [[Kingswear]], [[Devon]] named [[Coleton Fishacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/coleton-fishacre "Coleton Fishacre"], [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], accessed 5 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The house is still known for its design features and garden with exotic tropical plants.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine, 25 October 2007 feature on the house and gardens.&lt;/ref&gt; After her parents' divorce, Bridget D'Oyly Carte took over the house, which her father, who lived in London, would visit for long weekends.  She sold the house after his death, and it is now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden Coleton Fishacre House and Garden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217084145/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-coletonfishacrehouseandgarden |date=17 December 2009 }}, Nationaltrust.org, accessed 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte's private pastimes included gardening, notably at Coleton Fishacre, driving and yachting.  He was an early devotee of the motor car and incurred the displeasure of the courts more than once.  He was fined £3 for driving at 19 miles an hour in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 November 1902, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was subject to criminal prosecution for knocking down and injuring a child when driving at the speed of 24 miles an hour.  He made "every provision for the comfort of the child", who recovered from the accident.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 November 1903, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the years after World War I, he was a frequent competitor in yachting races.  From 1919 he raced his yacht "Kali" in the Hamble River class.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''The Times'', 22 July 1919, p. 5; and 11 August 1919, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he owned and raced a 19-ton cutter, "Content".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 August 1927, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Carte divorced his wife for adultery.  The suit was undefended.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 December 1941, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lady Dorothy moved to the [[Bahamas]] and married St Yves de Verteuil, who had been the co-respondent in the divorce case.  De Verteuil died in 1963, and Lady Dorothy de Verteuil died in February 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 March 1977, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Psmith-1909.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|P. G. Wodehouse's [[Psmith]], said to be modelled on Carte]]
[[P. G. Wodehouse]] based the character [[Psmith]], seen in several of his comic novels, on either Rupert D'Oyly Carte or his brother Lucas.  In the introduction to his novel ''Something Fresh'', Wodehouse says that Psmith (originally named Rupert, then Ronald) was "based more or less faithfully on Rupert D'Oyly Carte, son of the Savoy theatre man.  He was at school with a cousin of mine, and my cousin happened to tell me about his monocle, his immaculate clothes and his habit, when asked by a master how he was, of replying, 'Sir, I grow thinnah and thinnah'."&lt;ref&gt;The Psmith novels include ''[[Mike (novel)|Mike]]'' (1909), ''[[Psmith in the City]]'' (1910), ''[[Psmith, Journalist]]'' (1915) and ''[[Leave it to Psmith]]'' (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the [[Winchester College|Wykehamist]] schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester College.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert D'Oyly Carte was "shy, reserved and at times distinctly taciturn."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Psmith, by contrast, is outgoing and garrulous.&lt;ref&gt;"Don't ''talk'' so much! I never met a fellow like you for talking!" – Wodehouse, ''Leave it to Psmith'', ''quoted'' in Usborne, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
Carte died at the Savoy Hotel, after a brief illness, at the age of 71.  A memorial service was held for him at the [[Savoy Chapel]] on 23 September 1948.&lt;ref&gt;"Our London Correspondence", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 23 September 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were scattered on the headland at [[Coleton Fishacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Maev.  "An ideal cove", ''The Guardian'', 15 May 1999, p. G7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He left an estate valued at £228,436.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 October 1948, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  At his death, the family businesses passed to his daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte.  The Savoy hotel group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan.

The Gilbert and Sullivan operas, nurtured by Carte and his family for over a century, continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html List of 200 amateur G&amp;S performing groups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117020238/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/websites/index.html |date=17 November 2010 }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Bernard.

An example of Polish secessionist art, highly decorative, symbolical composition that seem fantastic combined with elements of [[Art Nouveau]].]]
'''Secession''' ({{lang-de|Sezession}}) refers to a number of [[modernism|modernist]] artist groups that separated from the support of official [[academic art]] and its administrations in the late 19th and early 20th century.

The first secession from the official politics occurred in France, when, in 1890, the "Salon au Champs-de-Mars" was established, headed by Meissonnier and Puvis de Chavannes. In the years following artists in various European countries took up this impulse, primarily in [[Germany]], [[Austria–Hungary]], and [[Belgium]], which 'seceded' from traditional [[art movement]]s and embraced progressive styles. The first secession outside France formed in [[Munich]] in 1892, followed by the Vienna Secession formed 5 years later in 1897.

The best-known secession movement was the [[Vienna Secession]] formed in 1897, and included [[Gustav Klimt]], who favored the ornate [[Art Nouveau]] style over the prevailing styles of the time. The style of these artists, as practiced in [[Austria]] is known as ''Sezessionstil'', or "Secession style".

[[Georg Hirth]], the editor and publisher of ''Jugend'' ({{lang-en|Youth}}) from 1896 until his death in 1916, coined the term "Secession" to represent the spirit of the various modern and reactionary movements of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Powell, "review of  C. Nebehay, ''[[Ver Sacrum (magazine)|Ver Sacrum]], 1898–1903''," ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 118 (Sep., 1976): 660.''&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later revisited in the published thesis by Hans-Ulrich Simon (''Sezessionismus. Kunstgewerbe in literarischer und bildender Kunst'', 1976), who argues that the series of secessions in late 19th and early 20th century Europe together form a movement of "Secessionism" ({{lang-de|Sezessionismus}}) that was manifested in both the art and literature of the era.

'''''Seraphim Falls''''' is a 2006 American [[Revisionist Western]] film directed by television producer and director [[David Von Ancken]] in his first [[feature film]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Von Ancken and Abby Everett Jaques. The fictional story focuses on a [[Bounty hunter|bounty hunt]] for a Union soldier by a Confederate colonel following the [[American Civil War]] in the late 1860s. [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Michael Wincott]], [[Tom Noonan]], and [[Ed Lauter]] star in principal roles. ''Seraphim Falls'' explores civil topics, such as violence, human survival and war.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;David Von Ancken. (2007). ''Seraphim Falls'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Icon Productions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced by the motion picture studio of [[Icon Productions]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]] and [[Destination Films]] theatrically, and by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] for home media. The film score was composed by musician [[Harry Gregson-Williams]], although a soundtrack version for the motion picture was not released to the public.

''Seraphim Falls'' premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and was released to theaters in limited release in the United States on January 26, 2007 grossing $418,296 in domestic ticket sales. It earned an additional $801,762 in box office business overseas for a combined worldwide total of $1,220,058 in revenue. The film was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas. The widescreen DVD edition of the film featuring scene selections and a bonus featurette, was released in the United States on May 15, 2007.

==Plot==
In 1868, within the [[Ruby Mountains]], Gideon ([[Pierce Brosnan]]) roasts hare over an open fire. Suddenly, gunshots ring out with one striking his left arm. He grabs what he can and races down the mountain. His attackers emerge from their cover to inspect his campsite. Colonel Morsman Carver ([[Liam Neeson]]), a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer, is accompanied by Pope ([[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]), Hayes ([[Michael Wincott]]), Parsons ([[Ed Lauter]]) and the Kid ([[John Robinson (American actor)|John Robinson]]); who are all engaged in a bounty operation to apprehend him.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

After removing the bullet from his arm with his hunting knife at a secluded locale, Gideon leaves an open fire burning, which attracts the posse. He ends up killing Pope with his knife and then ventures out again into the wilderness. He attempts to steal a horse, but is caught by a young woman named Charlotte (Shannon Zeller) who helps him after she realizes he is injured. She redresses his wound and her family lets him sleep overnight in their farmhouse. He later offers to buy their horse and leaves before daybreak. As the group of men approach Gideon's trail, he lays an ambush using a [[Animal trapping|bear trap]] which impales the Kid, who is then shot by Carver as an act of mercy. Later, Parsons decides to leave the other men following the discovery of a dead bank robber ([[James Jordan (actor)|James Jordan]]), whom Gideon had killed earlier in an act of self-defense and whose bounty money exceeds Gideon's.&lt;ref name=film /&gt; As Parsons is preparing to load the dead body to take to Carson City for the reward money, Carver shoots the horse - which he declares is his, leaving Parsons to walk the 30 miles back to town carrying the body.

Encountering a railroad under construction, Gideon hitches his horse and steals some food. The foreman recognizes the stolen horse and detains Gideon. Carver and his remaining man, Hayes, come upon the railroad site and search for Gideon. Meanwhile, Gideon escapes from custody and makes off with another horse. As Carver and Hayes draw closer, Gideon's horse can no longer take the strain of the heat and collapses. Gideon euthanizes the horse with his knife. When Carver and Hayes finally reach the horse's carcass, Hayes dismounts and marvels at what type of an animal would disembowel the creature. Suddenly, Gideon leaps out from the horse's belly, where he had been hiding, and grabs Hayes threatening to kill him if Carver doesn't give up his gun. Carver instead shoots Hayes with his last bullet. Confronting each other, Carver and Gideon recall the events that put them at odds. After the end of the [[American Civil War]], Gideon was ordered to track down former Confederate officers. When he arrived at Carver's home in Seraphim Falls to interrogate him, Carver was out in a nearby field. To coerce Carver's wife ([[Angie Harmon]]) into revealing his whereabouts, and believing that their house was empty, Gideon ordered their barn to be set on fire. The blaze quickly spread to the house, as Carver returned from the cropland. While the soldiers restrained him, his wife and son ran inside the house to save their infant child who was still in a bedroom. Both men look on with horror at the unfolding tragedy; trapped by the flames, Carver's wife and children perish. Gideon, racked with guilt over the tragedy, is seen dropping his gunbelt and walking away from his men.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

The two men fight, Gideon eventually getting the better of Carver. He points Carver in the direction of a town and tells him that he will get nothing but torment if he continues his pursuit. Gideon takes the horses ridden by Carver and Hayes and sets off deeper into the countryside. When Carver later catches up with Gideon, both men are on the brink of exhaustion. They confront each other again with their pistols. Gideon shoots Carver in the side but, instead of finishing him off, he offers himself to Carver. Carver decides not to shoot him and throws his pistol aside. Gideon helps Carver to his feet and the two men walk into the distance away from one another. In a final scene, Gideon takes his knife, which he has used throughout the film, and throws it into the ground.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

===Filming===
[[David Von Ancken]] first researched the script for six months before joining Abby Everett Jaques to create the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_11073.html|title=David Von Ancken Interview, Seraphim Falls|publisher=''MoviesOnline.ca''|accessdate=2007-04-18|last=Roberts|first=Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was originally announced at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] with [[Liam Neeson]] and [[Richard Gere]] in the lead roles.

In a mixed review, Christy Lemire writing in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' mused about the lead characters, stating, "Their climactic confrontation is visually arresting in its starkness. But as an anti-war statement, a call to lay down arms that's clearly intended to be relevant today, it's a bit too clunky in its literalism." She ultimately found the film to be "technically solid" but a "dramatically unremarkable Western".&lt;ref&gt;Lemire, Christy (2 March 2007).

He did however reserve praise for the cinematography noting, "Its physical beauty notwithstanding – Toll's work, which emphasizes the blues and greens of the forests, is always a pleasure to behold".&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Todd (18 September 2006).

Claudia Puig writing for ''[[USA Today]]'' offered an almost entirely positive review recalling how she thought the film was a "psychological drama with an intriguing ambiguity that challenges the viewer's loyalties and preconceived notions." She remarked that the storyline was an "elaborate and relentless chase that takes those involved into primal psychological terrain."&lt;ref&gt;Puig, Claudia (26 January 2007).

[[Stephen Holden]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' applauded some of the realism displayed in the film, commenting, "Nothing in the rest of the film comes close to matching the impact of Gideon’s carving the bullet from his arm with his hunting knife, then cauterizing the wound while emitting agonizing howls. This scene is enough to give you vicarious hypothermia." He also expressed his satisfaction with the visual attributes of the picture by saying "Its strongest element is the austere majesty of the cinematography by John Toll (''"[[Braveheart]],"'' ''"[[Legends of the Fall]],"'' ''"[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]"''), in which the severe beauty of the Western landscape looms over the characters as a silent rebuke."&lt;ref name="holden"/&gt; Critic Josh Rosenblatt, writing for ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' viewed ''Seraphim Falls'' as "Meditative, beautifully shot, and blessed with a healthy dose of cynicism" and a "morality play without the morality and a Western Purgatorio that, in the end, demands its protagonists resign themselves to their loneliness and brutality and avail themselves of the redemptive power of sheer exhaustion."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt, Josh (26 January 2007).

Peter Rainer of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' highlighted the film's merits by declaring that it was "essentially one long, bleak stalk-and-kill action thriller. From the rugged snowscapes to the cracked desert vistas, director David Von Ancken and cinematographer John Toll serve up a whole lot of eye candy from the great outdoors." He added, "The film functions as a kind of survivalists' guide, and there's a morbid pleasure in seeing how Gideon extricates himself from one impossible situation after another."&lt;ref&gt;Rainer, Peter (2 February 2007).

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.png|thumb|[[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]] and his Chinese secretary (1783–1859) portrait at the Sir J. J. School of Art]]

The School was founded in March 1857, named after [[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]], a businessman and philanthropist, who donated Rs. 100,000 for its endowment. Operations were managed by a committee headed by the Chief Justice of Bombay. The School's first class was in drawing, and began on 2 March 1857. Classes were held at the [[Elphinstone Institution]]. [[John Griffiths (artist)|John Griffiths]] became Principal of the School in 1865. He later became famous for copying the murals in the [[Ajanta Caves]] temple complex, a project which lasted from 1872 to 1891, and which the School's students assisted in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=224832 Art heritage, saved by sunshine law]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 2 March 2007. "...when the Public Works Department took up repainting of the building, the paintings had been shifted to the terrace and may have been washed out after the 26/7 deluge two years ago.(2005)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, management of the school was taken over by the Government of India. Also in 1866, [[John Lockwood Kipling|Lockwood Kipling]], who had become a professor of the School in 1865, established three ''[[Wikt:atelier|ateliers]]'' for (i) Decorative Paintings, (ii) Modelling; and (iii) Ornamental Wrought Iron Work, and became its first dean. He was the father of the author [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was born on the School's campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-10-05/mumbai/27989345_1_kipling-house-bungalow-jsw-foundation Kipling house to become museum] ''[[Times of India]]', Oct 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the school moved to its own building, where it is currently situated. The building was designed by architect George Twigge Molecey,&lt;ref name=bre&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-07/mumbai/27946139_1_stone-walls-restoration-heritage-buildings After years, Sir JJ School of Art begins to BREATHE] ''[[Times of India]]'', Nov 7, 2008. "Kipling House (Dean's Bungalow)The original cottage was brought down in the early 1900s and a new house built on the same spot."&lt;/ref&gt; in  [[neo Gothic]] architecture.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-03-03/mumbai/27877604_1_art-world-bronze-bust-clay Celebrating 150 years] ''[[Times of India]]', 3 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The School campus, including the Kipling House, better known as the Dean's Bungalow, is classified as Grade II heritage structure by the Government of Maharashtra, and underwent a restoration in 2002-2006, and again in 2008.&lt;ref name=bre/&gt;

Drawing instruction as a subject was introduced in 1879 and a programme for training drawing teachers was started in 1893. In 1891 the Lord Reay Art Workshops (now known as the Department of Art-Crafts) were established.

===1900s===
The School had an important tradition in [[architecture]]. In 1900. the School offered its first course in architecture, taught by [[John Begg]], later Consulting Architect of Bombay and of the Government of India. A complete 4-year programme was established in 1908 under Begg's assistant [[George Wittet]]. In 1917, architect [[Claude Batley]] became a visiting professor; he was Principal of the School from 1923 to 1943, and is commemorated in the Claude Batley Architectural Gallery for architectural exhibitions, opened in 1996.

In 1896, the Draughtsman's classes, the nucleus of the Department of Architecture, were added. This Department was later organised for a 3 years Diploma Course which was duly recognised by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|R.I.B.A. Board]].

In 1910, the [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|Sir George Clarke]] Studies and Laboratories were built for the advanced study of crafts, pottery being the first craft taken up for study. In 1929, the head of the School was renamed "Director", and in 1935, the Department of Commercial Art was also started.

In 1937 [[M.R. Acharekar]] was appointed deputy director and continued his tenure till 1939. Shri. V. S. Adurkar was the first Indian head of the school, succeeding [[Claude Batley]] as Director in 1943.

===Post-independence===
In 1958, the school was divided, with the Departments of Architecture and Applied Art becoming the [[Sir J. J. College of Architecture]] and [[Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art]] respectively.

In 1981, the School became affiliated with the [[University of Mumbai]].

It can not only be a means to generate awareness, but it can also be a catalyst to engage community members to take action around a social issue.  '''Social justice art''' consequently allows people to develop [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to interrupt and alter [[Oppression|oppressive]] systemic patterns or individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Mary|title=You Better Recognize!: The Arts as Social Justice for African American Students|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=420–444|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.589763}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes by which people create and engage with art equips them with analytic tools to understand and challenge [[Social justice|social injustices]] through [[Teaching for social justice|social justice education]] (teaching for social justice), [[community building]], and social [[activism]]/[[social movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Rosemarie|title=Facing and Transforming Hauntings of Race Through the Arts|journal=Equity and Excellence in education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=330–347|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.591260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of visual and performing social justice art includes: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[murals]], [[graffiti]], [[film]], [[theater]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[spoken word]], etc. [[File:Filipino Community Mural.jpg|thumb|Filipino Community Mural]]

==Background==
Art has played a role in social justice education, community building, and social [[activism]]/[[social movement]]s.  It provides a universal language that gives voice to individuals and communities and is accessible across social boundaries.  These examples can overlap and are not strictly confined to one specific category.

==History==
Two well-known [[art movements]] that have utilized art as a means to work towards social justice are the [[Black Arts Movement]] and [[Chicano art movement]].  Both movements began to enter into public consciousness during the 1960s.  The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in combination with the [[Black Power Movement]] helped to propel the Black Arts Movement.  One of the main goals of this movement was to support [[Black Nationalism]] and [[Community mobilization|mobilize the community]] towards [[Social Action|social action]].  This period produced an increase in Black poetry, [[African-American literature|literature]], and [[African-American music|music]].  A few key figures of the movement were; author [[Marcus Garvey]], author and artist [[Charles S. Johnson]], revolutionary artist [[Emory Douglas]], and social dancer and choreographer Katrina Hazzard-Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Tony|title=Literary Garveyism: Garvey, Black Arts, and the Harlem Renaissance|year=1983|publisher=The Majority Press|location=Dover, Massachusetts|isbn=0-912469-00-5|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The efforts to incorporate post-[[Mexican Revolution]] notions with current [[Mexican American]] social, political, and cultural issues drove the Chicana/Chicano Arts Movement. [[Murals]] are a form of [[visual art]] that experienced a rise in popularity during this movement.  Chicana/Chicano mural art became a means of working towards political goals, challenging [[stereotype]]s, as well as a way for community members to play an active role in creating community [[memoir]]s.  [[Diego Rivera]] was one prominent figure who helped to establish [[Mexican muralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicanoart.org The Road to Mictlan|url=http://www.chicanoart.org/dia05.html|work=Webpage|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals.jpg|thumb|Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals]]

===Social justice education===
An educational approach that focuses on fostering awareness of social injustices and how [[Social inequality|inequalities]] impact youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Curkovic|title=Art and Social Justice Education Part 1|url=http://frankcurkovic.edublogs.org/2012/07/19/art-social-justice-education-part-1/|work=blog|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice education saw its roots in the ideas of [[Paulo Freire]], author of [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]. In his work, Freire highlights the theoretical ideas of [[critical pedagogy]], which is an approach that combines education and [[critical theory]]. This approach is relevant to social justice art education because it combines the critique of social injustices and the use of art as a mechanism to engage with social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=Elizabeth|title=Social Justice and Art Education|journal=Visual Arts Research|year=2004|volume=30|series=59|issue=2|pages=4–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culturally relevant arts education ====
Culturally relevant arts education (CRAE) is an education model that emerged from Tubman Theater Project.  The theater project is a culturally relevant [[drama]] program in which African American middle and high school students examine their [[internalized oppression]] and work to create positive racial [[Racial identity|identities]].  The program gives them the opportunity to learn from rehearsing and performing plays based on their lived experiences. This framework incorporates six different [[pedagogies]].  Three of these are art related; arts production, [[aesthetics]], and [[arts integration]] as well as three non-art related; [[multicultural education]], [[critical pedagogy]], and contextual teaching and learning.  CRAE engages both students and educators in a process in which they reflect on their social position in societal liberation and [[Subjugate|subjugation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanley|first=Mary|title=You Better Recognize!: The Arts as Social Justice for African American Students|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=420–444|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.589763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social justice art in higher education===
Universities have employed social justice art education models within the art department.

:[[University of Michigan]] - The Prison Creative Arts Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsa.umich.edu/pcap/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community building===
Sense of community is built through bridging geographic or interest-driven relationships.  Building community helps individuals come together to challenge inner oppressive dynamics that have been imposed by [[institution]]s, structures and bodies.  These inner oppressive dynamics have been termed “social ghosts” have been referenced in dance literature and function as a key theme within many community building art projects.  Art for community building is a collective effort in which the art making process strengthens community ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=Pamela |title=Hand-in Hand, Building Community on Common Ground|journal=Art Education|date=November 2010|volume=63|issue=6|pages=6–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of Western Artists''' was founded by [[William Forsyth (artist)|William Forsyth]], [[T. C. Steele]], [[J. Ottis Adams]], [[John Elwood Bundy]] and fourteen other artists in 1896.

== Objective of Society ==

The Society of Western Artists "was organized in 1896 for the purpose of uniting artists in fellowship and of combining their efforts in the advancement of Art. As one of the means to this end the Society gathers together, annually, a collection of representative works, chiefly done in the middle west, and exhibits the collection in various cities."&lt;ref&gt;"Catalogue of the Eleventh Annual Exhibition of the Society of Western Artists", ''The Art Institute of Chicago'', December 6 to December 26, 1906, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Area of Activity ==

These painters most of whom were impressionists were active primarily in the American Midwest.

== Other Members ==

Other members included [[Frank J. Girardin]], [[Frank Reaugh]] and [[Mathias Alten]], and the miniature portraitist [[Edward William Carlson]].

== Development as a Society ==

"The Society of Western Artists feels that it has passed beyond its first youth, and that it can afford to take upon itself a more critical and dignified attitude."—Edmund H. Wuerpel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= | title =The Fourth Annual Exhibition of the Society of Western Artists | journal =Brush &amp; Pencil | volume =5 | issue =4 | page=165 | publisher = | location = | date =January 1900| jstor =25505502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Perry, Rachel Berenson, ''T.

'''''St. George''''' or '''''St. George and the Dragon''''' is a small [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. It is housed in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]]. A later version of the same subject is the ''[[St. George and the Dragon (Raphael)|St. George]]'' in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==History==
This painting and the equally small ''[[St. Michael (Raphael)|Saint Michael]]'', also in the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/saint-michael-overwhelming-demon Louvre entry]&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair. In the [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]] Collection they were joined together, forming a [[diptych]], and bound in leather. [[Louis XIV]] acquired them from [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]]'s heirs in 1661.&lt;ref name="ChamplinPerkins1913"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Champlin|first1=John Denison|author2=Charles Callahan Perkins|authorlink2=Charles Callahan Perkins|title=Cyclopedia of painters and paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KUaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA258|accessdate=26 June 2010|year=1913|publisher=C. Scribner's sons|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saint George'' has sometimes been ascribed to the artist's Roman period, because the horse resembles one of the horses of [[Horse Tamers|Monte Cavallo]] (the [[Quirinal Palace]]). However, Raphael could easily have known this particular horse from a drawing of it, done by one of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]'s pupils.&lt;ref name="Muntz2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Muntz|title=Raphael: His Life, Works, and Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pO7GkO4soMgC&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=26 June 2010|date=May 2005 (originally 1888)|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-9396-3|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; To judge by the still somewhat naïve and [[Perugino|Peruginesque]] style of the painting, it is really one of Raphael's early works, dating from about 1504. He did another painting of the same subject a little later (the mentioned panel in Washington D. C.), and towards the end of his life he painted a large ''[[St. Michael Vanquishing Satan (Raphael)|Sant Michael]]'' which is also in the [[Louvre]].

Giovanni Lomazzo, in his ''Trattato della Pittura'' (1584), mentions a ''Saint George'' by Raphael, commissioned by the [[Duke of Urbino]], which was painted on a little chess-board (''tavoliere''). According to the old catalogues the small ''Saint Michael'', if not the saint George as well, had a draught-board on the back which is now covered over.&lt;ref&gt;G. P. Lomazzo, ''Trattato Dell' Arte Della Pittura Scultura Ed Architettura'', (reprint) Kessinger Publishing (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Examination by means of X-rays and infrared has not confirmed this statement. In the abovementioned book, Lomazzo seems to have confused various pictures of the same subject.&lt;ref name="Cartwright2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartwright|first=Julia|title=Early Work of Raphael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTtIHgsS1tQC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=26 June 2010|date=18 October 2006|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4254-9624-1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one can rely to some extent on his late and somewhat muddled testimony, it is possible that the two paintings in the Louvre were painted for the [[Duke of Urbino]].

The [[Uffizi Gallery]] has a pen-and-wash cartoon for the ''Saint George'' (seen here below).

'''Stencilling''' produces an image or pattern by applying [[pigment]] to a surface over an intermediate object with designed gaps in it which create the pattern or image by only allowing the pigment to reach some parts of the surface. The '''stencil''' is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object; the context in which ''stencil'' is used makes clear which meaning is intended. In practice, the (object) stencil is usually a thin sheet of material, such as paper, plastic, wood or metal, with [[lettering|letters]] or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cut-out holes in the material.

The key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design. Although [[aerosol paint|aerosol]] or painting stencils can be made for one-time use, typically they are made with the intention of being reused. To be reusable, they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface. With some designs, this is done by connecting stencil '''islands''' (sections of material that are inside cut-out "holes" in the stencil) to other parts of the stencil with '''bridges''' (narrow sections of material that are not cut out).

Stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as '''pochoir'''.  A related technique (which has found applicability in some [[surrealist techniques|surrealist]] compositions) is [[Aerography (arts)|aerography]], in which spray-painting is done ''around'' a  three-dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting handprint outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment.

[[Screen printing]] also uses a stencil process, as does [[Mimeograph machine|mimeography]]. The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called "stencils". Stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and mimeography, the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi-colored images.

[[Hand stencils]], made by blowing pigment over a hand held against a wall, are found from over 35,000 years ago in Asia and Europe, and later prehistoric dates in other continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Cave paintings change ideas about the origin of art|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29415716|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News}} "The minimum age for (the outline of the hand) is 39,900 years old, which makes it the oldest hand stencil in the world," said Dr Aubert. "Next to it is, and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one," he told BBC News. There are also paintings in the caves that are around 27,000 years old, which means that the inhabitants were painting for at least 13,000 years."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pike, A.

Stencils may have been used to color cloth for a very long time; the technique probably reached its peak of sophistication in [[Katazome]] and other techniques used on silks for clothes during the [[Edo period]] in Japan.  In Europe, from about 1450 they were commonly used to color [[old master print]]s printed in black and white, usually [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 51, 65, 80, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was especially the case with playing-cards, which continued to be colored by stencil long after most other subjects for prints were left in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 15, {{ISBN|0691003262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stencils were used for mass publications, as the type did not have to be hand-written.

==Book illustration==

Stencils were popular as a method of book illustration, and for that purpose, the technique was at its height of popularity in France during the 1920s when [[André Edouard Marty|André Marty]], [[Jean Saudé]] and many other studios in Paris specialized in the technique. Low wages contributed to the popularity of the highly labor-intensive process.&lt;ref name=jj&gt;Jan Juffermans (2003). ''Kees van Dongen: The Graphic Work'' Lund Humphries Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85331-876-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; When stencils are used in this way they are often called "pochoir".
In the pochoir process, a print with the outlines of the design was produced, and a series of stencils were used through which areas of color were applied by hand to the page. To produce detail, a [[collotype]] could be produced which the colors were then stenciled over.&lt;ref name=dp&gt;David Pankow (1997). ''Tempting the palette''. {{ISBN|1-933360-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pochoir was frequently used to create prints of intense color and is most often associated with [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/arb/archives/exhibits2/Pochoir/Pochoir.html The University of Cincinnati] The Art of the Pochoir Book, University of Cincinnati&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/ondisplay/pochoir/intro.htm Smithsonian Institution] Vibrant Visions, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerosol stencils==

Aerosol stencils have many practical applications and the stencil concept is used frequently in industrial, commercial, artistic, residential and recreational settings, as well as by the military, government and infrastructure management. A template is used to create an outline of the image.  Stencils templates can be made from any material which will hold its form, ranging from plain paper, cardboard, plastic sheets, metals, and wood.

===Official use===
Stencils are frequently used by official organizations, including the military, utility companies, and governments, to quickly and clearly label objects, vehicles, and locations. Stencils for an official application can be customized, or purchased as individual letters, numbers, and symbols. This allows the user to arrange words, phrases and other labels from one set of templates, unique to the item being labeled. When objects are labeled using a single template alphabet, it makes it easier to identify their affiliation or source.

===Stencil graffiti===
{{Main|Stencil graffiti}}
Stencils have also become popular for [[graffiti]], since stencil art using [[aerosol paint|spray-paint]] can be produced quickly and easily.  These qualities are important for graffiti artists where graffiti is illegal or quasi-legal, depending on the city and stenciling surface.  The extensive lettering possible with stencils makes it especially attractive to political artists. For example, the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]] used stencils of [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]] and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages in a long-term graffiti campaign around the [[London Underground]] system and on advertising billboards. There has been a semi-recent trend in making multi-layered stencils with different shades of grey for each layer creating a more detailed stenciled image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09400a.html Crass Discography (Christ's Reality Asylum)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912012809/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09400a.html |date=2006-09-12 }} Retrieved on November 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Also well known for their use of stencil art is [[Blek le Rat]] and [[Jef aerosol]] from France, British artist [[Banksy]], New York artist [[John Fekner]], world traveling artist [[Tavar Zawacki]] f.k.a. 'ABOVE', [[Shepard Fairey]]'s [[Andre the Giant Has a Posse|OBEY]], and [[Pirate &amp; Acid]] from Hollywood, California.

==Home stenciling==
A common tradition for stencils is in [[home decorating]] and [[Handicraft|arts &amp; crafts]]. Home decor stencils are an important part of the DIY (Do It Yourself) industry. There are prefabricated stencil templates available for home decoration projects from hardware stores, arts &amp; crafts stores and through the internet. Stencils are usually applied in the home with a paint or roller brush along wall borders and as trim. They can also be applied with a painted sponge for a textured effect.

Stencil templates can be purchased or constructed individually.  Typically they are constructed of flexible plastics, including acetate, mylar, and vinyl. Stencils can be used as children's toys.

==Military stenciling==
Stencils have been used in the military across most nations for many years and continue to be used today. They are used to mark up equipment, vehicles, rations, signposts, helmets, etc. One use of military stencils was the application of playing card designs to USA Airborne helmets during World War Two as a method to identify regimental units.

==Silk screening==

[[Silk screening]] is a type of printing on paper or [[textile]]s, in which an ink is embedded in the cloth.  The ink is controlled through the use of a stencil, which is placed directly over the paper or textile.  This process can only handle one color of ink at a time.  Therefore, multi-colored designs must be silk screened several times, with each interval taking time to dry.

==Micro/nanostencil==
{{Main|Nanostencil}}

Stencils are also used in micro/[[nanotechnology]], as miniature shadow masks through which material can be deposited, etched or ions implanted onto a substrate. These stencils are usually made out of thin (100-500&amp;nbsp;nm) low-stress SiN in which apertures are defined by various lithographic techniques (e. g. electron beam, photolithography).

[[Stencil lithography]] has unique advantages compared to other patterning techniques: it does not require spinning of a uniform layer of resist (therefore patterns can be created on 3D topographies) and it does not involve any heat or chemical treatment of the substrate (like baking, developing and removing the resist). Thus it allows a wide range of substrates (e.g. flexible, surface-treated) and materials (e. g. organics) to be used.

==Other stencil forms==
{{Main|Screen printing}}

A stencil technique is employed in [[screen printing]] which uses a tightly woven mesh '''screen''' coated in a thin layer of emulsion to reproduce the original image. As the stencil is attached to the screen, a contiguous template is not necessary.
{{Main|Airbrush}}
A stencil used in [[airbrushing]] called a [[frisket]] is pressed directly on the artwork. It can be used control or contain overspray, create sharp or complex shapes, but is not designed to be used more than once.

Wall stencils - to decorate walls and ceilings or create your own repeat for an overall modern wall pattern effect.

{{Anti-consumerism|Theories}}

'''Subvertising''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[subversion (political)|subvert]]'' and ''advertising'') is the practice of making spoofs or [[parody|parodies]] of [[corporation|corporate]] and [[politics|political]] [[advertising|advertisements]].&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite news |author=Alexander Barley|coauthors= |title=Battle of the image |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/153475 |quote=Subvertising is an attempt to turn the iconography of the advertisers into a noose around their neck. If images can create a brand, they can also destroy one. A subvert is a satirical version or the defacing of an existing advert, a detournement, an inversion designed to make us forget consumerism and consider instead social or political issues. |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=May 21, 2001 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subvertisements may take the form of a new image or an alteration to an existing image or icon, often in a [[satire|satirical]] manner. A subvertisement can also be referred to as a [[meme hack]] and can be a part of [[social hacking]] or [[culture jamming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Clearing the Mindscape |url=http://www.adbusters.org/category/tags/subvertising |quote=So I think that, for me, "subvertising", or "culture jamming", as I call it, is the art of creating a new kind of cool. |newspaper=[[Adbusters]] |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927050110/http://www.adbusters.org/category/tags/subvertising |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Adbusters]]'', a [[Canada|Canadian]] magazine and a proponent of counter-culture and subvertising, "A well produced 'subvert' mimics the look and feel of the targeted ad, promoting the classic '[[double-take (comedy)|double-take]]' as viewers suddenly realize they have been duped. Subverts create [[cognitive dissonance]]. It cuts through the [[:wikt:hype|hype]] and glitz of our mediated reality and, momentarily, reveals a deeper truth within."

Subvertising is a type of ''advertising hijacking'' (''détournement publicité''), where [[détournement]] techniques developed in the 1950s by the French [[Letterist International]] and later used by the better-known [[Situationist International]] have been used as a contemporary critical form to re-route advertising messages.

In 1972, the logo of Richard Nixon's reelection campaign posters was subvertised with two x's in Nixon's name (as in the [[Exxon]] logo) to suggest the corporate ownership of the Republican party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Exxon Victorious |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903902,00.html |quote=One sure sign that Exxon has arrived as a brand name is that it has become the butt of cartoonists' jokes. For example, a cartoon in [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]] shows a picture of the White House with a sign overhead emblazoned Nixxon. The caption: 'But it's still the same old gas'. |work=Time |date=March 5, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/04/stickers.election/ |title=Sore-Loserman: From political parody to charity's windfall.

At the 2015 Paris COP21 climate conference, the collective known as [[Brandalism]] installed 600 posters that attacked what they perceived as the hypocrisy of corporate sponsors.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/subvertising-ads-posters-billboards/index.html|title=The hackers using street ads to protest|date=23 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Attack at Dawn''''' by [[Alphonse de Neuville]] depicts a French town under siege by Prussian troops.

==History==
Alphonse de Neuville served as an officer in the Auxiliary Sappers and as aide-de-camp to General Callier during the Franco-Prussian War.  He closely studied locations of battles and weaponry to recreate battle scenes.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;[Johnston, W. R., Nineteenth-Century Art: From Romanticism to Art Nouveau, The Walters Art Gallery, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''The Attack at Dawn'' is a recreation of a Prussian assault on a French village.  To the left of the painting, a bugler sounds the alarm.  French troops rush from the inn, their uniforms identify them as [[Tirailleur#Algerian.2C_Tunisian_and_Moroccan_tirailleurs|''Turcos'']] or Algerian rifleman and ''mobiles'' or members of the [[Garde Mobile]].  The mountain in the background, helps to identify the location of the scene as a village near the [[Jura Mountains]], located near the Swiss border.  &lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;[Johnston, W. R., Nineteenth-Century Art: From Romanticism to Art Nouveau, The Walters Art Gallery, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The paintings of de Neuville attempt to glorifying France's heroic resistance rather than its military defeat.&lt;ref name= "The Walters Art Museum"&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/4911/ The Walters Art Museum - ''The Attack at Dawn'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Off the Wall==
Currently, ''The Attack at Dawn'' is being featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland.  A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of [[The Walters Art Museum]] collection, will be on display at Federal Hill Park.&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;[http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119005400/http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The ''Off the Wall'' reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"&gt;[Smith, T., Walters Art Museum goes of the wall, ''The Baltimore Sun'', September 11, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Funeral''''' (often '''''The Funeral (Dedicated to Oskar Panizza)''''') is a painting by the German [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] artist [[George Grosz]], completed between 1917 and 1918. The work combines elements of [[Futurism]] and [[Cubism]]&lt;ref name="W42"&gt;Wolf &amp; Grosenick, 42&lt;/ref&gt; to show a [[funeral procession]] in a modern urban city, as an [[hell|infernal]] abyss populated by twisted and grotesque attendants.&lt;ref name="FW"&gt;Friedrich-Wilhelms, Rheinische. "[http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/edoc/ia/eese/artic99/less3/Sources/HTML-Pages/HTML-Pages/georg30.html Widmung an Oskar Panizza (1917/18)]". Universität Bonn. Retrieved on 21 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is dedicated to the German psychiatrist and avant-garde writer [[Oskar Panizza]], noted for his play ''[[Liebeskonzil]]'', which draws on the first historically documented outbreak of [[syphilis]] and depicts [[God the Father]] as a senile old man. Although Panizza's works, in which he rejected all militarism and religious authority, were deemed [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] by both the Church and government of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]], they were later admired by Grosz and other idealists of his generation.&lt;ref name="W42" /&gt;

The painting seeks to emulate medieval depictions of hellscapes, mainly through dramatic colourisation—in particular through its use of red light—as well as through the depiction of multitudes of layered distorted bodies and limbs, echoing the work of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]] in the 16th century. A skeleton representing the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] sits on the coffin, drinking&lt;ref&gt;likely to be [[Schnapps]]&lt;/ref&gt; from a bottle. A mob of mourners gathered around him are presented as ugly, frenzied and as if ridden with alcoholism and late-stage syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/promethean/1st%20Issue/1%206.htm Weimar artist's Social Satire]". ''Die Promethean''. Retrieved on 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tall claustrophobic buildings are lined above the procession. They seem to heave and bend backwards and forwards, as if about to topple over and collapse onto those cluddered below.&lt;ref name="FW" /&gt; Among these buildings is a lone small church, surrounded by bars, nightclubs and offices. Giving a literal voice to the "[[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]]" depicted by the artist, a sign over one club reads "DANCE TONIGHT".&lt;ref name="W42" /&gt;

Explaining his intention when creating the work, Grosz said, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"In a strange street by night, a hellish procession of [[Dehumanization|dehumanized]] figures mills, their faces reflecting alcohol, syphilis, plague ... I painted this protest against a humanity  that had gone insane."&lt;ref name="W42" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}

The painting served as the cover artwork for the 1987 album ''[[I Am a Wallet]]'' by the British rock band [[McCarthy (band)|Mccarthy]].

'''The London Group''' is a society based in [[London]], England, created to offer additional exhibiting opportunities to artists besides the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. Formed in 1913, it is one of the oldest artist-led organisations in the world. It was formed from the merger of the [[Camden Town Group]], an all-male group, and the Fitzroy Street Group. It holds open submission exhibitions for members and guest artists.

== Overview ==
The London Group is composed of working artists. All forms of art are represented. The group functions democratically without dogma or style.&lt;ref name="Redfern"&gt;Redfern, David [https://books.google.com/books?id=hzMSSQAACAAJ ''The London Group: origins and Post War history'']. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It has a written constitution, annually elected officers, working committees and a selection committee. There are usually between 80 and 100 members and an annual fee is charged to cover gallery hire and organisational costs. The group has no permanent exhibition venue and rents gallery space in London, most recently at the Menier Gallery, [[Bankside Gallery]] and Cello Factory. New members are elected most years, from nominations made by current members.&lt;ref name="Redfern"/&gt;

==History==
The London Group was founded in 1913, when the [[Camden Town Group]] came together with the English [[Vorticists]] and other independent artists to challenge the domination of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], which had become unadventurous and conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, Denys J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EtNPAAAAMAAJ ''The London Group, 1913-1939: the artists and their works'']. Scholar Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Group emerged from a merger of the Fitzroy Street Group and the male-member-only Camden Town Group organization.&lt;ref name="Redfern"/&gt; Founding members included the patron-artist [[Ethel Sands]], artist [[Anna Hope Hudson]],&lt;ref name="Tate Ethel bio"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/camden-town-group/ethel-sands-r1105348 Ethel Sands.] Tate. Retrieved 17 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sickert]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Wyndham Lewis]], [[Robert Bevan]] and his wife [[Stanislawa de Karlowska]], and [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]].&lt;ref name="Dickson, Rachel 2013"&gt;Dickson, Rachel ; MacDougall, Sarah; Baron, Wendy; Wilcox, Denys; Redfern David.

The open submissions are shown along with the work of existing members and guest artists.&lt;ref name="DRedfern"/&gt; The exhibition Uproar! celebrated the first 50 years of the London Group in 1963 and it highlighted the role played by women and emigre artists in its membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/uproar-the-first-50-years-of-the-london-group-1913-1963] Review in ''Studio International'' from 1963&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013-14 the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] celebrated The London Group's 100-year anniversary with an exhibition Uproar: The First 50 Years of The London Group 1913-1963 curated by Rachel Dickson and Sarah MacDougall.&lt;ref name="Dickson, Rachel 2013"/&gt;

One of the oldest standing artist-led organisations in the world, The London Group continues to exist today with over 80 members. In 2011 the open exhibition presented over 140 artists at the Cello Factory. The group celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2013 with several shows, both historical and contemporary.&lt;ref name="Redfern"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28062">The '''Vilna Troupe''' ({{lang-yi|Vilner trupe ווילנער טרופע}}; {{lang-lt|Vilniaus trupė}}; {{lang-pl|Trupa Wileńska}}; {{lang-ro|Trupa din Vilna}}), also known as '''Fareyn Fun Yiddishe Dramatishe Artistn''' (Federation of Yiddish Dramatic Actors)&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{Harvnb|Pascal|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Roshwald|Stites|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later '''''Dramă şi Comedie''''', was an international and mostly [[Yiddish]]-speaking theatrical company, one of the most famous in the history of [[Yiddish theater]]. It was formed in and named after the city of [[Vilnius]] (Vilna) in the [[Russian Empire]], later capital city of [[Lithuania]]. Distinctly [[Modernism|Modernist]], and strongly influenced by [[Russian literature]] and by the ideas of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], their travels in [[Western Europe]] and later to [[Romania]] played a significant role in the dissemination of a disciplined approach to acting that continues to be influential down to the present day.

==Early years==
[[File:הדיבוק.jpg|thumb|Vilna Troupe plays "Der dibek" (''[[The Dybbuk]]''), Poland, 1920s]]

Founded in 1915 or 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|p=125}} says 1915; {{Harvnb|Liptzin|1972|p=411}} says 1916, as does {{Harvnb|Pascal|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War I]], the troupe began with the deserted [[Vilna State Theatre]] as their base, toured [[Kovno]], [[Białystok]] and [[Grodno]], and soon moved to [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=Pascal /&gt; Their repertoire epitomized the second golden age of Yiddish theater, with works by [[S. Ansky]], [[Sholom Aleichem]] and [[Sholem Asch]], as well as [[Molière]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], plus some Jewish-themed plays by non-Jews, notably [[Karl Gutzkow]]'s ''[[Uriel Acosta]]''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|pp=125–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their uniform [[Yiddish dialects|Lithuanian Yiddish]] stood in contrast to the mix of dialects often heard in Yiddish theater at the time.&lt;ref name=Pascal/&gt;

They were the first to stage Ansky's ''[[The Dybbuk]]''.&lt;ref name=Roskies&gt;{{Harvnb|Roskies|Werman|2002|p=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the play were written variously in [[Russian language|Russian]] and Yiddish, but Russian director and [[Stanislavski's system|method acting]] pioneer Stanislavski (who first encountered the work in Russian) made several suggestions to Ansky. One of these was that for the sake of authenticity the piece should be in Yiddish. Stanislavski's death prevented the play from being produced at the [[Moscow Art Theater]].&lt;ref name=Fisher-143&gt;{{Harvnb|Fisher|2002|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Ansky's death, on November 8, 1920, the play was complete but had never been professionally produced.&lt;ref name=Roskies /&gt; As a tribute to Ansky, the Vilna troupe, under the direction of [[David Herman (Yiddish theater)|David Herman]], utilised the 30-day period of mourning after his death to prepare the play, which opened December 9, 1920, at the Elysium Theatre in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=Fisher-143 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Downes&gt;Olin Downes, "VILNA TROUPE REVIVED On the 20th Anniversary of Its Founding 'Dybbuk' Is Given", ''The New York Times'', February 24, 1937, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mazower|2005}}; this is the citation for the name of the theater.&lt;/ref&gt; Its unanticipated success established the play as a classic of modern Yiddish theater.&lt;ref name=Roskies /&gt;

They toured extensively; they played in [[New York City]], [[London]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their 1923 London production of [[Sholem Asch]]'s ''[[The God of Vengeance]]'' at the [[Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel]] was shut down by the censor (who had originally passed it based on an English-language synopsis).&lt;ref&gt;"LONDON NOTES: Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES", ''The New York Times'', October 28, 1923, p. X2.&lt;/ref&gt; The play includes a portrayal of a [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] relationship, which is the most favorably portrayed relationship in this rather dark play. &lt;ref&gt;Bud Coleman, [http://salempress.com/Store/samples/great_events_from_history_glbt/great_events_from_history_glbt_god.htm "''The God of Vengeance'' Opens on Broadway"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028182732/https://salempress.com/Store/samples/great_events_from_history_glbt/great_events_from_history_glbt_god.htm |date=2007-10-28 }}, excerpted from ''Great Events from History: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Events'' (Lillian Faderman, Yolanda Retter, Horacio Roque Ramírez, eds., December 2006; {{ISBN|978-1-58765-263-9}}), Salem Press. Accessed online December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the members of the troupe was [[Joseph Green (actor)|Joseph Green]], later a Yiddish-language filmmaker.&lt;ref name=Edelman&gt;{{Harvnb|Edelman|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bucharest==
In 1923, the Vilna troupe came to Bucharest at the invitation of [[Isidor Goldenberg]] of the Jigniţa Summer Theater. At the time, the troupe included actresses [[Hanna Braz]], [[Luba Kadison]], Helene Gottlieb, [[Judith Lares]], [[Hanna Mogel]], and [[Miriam Orleska]], and actors [[Alexander Stein (Vilna Troupe actor)|Alexander Stein]], [[Joseph Buloff]], [[Aizic Samberg]], Joseph Kamen, Jacob Weislitz, [[Leib Kadison]], [[Samuel Schäftel]], [[Benjamin Ehrenkrantz]] and [[Haim Brakasch]]. The director of the company was [[Mordechai Mazo]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author, businessman and [[Zionism|Zionist]] activist [[A. L. Zissu]] was instrumental in helping the transition and was  reportedly the company's main financial backer after 1923. Zissu was the brother-in-law of the Romanian poet [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref name=pc275&gt;{{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to playwright and cultural promoter [[Israil Bercovici]], their disciplined approach to theater impacted not only Romanian Yiddish theater but [[Theater of Romania|Romanian theater]] generally. Their audience went beyond the usual attendees of Yiddish theater: they drew the attention of the [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] press, the Romanian theater world, and of "men of culture" generally. An August 23, 1924 article in the daily newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'' noted: "Such a demonstration of artistry, even on a small stage such as Jigniţa and even in a language like Yiddish ought to be seen by all who are interested in superior realization of drama."&lt;ref&gt;   {{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998}}, especially pp. 126–8; the ''Adevărul'' quotation is on page 128&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian literary critic [[Paul Cernat]] argues that the Vilna Troupe acted as a ferment for the local [[avant-garde]], [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] environment, and by extension, for cutting edge [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|pp=269, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cernat noted that while most Romanian avant-garde shows were "simple playful curiosities", "expressionist aesthetics were not without consequences on the [new Romanian] theatrical texts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Cernat's view, the Vilna Troupe accomplished this in tandem with various local companies and promoters. Among the latter, he cites Zissu, [[Benjamin Fondane]], [[Ion Marin Sadoveanu]], [[Armand Pascal]], [[Sandu Eliad]], [[Scarlat Callimachi (communist activist)|Scarlat Callimachi]], [[Dida Solomon]], [[George Ciprian]] and various authors affiliated with ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|pp=269–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing cultural historian [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]], Cernat also concludes that the branch of Expressionism favored by the company followed a distinct path, having its roots in [[Hasidic Judaism]].&lt;ref name=pc276&gt;{{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vilna Troupe was instantly made notorious by its staging of ''The Deluge'', a work by [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born dramatist [[Henning Berger]], which was positively reviewed by the prominent literary magazine ''Rampa''.&lt;ref name="potop"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr280_281/speciala6.pdf "''Potopul''—valuri, valuri" ("''The Deluge''—wave after wave")], ''Realitatea Evreiască'' nr. 280-81 (1080-81)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Deluge'' was a headliner by the company, until it was replaced by [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'' (August 1924)&lt;ref name="potop"/&gt; The artistic praise did not pay the bills, and touring elsewhere in Romania only made the financial picture worse. According to modernist author [[Mihail Sebastian]], the actors' commitment and the quality of the shows contrasted heavily with the venues they were touring. Sebastian referred to one of the latter as "once destined for Jewish [[pornography]]", and recounted how news of the Vilna Troupe "miracle" had spread by word of mouth.&lt;ref name="msvilna"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihail Sebastian, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr277/speciala7.pdf] "Atitudini. Trupa din Vilna se reîntoarce" ("Attitudes. The Vilna Troupe Is Back")], ''Realitatea Evreiască'' nr. 277 (p. 1077)&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was aggravated when the actors had to take a break from performing at the Jigniţa, following the death of its female owner, Sofia Lieblich. During that period, several actors left their temporary home in Romania, most of them settling in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="potop"/&gt;  

Their fortunes were salvaged by a 1925 production of [[Osip Dymov (writer)|Osip Dymov]]'s ''Der Zinger fun zayn troyer'' ("The Singer of His Sorrow"), created in collaboration with [[Jacob Sternberg]]'s troupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|p=128 ''et. seq.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Der Zinger…'' was another critical success: writer [[Victor Eftimiu]] called it "a model of stylized realist theater",&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|p=131}}; {{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; while dramatist [[Ion Marin Sadoveanu]] argued that it was comparable to "the best scenes" produced in [[France]] by the acclaimed director [[Jacques Copeau]].&lt;ref name=pc276/&gt; It was an unprecedented hit, and ran at length at Bucharest's Central Theater.&lt;ref name=Bercovici-131&gt; {{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their 40th show with the play, the actors were rewarded with portraits specially drawn by caricaturist [[Jacques Kapralik]].&lt;ref name="potop"/&gt; The company was by then also being reviewed by the modernist platform ''Integral'', and especially by its two main columnists, [[Ion Călugăru]] and [[M. H. Maxy]], both of whom later chose to become directly involved in its activities. Their initiative followed their dissatisfaction with the choice of ''Der Zinger fun zayn troyer'' and in particular with Joseph Buloff's directing: the magazine accused Buloff of having "abused color in order to complete a null text."&lt;ref name=pc276/&gt; For a while, Călugăru replaced Mazo as director of the troupe, while Maxy provided the [[scenic design]] for several productions.&lt;ref name=pc275/&gt;

The positive reception indirectly helped establish close cultural connections between the newly-[[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated]] [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian community]] and sections of the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] majority. Cernat notes that this was in glaring contrast to a parallel phenomenon, "the recrudescence of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] manifestations, particularly among the students".&lt;ref name=pc275/&gt; Solidarity with the company and the Jewish community at large was notably expressed by left-wingers such as Arghezi, [[Gala Galaction]], [[N. D. Cocea]] and ''Contimporanul'' editor [[Ion Vinea]].&lt;ref name=pc277&gt;{{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an article for the leftist magazine ''[[Lupta]]'', Victor Eftimiu also expressed his opinion that the cultural renaissance heralded by the Troupe could enforce cultural patriotism and nationalism among Romanian Jews, and thus make "Jewishness" prove itself more worthy than "the braggadocios" of other nationalist discourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|pp=276–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the [[Warsaw]] Yiddish-language ''Literarishe Bleter'' during the run of ''Der Zinger…'', Joseph Buloff was amazed at the positive reception that Yiddish theater received among the gentiles of Bucharest. Buloff noted that the Romanian actor [[Tanţi Cutava]] was equally comfortable acting in [[French language|French]] and Yiddish as in his native Romanian, that he often heard ethnic Romanians singing songs from the Yiddish theater over a glass of wine, and that Romanian writers and artists invited Yiddish actors to their get-togethers, all of which apparently formed a stark contrast to Warsaw at that time.&lt;ref name=Bercovici-131 /&gt; Following the November 1924 establishment of an ''Amicii teatrului evreiesc'' (''Friends of the Jewish Theatre'') association designed to help the troupe recover from its financial slump,&lt;ref name="potop"/&gt; several such clubs were set up by Jews and non-Jews in various Romanian localities.&lt;ref name=pc275/&gt;

The company also registered success when, in late 1925, it decided to reinstate ''The Deluge'' as its headliner. Apparently, the production was the work of several directors, and underwent significant changes from one staging to another, in both direction and assignment of roles.&lt;ref name="potop"/&gt; It earned further praise from critics, especially after Luba Kadison replaced Orleska in the play's sole female role. (Buloff and Leib Kadison, who had been assigned the title roles in the original variant, had by then withdrawn.)&lt;ref name="potop"/&gt; ''Der Zinger…'' and ''The Deluge'' were followed by successful Bucharest productions of [[David Pinsky]]'s ''Melech David un zaine Froien'' (''King David and His Women'') and Tolstoy's ''[[The Living Corpse]]''. Pressured, in part, by a 32% tax on performances by foreign troupes, by the end of 1925, the troupe had decided to reconstitute themselves as a Bucharest-based troupe, taking the Romanian-language name ''Dramă şi Comedie''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Dramă şi Comedie''==
"The wandering troupe from Vilna will stay put... after an era of prolonged touring", reported ''Integral''. "They will fix on a program, which will no longer oscillate between melodrama and an expressionist mural. Apparently, the prospect launched today is precise: a new group tending to go along the route of modern innovation. 'No compromise with lack of taste—no compromise with bad taste': a shout that justifies an existence and would be worthy of realization."&lt;ref&gt;''Integral'' nr. 6-7/1925, quoted in {{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998|pp=132–33}} Partly rendered in {{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "no compromise" slogan came from the statement of program, really more of an artistic [[manifesto]], with which the reconstituted group launched itself. The same document also declared the troupe's intent "to offer the masses and intellectuals simultaneously an institution of culture". The new troupe included such actors as Braz, Kadison, Lares, Orleska, Stein, Buloff, Kamen, Weislitz, Schäftel, and the Kadisons from the 1923 roster, plus Noemi Nathan, Joheved Weislitz,&lt;!--I presume this is a different person from Benjamin Ehrenkrantz --&gt; Jehuda Ehrenkranz, Samuel Irish, Simha Nathan, Sholom Schönbaum, Henry Tarlo, and Simi Weinstock.&lt;ref name=Bercovici&gt;
{{Harvnb|Bercovici|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Dramă şi Comedie would play only one full season of theater (1925–26), with some remnants struggling on another year. Their productions, beginning with [[Alter Kacyzne]]'s ''Ger tzedek'' ("The Neophyte") and including [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[Marriage (play)|Marriage]]'', were critically acclaimed, but never matched the commercial success of ''Der Zingher…''.&lt;ref name=Bercovici /&gt; Directed by Sternberg, and endorsed by writers Arghezi, [[Felix Aderca]] and [[Alfred Hefter|Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]], the ''Marriage'' production was also at the center of a dispute in the literary community, due to its innovative aesthetics. ''Integral'' reacted when some spoke of it as an example of the [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] "pure theatre" guidelines theorized by ''Contimporanul'', and instead explained it as an example of "synthetic" theatre.&lt;ref name=pc276/&gt; 

During that period, the staging of ''Ger tzedek'' was criticized by ''Contimporanul'' chronicler [[Sergiu Milorian]], who saw in it proof that traditional "Yiddishist" plays were "unperformable", while arguing that the contribution of painter Arthur Kolnik in "the science" of scenic design was the show's only merit.&lt;ref name=pc279&gt;{{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sudden and unexpected death of actress [[Judith Lares]], director Mazo left for Warsaw, and then Vilna. The troupe continued briefly with [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''Man, Beast, and Virtue'' in the 1926–27 season.&lt;ref name=Bercovici /&gt;

==Later years==
After the breakup of ''Dramă şi Comedie'', there were several revivals of the Vilna Troupe in [[New York City]] over the next decade or so. The first of these was a revival of ''The Dybbuk'' at the Grand Theater in April 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Untitled item, ''The New York Times'', April 7, 1926. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In late summer 1926 they were at the Liptzin Theater performing ''Rasputin and the Czarina''.&lt;ref&gt;"75 years ago", ''The Forward'', August 31, 2001; {{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/issues/2001/01.08.31/lookingback.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-01-23 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011107230731/http://www.forward.com/issues/2001/01.08.31/lookingback.html |archivedate=November 7, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 1929, they were playing [[Clement Gottesfeld]]'s ''Parnuse'' ("Business") in The Bronx, New York. The production moved in May to the Yiddish Folks Theater at [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]] and East 12th Street, near the center of New York's main [[Yiddish Theater District]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt; Advertisement, ''The New York Times'', March 2, 1929, p. 21 says they are performing at the Intimate Playhouse, 180th St. &amp; Boston Road in the Bronx. A further ad March 16, 1929, p. 24, quotes a testimonial from [[Eddie Cantor]]. "Theatrical Notes", May 16, 1929, p. 39, states that the production is moving to the "Yiddish Folks Theater".&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Jakob Rotbaum]] began his professional career staging [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s works with the troupe in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinlauf|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shows continued to be produced in Bucharest under the Vilna Troupe name even after 1927. Following the breakup of Dramă şi Comedie, a play ''The Flood'' was put on at the [[Baraşeum]] theater, which was loosely the story of the Vilna troupe.&lt;ref name=Bercovici /&gt; In a March 1929 article for ''[[Cuvântul]]'' newspaper, [[Mihail Sebastian]] announced that the company was returning to Bucharest.&lt;ref name="msvilna"/&gt; In early 1930, company actors also staged [[Isaac Leib Peretz]]'s ''A Night in the Old Marketplace'', later described by Crohmălniceanu as one of the "memorable dates in the history of European Yiddish theater", alongside 1925's ''Der Zingher fun Zain Troirer''.&lt;ref name=pc276/&gt; The production, directed by Sternberg, was the subject of a "literary trial" in the intellectual community: Sternberg's radical modernist approach was scrutinized by the more reserved authors [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], but their accusations were denied merit by a pro-avant-garde group comprising Maxy, [[Sandu Tudor]] and [[Ilarie Voronca]].&lt;ref name=pc277/&gt; References to the troupe and its role were also present in Maxy's overview of modernist performances in Romania, published by ''[[unu]]''&lt;!-- sic (no upper case initial) --&gt; magazine in February 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cernat|2007|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January of the following year, the fate of the company was also discussed by Sebastian, in his column for ''Cuvântul''. The writer, who had followed the Vilna Troupe's activities over the previous decade, was reviewing [[Joseph Kamen]]'s return to the Romanian stage with another group of actors. Remembering his impression of the original troupe's shows, Sebastian spoke of its "melancholic destiny": "ever since then, death, dissipation and perhaps fatigue have passed through all these things. [J]udith Lares, who sleeps her eternal sleep in some town in [[Transylvania]]. [Buloff], who confronts an infamous public in America.

The company disbanded again in 1931.&lt;ref name=Downes/&gt; Still, several members of the troupe continued on occasion to perform together in the United States. In September 1936, [[Sonia Alomis]], [[Alexander Asro]] and [[Noah Nachbush]] performed a program of short pieces at the [[New School for Social Research]], which ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "remind[ed] us that they are still an active force in [Jewish] theater."&lt;ref name="nytprog"&gt;W.S., "A Yiddish Program", ''The New York Times'', September 28, 1936, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Among the plays performed were Sholom Aleichem's ''Kapores'', [[Mikhail Artsybashev]]'s one-act ''Jealousy'', [[Yosef Tunkel|Der Tunkeler]]'s ''Should I Marry, or Shouldn't I?'', and Veviorke's ''A Philosopher—A Drunkard''.&lt;ref name="nytprog"/&gt; Several members of the troupe participated in a 1937 New York revival of ''The Dybbuk'', directed again by David Herman.&lt;ref name=Downes /&gt;

The Vilna Troupe's success with ''The Deluge'' had made various Romanian intellectuals seek to preserve the text in a Romanian-language translation. This was first attempted in 1928 by an author named Iosif Vanciu, but its staging by the [[National Theatre Cluj-Napoca|National Theatre Cluj]] received bad reviews. &lt;ref name="potop"/&gt; During the final stages of [[World War II]], following the [[King Michael Coup]] (August 23, 1944), the project was resumed by Baraşeum and Sebastian, resulting in a loose adaptation based not on Berger's original, but on the text as performed by the Vilna Troupe. In his stage program for the play, Sebastian offered additional praise to his predecessors, but noted that, although "excellent", the Vilna Troupe's text had to be adapted for being too "sketchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihail Sebastian, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr280_281/speciala4-5.pdf "''Potopul''.

'''''Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy''''' is a 1977 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[biographical film]] that originally aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Based upon the biography by [[Hank Searls]] called ''The Lost Prince: Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy'', the film chronicles the life of [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]], the older brother of [[John F. Kennedy]] who was killed in action in World War II, leaving behind aspirations to become the first Irish-Catholic president. ''Young Joe'' stars [[Peter Strauss]] in the titular role and was directed by [[Richard T. Heffron]].

==Production==
The production was filmed in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1aIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6-0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2005%2C4808375 "Peter Strauss stars in 'Young Joe'"], ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', June 17, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss, then highly popular due to his starring appearances in the television miniseries ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'', said he had turned down a million-dollar offer to continue with a third year of that miniseries before taking on the role of Joe Kennedy, and that he had researched it heavily.&lt;ref name="Deseret"&gt;Howard Pearson, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n61YAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d38DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7123%2C4881674 "A candid visit with Peter Strauss"], ''[[Deseret News]]'', June 17, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  The production received attention when it was discovered that Bill Foulon, an escaped convict from the [[Oregon State Penitentiary]], had managed to secure work as an [[Extra (acting)|extra]] on the film, and later (while still on the run) called the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' to talk about his experience.&lt;ref&gt;John Hurst, "Escaped convict got role in 'Young Joe'", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gy4dAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-Z0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6562%2C4719780 reprinted in] ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'', October 17, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U3lUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YY8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6847%2C652616 "Fugitive calls newspaper to discuss life, television role"], [[United Press International]] in ''[[Ellensburg Daily Record]]'', October 11, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X99NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3643%2C1890297 "Fugitive gets movie part"], ''[[The Free Lance–Star]]'', October 13, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews of the film were mixed.  ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' columnist Win Fanning gave it a strongly positive review, saying that Strauss had "acquitted himself brilliantly" in portraying Kennedy as a "driven young man".&lt;ref&gt;Win Fanning, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MUENAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UW0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6814%2C2581631 "Peter Strauss scores in 'Young Joe'"], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', September 20, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kay Gardella]] of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave it a moderately positive review, though she commented that Strauss, as Kennedy, had done a better job of "imitating Jack Kennedy" than [[Sam Chew Jr.|Sam Chew]], the actor who had actually played the future president.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kay Gardella]], "Peter Strauss stars in Kennedy drama", ''[[New York Daily News]]'', [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iSdUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B40DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5758%2C2218157 reprinted in] ''[[Boca Raton News]]'', September 16, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Chris Stoehr of ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' thought that Strauss had been "trapped" in a bad production with "unforgivably bad lines" and a failure to show the viewer Joe Kennedy's special qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Stoehr, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IXJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9BIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6841%2C3248236 "Peter Strauss Plays You Know Who For Who Knows Why"], ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', September 17, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Lawrence J. Quirk]] later summarized the film's reception as "respectful but yawning", and noted that it had been a disappointment for Strauss and several other actors who had seen it as a career opportunity when they joined the production.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence J. Quirk]], ''The Kennedys in Hollywood'' ([[Taylor Trade Publications]], 2004 ed., originally published 1996), {{ISBN|978-0815412960}}, p. 274.

==Awards==
''Young Joe'' received three nominations at the [[30th Primetime Emmy Awards|1978 Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Special - Drama or Comedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Roberts, ''Encyclopedia of Television Film Directors'' ([[Scarecrow Press]], 2009), {{ISBN|978-0810863781}}, p. 244.
