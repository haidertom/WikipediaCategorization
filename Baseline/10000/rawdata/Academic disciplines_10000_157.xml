      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">'''American political development''' (often abbreviated as '''APD''') is a subfield of [[political science]] that studies the historical development of [[politics in the United States]]. In American political science departments, it is considered a subfield within [[American political science|American politics]] and is closely linked to [[historical institutionalism]].

Scholarship in American political development focuses on "the causes, nature, and consequences of key transformative periods and central patterns in American political history."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersh|first=Rogan|date=2005-01-01|title=The Growth of American Political Development: The View from the Classroom|jstor=3688034|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=335–345|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Orren]] and [[Stephen Skowronek]], co-founders of the subfield's [[Studies in American Political Development|flagship journal]], define American political development as the study of "durable shifts in governing authority" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Search-American-Political-Development/dp/0521547644|title=The Search for American Political Development|date=2004-05-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521547642|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield emerged within [[American political science]] in the 1980s, alongside a general renewal of work in [[historical institutionalism]], as an "insurgent movement" that sought to refocus attention on the study of historical American politics and to use such historical study to recast the study of contemporary political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-21|chapter=Distinctiveness and Necessity of American Political Development |title=Oxford Handbook of American Political Development| editors=Richard M. Valelly, Suzanne Mettler, and [[Robert C. Lieberman]]|last=Mettler|first=Suzanne|last2=Valelly|first2=Richard|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.013.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APD shares overlaps with the research agendas of [[comparative politics]] (particularly [[Comparative historical research|comparative historical analysis]]), [[historical sociology]], and [[political history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/research/department-strengths/american-political-development.html|title=American Political Development: Department of Political Science - Northwestern University|website=www.polisci.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship in APD differs from political history in that the former's "primary concerns are analytical, conceptual, and theoretical rather than historical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-36|title=Qualitative Methods and American Political Development|last=Galvin|first=Daniel J.|date=2015-07-09|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodologically, the subfield tends to use within-case analysis and conduct causes-of-effects research (as opposed to effects-of-causes research).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Major journals in the subfield include the flagship journal ''[[Studies in American Political Development]]'', founded in 1986, and ''The Journal of Political History'', founded in 1989. As of 2005, the Politics and History section (founded in 1989) of the [[American Political Science Association]] was the eighth-largest in membership out of 35 total sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/section24|title= MEMBERSHIP &gt; Organized Sections by Title &gt; Politics and History (Section 24)|website=American Political Science Association|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1827">'''Aphelia''' (Greek, "plainness") is a rhetorical term that refers to the plainness of writing or speech.&lt;ref&gt;Lanham, Richard A. ''A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms''. 2nd ed. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991. 17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to explain or teach rather than to entertain or elicit an emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. "A Catalogue of Rhetorical and Other Literary Terms from American Literature and Oratory." ''Style'' 22 Dec. 1997: n. pag. Web. 29 Sep. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The sentence structure is typically both short in length and lacks "poetic and rhetorical adornment." &lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 139. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parataxis]] and [[asyndeton]] are also expected within the plain style. Writing or speech using aphelia may display a "right-branching" sentence structure for the most part; that is, the sentence will begin with an [[independent clause]] that will be followed by at least one [[dependent clause]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Brett. ''Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2005. 138. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*"In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar." — [[Herman Melville]], [[Moby-Dick]]
*"I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, but chuckled at heart." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Tell-Tale Heart]]
*"She presented all of the ordinary appearances of death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased." — [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[The Premature Burial]]

The '''Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca'''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.idiomas.uabjo.mx/linkInglesExtranjeros/uabjo.html THE “BENITO JUAREZ” AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITY OF OAXACA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230258/http://www.idiomas.uabjo.mx/linkInglesExtranjeros/uabjo.html |date=July 22, 2011 }}." Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca. Retrieved on March 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-es|'''Universidad Autónoma Benito Juárez de Oaxaca'''}}, '''UABJO''') is a [[public university]] located in the city of [[Oaxaca de Juárez]] in state of [[Oaxaca]], Mexico.

The University was founded on January 8, 1827 as the Oaxacan Institute for Arts and Sciences. Initially courses were offered in [[Medicine]], Surgery, Civil and [[Natural Law]], [[Public law|Public Law]], [[Canon Law]] and [[Ecclesiastical]] [[History]], Political Economy, Statistics, [[Geography]] and [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], [[Logic]], [[Ethics]], English, and French.&lt;ref name="Facultadde"&gt;[http://espanol-idiomas.uabjo.mx Facultad de Idiomas de la Universidad Autónoma "Benito Juárez" de Oaxaca]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In December 1943, governor Major General [[Vicente Gonzalez Fernandez]] decreed that the Institute of Arts and Sciences would be granted [[autonomy]]. Then on January 18, 1955 General [[Manuel Cabrera Carrasquedo]] enacted a law elevating the Institute to University status. The school then became known as Universidad Autónoma "Benito Juárez" de Oaxaca.  The university was named in honor of the full-blooded [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous national]] to become [[president of Mexico]], Oaxacan native [[Benito Juárez]] (March 21, 1806 – July 18, 1872).&lt;ref name="Facultadde" /&gt;

{{main article|2006 Oaxaca protests}}

In May 2006, a teachers' strike began in the [[Zócalo]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca]].  2006 was the 25th consecutive year that Oaxaca's teachers have struck. Previously, the protests had generally lasted for one to two weeks and had resulted in small raises for teachers.  The 2006 strike began in protest of the low funding for teachers and rural schools in the state, but was prompted to additionally call for the resignation of the state governor [[Ulises Ruiz Ortiz]] after 3000 police were sent to break up the occupation in the early morning of June 14, 2006.  A street battle lasted for several hours that day, resulting in more than one hundred hospitalizations but no fatalities.  Ortiz declared that he would not resign.

On November 2, 2006, [[Federal Preventative Police]] advanced on the University, occupied by students and displaced protesters from the [[Zocalo]].  Since the University is autonomous, the police are forbidden from entering the grounds, unless invited by the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6112142.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=More violence in Oaxaca protest|date=2006-11-03|accessdate=2011-03-02|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of protesters arrived in the following hours, surrounding the police and eventually forcing them to withdraw from the area surrounding the university. The [[Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca]] had received permission by the university rector to broadcast their messages through the university radio, which they used to criticise political parties, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] specifically. Opinions against the APPO were quickly taken off the air &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/145225.html|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)]]|title=Radio Universidad, voz estratégica de APPO|author=Morales, Alberto|date=2006-11-09|accessdate=2011-03-02|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After criticism by the private sector, political organizations and the press (specifically [[Grupo Formula]]'s news anchor [[Denise Maerker]]) for his remarks towards the APPO the rector declared that he had requested respect for the rights of students and faculty &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48536&amp;id_ejemplar=1276 |work=Noticias de Oaxaca |title=Exige rector de la UABJO a Segob se respeten garantías individuales |date=2006-11-08 |author=LUIS IGNACIO VELÁSQUEZ |accessdate=2011-03-02 |language=es |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021656/http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48536&amp;id_ejemplar=1276 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that an operational attempt by the Federal Police would not provide a solution to the issue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oloramitierra.com.mx/?mod=read&amp;sec=general&amp;id=9420&amp;titulo=Busca_el_rector_de_la_UABJO_reestablecer_actividades_en_Ciudad_Universitaria |title=Busca el rector de la UABJO reestablecer actividades en Ciudad Universitaria |work=Olor a Mi Tierra |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2011-03-02 |author=Staff |language=es |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930075218/http://www.oloramitierra.com.mx/?mod=read&amp;sec=general&amp;id=9420&amp;titulo=Busca_el_rector_de_la_UABJO_reestablecer_actividades_en_Ciudad_Universitaria |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
Through an agreement with the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM) the CEC (Center for Continuing Education) was established, that allows the university to offer additional baccalaureate degrees in conjunction with UNAM.

In 2001, the UABJO's School of Languages initiated a study abroad exchange program with the [[College of the Mainland]], in [[Texas City]], [[Texas]], United States.  This has led to increased exposure for the university as well as helped to further the mission of university's School of Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/62165/|work=[[Texas City Sun]]|title=COM to enter exchange agreement|author=Bernard, Lori|date=2004-03-18|accessdate=2011-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711071111/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/62165/|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/117939/|work=[[Galveston County Daily News]]|title=COM extends international agreement|author=Collette, Mark|date=2008-04-18|accessdate=2011-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711071118/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/117939/|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major turning point for Braille literacy was the passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], which moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire Braille-qualified teachers, Braille literacy has declined since the law took effect.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed, in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that have led 27 states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille.&lt;ref name="Ruby Riles" /&gt;

In 1998-99 there were approximately 55,200 legally blind children in the United States, but only 5,500 of them used braille as their primary reading medium.&lt;ref name=Blind1999&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a visually impaired child. A study conducted in the state of Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well as, if not better than, their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension.  In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44 percent of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77 percent unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print.&lt;ref name=Ph2004&gt;{{Citation

Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States {{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2018}}, 90 percent of those who are braille literate are employed. Among adults who do not know Braille, only 1 in 3 is employed.&lt;ref name="Ranalli2008"/&gt; Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows visually impaired children not only to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment, but also later in life as they enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Ruby Riles" /&gt;

== Programs ==

===Braille Instruction at Hadley===

Hadley is the largest educator of braille as well as the largest worldwide provider of distance education for people who are blind or visually impaired. Braille literacy has been a priority for Hadley since its founding in 1920, and to this day, braille courses are still the most popular. During the 2010 fiscal year, Hadley enrolled nearly 3,400 students in braille reading and writing courses alone (combined sighted and blind students). Hadley currently offers 14 braille courses taught by 11 highly trained instructors. Nine courses are focused on tactile learners, and Hadley also provides five courses for sighted individuals, including families and professionals in the field.

Hadley School has advanced the use of braille in a number of ways over the years, including being one of the first institutions to use the Thermoform Duplicator, which copies braille from paper to a Brailon (a sheet of durable plastic) and one of the first to use a computer-driven, high-speed braille printer. A longtime leader in braille production, Hadley produces more than 50,000 braille pages each year, supplementing mass brailling done offsite. For a modest fee, Hadley provides braille transcription services in accordance with the [[Braille Authority of North America]]. Transcribers are certified by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.

=== NLS Braille Certification Program ===

The [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] (NLS) of the [[Library of Congress]] has contracted with the [[National Federation of the Blind]] (NFB) to offer a certificate of proficiency for braille transcribers and proofreaders who are interested in working in their communities to produce Braille materials for blind people. Certified Braille volunteers transcribe material into Braille that is used by state departments of special education, NLS, and libraries that distribute books and magazines through the NLS program. These volunteers complete a detailed course of Braille transcribing and provide essential materials in the advancement of Braille literacy.&lt;ref name=Service2006&gt;{{Citation

 | year = 2006 | author = Service, National Library
 | journal = NLS Factsheets
 | issue = May | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NLS also offers a broad range of Braille literacy information and resources including braille books, software, and other material intended to assist with the production of braille. This information can be very helpful for family members, friends, and professionals who desire information about braille literacy. They provide educational resources for instructors who teach braille as well as those who are interested in learning to read and write Braille.

=== ReadBooks! Because Braille Matters ===

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083746/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/index.html ReadBooks!] program from [http://www.nbp.org National Braille Press] distributes free braille literacy bags in the U.S. and Canada to families with blind children, birth to age 7. The program introduces blind children to braille at the earliest age and encourages families to read print/braille books together. Since the inception of the program in 2001, over 9,000 braille literacy bags have been distributed in English or Spanish.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083746/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/index.html ReadBooks!] bags contain age-appropriate print-braille books; a primer for sighted parents to learn braille; tactile literacy objects/games; waxed string for drawing; and a guide for parents on why and how to read books with their young blind child. Print-braille books are standard print books, like ''Miss Nelson Is Missing'' or ''Corduroy'', with braille text added on transparent plastic sheets so everyone can read together. National Braille Press works with educators and early intervention professionals to identify families who could benefit from the book bags; [https://web.archive.org/web/20091001191130/http://www.nbp.org/ic/nbp/readbooks/request.html families can request their own bags]. There is increasing evidence that parental beliefs and attitudes about reading and the opportunities parents provide their children in reading can greatly influence children's reading development. Parents can help their children prepare by providing a braille-rich environment in the home.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justreadflorida.com/promote.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501005007/http://www.justreadflorida.com/promote.asp |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This program provides visually impaired children with books that have been printed in Braille. Children are able to follow along with the rest of their classmates when reading popular children's books in libraries, at home, or in a school environment. Dots for Tots provide an entire book kit that includes the children's book in braille, a tape with a professional descriptive narration with sound effects, and a set of three-dimensional toys that allow them to understand the importance of visualizing stories with their fingers.&lt;ref name=America&gt;{{Citation

=== Connecting the Dots ===

The [[American Foundation for the Blind]] (AFB) offers the Connecting the Dots resource for parents to promote early Braille literacy. The program provides a folder containing fact sheets about braille, resource lists, and information for parents about braille, organizations that promote braille literacy, sources of braille books and magazines, adapted materials, and other information intended to promote literacy development.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;{{Citation

=== Instant Access to Braille ===

The Instant Access to Braille program, supported through [[US Department of Education]] Office of [[Special Education]] Programs CFDA 84.00327A, provides blind and visually impaired students with access to learning materials in  braille to support braille literacy efforts in general education classrooms.  This program provides portable braille note-taking devices to students to train students as well as assist educators, parents, and school administrators overcome the barriers of teaching special needs children and ensuring that students receive the equivalent education opportunities that sighted children receive. The program also provides assistance with converting their printed learning materials into electronic format so that visually impaired students are not at disadvantaged in the school environment.

The Instant Access program is intended to assist students in grades 3-10 that use [[New York (state)|New York]] State curriculum and is focused on academics related mainly to [[Social Studies]]. There is no charge for the Braille note-taking devices, disk drives, printers or setup of the equipment. The program is a one-year school-based project and can be adjusted to take full advantage of features that will benefit the student and support the education process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">The '''Cerro de la Muerte Biological Station''' is one of the several field stations for biological research that exist in [[Costa Rica]].

Located at 3,200 m [[elevation]] (approximately 10,500 feet) on the southeastern slope of the Cerro Bellavista (one of the highest points in the ''[[Cordillera de Talamanca]]''), this is the biological station located at the highest elevation in Costa Rica and perhaps{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} in all of Central America.

Mr. Federico Valverde, the owner of the station is a former [[herpetologist]] from the [[University of Costa Rica]] who decided to protect these lands and offer them to the scientific community. For this reason, the station is only open for research and academic purposes. This offers an opportunity for scientists that are interested in studying the higher [[oak]] forests ranging from 3,100 – 3,400 m (approximately 10,000-11,000 feet) as well as the [[páramo]] ecosystem above the tree line.

The mission of the station is to protect the natural beauty of the páramo, to conduct long-term research on natural systems as part of a global effort to understand and preserve the Earth's biodiversity, and to increase appreciation of this effort through innovative, field-based educational programs for student of all levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerrodelamuerte.com Cerro de la Muerte Biological Station website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cerro de la Muerte Biological Station 1.gif|right|thumb|150px|Lichens at the station]]
The dominant tree species is ''Quercus costarricensis'', although many other trees, [[shrubs]] and [[vine]]s occur in the area. A number of vertebrates and insects can also be observed at this station. Currently there is data listing mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, [[algae]], [[Mycetozoa|myxomycetes]]&lt;ref&gt;Rojas C, Stephenson SL. 2007. Distribution and ecology of myxomycetes in the high-elevation oak forests of Cerro Bellavista, Costa Rica. Mycologia 99(4): 534.543&lt;/ref&gt; and [[plants]].

Researchers from all over the world visit this station every year. However, many United States' academic institutions come year after year with groups of students interested in tropical [[ecology]]. Some courses at the University of Costa Rica also offer field trips to this area.

The staff of the station take care of the visitors by providing them with the basic services offered in any other field station in the world. However, they are locally known for making their own [[hot sauce]].

Chengdu Panda Base was founded in 1987. It started with 6 giant pandas that were rescued from the wild.  By 2008, it had 124 panda births, and the captive panda population has grown to 83.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About Chengdu Panda Base|url=http://www.panda.org.cn/english/about/about/2013-09-11/2416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its stated goal is to "be a world-class research facility, conservation education center, and international educational tourism destination."&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Partnerships==
Chengdu Panda Base has partnered with many organizations in improving ways to conserve giant pandas.  For example, its partnership with [[Zoo Atlanta]] helped the zoo secure the loan of 2 giant pandas.&lt;ref name=atlanta&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoo Atlanta's Conservation Education Initiative in China|url=http://www.zooatlanta.org/conservation_education.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317023904/http://www.zooatlanta.org/conservation_education.htm|archivedate=2008-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, these 2 giant pandas, [[Yang Yang (Atlanta giant panda)|Yang Yang]] and [[Lun Lun]], have produced five off-spring: [[Mei Lan]] in 2006, [[Xi Lan]] in 2008, Po born on November 3, 2010 and Mei Lun and Mei Huan in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Giant Panda cub born at Zoo Atlanta|url=http://www.zooatlanta.com/zoo_news_panda_birth_2008.htm|publisher=Zoo Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoo Atlanta's Giant Panda Cub Is Named Xi Lan|url=http://www.zooatlanta.com/zoo_news_panda_xilan_name.htm|publisher=Zoo Atlanta|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010's only US giant panda cub born in Atlanta zoo|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/11/03/georgia.panda.cub/index.html?hpt=T2|publisher=CNN|date=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoo Atlanta and Dreamworks Animation Announce Panda Cub’s New Name|url=http://www.zooatlanta.org/home/article_content/pandacub_100day_po|publisher=Zoo Atlanta|date=February 15, 2011|access-date=2011-03-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GpWxxUN7?url=http://www.zooatlanta.org/home/article_content/pandacub_100day_po#|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nephology''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; from the Greek word ''nephos'' for 'cloud') is the study of [[cloud]]s and cloud formation. British meteorologist [[Luke Howard]] was a major researcher within this field, establishing a [[Cloud#Classification|cloud classification system]].

While this branch of [[meteorology]] still exists today, the term nephology, or nephologist is rarely used.  The term came into use at the end of the nineteenth century, and fell out of common use by the middle of the twentieth.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''community land trust''' ('''CLT''') is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing, community gardens, civic buildings, commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community. “CLTs” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability, economic diversity and local access to essential services.

== Historical overview ==
The community land trust (CLT) is a neutral and sustainable model of affordable housing and community development that has slowly spread throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom over the past 40 years. The model was originated in the United States by [[Ralph Borsodi]] and [[Robert Swann (land trust pioneer)|Robert Swann]], drawing upon earlier examples of planned communities on leased land including the [[Garden city movement]] in the United Kingdom, single tax communities in the US, [[Gramdan]] villages in India, and [[moshav]] communities on lands owned by the [[Jewish National Fund]] in Israel. [[New Communities]], Inc., the prototype for the modern-day community land trust, was formed in 1969 near [[Albany, Georgia]], by leaders of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] who were seeking a new way to achieve secure access to land for [[African American farmer]]s.

== History ==
According to the [[Schumacher Center for a New Economics]] website, "Swann was inspired by [[Ralph Borsodi]] and by Borsodi's work with [[J. P. Narayan]] and [[Vinoba Bhave]], both disciples of [[Gandhi]]. Vinoba walked from village to village in rural [[India]] in the 1950s and 1960s, gathering people together and asking those with more land than they needed to give a portion of it to their poorer sisters and brothers. The initiative was known as the [[Bhoodan]] or Land gift movement, and many of India's leaders participated in these walks.

Some of the new landowners, however, became discouraged. Without tools to work the land and seeds to plant it, without an affordable [[Credit (finance)|credit system]] available to purchase these necessary things, the land was useless to them. They soon sold their deeds back to the large landowners and left for the cities. Seeing this, Vinoba altered the Boodan system to a [[Gramdan]] or Village gift system. All donated land was subsequently held by the village itself. The village would then lease the land to those capable of working it. The lease expired if the land was unused. The Gramdan movement inspired a series of regional village land trusts that anticipated Community Land Trusts in the United States.

The first organization to be labeled with the term 'community land trust' in the U.S., called [[New Communities]], Inc., was founded with the purpose of helping [[African-American]] farmers in the rural South to gain access to farmland and to work it with security.

A precursor to this was the [[Celo Community]] in North Carolina, which was founded in 1937 by [[Arthur Ernest Morgan]].&lt;ref name=hicks&gt;Hicks, George L. Experimental Americans: Celo and Utopian Community in the Twentieth Century. University of Illinois Press: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Communities ===
{{Main|New Communities}}

Robert Swann worked with [[Slater King]], president of the [[Albany Movement]] and a cousin of [[Martin Luther King]], Jr., [[Charles Sherrod]], an organizer for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], his wife [[Shirley Sherrod]], and individuals from other southern civil rights organizations in the South to develop [[New Communities]], Inc., "a nonprofit organization to hold land in perpetual trust for the permanent use of rural communities".

Their vision for New Communities Inc. drew heavily on the example and experience of the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF) in making land available through 99-year ground leases for the development of planned communities and agricultural cooperatives.  The JNF was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in [[Ottoman Palestine]] (later Israel) for Jewish settlement.  By 2007, the JNF owned 13% of all the land in Israel.  It has a long and established legal history of leasing land to individuals, to [[cooperative]]s, and to [[intentional communities]] such as [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im. Swann, Slater King, Charles Sherrod, Faye Bennett, director of the National Sharecroppers Fund, and four other Southerners travelled to Israel in 1968 to learn more about ground leasing. They decided on a model that included individual leaseholds for [[homestead (buildings)|homesteads]] and [[cooperative]] leases for farmland. New Communities Inc. purchased a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm near [[Albany, Georgia]] in 1970, developed a plan for the land, and farmed it for 20 years. The land was eventually lost as a result of [[Pigford v. Glickman|USDA]] racial discrimination, but the example of New Communities inspired the formation of a dozen other rural community land trusts in the 1970s. It also inspired and informed the first book about community land trusts, produced by the International Independence Institute in 1972.

Ralph Borsodi, Robert Swann, and Erick Hansch founded the International Independence Institute in 1967 to provide training and technical assistance for rural development in the United States and other countries, drawing on the model of the Gramdan villages being developed in India. In 1972, Swann, Hansch, Shimon Gottschalk, and Ted Webster proposed a "new model for land tenure in America" in ''The Community Land Trust'', the first book to name and describe this new approach to the ownership of land, housing, and other buildings. One year later, they changed the name of the International Independence Institute to the Institute for Community Economics (ICE).

In the 1980s, ICE began popularizing a new notion of the CLT, applying the model for the first time to problems of affordable housing, gentrification, displacement, and neighborhood revitalization in urban areas. From 1980–1990, [[Chuck Matthei]], an activist with roots in the [[Catholic Worker movement]] and the [[peace movement]], served as Executive Director of ICE, then based in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], MA and now an affiliate of the National Housing Trust and located in [[Washington, DC]]. ICE pioneered the modern community land trust and community loan fund models. During Matthei's tenure, the number of community land trusts increased from a dozen to more than 100 groups in 23 states, creating many hundreds of permanently affordable housing units, as well as commercial and public service facilities. With colleagues Matthei guided the development of 25 regional loan funds and organized the National Association of Community Development Loan Funds, later known as the National Community Capital Association. From 1985–1990, Matthei served as a founding Chairman of the Association and from 1983–1988 he served as a founding board member of the [http://www.socialinvest.org/ Social Investment Forum], the national professional association in the field of socially responsible investment. Matthei also launched an effort in the early to mid-1980s to address many of the legal and operational questions about CLTs that were arising as banks, public officials and1 by an ecumenical association of churches and ministries created to prevent the displacement of low-income, African-American residents from their neighborhood. During the 1980s, the number of urban CLTs increased dramatically. They were sometimes formed, as in Cincinnati, in opposition to the plans and politics of municipal government. In other cities, like Burlington, Vermont and Syracuse, New York, community land trusts were formed in partnership with a local government. One of the most significant city-CLT partnerships was formed in 1989 when a CLT subsidiary of the Dudley Neighborhood Initiative was granted the power of eminent domain by the City of Boston. others encountered the growing effort to create such community-based organizations around the country.

The first urban CLT, the Community Land Cooperative of Cincinnati, was founded in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Land Cooperative of Cincinnati (CLCC) |url=https://community-wealth.org/content/community-land-cooperative-cincinnati-clcc|access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently over 250 community land trusts in the United States. In 2006, a national association was established in the United States to provide assistance and support for CLTs: the National Community Land Trust Network. Also established that year to serve as the Network’s training and research arm was the National CLT Academy. Fledgling CLT movements are also underway in England, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Kenya and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111127232235/http://www.communitylandtrusts.co.nz/ New Zealand]. Similar nationwide networks for promoting and supporting CLTs have recently been formed in the United Kingdom and in Australia.

[[File:Community Land Trusts.png|thumbnail|right|The basic mechanisms of community land trusts]]

== Defining features in the United States ==
Since 1992, the defining features of the CLT model in the United States have been enshrined in federal law ([[s:Housing and Community Development Act of 1992/Title II#Sec. 213. Housing Education and Organizational Support for Community Land Trusts.|Section 213, Housing and Community Development Act of 1992]]). There is considerable variation among the hundreds of organizations that call themselves a community land trust, but ten key features are to be found in most of them.

=== Nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation ===
A community land trust is an independent, nonprofit corporation that is legally chartered in the state in which it is located. Most CLTs are started from scratch, but some are grafted onto existing nonprofit corporations such as community development corporations. Most CLTs target their activities and resources toward charitable activities like providing housing for low-income people and redeveloping blighted neighborhoods, making them eligible to receive [[501(c)(3)]] designation from the IRS.

=== Dual ownership ===
A nonprofit corporation, the CLT, acquires multiple parcels of land throughout a targeted geographic area with the intention of retaining ownership of the parcels forever. Any building already located on the land or later constructed on the land can be held by the CLT or sold off to an individual homeowner, a [[Housing cooperative|cooperative housing corporation]], a nonprofit developer of rental housing, or some other nonprofit, governmental, or for-profit entity.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite news|title= Affordable Housing, Always|first= Alana |last= Semuels|work= [[The Atlantic]]|date= July 7, 2015| url= http://www.routefifty.com/2015/07/collective-land-ownership-cities/117061/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leased land ===
Although CLTs intend never to resell their land, they can provide for the exclusive use of their land by the owners of any buildings located thereon. Exclusive use of parcels of land can be conveyed to individual homeowners or to the owners of other types of residential or commercial structures by long-term ground leases. The two-party contract between the landowner (the CLT) and a building's owner protects the owner's interests in security, privacy, legacy, and equity and enforces the CLT's interests in preserving the appropriate use, the structural integrity and the continuing affordability of any buildings on its land.

=== Perpetual affordability ===
The CLT retains an option to repurchase any residential (or commercial) structures on its land if their owners ever choose to sell. The resale price is set by a formula contained in the ground lease that is designed to give present homeowners a fair return on their investment but giving future homebuyers fair access to housing at an affordable price. By design and by intent, the CLT is committed to preserving the affordability of housing (and other structures), one owner after another, one generation after another, in perpetuity.

=== Perpetual responsibility ===
The CLT does not disappear once a building is sold. As owner of the underlying land and as owner of an option to repurchase any buildings located on its land, the CLT has an abiding interest in what happens to the structures and to the people who occupy them. The ground lease requires owner-occupancy and responsible use of the premises. Should buildings become a hazard, the ground lease gives the CLT the right to step in and force repairs. Should property owners default on their mortgages, the ground lease gives the CLT the right to step in and cure the default, forestalling foreclosure. The CLT remains a party to the deal, safeguarding the structural integrity of the buildings and the residential security of the occupants.

=== Community base ===
The CLT operates within the physical boundaries of a targeted locality. It is guided by and accountable to the people who call the locale their home. Most commonly, any adult who resides on the CLT’s land and any adult who resides within the area deemed by the CLT to be its community can become a voting member of the CLT. The community may encompass a single neighborhood, multiple neighborhoods, or, in some cases, an entire town, city, or county.

=== Governance ===
Typically, CLTs are run by a [[board of directors]] whose members include three groups of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s: residents or leaseholders, people who reside within its targeted community but do not live on its land, and lastly the broader public interest. This third group is frequently represented by government officials, funders, housing agencies, and social service providers. Organization [[bylaws]] may designate each of these groups a specific and equal number of seats, and they may be elected separately by their constituent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-03-29/community-land-trust-models-housing-coops-around-world/ |quote=Like many other CLTs, the CHT has a governing board divided in thirds and elected by residents: one-third of its membership is constituted by CHT residents; another third from surrounding communities; and the final third is {{sic|comprised |hide=y}} of municipal officials and a regional representative who are presumed to speak for the public interest (in other CLTs this final third is often {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} technical specialists like engineers, accountants, planners, architects, social workers or lawyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=25330 |quote=CLT trusts are usually divided into thirds, where one third of the trust leadership is residents from the CLT community, one third is people from the neighborhood surrounding the CLT, and one third is made up of technical experts and municipal officials who provide particular expertise (legal, architectural, engineering, political, etc.) and speak in the general public interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prosper.org.au/2008/05/29/community-land-trusts-explained/ |quote=those representing resident members, those representing members who are not CLT residents, and those representing the broader community interest here members includes neighbors who are interested, supportive, or may become residents}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cltnetwork.org/faq/ |quote=CLTs are nonprofit organizations—governed by a board of CLT residents, community residents and public representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saratogacommunityhousing.org/what-is-a-community-land-trust/ |quote=residents of trust owned lands, other community members and public-interest representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Control of the CLT’s board is diffused and balanced to ensure that all interests are heard but that no interest predominates.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

=== Expansionist acquisition ===
CLTs are not focused on a single project located on a single parcel of land. They are committed to an active acquisition and development program aimed at expanding the CLT's holdings of land and increasing the supply of affordable housing (and other types of buildings) under the CLT's stewardship. A CLT's holdings are seldom concentrated in one corner of a community but tend to be scattered throughout its service area, indistinguishable from other owner-occupied housing in the same neighborhood.

== Flexible development ==
There is enormous variability in the types of projects that CLTs pursue and in the roles they play in developing them. Many CLTs do development with their own staff. Others delegate development to nonprofit or for-profit partners, confining their own efforts to assembling land and preserving the affordability of any structures located upon it. Some CLTs focus on a single type and tenure of housing, like detached, owner-occupied houses. Others take full advantage of the model’s unique flexibility. They develop housing of many types and tenures or they focus more broadly on comprehensive community development, undertaking a diverse array of residential and commercial projects. CLTs around the country have constructed (or acquired, rehabilitated, and resold) single-family homes, duplexes, condos, co-ops, SROs, multi-unit apartment buildings, and mobile home parks. CLTs have created facilities for neighborhood businesses, nonprofit organizations, and social service agencies. CLTs have provided sites for community gardens. vest-pocket parks, and affordable working land for entry-level agriculturalists. Permanently affordable access to land is the common ingredient, linking them all. The CLT is the social thread, connecting them all.

== Development elsewhere ==
Fledgling CLT movements are also underway in:

'''''Crash Test Danny''''' was a series of 13 educational science sketch television shows for the [[Discovery Kids]] channel in the UK.

Danny, played by Ben Langley, is a [[crash test dummy]] who goes the extra mile to put the fizz into [[physics]]. He is both motivated and hindered by the Professor, played by [[Gary Carpenter]] (who also co-wrote the program).

The shows were directed by Justin Rhodes, narrated by [[Jon Holmes]], and series produced by Mark Robson at Initial Television.

is a nascent movement in real estate development that preserves and invests in agricultural land use.  As farmland is lost due to the challenging economics of farming and the pressures of the real estate industry, DSA attempts to reconcile the need for development with the need to preserve agricultural land. The overall goal of DSA is to incubate small-scale organic farms that co-exist with residential land development, providing benefits to farmers, residents, the local community, and the environment.

A related term, ''agricultural urbanism'', refers to agricultural operations located in proximity to and integrated with urban areas.  The term of agricultural urbanism was coined by Mark Holland and Janine de la Salle, and is based on their book by the same name, published by Green Frigate Press in 2010 (De la Salle and Holland et al.).  The term and concept of Agricultural Urbanism was originally developed in British Columbia in 2008 during a planning process for a development project called Southlands in South Delta, Metro Vancouver and was introduced to planner, real estate developer, and founder of the New Urbanism movement, Andres Duany, as part of the preparation for a design charrette which Duany and his team were involved in. 

Two academics who authored a chapter (Patrick Condon from UBC and Kent Mulnix from Kwantlen Polytechnic) posited the original idea of using development to support agriculture by using mechanisms such as transferring density rights from agricultural land onto adjacent areas and preserving the agricultural land through covenants while harvesting the development land value in the adjacent area that received the transferred development rights. 

Andres Duany has been a significant proponent of the idea as well as the author of a similar stream of thought called Agrarain Urbanism.  Duany’s adoption of the concept has given it a higher profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawley|first=Steve|title=Agricultural Urbanism:Transects and Food Planning|url=http://www.houstontomorrow.org/initiatives/story/agricultural-urbanism/|publisher=HoustonTomorrow|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The term ''development-supported agriculture'' (DSA) was coined to describe the Harvest project. A variety of individuals collaborated on the project, including planner Duane Verner, developer Nathan Wieler, members of Piedmont Biofuels, participants in the Sustainable Agriculture program at Central Carolina Community College, and others. The group set out to determine the best usage for an existing farm that was being sold by the owner, a career farmer named Paul McCoy. It became clear that the group had an opportunity to create a unique residential community where farmers and residents have a symbiotic relationship. This relationship would benefit all involved, while also improving the general state of residential development and helping to reduce the ecological destruction associated with typical residential development models. Reynolds &amp; Jewell Landscape Architecture was retained to design the master plan for the community, and the team grew to include experienced organic farmers, experts on native plants, and others. As of July 2008, the developer is actively implementing the master plan, and response to the concept has been overwhelmingly positive.

==DSA and CSA==

Development-supported agriculture has its roots in the [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) movement. However, whereas CSA typically focuses on establishing a direct business relationship between consumers and farmers, DSA builds on a [[barter]] approach first and foremost, while also ensuring that products from DSA farms are integrated into the local economy. On a more general level, DSA is a response to concerns about the urbanization of agricultural land and an attempt to preserve existing farms. Another goal of DSA is to establish a new generation of farmers by using the revenue from real estate development to establish small-scale organic farms that are protected in perpetuity by conservation easements and property covenants.

== Five points of DSA ==

Development-supported agriculture is based on the concept of a master-planned residential development with farming as the central amenity. This model provides residents with the benefits of, and the opportunity to experience, small-scale organic farming. Property owners have the option of participating in the farming or leasing their land to a farmer; in either case, the farmland is protected from development. Homesites are restricted to certain areas and continuous areas of open space are maintained across multiple properties.

In the spirit of [[Le Corbusier| Le Corbusier's]] "Five Points of a New Architecture," DSA focuses on five core principles:

# Preservation of farmland through limited development and continuity of previous farming uses.
# Agreements between developers and farmers (development provides farm infrastructure, farmers provide farm products to residents and the local community).
# Low-impact development techniques, sustainable architecture, and careful ecological/environmental planning.
# Establishment of wildlife corridors and animal habitats, promotion of native plant species, and protection of water quality.
# Utilization of an open-source development model that provides a framework for master-planned farm communities and integrated local food systems.

== Examples ==

=== Developments in the urban-rural fringe ===

'''Harvest, North Carolina'''

Harvest&lt;ref&gt;http://wieler.com/communities/harvest/overview/&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} development introduced in 2008, sited in the [[New Hope River Valley]] in [[Chatham County, North Carolina]].  The development consists of 20 individual properties with an organic farm as the literal and metaphorical center of the community.  A farmbelt easement protects farmland and preserves rural views.

According to Paul McCoy, the previous owner of the land, the Harvest property had been used for farming since the American Revolution.  During the middle of the 20th century, the primary use of the farm was for growing tobacco.  In the late 20th century, the farm was used to grow a typical rotation of tobacco, corn, and soybeans. In 2008, the developer of Harvest began transitioning the farm from conventional operations to organic certification. The change from commercial (i.e. using pesticides) to organic farming will help protect the water quality of nearby Jordan Lake and the Haw River. 

'''Serenbe, Georgia'''

Another example of an urban-rural fringe project that fits into the DSA framework is [[Serenbe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serenbecommunity.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; This community is located on one of the last undeveloped parcels of land in the [[Atlanta]] area. The founders of Serenbe realized that their largely untouched {{convert|900|acre|km2}} presented a window of opportunity for creating a unique type of residential development. A {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} organic farm is located at Serenbe that provides organic produce throughout Atlanta and The Chattahoochee Hill Country. The {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of Serenbe lie in the heart of {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} protected with a master plan that calls for 80% green space. Building sites are limited to 220 structures, including live/work spaces and commercial buildings.

'''Middle Green Valley, Solano County, CA'''

One of the largest and most recent examples of development-supported agriculture is in Middle Green Valley in southwestern Solano County, California.  
The City of Fairfield to the south, and unincorporated Solano County to the north, have continued to entitle subdivisions while Green Valley has remained largely undeveloped agricultural land and open space.  Like many places at the edge of suburban boundaries, there has been a longstanding conflict between the open space desired by neighbors and development rights desired by landowners.  The landowners in this part of Green Valley have been under pressure to preserve the rural culture, even as the basic economics of agriculture have eroded the financial viability of their lands.  Usually, the only viable choice was to develop their property to realize economic benefit.  Many of the landowners, some whose families have cultivated the land for over 150 years, wished to realize the development value while at the same time maintain the integrity of the open space, agricultural productivity and the farming legacy.

In 2010, at significant cost and with no guarantee of success, the Solano County Board of Supervisors – with meaningful participation from landowners AND neighborhood groups – approved a Specific Plan for Middle Green Valley.  The final plan includes more than 1,400 acres of protected agricultural and open space and a small village of about 400 clustered homes that are shielded from the main views from Green Valley Road.  Over 15 different land owners covering almost 200 acres signed the Master Development Agreement putting this plan into place.  The entire Specific Plan can be obtained at: 

http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/rm/documents/eir/middle_green_valley_specific_plan.asp

Preserving the rural beauty and cultural legacy of the Green Valley area is the guiding vision in crafting a long term, equitable, and sustainable development plan. The Specific Plan celebrates and perpetuates the tradition of the working landscapes that characterize this part of Solano County for over 150 years. A core component is the promotion of sustainable food and agriculture systems as a means to connect agricultural lands, the built and natural environments, community health and natural resource stewardship.

The Green Valley Agricultural Conservancy

To provide assurances for the long-term preservation and management of the open space, the Middle Green Valley Specific Plan envisioned the creation of a non-profit Conservancy (the GVAC) to oversee the ±1,490 acres of productive agricultural land, pastures, and natural areas. The Conservancy has three primary areas of responsibility:

* Assisting and encouraging the farms in Green Valley;
* Overseeing the management, stewardship, enhancement, restoration and access easements for conservation lands; and
* Managing and developing a design review process for the community 

One of the first tangible initiatives by the Conservancy to promote and support local farmers and artisans has been the creation of Totally Local - a new Certified Farmers' Market (CFM) - that was started in July 2011. The Green Valley Farmers' Market provides a community gathering place to share a cup of coffee, meet the local farmers, taste some great local food, and simply have some conversation with neighbors. The Conservancy’s goal is not to compete with, but rather compliment the already established food stands and local artisans in the region to help provide a stable platform for featuring LOCAL agricultural and artisan products.

=== Urban agricultural developments ===

East Lake Commons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagehabitat.com/project_menu/east_lake/east_lake.htm&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} cohousing community planned by Village Habitat Design located {{convert|4|mi|km}} from downtown Atlanta.

Southeast False Creek and Olympic Village&lt;ref&gt;http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/&lt;/ref&gt; is an {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} sustainable development project near downtown [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] that includes an urban agriculture component.

=== Future possibilities: vertical farming ===

[[Vertical farming]], also known as skyfarming, is a conceptual form of agriculture done in urban high-rises. In these high-rises, food such as fruit, vegetables, fish, and livestock can be raised by using greenhouse growing methods and recycled resources year-round, allowing cities of the future to become self-sufficient. The concept of the vertical farm remains mostly hypothetical; however, many people believe that this type of development will become necessary as a result of increased [[urban density]] and rising energy costs.

'''Early Christian art and architecture''' or '''Paleochristian art''' is the art produced by [[Christian]]s or under Christian patronage from the [[Early Christianity|earliest period]] of [[Christianity]] to, depending on the definition used, sometime between 260 and 525. In practice, identifiably Christian art only survives from the 2nd century onwards.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=15–16}} After 550 at the latest, Christian art is classified as [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]], or of some other regional type.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=15–16}}&lt;ref&gt;van der Meer, F., 27 uses "roughly from 200 to 600".&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hard to know when distinctly [[Christian art]] began. Prior to 100, Christians may have been constrained by their position as a persecuted group from producing durable works of art. Since Christianity was largely a [[religion]] of the lower classes in this period,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} the lack of surviving art may reflect a lack of funds for [[patronage]], and simply small numbers of followers. The [[Old Testament]] restrictions against the production of graven (an idol or fetish carved in wood or stone) images (see also [[Idolatry and Christianity]]) may also have [[aniconism in Christianity|constrained Christians from producing art]]. Christians may have made or purchased art with [[paganism|pagan]] [[iconography]], but given it Christian meanings, as they later did.  If this happened, "Christian" art would not be immediately recognizable as such.

Early Christianity used the same artistic media as the surrounding pagan culture. These media included [[fresco]], [[mosaic]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. Early Christian art not only used [[Roman architecture|Roman]] forms, it also used Roman styles. Late classical style included a proportional portrayal of the human body and impressionistic presentation of space. Late classical style is seen in early Christian frescos, such as those in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], which include most examples of the earliest Christian art.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=10–14}}{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=30-32}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=12-15}}

Early Christian art and architecture adapted [[Roman art|Roman]] artistic motifs and gave new meanings to what had been pagan symbols. Among the motifs adopted were the [[peacock]], [[grape]]vines, and the "[[Good Shepherd]]". Early Christians also developed their own [[iconography]], for example, such symbols as the fish (''[[ikhthus]]''), were not borrowed from pagan iconography.

Early Christian art is generally divided into two periods by scholars: before and after either the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, bringing the so-called [[Triumph of the Church]] under [[Constantine I|Constantine]], or the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325.  The earlier period being called the Pre-Constantinian or [[Ante-Nicene Period]] and after being the period of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]].{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=16}} The end of the period of early Christian art, which is typically defined by art historians as being in the 5th–7th centuries, is thus a good deal later than the end of the period of early Christianity as typically defined by theologians and church historians, which is more often considered to end under Constantine, around 313–325.

{{See also|Christian symbolism#Early Christian symbols|l1=Early Christian symbols}}
During the [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire]], Christian art was necessarily and deliberately furtive and ambiguous, using imagery that was shared with pagan culture but had a special meaning for Christians. The earliest surviving Christian art comes from the late 2nd to early 4th centuries on the walls of Christian [[tomb]]s in the [[catacombs of Rome]].  From literary evidence, there may well have been panel [[icon]]s which, like almost all classical painting, have disappeared.  Initially Jesus was represented indirectly by [[pictogram]] symbols such as the ''[[Ichthys]]'' (fish), [[peacock]], [[Lamb of God]], or an anchor (the ''[[Labarum]]'' or ''Chi-Rho'' was a later development).  Later personified symbols were used, including [[Jonah]], whose three days in the belly of the whale pre-figured the interval between the death and [[resurrection of Jesus]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion's den, or [[Orpheus]]' charming the animals. The image of "[[The Good Shepherd (religion)|The Good Shepherd]]", a beardless youth in [[pastoral]] scenes collecting [[sheep]], was the most common of these images, and was probably not understood as a portrait of the historical Jesus.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=21-23}} These images bear some resemblance to depictions of ''kouros'' figures in Greco-Roman art.  The "almost total absence from Christian monuments of the period of persecutions of the plain, unadorned [[cross]]" except in the disguised form of the anchor,&lt;ref&gt;Marucchi, Orazio. "Archæology of the Cross and Crucifix." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 Sept. 2018 [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04517a.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt; is notable.  The Cross, symbolizing Jesus' crucifixion on a cross, was not represented explicitly for several centuries, possibly because crucifixion was a punishment meted out to common criminals, but also because literary sources noted that it was a symbol recognised as specifically Christian, as the [[sign of the cross]] was made by Christians from very early on.

The popular conception that the Christian catacombs were "secret" or had to hide their affiliation is probably wrong; catacombs were large-scale commercial enterprises, usually sited just off major roads to the city, whose existence was well known.  The inexplicit symbolic nature of many early Christian visual motifs may have had a function of discretion in other contexts, but on tombs they probably reflect a lack of any other repertoire of Christian iconography.{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=22}}

The dove is a symbol of peace and purity. It can be found with a halo or celestial light. In one of the earliest known Trinitarian images, "the Throne of God as a Trinitarian image" (a marble relief carved c. 400 CE in the collection of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation), the dove represents the Spirit. It is flying above an [[empty throne]] representing God, in the throne are a ''[[chlamys]]'' (cloak) and [[diadem]] representing the Son.  The [[Chi-Rho]] monogram, XP, apparently first used by [[Constantine I]], consists of the first two characters of the name 'Christos' in Greek.

==Christian art before 313==
[[File:Noah catacombe.jpg|thumb|[[Noah]] praying in the Ark, from a Roman catacomb]]

A general assumption that [[Aniconism in Christianity#Early Christianity|early Christianity was generally aniconic]], opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200, has been challenged by Paul Corby Finney's analysis of early Christian writing and material remains (1994).  This distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early Christians on the issue: "first that humans could have a direct vision of God; second that they could not; and, third, that although humans could see God they were best advised not to look, and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen".  These derived respectively from Greek and Near Eastern pagan religions, from Ancient Greek philosophy, and from the Jewish tradition and the Old Testament. Of the three, Finney concludes that "overall, Israel's aversion to sacred images influenced early Christianity considerably less than the Greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined", so placing less emphasis on the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish background]] of most of the first Christians than most traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, viii–xii, viii and xi quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Finney suggests that "the reasons for the non-appearance of Christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art, with other-worldliness, or with anti-materialism. The truth is simple and mundane: Christians lacked land and capital. Art requires both. As soon as they began to acquire land and capital, Christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art".&lt;ref&gt;Finney, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dura-Europos church]], of about 230–256, which is in the best condition of the surviving very early churches, there are frescos of biblical scenes including a figure of Jesus, as well as Christ as the [[Good Shepherd]].  The building was a normal house apparently converted to use as a church.{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 360}}&lt;ref&gt;Graydon F. Snyder, ''Ante pacem: archaeological evidence of church life before Constantine'', p. 134,  Mercer University Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swtI9Cpyl3kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Christian paintings in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] are from a few decades before, and these represent the largest body of examples of Christian art from the pre-Constantinian period, with hundreds of examples decorating tombs or family tomb-chambers. Many are simple symbols, but there are numerous figure paintings either showing [[orant]]s or female praying figures, usually representing the deceased person, or figures or shorthand scenes from the bible or Christian history.

The style of the catacomb paintings, and the entirety of many decorative elements, are effectively identical to those of the catacombs of other religious groups, whether conventional pagans following [[Ancient Roman religion]], or Jews or followers of the [[Roman mystery religion]]s.  The quality of the painting is low compared to the large houses of the rich, which provide the other main ''corpus'' of painting surviving from the period, but the shorthand depiction of figures can have an expressive charm.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=29-30}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=24}}{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=23–24}} A similar situation applies at [[Dura-Europos]], where the decoration of the church is comparable in style and quality to that of the (larger and more lavishly painted) [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] and the Temple of Bel. At least in such smaller places, it seems that the available artists were used by all religious groups. It may also have been the case that the painted chambers in the cattacombs were decorated in similar style to the best rooms of the homes of the better-off families buried in them,  with Christian scenes and symbols replacing those from mythology, literature, paganism and eroticism, although we lack the evidence to confirm this.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=10–11}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=10-15}}&lt;ref&gt;Balch, 183, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  We do have the same scenes on small pieces in media such as pottery or glass,{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 377}} though less often from this pre-Constantinian period.

There was a preference for what are sometimes called "abbreviated" representations, small groups of say one to four figures forming a single motif which could be easily recognised as representing a particular incident. These vignettes fitted the Roman style of room decoration, set in compartments in a scheme with a geometrical structure (see gallery below).{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}}  Biblical scenes of figures rescued from mortal danger were very popular; these represented both the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], through [[typology (theology)|typology]], and the salvation of the soul of the deceased. [[Jonah and the whale]],{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 365}}&lt;ref&gt;Balch, 41 and chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]], [[Noah]] praying in the Ark (represented as an orant in a large box, perhaps with a dove carrying a branch), [[Moses]] striking the rock, [[Daniel in the lion's den]] and the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Three Youths in the Fiery Furnace]] ({{Bibleref2c|Daniel|3:10–30|NIV|Daniel 3:10–30}}) were all favourites, that could be easily depicted.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=15-18}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|p=Chapte 3}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 360-407}}{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=21-24}}

[[Early Christian sarcophagi]] were a much more expensive option, made of marble and often heavily decorated with scenes in very [[high relief]], worked with drills. Free-standing statues that are unmistakably Christian are very rare, and never very large, as more common subjects such as the [[Good Shepherd]] were symbols appealing to several religious and philosophical groups, including Christians, and without context no affiliation can be given to them.  Typically sculptures, where they appear, are of rather high quality. One exceptional group that seems clearly Christian is known as the Cleveland Statuettes of Jonah and the Whale,{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=no. 362-367}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=396}} and consists of a group of small statuettes of about 270, including two busts of a young and fashionably dressed couple, from an unknown find-spot, possibly in modern Turkey.  The other figures tell the story of Jonah in four pieces, with a Good Shepherd; how they were displayed remains mysterious.{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=410}}

The [[depiction of Jesus]] was well-developed by the end of the pre-Constantinian period. He was typically shown in narrative scenes, with a preference for [[New Testament]] miracles, and few of scenes from his Passion.  A variety of different types of appearance were used, including the thin long-faced figure with long centrally-parted hair that was later to become the norm. But in the earliest images as many show a stocky and short-haired beardless figure in a short tunic, who can only be identified by his context. In many images of miracles Jesus carries a stick or wand, which he points at the subject of the miracle rather like a modern stage magician (though the wand is a good deal larger).

Saints are fairly often seen, with [[saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], both martyred in Rome, by some way the most common in the catacombs there. Both already have their distinctive appearances, retained throughout the history of Christian art. Other saints may not be identifiable unless labelled with an inscription.  In the same way some images may represent either the [[Last Supper]] or a contemporary [[agape feast]].

==Christian architecture after 313==
[[File:Santa Sabina.JPG|thumb|[[Santa Sabina]], Rome, interior (5th century).]]
:Main article: '''''Christianising the basilica''''' in '''''[[Basilica]]'''''

In the 4th century, the rapidly growing Christian population, now supported by the state, needed to build larger and grander public buildings for worship than the mostly discreet meeting places they had been using, which were typically in or among domestic buildings. Pagan temples remained in use for their original purposes for some time and, at least in Rome, even when deserted were shunned by Christians until the 6th or 7th centuries, when some were converted to churches.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=39}} Elsewhere this happened sooner.  Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable, not simply for their pagan associations, but because pagan cult and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a windowless backdrop.

The usable model at hand, when [[Constantine I (emperor)|Emperor Constantine I]] wanted to memorialize his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the [[basilica]].  There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a center nave with one aisle at each side, and an [[apse]] at one end opposite to the main door at the other. In, and often also in front of, the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed and the clergy officiated.  In secular buildings this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=40}} This was the normal pattern used for Roman churches, and generally in the Western Empire, but the Eastern Empire, and Roman Africa, were more adventurous, and their models were sometimes copied in the West, for example in [[Milan]].  All variations allowed natural light from windows high in the walls, a departure from the windowless sanctuaries of the temples of most previous religions, and this has remained a consistent feature of Christian [[church architecture]]. Formulas giving churches with a large central area were to become preferred in [[Byzantine architecture]], which developed styles of basilica with a dome early on.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|loc=chapter II, covers the whole story of the Christianization of the basilica.}}

A particular and short-lived type of building, using the same basilican form, was the '''funerary hall''', which was not a normal church, though the surviving examples long ago became regular churches, and they always offered funeral and memorial services, but a building erected in the Constantinian period as an indoor cemetery on a site connected with early Christian martyrs, such as a catacomb.  The six examples built by Constantine outside the walls of Rome are: [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]], the older basilica dedicated to [[Saint Agnes]] of which [[Santa Costanza]] is now the only remaining element, [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]], [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura]], [[Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano]], and one in the modern park of [[Villa Gordiani]].&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Matilda. ''The churches and catacombs of early Christian Rome: a comprehensive guide'', p. 251, 2001, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|1-902210-58-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-902210-58-2}}, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hUN1K78QMskC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=santa+costanza+rome&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g2NRTvayJMzD8QOjwNyvBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=santa%20costanza%20rome&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Martyrium (architecture)|martyrium]] was a building erected on a spot with particular significance, often over the burial of a martyr. No particular architectural form was associated with the type, and they were often small. Many became churches, or chapels in larger churches erected adjoining them.  With baptistries and mausolea, their often smaller size and different function made martyria suitable for architectural experimentation.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|loc=chapter III}}
  
Among the key buildings, not all surviving in their original form, are:
*Constantinian [[Basilicas]]:
**[[Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano|St. John Lateran]]
**[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|St Mary Major]]
**[[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]
**[[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]
**[[Church of the Nativity]]

==Christian art after 313==
[[File:1057 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Detail - cast of the central sections of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], with ''[[Traditio Legis]]'' and ''Jesus entering Jerusalem''.]]
With the final legalization of Christianity, the existing styles of Christian art continued to develop, and take on a more monumental and iconic character.  Before long very large Christian churches began to be constructed, and the majority of the rich elite adapted Christianity, and public and elite Christian art became grander to suit the new spaces and clients.

Although borrowings of motifs such as the [[Virgin and Child]] from pagan religious art had been pointed out as far back as the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[John Calvin]] and his followers gleefully used them as a stick with which to beat all Christian art, the belief of [[André Grabar]], [[Andreas Alföldi]], [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] and other early 20th-century art historians that Roman Imperial imagery was a much more significant influence "has become universally accepted".  A book by Thomas F. Mathews in 1994 attempted to overturn this thesis, very largely denying influence from Imperial iconography in favour of a range of other secular and religious influence, but was roughly handled by academic reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;The book was ''The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art'' by Thomas F. Mathews. Review by: W. Eugene Kleinbauer (quoted, from p. 937), ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937-941, Medieval Academy of America, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2865390 JSTOR]; JSTOR has other reviews, all with criticisms along similar lines: [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', Vol. 77, No. 3 (Sep., 1995), pp. 499–502;  RW. Eugene Kleinbauer, ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937–941 ,  Liz James, ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 136, No. 1096 (Jul., 1994), pp. 458–459;Annabel Wharton, ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 100, No. 5 (Dec., 1995), pp. 1518–1519 .&lt;/ref&gt;

More complex and expensive works are seen, as the wealthy gradually converted, and more theological complexity appears, as Christianity became subject to acrimonious doctrinal disputes. At the same time a very different type of art is found in the new public churches that were now being constructed.  Somewhat by accident, the best group of survivals of these is from Rome where, together with Constantinople and Jesusalem, they were presumably at their most magnificent. [[Mosaic]] now becomes important; fortunately this survives far better than [[fresco]], although it is vulnerable to well-meaning restoration and repair. It seems to have been an innovation of early Christian churches to put mosaics on the wall and use them for sacred subjects; previously the technique had essentially been used for floors and walls in gardens.  By the end of the period the style of gold background had developed that continued to characterize Byzantine images, and many [[Early Medieval]] Western ones.

With more space, narrative images containing many people develop in churches, and also begin to be seen in later catacomb paintings. Continuous rows of biblical scenes appear (rather high up) along the side walls of churches. The best-preserved 5th-century examples are the set of [[Old Testament]] scenes along the nave walls of  [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome.  These can be compared to the paintings of Dura-Europos, and probably also derive from a lost tradition of both Jewish and Christian illustrated manuscripts, as well as more general Roman precedents.{{sfn|Syndicus|1962|p=52-54}}{{sfn|Weitzmann|1979|p=366-369}} The large [[apse]]s contain images in an iconic style, which gradually developed to centre on a large figure, or later just the bust, of Christ, or later of the Virgin Mary. The earliest apses show a range of compositions that are new symbolic images of the Christian life and the Church.

No panel paintings, or "[[icon]]s" from before the 6th century have survived in anything like an original condition, but they were clearly produced, and becoming more important throughout this period.

Sculpture, all much smaller than lifesize, has survived in better quantities.  The most famous of a considerable number of surviving [[early Christian sarcophagi]] are perhaps the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] and [[Dogmatic sarcophagus]] of the 4th century.  A number of [[ivory carving]]s have survived, including the complex late-5th-century [[Brescia Casket]], probably a product of Saint [[Ambrose]]'s episcopate in [[Milan]], then the seat of the Imperial court, and the 6th-century [[Throne of Maximian]] from the Byzantine Italian capital of [[Ravenna]].

===Gold glass===
{{main article|Gold glass}}
[[Gold sandwich glass]] or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of [[gold leaf]] with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in [[Hellenistic glass]] and revived in the 3rd century.  There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish, and had probably originally been given as gifts on marriage, or festive occasions such as New Year.  Their [[iconography]] has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated.{{sfn|Beckwith|1979|p=25-26}} Their subjects are similar to the catacomb paintings, but with a difference balance including more portraiture of the deceased (usually, it is presumed).  The progression to an increased number of images of saints can be seen in them.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  The same technique began to be used for gold [[tesserae]] for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.

'''Ernest-Marie Laperrousaz''' (2 August 1924 – 20 August 2013) was a French historian and archaeologist. As an archaeologist he worked at [[Qumran]] and [[Masada]]. He has published numerous books including works on Qumran and the context of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

Laperrousaz is now ''professeur honoraire'' of the religious studies faculty of the [[École pratique des hautes études]] and was formerly the director of that institution. He was a resident at the [[École Biblique|École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem]]. He has long been acquainted with Qumran, having been a participant in the excavations directed by [[Roland de Vaux]] from 1953 to 1956. From 1970 to 1995 Laperrousaz continued an archaeological mission to Jerusalem and the Qumran area on a yearly basis. Always a strong believer in the [[Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Qumran–Essene Theory|Qumran-Essene hypothesis]], he differed with de Vaux over interpretations of the site of Qumran. His most influential work is ''Qoumran: L'Etablissement essénien des bord de la Mer Morte: Histoire et archéologie du site'', an independent study of the archaeology of Qumran.

'''''Fundamentals of Physics''''' is a [[calculus]]-based [[physics]] textbook by [[David Halliday (physicist)|David Halliday]], [[Robert Resnick]], and [[Jearl Walker]]. The textbook is currently in its tenth edition (published 2013). The current version is a revised version of the original 1960 textbook ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'' by Halliday and Resnick, which was published in two parts (Part I containing Chapters 1-25 and covering mechanics and thermodynamics; Part II containing Chapters 26-48 and covering electromagnetism, optics, and introducing quantum physics).  A 1966 revision of the first edition of Part I changed the title of the textbook to ''Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics'', Part I, rev. ed. (New York, London, and Sydney: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1966), pp. v-vi, and Resnick &amp; Halliday, ''Physics for Students of Science and Engineering'', Part II, 2nd ed. (New York and London: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1962), pp. xi-xv.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in [[college]]s as part of the [[undergraduate]] physics courses, and has been well known to [[science]] and [[engineering]] students for decades as "the gold standard" of [[freshman]]-level physics texts. In 2002, the [[American Physical Society]] named the work the most outstanding introductory physics text of the 20th century.

The first edition of the book to bear the title ''Fundamentals of Physics'', first published in 1981, was revised from the original text by [[Farrell Edwards]] and [[John J. Merrill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.physics.byu.edu/department/publications/merrill-0 Publications by John J. Merill], Brigham Young University&lt;/ref&gt; Walker has been the revising author since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://facultyprofile.csuohio.edu/csufacultyprofile/detail.cfm?FacultyID=HRW Jearl D Walker], Profile page at CSU Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="155769">A '''fuzzy concept''' is a [[concept]] of which the boundaries of application can vary considerably according to context or conditions, instead of being fixed once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This means the concept is [[Vagueness|vague]] in some way, lacking a fixed, precise meaning, without however being unclear or meaningless altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009; Delia Graff &amp; Timothy Williamson (eds.), ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a definite meaning, which can be made more precise only through further elaboration and specification - including a closer definition of the context in which the concept is used. The study of the characteristics of fuzzy concepts and fuzzy language is called ''fuzzy semantics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Williamson]], ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 124f; [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Quantitative fuzzy semantics". ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 2, April 1971, pp. 159-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of a "fuzzy concept" is a "crisp concept" (i.e. a precise concept). 

A fuzzy concept is understood by scientists as a concept which is "to an extent applicable" in a situation. That means the concept has ''gradations'' of significance or ''unsharp'' (variable) boundaries of application. A fuzzy statement is a statement which is true "to some extent", and that extent can often be represented by a scaled value. The best known example of a fuzzy concept around the world is an amber [[traffic light]], and indeed fuzzy concepts are widely used in traffic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sandeep Mehan &amp; Vandana Sharma, "Development of traffic light control system based on fuzzy logic".  ''ACAI '11 Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2011'', pp. 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used these days in a more general, popular sense - in contrast to its technical meaning - to refer to a concept which is "rather vague" for any kind of reason.

In the past, the very idea of reasoning with fuzzy concepts faced considerable resistance from academic elites. They did not want to endorse the use of imprecise concepts in research or argumentation. Yet although people might not be aware of it, the use of fuzzy concepts has risen gigantically in all walks of life from the 1970s onward. That is mainly due to advances in electronic engineering, fuzzy mathematics and digital computer programming. The new technology allows very complex inferences about "variations on a theme" to be anticipated and fixed in a program.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], ''Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic.'' New York: Hyperion, 1993; [[Bart Kosko]], ''Heaven in a chip: fuzzy visions of society and science in the digital age''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 1999; Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994. Charles Elkan, "The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic." ''IEEE Expert'', August 1994.[https://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/ElkanIEEEdiscussion.pdf] A useful overview of the field is provided in: Radim Bělohlávek, [[Joseph W. Dauben]] &amp; [[George J. Klir]], ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new [[neuro-fuzzy]] computational methods make it possible, to identify, to measure and respond to fine gradations of significance, with great precision.&lt;ref&gt;A useful overview is provided in: Enrique Ruspini et al. ''Handbook of fuzzy computation''. Bristol &amp; Philadelphia: Institute of Physics Publishing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It means that practically useful concepts can be coded and applied to all kinds of tasks, even if, ordinarily, these concepts are never precisely defined. Nowadays engineers, statisticians and programmers often represent fuzzy concepts mathematically, using fuzzy logic, fuzzy values, fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Behlohlavek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.), ''Concepts and fuzzy logic''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Problems of vagueness and fuzziness have probably always existed in human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising et al., ''On fuzziness: homage to Lotfi A. Zadeh'', Vol. 2. Heidelberg: Springer, 2013, p. 656; Ellen Christiaanse, "1.5 million years of information systems; from hunters-gatherers to the domestication of the networked computer". In: David Avison et al., ''The past and future of information systems: 1976-2006 and beyond''. New York: IFIP/Springer, 2006, pp. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between different things can appear blurry. Sometimes people have to think, when they are not in the best frame of mind to do it, or, they have to talk about something out there, which just isn't sharply defined. Across time, however, philosophers and scientists began to reflect about those kinds of problems, in much more systematic ways.

===Sorites paradox===
The ancient [[Sorites paradox]] first raised the logical problem of how we could exactly define the threshold at which a change in quantitative gradation turns into a qualitative or categorical difference.&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Keefe &amp; Peter Smith, ''Vagueness: a reader.'' Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; With some physical processes this threshold is relatively easy to identify. For example, water turns into steam at 100&amp;nbsp;°C or 212&amp;nbsp;°F (the boiling point depends partly on atmospheric pressure, which decreases at higher altitudes). 

With many other processes and gradations, however, the point of change is much more difficult to locate, and remains somewhat vague. Thus, the boundaries between qualitatively different things may be ''unsharp'': we know that there are boundaries, but we cannot define them exactly. 

According to the modern idea of the [[continuum fallacy]], the fact that a statement is to an extent vague, does not automatically mean that it is invalid. The problem then becomes one of how we could ascertain the kind of validity that the statement does have.

===Loki's wager===
The Nordic myth of [[Loki's wager]] suggested that concepts that lack precise meanings or precise boundaries of application cannot be usefully discussed at all.&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Pigliucci &amp; Maarten Boudry (eds.), ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem''. University of Chicago Press, 2013, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 20th century idea of "fuzzy concepts" proposes that "somewhat vague terms" can be operated with, since we can explicate and define the variability of their application, by assigning numbers to gradations of applicability. This idea sounds simple enough, but it had large implications.

===Precursors===
The intellectual origins of the species of fuzzy concepts as a logical category have been traced back to a diversity of famous and less well-known thinkers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; including (among many others) [[Eubulides]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Nuzzo, "Vagueness and Meaning Variance in Hegel’s Logic". In: Angelica Nuzzo, ''Hegel and the analytical tradition''. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, pp. 61-82.

''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' (''PNAS''), Vol. 97 No. 23, 7 November 2000, pp. 12926-12931.[http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12926.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Hugh MacColl]],&lt;ref&gt;S.

In: Jan Łukasiewicz, ''Selected Works''. Amsterdam: North Holland Publishing Company, 1970, pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Leon Post]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Leon Post]], "Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions". ''American Journal of Mathematics'', Vol. 43, No. 3, July 1921, p. 163-185.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Tarski]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski]], ''Logic, semantics, metamathematics''.

''Studies in Soviet Thought'', Vol.39 No. 3, 1990, pp.333-341.[http://staff.ulsu.ru/bazhanov/russian/fatevas1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Stanisław Jaśkowski]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]] notes that [[Stanisław Jaśkowski]] provided axiomatizations of many-valued logics in:  Jaśkowski, "On the rules of supposition in formal logic". ''Studia Logica'' No. 1, 1934.[http://www.logik.ch/daten/jaskowski.pdf] See Susan Haack, ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Priyanka Kaushal, Neeraj Mohan and Parvinder S. Sandhu, "Relevancy of Fuzzy Concept in Mathematics". ''International Journal of Innovation, Management and Technology'', Vol. 1, No. 3, August 2010.[http://ijimt.org/papers/58-M450.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Across at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with "fuzzy" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few logicians and philosophers have also tried to ''analyze'' the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of [[many-valued logic]] or [[substructural logic]].

An early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a theory of sets where set membership is a matter of degree was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott measured the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Kaplan and Hermann F. Schott, "A calculus for empirical classes", ''Methodos'', Vol. 3, 1951, pp. 165–188.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, their idea "fell on stony ground".&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating "many-valued sets".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Barkley Rosser|J. Barkley Rosser Sr.]] and Atwell R. Turquette, ''Many-valued logics''. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, 1952, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Another treatise was published in 1963 by Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev and others&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr A. Zinov'ev, David Dinsmore Comey and Guido Küng, ''Philosophical problems of many-valued logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the American philosopher [[William Alston]] introduced the term "degree vagueness" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to "combinatory vagueness" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application).&lt;ref&gt;William P. Alston, ''Philosophy of Language''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1964, p. 87; William P. Alston, “Vagueness,” in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 8. New York: Macmillan, first edition 1967, pp. 218–221; William P. Alston, ''A Realist Conception of Truth''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996 p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German mathematician Dieter Klaua [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Klaua] published a German-language paper on fuzzy sets in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Klaua. "Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre". ''Monatsberichte der Deutschen Akademie der Wissenschaften'' (Berlin), Vol. 7, pp. 859–867, 1965. Siegfried Gottwald, "An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems''. Vol. 161 Issue 18, September 2010, pp. 2369–2379.&lt;/ref&gt; but he used a different terminology (he referred to "many-valued sets", not "fuzzy sets").&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Gottwald, "Shaping the logic of fuzzy set theory". In: Cintula, Petr et al. (eds.), ''Witnessed years. Essays in honour of Petr Hájek''. London: College Publications, 2009, pp. 193–208. [http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/gottwald/Hajek09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two popular introductions to many-valued logic in the late 1960s were by Robert J. Ackermann and [[Nicholas Rescher]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Robert John Ackermann, ''An introduction to many-valued logics''. London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1967; Nicholas Rescher, ''Many-Valued Logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Rescher’s book includes a bibliography on fuzzy theory up to 1965, which was extended by Robert Wolf for 1966-1974.&lt;ref&gt; Robert G. Wolf, “A survey of many-valued logic (1966–1974)”, in: J. Michael Dunn and George Epstein (eds.), ''Modern Uses of Multiple-Valued Logic''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1977, 167–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Haack provides references to significant works after 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic: beyond the formalism''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergmann provides a more recent (2008) introduction to fuzzy reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Merrie  Bergmann, ''An  Introduction  to  Many-Valued  and  Fuzzy  Logic: Semantics, Algebras, and Derivation Systems''. Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotfi Zadeh===
Usually the Iranian-born American computer scientist [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] (1921-2017) is credited with inventing the specific idea of a "fuzzy concept" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he gave a formal mathematical presentation of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Fuzzy sets". In: ''Information and Control'', Vol. 8, June 1965, pp. 338–353.{{cite web|url=http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127005930/http://www-bisc.cs.berkeley.edu/Zadeh-1965.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-27 |df= See also A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Zadeh who played a decisive role in developing the field of fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, with a large number of scholarly papers.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017. Lotfi A Zadeh with George J. Klir and Bo Yua, ''Fuzzy Sets, Fuzzy Logic, and Fuzzy Systems: Selected Papers''. Singapore and River Edge (N.J.): World Scientific Publishing Company, 1996. This last title includes a bibliography of Zadeh's writings up to 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most philosophical theories of vagueness, Zadeh's engineering approach had the advantage that it could be directly applied to computer programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "Cybernetics, system(s) theory, information theory and Fuzzy Sets and Systems in the 1950s and 1960s". ''Information Sciences'' No. 180, 2010, pp. 4459-4476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zadeh's seminal 1965 paper is acknowledged to be one of the most-cited scholarly articles in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013 [http://isdlab.ie.ntnu.edu.tw/ntust/ifsa/files/newsletter/Vol10/IFSAnewsletterV10N1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was placed 46th in the list of the world's 100 most-cited research papers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Noorden, Brendan Maher &amp; Regina Nuzzo, "The top 100 papers". ''Nature'', 29 October 2014.[https://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1960s, many scholars have contributed to elaborating the theory of reasoning with graded concepts, and the research field continues to expand.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben &amp; George J. Klir, ''Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective''. Oxford University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ordinary scholarly definition of a concept as "fuzzy" has been in use from the 1970s onward.

===Criteria===
Radim Bělohlávek explains:

{{Quotation|"There exists strong evidence, established in the 1970s in the psychology of concepts... that human concepts have a graded structure in that whether or not a concept applies to a given object is a matter of degree, rather than a yes-or-no question, and that people are capable of working with the degrees in a consistent way. This finding is intuitively quite appealing, because people say "this product is more or less good" or "to a certain degree, he is a good athlete", implying the graded structure of concepts. In his classic paper, Zadeh called the concepts with a graded structure ''fuzzy concepts'' and argued that these concepts are a rule rather than an exception when it comes to how people communicate knowledge. Moreover, he argued that to model such concepts mathematically is important for the tasks of control, decision making, pattern recognition, and the like. Zadeh proposed the notion of a ''[[fuzzy set]]'' that gave birth to the field of ''[[fuzzy logic]]''..."&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice? II", in: Sergei O. Kuznetsov et al. (eds.), ''Rough sets, fuzzy sets, data mining and granular computing.'' Berlin: Springer Verlag, 2011, pp. 19–20.[http://belohlavek.inf.upol.cz/publications/BeVy_Wifcl.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hence, a concept is generally regarded as "fuzzy" in a logical sense if:
*defining characteristics of the concept apply to it "to a certain degree or extent" (or, more unusually, "with a certain magnitude of likelihood").&lt;ref&gt;The vast majority of scientific or scholarly users of the idea of fuzzy concepts refer to scaled (graded)  characteristics, and not to the variations in the ''likelihoods'' of their applicability.&lt;/ref&gt;
*or, the boundaries of applicability (the truth-value) of a concept can vary in degrees, according to different conditions. 
*or, the fuzzy concept itself straightforwardly consists of a [[fuzzy set]], or a combination of such sets.

The fact that a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical reasoning; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see [[fuzzy logic]]). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, it is necessary to specify and formalize what those gradations are, if they can make an important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but they can often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other [[substructural logic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Galatos, Peter Jipsen, Tomasz Kowalski &amp; Hiroakira Ono, ''Residuated lattices: an algebraic glimpse at [[substructural logics]].'' Elsevier Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables - in theory, at least - the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule.

===Probability===
[[Petr Hájek]], writing about the foundations of fuzzy logic, sharply distinguished between "fuzziness" and "uncertainty":

{{Quotation|"The sentence "The patient is young" is true to some degree – the lower the age of the patient (measured e.g. in years), the more the sentence is true. Truth of a fuzzy proposition is a matter of degree. I recommend to everybody interested in fuzzy logic that they sharply distinguish fuzziness from uncertainty as a degree of belief (e.g. probability). Compare the last proposition with the proposition "The patient will survive next week". This may well be considered as a crisp proposition which is either (absolutely) true or (absolutely) false; but we do not know which is the case. We may have some probability (chance, degree of belief) that the sentence is true; but probability is not a degree of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], ''Metamathematics of fuzzy logic''. Dordrecht: Springer, 1998, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), it is acknowledged that for any measure we care to make, there exists an [[Measurement uncertainty|amount of uncertainty]] about its accuracy, but this degree of uncertainty is conventionally expressed with a magnitude of likelihood, and not as a degree of truth. In 1975, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] introduced a distinction between "Type 1 fuzzy sets" without uncertainty and "[[Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems|Type 2 fuzzy sets]]" with uncertainty, which has been widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning–1", ''Information Sciences'', Vol. 8, pp. 199–249, 1975. Jerry M. Mendel and Robert I. Bob John, "Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Made Simple." ''IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems'', Vol. 10, No. 2, April 2002, pp. 117-127. Jerry M. Mendel, "Advances in type-2 fuzzy sets and systems". In: ''Information Sciences'' 177, 2007, pp. 84–110.[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.466.477&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, in the former case, each fuzzy number is linked to a non-fuzzy (natural) number, while in the latter case, each fuzzy number is linked to another fuzzy number.

==Applications==
===Philosophy===
In philosophical [[logic]] and linguistics, fuzzy concepts are often regarded as vague concepts which in their application, or formally speaking, are neither completely true nor completely false, or which are partly true and partly false; they are ideas which require further elaboration, specification or qualification to understand their applicability (the conditions under which they truly make sense).&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Graff Fara]], "Shifting Sands: An Interest Relative Theory of Vagueness". ''Philosophical Topics'', Vol. 28 No. 1, 2000, pp. 45-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The "fuzzy area" can also refer simply to a ''residual'' number of cases which cannot be allocated to a known and identifiable group, class or set if strict criteria are used.

===Sciences===
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], a fuzzy variable (such as "the temperature", "hot" or "cold") is a value which could lie in a probable [[Range (mathematics)|range]] defined by some quantitative limits or [[parameters]], and which can be usefully described with imprecise categories (such as "high", "medium" or "low") using some kind of [[Level of measurement|scale]] or conceptual hierarchy.

===Fuzzy logic===
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}
In mathematics and [[computer science]], the gradations of applicable meaning of a fuzzy concept are described in terms of ''quantitative'' relationships defined by logical operators. Such an approach is sometimes called "degree-theoretic semantics" by logicians and philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook, ''A dictionary of philosophical logic''. Edinburgh University Press, 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; but the more usual term is [[fuzzy logic]] or [[many-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher]], ''Many-valued logic''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fuzzy logic is, that it "breaks with the traditional principle that [[formal system|formalisation]] should correct and avoid, but not compromise with, vagueness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea of fuzzy logic is that a real number is assigned to each statement written in a language, within a range from 0 to 1, where 1 means that the statement is completely true, and 0 means that the statement is completely false, while values less than 1 but greater than 0 represent that the statements are "partly true", to a given, quantifiable extent. [[Susan Haack]] comments:

{{Quotation|"Whereas in classical set theory an object either is or is not a member of a given set, in fuzzy set theory membership is a matter of degree; the degree of membership of an object in a fuzzy set is represented by some real number between 0 and 1, with 0 denoting ''no'' membership and 1 ''full'' membership."&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack]], ''Philosophy of Logics''. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

"Truth" in this mathematical context usually means simply that "something is the case", or that "something is applicable". This makes it possible to analyze a distribution of statements for their truth-content, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions, and model how processes operate. 

[[Petr Hájek]] claimed that "fuzzy logic is not just some "applied logic", but may bring "new light to classical logical problems", and therefore might be well classified as a distinct branch of "philosophical logic" similar to e.g. [[Modal logic|modal logics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petr Hájek]], "Ten questions and one problem on fuzzy logic". ''Annals of Pure and Applied Logic'', Vol. 96, Issues 1-3, March 1999, 157-165, at p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machinery &amp; analytics===

Fuzzy logic offers computationally-oriented systems of concepts and methods, to formalize types of reasoning which are ordinarily approximate only, and not exact. In principle, this allows us to give a definite, precise answer to the question, "To what extent is something the case?", or, "To what extent is something applicable?". Via a series of switches, this kind of reasoning can be built into electronic devices. That was already happening before fuzzy logic was invented, but using fuzzy logic in modelling has become an important aid in design, which creates many new technical possibilities.

Fuzzy reasoning (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) turns out to have many practical uses.&lt;ref&gt;Kazuo Tanaka, ''An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic for Practical Applications''.

Humberto Bustince et al. (eds.), ''Fuzzy Sets and Their Extensions: Representation, Aggregation and Models. Intelligent Systems from Decision Making to Data Mining, Web Intelligence and Computer Vision.''  Berlin: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nowadays widely used in:

It looks like fuzzy logic will eventually be applied in almost every aspect of life, even if people are not aware of it, and in that sense fuzzy logic is an astonishingly successful invention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldengooseaward.org/awardees/fuzzy-logic "2017 Golden Goose Awardee: Fuzzy Logic, Clear Impact"]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific and engineering literature on the subject is constantly increasing.

===Community===
Originally lot of research on fuzzy logic was done by Japanese pioneers inventing new machinery, electronic equipment and appliances (see also [[Fuzzy control system]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michio Sugeno (ed.), ''Industrial applications of fuzzy control''. Amsterdam: North Holland, 1992; Andrew Pollack, "Technology; Fuzzy Logic For Computers". ''New York Times'', 11 October 1984; Andrew Pollack, "Fuzzy Computer Theory: How to Mimic the Mind?" ''New York Times'', 2 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea became so popular in Japan, that the English word entered Japanese language (ファジィ概念). "Fuzzy theory" (ファジー理論) is a recognized field in Japanese scientific research.

Since that time, the movement has spread worldwide; nearly every country nowadays has its own fuzzy systems association, although some are larger and more developed than others. In some cases, the local body is a branch of an international one. In other cases, the fuzzy systems program falls under [[artificial intelligence]] or [[soft computing]].

===Achievements===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] estimated around 2014 that there were more than 50,000 fuzzy logic–related, patented inventions. He listed 28 journals at that time dealing with fuzzy reasoning, and 21 journal titles on [[soft computing]]. His searches found close to 100,000 publications with the word "fuzzy" in their titles, but perhaps there are even 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Factual Information about the Impact of Fuzzy Logic". Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing, at Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department, University of Berkeley, California, circa 2014.[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/stimfl.html] For more details about the global fuzzy logic community, see [http://users.abo.fi/rfuller/fuzs.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, [[Google Scholar]] found 2,870,000 titles which included the word "fuzzy". When he died on 11 September 2017 at age 96, Professor Zadeh had received more than 50 engineering and academic awards, in recognition of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Cade Metz, "Lotfi Zadeh, Father of Mathematical ‘Fuzzy Logic,’ Dies at 96." ''New York Times'', 11 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lattices and big data sets==
The technique of fuzzy concept lattices is increasingly used in programming for the formatting, relating and analysis of fuzzy data sets.

===Concept formalization===
According to the computer scientist Andrei Popescu at [[Middlesex University London]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Popescu, "A general approach to fuzzy concepts". ''Mathematical Logic Quarterly'' Vol. 50, No. 3, 2005, pp. 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept can be operationally defined to consist of: 
*an ''intent'', which is a description or specification stated in a language, 
*an ''extent'', which is the collection of all the objects to which the description refers, 
*a ''context'', which is stated by: (i) the universe of all possible objects, (ii) the universe of all possible attributes of objects, and (iii) the logical definition of the relation whereby an object possesses an attribute. 

Once the context is defined, we can specify relationships of sets of objects with sets of attributes which they do, or do not share.

===Fuzzy concept lattice===
Whether an object belongs to a concept, and whether an object does, or does not have an attribute, can often be a matter of degree. Thus, for example, "many attributes are fuzzy rather than crisp".&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek and Vilem Vychodil, "What is a fuzzy concept lattice?" Department of Computer Science, Palacky University, Olomouc, 2005.[http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-162/paper2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome this issue, a numerical value is assigned to each attribute along a scale, and the results are placed in a table which links each assigned object-value within the given range to a numerical value denoting a given degree of applicability.

This is the basic idea of a "fuzzy concept lattice", which can also be graphed; different fuzzy concept lattices can be connected to each other as well (for example, in "[[fuzzy clustering|fuzzy conceptual clustering]]" techniques used to group data, originally invented by [http://dblp2.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/r/Ruspini:Enrique_H= Enrique H. Ruspini]). Fuzzy concept lattices are a useful programming tool for the exploratory analysis of [[big data]], for example in cases where sets of linked behavioural responses are broadly similar, but can nevertheless vary in important ways, within certain limits. It can help to find out what the structure and dimensions are, of a behaviour that occurs with an important but limited amount of variation in a large population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compasss.org/index.htm See further the COMPASSS site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big data===
Coding with fuzzy lattices can be useful, for instance, in the [[psephological]] analysis of [[big data]] about voter behaviour, where researchers want to explore the characteristics and associations involved in "somewhat vague" opinions; gradations in voter attitudes; and variability in voter behaviour (or personal characteristics) within a set of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kreiss, ''Prototype Politics: Technology-Intensive Campaigning and the Data of Democracy''.

Very large quantities of data can now be explored using computers with fuzzy logic programming&lt;ref&gt;For example, Kyle C. Longest and Stephen Vaisey, "Fuzzy: A program for Performing Qualitative Comparative Analyses (QCA) in Stata." ''Stata Journal'', Vol. 8 No. 1, 2008: pp. 79–104. Gregory Viot, "Fuzzy logic in C". ''Dr Dobb's journal'', 1 February 1993.[http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/fuzzy-logic-in-c/184408940]&lt;/ref&gt; and open-source architectures such as [[Apache Hadoop]], [[Apache Spark]], and [[MongoDB]]. One author claimed in 2016 that it is now possible to obtain, link and analyze "400 data points" for each voter in a population, using [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] systems (a "data point" is a number linked to one or more categories, which represents a characteristic).&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger, "Big-Data Analytics Plays Big Role in 2016 Election Campaigns". ''eWeek'', 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[NBC News]] reported in 2016 that the Anglo-American firm [[Cambridge Analytica]] which profiled voters for [[Donald Trump]] ([[Steve Bannon]] was a board member)&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth P. Vogel, "The heiress quietly shaping Trump’s operation." ''Politico.com'', 21 November 2016.[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/rebekah-mercer-donald-trump-231693]&lt;/ref&gt; did not have 400, but 4,000 data points for each of 230 million US adults.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brannely, "Trump Campaign Pays Millions to Overseas Big Data Firm." NBC News, 4 November 2016.[http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321]&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Analytica's own website claimed that "up to 5,000 data points" were collected for each of 220 million Americans, a data set of more than 1 trillion bits of formatted data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Cambridge Analytica]] website |url=https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216023554/https://cambridgeanalytica.org/about |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2016-02-16 |title=Cambridge Analytica – About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' later claimed that Cambridge Analytica in fact had, according to its own company information, "up to 7,000 data points" on 240 million American voters.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr, "UK regulator orders Cambridge Analytica to release data on US voter". ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/cambridge-analytica-uk-regulator-release-data-us-voter-david-carroll]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] Professor [[Latanya Sweeney]] calculated, that if a U.S. company knows just your [[date of birth]], your [[ZIP code]] and [[sex]], the company has an 87% chance to identify you by name – simply by using linked data sets from various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tanner, "Nine Things You Don't Know About The Gathering Of Your Personal Data." ''Forbes Magazine'', 4 November 2014.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2014/11/04/nine-things-you-dont-know-about-the-gathering-of-your-personal-data/#3faf581675b7]&lt;/ref&gt; With 4,000–7,000 data points instead of three, a very comprehensive personal profile becomes possible for almost every voter, and many behavioural patterns can be inferred by linking together different data sets. It also becomes possible to identify and measure gradations in personal characteristics which, in aggregate, have very large effects.

===Human judgement===
Some researchers argue that this kind of big data analysis has severe limitations, and that the analytical results can only be regarded as indicative, and not as definitive.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lohr and Natasha Singernov, "How Data Failed Us in Calling an Election." ''[[New York Times]]'', 10 November 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/the-data-said-clinton-would-win-why-you-shouldnt-have-believed-it.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by [[Kellyanne Conway]], [[Donald Trump]]’s campaign advisor and counselor, who emphasized the importance of human judgement and common sense in drawing conclusions from fuzzy data.&lt;ref&gt;"How Trump won the presidency". Interview of Gerald F. Seib with [[Kellyanne Conway]], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ CEO Council full interview video), 14 November 2016.[https://www.wsj.com/video/how-trump-won-the-presidency/969FC367-31B3-436F-8388-6C9CE7546AC7.html] See also: Jonathan Vanian, "How Bad Polling Data Fooled Everyone Except Donald Trump".

====Propaganda machine====
In a video interview published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in March 2018, whistleblower [[Christopher Wylie]] called [[Cambridge Analytica]] a "full-service propaganda machine" rather than a bona fide data science company. Its own site revealed with "case studies" that it has been active in political campaigns in numerous different countries, influencing attitudes and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Jina Moore, "Cambridge Analytica Had a Role in Kenya Election, Too". ''New York Times'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/world/africa/kenya-cambridge-analytica-election.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Wylie explained, that "we spent a million dollars harvesting tens of millions of [[Facebook]] profiles, and those profiles were used as the basis of the algorithms that became the foundation of Cambridge Analytica itself. The company itself was founded on using Facebook data".&lt;ref&gt;Carole Cadwalladr &amp; Emma Graham-Harrison, "Pressure mounts on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook over data scandal." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 March 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-data-breach]&lt;/ref&gt; 
====Audit====
On 19 March 2018, [[Facebook]] announced it had hired the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a "comprehensive audit" of Cambridge Analytica, while Facebook shares plummeted 7 percent overnight (erasing roughly $40 billion in market capitalization).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Shieber, "Facebook hired a forensics firm to investigate [[Cambridge Analytica]] as stock falls 7%." ''TC Techcrunch.com'', 19 March 2018.[https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/facebook-hired-a-forensics-firm-to-investigate-cambridge-analytica-as-stock-falls-7/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Analytica]] had not just used the profiles of [[Facebook]] users to compile data sets. According to [[Christopher Wylie]]'s testimony, the company also harvested the data of each user's network of friends, leveraging the original data set. It then converted, combined and migrated its results into ''new'' data sets, which can in principle survive in some format, even if the original data sources are destroyed. It created and applied algorithms using data to which - critics argue - it could not have been entitled. This was denied by [[Cambridge Analytica]], which stated on its website that it legitimately "uses data to change audience behavior" among customers and voters (who ''choose'' to view and provide information). If advertisers can do that, why not a data company? Where should the line be drawn? Legally, it remained a "fuzzy" area.
====Legal issue====
The tricky legal issue then became, what kind of data [[Cambridge Analytica]] (or any similar company) is actually allowed to have and keep.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Phade, "Who Should Profit From Selling Your Personal Data?". ''Futures Platform'', 27 March 2018.[https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/your-data-and-profit-data-scraping]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] itself became the subject of another [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] inquiry, to establish whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree governing its handing of user data (data which was allegedly transferred to Cambridge Analytica without Facebook's and user's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;David McLaughlin, Ben Brody, and Billy House, "FTC Probing Facebook for Use of Personal Data, Source Says." ''Bloomberg'', 20 March 2018; Tony Romm and Craig Timberg, "FTC opens investigation into Facebook after Cambridge Analytica scrapes millions of users’ personal information." ''Washington Post'', 20 March 2018.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/20/ftc-opens-investigation-into-facebook-after-cambridge-analytica-scrapes-millions-of-users-personal-information/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' journalist Jessi Hempel commented in a CBNC panel discussion that "Now there is this fuzziness from the top of the company [i.e. Facebook] that I have never seen in the fifteen years that I have covered it."&lt;ref&gt;Sara Salinas, "Facebook hires firm to conduct a 'comprehensive audit' of Cambridge Analytica". ''CNBC news'', 19 March 2018 and squawkbox panel video [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/facebook-to-conduct-a-comprehensive-audit-of-cambridge-analytica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data privacy====
Interrogating Facebook's CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] before the U.S. [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] in April 2018, New Mexico Congressman Rep. [[Ben Ray Luján]] put it to him that the Facebook corporation might well have "29,000 data points" on each Facebook user. Zuckerberg claimed that he "did not really know". Lujan's figure was based on [[ProPublica]] research, which in fact suggested that Facebook may even have 52,000 data points for many Facebook users.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carbone, "Facebook might have 29,000 data points on you, but Mark Zuckerberg doesn't really know." ''Fox News'', 11 April 2018.[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/11/facebook-might-have-29000-data-points-on-but-mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-really-know.html] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA1S5A4Yuxc] Julia Angwin, Surya Mattu and Terry Parris Jr., "Facebook Doesn’t Tell Users Everything It Really Knows About Them." ''ProPublica'', 27 December 2016.[https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them]&lt;/ref&gt; When Zuckerberg replied to his critics, he stated that because the revolutionary technology of Facebook (with 2.2 billion users worldwide) had ventured into previously unknown territory, it was unavoidable that mistakes would be made, despite the best of intentions. He justified himself saying that:

{{Quotation|"For the first ten or twelve years of the company, I viewed our responsibility primarily as building tools, that if we could put those tools in people's hands, then that would empower people to do good things. What we have learnt now... is that we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerberg's Senate hearings highlights video, 10 April 2018.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgI_KAkSyCw]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2018, [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] barred access from [[Crimson Hexagon]], a company that advises corporations and governments using one trillion scraped social media posts, which it mined and processed with artificial intelligence and image analysis.&lt;ref&gt; Olivia Solon and Julia Carrie Wong, "Facebook suspends another analytics firm amid questions over surveillance." ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2018.[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/20/facebook-crimson-hexagon-analytics-data-surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity====
It remained "fuzzy" what was more important to Zuckerberg: making money from user's information, or real corporate integrity in the use of personal information. Zuckerberg implied, that he believed that, on balance, Facebook had done ''more good than harm'', and that, if he had believed that wasn't the case, he would never have persevered with the business. Thus, "the good" was itself a fuzzy concept, because it was a matter of degree ("more good than bad"). He had to sell stuff, to keep the business growing. If people did not like Facebook, then they simply should not join it, or opt out, they have the choice.

After the ''[[New York Times]]'' broke the news on 17 March 2018, that copies of the Facebook data set scraped by Cambridge Analytica could still be downloaded from the Internet, Facebook was severely criticized by government representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr, "How [[Donald Trump|Trump]] Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions". ''[[New York Times]]'', 17 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned, Zuckerberg admitted that "In general we collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook for security purposes" with the aim "to help prevent malicious actors from collecting public information from Facebook users, such as names". &lt;ref&gt;Sarah Frier and Todd Shields, "Zuckerberg Says Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users", ''Bloomberg'', 11 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2018, it was reported that the [[Cambridge Analytica]] company was shutting down and was starting bankruptcy proceedings, after losing clients and facing escalating legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ballhaus and Jenny Gross, "Cambridge Analytica Closing Operations Following Facebook Data Controversy". ''Wall Street Journal'', 2 May 2018; Munsif Vengattil, "Cambridge Analytica and parent SCL Elections shutting down." ''Reuters'', 2 May 2018.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-faceboook-privacy/cambridge-analytica-and-parent-scl-elections-shutting-down-idUSKBN1I32L7]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reputational risk|reputational damage]] which the company had suffered or caused, had become too great.

===Speed===
A traditional objection to big data is, that it cannot cope with rapid change: events move faster that the statistics can keep up with. Yet the technology now exists for corporations like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] to pump cloud-based data streams from app-users straight into big data analytics programmes, in real time.&lt;ref&gt;Tableau.com, ''Big data: the top 8 trends for 2016''.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that the right kinds of analytical concepts are used, it is now technically possible to draw definite and important conclusions about gradations of human and natural behaviour using very large fuzzy data sets – and increasingly it can be done very fast. Obviously this achievement has become highly topical in military technology, but military uses can also have spin-offs for medical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Hagan, "From military to medical and commercial applications of neural networks and fuzzy logic: a modern "swords-into-plowshares" play." ''Proceedings of IEEE WESCON '93'' conference, San Francisco, 28-30 Sept. 1993. Republished in ''EEE Xplore'', 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There have been many academic controversies about the meaning, relevance and utility of fuzzy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Radim Bělohlávek, George J. Klir, Harold W. Lewis III, Eileen C. Way, "Concepts and fuzzy sets: Misunderstandings, misconceptions, and oversights". ''International Journal of Approximate Reasoning'', Vol. 51, July 2009), pp. 23–34.[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0888613X09001327/1-s2.0-S0888613X09001327-main.pdf?_tid=7f4bada4-37bd-11e7-9bfe-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1494667448_9f6a0acd8f43577a7af214d56512b12a] Angel Garrido &amp; Piedad Yuste, "controversies about the introduction of non-classical logics". ''Brain'', Vol. 5, No. 1-4, 2014.[http://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/view/457]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fuzzy" label===
[[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] himself confessed that:

{{Quotation|"I knew that just by choosing the label ''fuzzy'' I was going to find myself in the midst of a controversy... If it weren't called ''fuzzy logic'', there probably wouldn't be articles on it on the front page of the ''New York Times''. So let us say it has a certain publicity value. Of course, many people don't like that publicity value, and when they see it in the ''New York Times'', it doesn't sit well with them."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

However, the impact of the invention of fuzzy reasoning went far beyond names and labels. When Zadeh gave his acceptance speech in Japan for the 1989 Honda Foundation prize, which he received for inventing fuzzy theory, he stated that "The concept of a fuzzy set has had an upsetting effect on the established order."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, p. 50. The Honda Foundation judged that Zadeh had taken an "active role in making the future of information society a more humane civilization", with a broad range of contributions in applied logic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Do they exist===

Some philosophers and scientists have claimed that in reality "fuzzy" concepts do not exist.

====Frege====
According to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' by the logician [[Gottlob Frege]],

{{Quotation|"A definition of a concept... must be complete; it must unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or not it falls under the concept... the concept must have a sharp boundary... a concept that is not sharply defined is wrongly termed a concept. Such quasi-conceptual constructions cannot be recognized as concepts by logic. The [[Law of excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]] is really just another form of the requirement that the concept should have a sharp boundary."&lt;ref&gt;P. Geach and M. Black (eds.), ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege'', 3rd edition. Blackwell, 1980, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

====Kálmán====
Similarly, [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] stated in 1972 that "there is no such thing as a fuzzy concept... We do talk about fuzzy things but they are not scientific concepts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "Is there a need for fuzzy logic?", ''Information Sciences'', No. 178, 2008, p. 2753.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion is that a concept, to qualify as a concept, must always be clear ''and'' precise, without any fuzziness. A vague notion would be at best a prologue to formulating a concept.&lt;ref&gt;For the debate between Zadeh and Kálmán, see: Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105. See also: Yücel Yüksel, "On Zadeh’s 'The Birth and Evolution of Fuzzy Logic'". In: Eyke Hüllermeier, Rudolf Kruse &amp; Frank Hoffmann (eds.), ''Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems. Applications''. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference, IPMU 2010, Dortmund, Germany, June 28–July 2, 2010 (Communications in Computer and Information Science, vol 81), Part II. Berlin: Springer, 2010,  pp 350-355. &lt;/ref&gt;

====DIN and ISO standards====
There is no general agreement among philosophers and scientists about how the notion of a "[[concept]]" (and in particular, a scientific concept), should be defined.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang G. Stock, "Concepts and Semantic Relations in Information Science". In: ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' Vol. 61 No. 10, October 2010, pp. 1951–1969.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220433962_Concepts_and_Semantic_Relations_in_Information_Science]; Eric Margolis &amp; Stephen Laurence, "Concepts". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2011.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#ProThe]&lt;/ref&gt; A concept could be defined as a mental representation, as a cognitive capacity, as an abstract object, etc. Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin stated that “there will likely be no crucial experiments or analyses that will establish one view of concepts as correct and rule out all others irrevocably.”&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Smith &amp; Douglas L. Medin, ''Categories and concepts''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, scientists also quite often do use imprecise analogies in their models to help understanding an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zeidler, ''Models and Metaphors as Research Tools in Science''. Zurich: Lit Verlag, 2013; L. Magnani, N. J. Nersessian &amp; P. Thagard (eds.), Model-based reasoning in scientific discovery. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 1999; Jonathan Lawry, ''Modelling and reasoning with vague concepts''. New York: Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept can be clear enough, ''but not'' (or not sufficiently) precise.

Rather uniquely, terminology scientists at the German national standards institute (''Deutsches Institut für Normung'') provided an official standard definition of what a concept is (under the terminology standards DIN 2330 of 1957, completely revised in 1974 and last revised in 2013; and DIN 2342 of 1986, last revised in 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Go to [https://standards.globalspec.com/ Standards Library] for info.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official German definition, a concept is a unit of thought which is created through abstraction for a set of objects, and which identifies shared (or related) characteristics of those objects.

The subsequent ISO definition is very similar. Under the ISO 1087 terminology standard of the [[International Standards Organization]] (first published in October 2000, and reviewed in 2005), a concept is defined as a unit of thought or an idea constituted through abstraction on the basis of properties common to a set of objects.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [https://www.iso.org/standard/20057.html] [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:1087:-1:ed-1:v1:en] [http://wiki.julien-roche.fr/tiki-index.php?page=concept+3.2.1+version2+%28en%29&amp;structure=vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is acknowledged that although a concept usually has one definition or one meaning, it may have multiple designations, terms of expression, symbolizations or representations. Thus, for example, the same concept can have different names in different languages. Both verbs and nouns can express concepts. A concept can also be thought of as "a way of looking at the world".

===Corruption===
Reasoning with fuzzy concepts is often viewed as a kind of "logical corruption" or scientific perversion because, it is claimed, fuzzy reasoning rarely reaches a definite "yes" or a definite "no". A clear, precise and logically rigorous conceptualization is no longer a necessary prerequisite, for carrying out a procedure, a project, or an inquiry, since "somewhat vague ideas" can always be accommodated, formalized and programmed with the aid of fuzzy expressions. The purist idea is, that either a rule applies, or it does not apply. When a rule is said to apply only "to some extent", then in truth the rule does ''not'' apply. Thus, a compromise with vagueness or indefiniteness is, on this view, effectively a compromise with error - an error of conceptualization, an error in the inferential system, or an error in physically carrying out a task.
====Kahan====
The computer scientist [[William Kahan]] argued in 1975 that "the danger of fuzzy theory is that it will encourage the sort of imprecise thinking that has brought us so much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Lotfi A. Zadeh, "The birth and evolution of fuzzy logic". ''International Journal of General Systems'', Vol. 17, No. 2-3, 1990, pp. 95-105, at p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He said subsequently,

{{Quotation|"With traditional logic there is no guaranteed way to find that something is contradictory, but once it is found, you'd be obliged to do something. But with fuzzy sets, the existence of contradictory sets can't cause things to malfunction. Contradictory information doesn't lead to a clash. You just keep computing. (...) Life affords many instances of getting the right answer for the wrong reasons... It is in the nature of logic to confirm or deny. The fuzzy calculus blurs that. (...) Logic isn't following the rules of Aristotle blindly. It takes the kind of pain known to the runner. He knows he is doing something. When you are thinking about something hard, you'll feel a similar sort of pain. Fuzzy logic is marvellous. It insulates you from pain. It's the [[cocaine]] of science."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McNeill &amp; Paul Freiberger, ''Fuzzy Logic: The Revolutionary Computer Technology that Is Changing Our World.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
According to Kahan, statements of a degree of probability are usually verifiable. There are standard tests one can do. By contrast, there is no conclusive procedure which can decide the validity of assigning particular fuzzy truth values to a data set in the first instance. It is just assumed that a model or program will work, "if" particular fuzzy values are accepted and used, perhaps based on some statistical comparisons or try-outs.

====Bad design====
In programming, a problem can usually be solved in several different ways, not just one way, but an important issue is, which solution works best in the short term, and in the long term. Kahan implies, that fuzzy solutions may create more problems in the long term, than they solve in the short term. For example, if one starts off designing a procedure, not with well thought-out, precise concepts, but rather by using fuzzy or approximate expressions which conveniently patch up (or compensate for) badly formulated ideas, the ultimate result could be a complicated, malformed mess, that does not achieve the intended goal.

Had the reasoning and conceptualization been much sharper at the start, then the design of the procedure might have been much simpler, more efficient and effective - and fuzzy expressions or approximations would not be necessary, or required much less. Thus, by ''allowing'' the use of fuzzy or approximate expressions, one might actually foreclose more rigorous thinking about design, and one might build something that ultimately does not meet expectations. 

If (say) an entity X turns out to belong for 65% to category Y, and for 35% to category Z, how should X be allocated? One could plausibly decide to allocate X to Y, making a rule that, if an entity belongs for 65% or more to Y, it is to be treated as an instance of category Y, and never as an instance of category Z. One could, however, alternatively decide to change the definitions of the categorization system, to ensure that all entities such as X fall 100% in one category only. 

This kind of argument claims, that boundary problems can be resolved (or vastly reduced) simply by using better categorization or conceptualization methods. If we treat X "as if" it belongs 100% to Y, while in truth it only belongs 65% to Y, then arguably we are really misrepresenting things. If we keep doing that with a lot of related variables, we can greatly distort the true situation, and make it look like something that it isn't.

In a "fuzzy permissive" environment, it might become far too easy, to formalize and use a concept which is itself badly defined, and which could have been defined much better. In that environment, there is always a quantitative way out, for concepts that do not quite fit, or which don't quite do the job for which they are intended. The cumulative adverse effect of the discrepancies might, in the end, be much larger than ever anticipated.

====Counter-argument====
A typical reply to Kahan's objections is, that fuzzy reasoning never "rules out" ordinary binary logic, but instead ''presupposes'' ordinary true-or-false logic. [[Lotfi Zadeh]] stated that "fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. In large measure, fuzzy logic is precise."&lt;ref&gt;A. Dumitras, &amp; G. Moschytz, "Understanding Fuzzy Logic: An Interview with Lotfi Zadeh". ''IEEE signal processing magazine'', May 2007, pp. 102-105, at p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precise logic of imprecision. Fuzzy logic is not a replacement of, or substitute for ordinary logic, but an enhancement of it, with many practical uses. Fuzzy thinking does oblige action, but primarily in response to a change in quantitative gradation, not in response to a contradiction.

One could say, for example, that ultimately one is ''either'' "alive" ''or'' "dead", which is perfectly true. Meantime though one is "living", which is also a significant truth - yet "living" is a fuzzy concept. It is true that fuzzy logic by itself usually cannot eliminate inadequate conceptualization or bad design. Yet it can at least make explicit, what exactly the variations are in the applicability of a concept which has unsharp boundaries.

If one always had perfectly crisp concepts available, perhaps no fuzzy expressions would be necessary. In reality though, one often does not have all the crisp concepts to start off with. One might not have them yet for a long time, or ever - or, several successive "fuzzy" approximations might be needed, to get there. 

At a deeper level, a "fuzzy permissive" environment may be desirable, precisely because it permits things to be actioned, that would never have been achieved, if there had been crystal clarity about all the consequences from the start, or if people insisted on absolute precision prior to doing anything. Scientists often try things out on the basis of "hunches", and processes like [[serendipity]] can play a role. 

Learning something new, or trying to create something new, is rarely a completely formal-logical or linear process, there are not only "knowns" and "unknowns" involved, but also "''partly'' known" phenomena, i.e. things which are known or unknown "to some degree". Even if, ideally, we would prefer to eliminate fuzzy ideas, we might need them initially to get there, further down the track. Any method of reasoning is a tool. If its application has bad results, it is not the tool itself that is to blame, but its inappropriate use. It would be better to educate people in the best ''use'' of the tool, if necessary with appropriate authorization, than to ''ban'' the tool pre-emptively, on the ground that it "could" or "might" be abused. Exceptions to this rule would include things like computer viruses and illegal weapons that can only cause great harm if they are used. There is no evidence though that fuzzy concepts as a species are intrinsically harmful, even if some bad concepts can cause harm if used in inappropriate contexts.

===Reducibility===

[[Susan Haack]] once claimed that a many-valued logic requires neither intermediate terms between true and false, nor a rejection of bivalence.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, Philosophy of Logics. Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Her suggestion was, that the intermediate terms (i.e. the gradations of truth) can always be restated as conditional if-then statements, and by implication, that fuzzy logic is fully reducible to binary true-or-false logic. 

This interpretation is disputed, but even if it was correct, assigning a number to the applicability of a statement is often enormously more efficient than a long string of if-then statements that would have the same intended meaning. That point is obviously of great importance to computer programmers, educators and administrators seeking to code a process, activity, message or operation as simply as possible, according to logically consistent rules.

===Quantification===
It may be wonderful to have access to an unlimited number of distinctions to define what one means, but not all scholars would agree that any concept is equal to, or reducible to, a mathematical [[Set theory|set]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Epstein, "Memory and concepts in reactive learning". ''Proceedings of the Canadian Workshop on Machine Learning 1992''[http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~epstein/papers/CSCSI92.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Some phenomena are difficult or impossible to quantify and count, in particular if they lack discrete boundaries (for example, clouds).

====Formalization====
Qualities may not be fully reducible to quantities&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mumford, "Quantities and Qualities", University of Nottingham blog post, September 30, 2012.[https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/artsmatters/2012/09/30/quantities-and-qualities/]&lt;/ref&gt; – if there are no qualities, it may become impossible to say what the numbers are numbers of, or what they refer to, except that they refer to other numbers or numerical expressions such as algebraic equations. A measure requires a counting unit defined by a category, but the definition of that category is essentially qualitative; a language which is used to communicate data is difficult to operate, without any qualitative distinctions and categories. We may, for example, transmit a text in binary code, but the binary code does not tell us directly what the text intends.

In creating a [[formal system|formalization]] or [[formal specification]] of a concept, for example for the purpose of measurement, administrative procedure or programming, part of the meaning of the concept may be changed or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Wachter, "How Measurement Fails Doctors and Teachers". ''New York Times'', 16 January 2016.[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/how-measurement-fails-doctors-and-teachers.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if we deliberately program an event according to a concept, it might kill off the spontaneity, spirit, authenticity and motivational pattern which is ordinarily associated with that type of event.

[[Quantification (science)|Quantification]] is not an unproblematic process.&lt;ref&gt;“A well-known quotation usually attributed to Einstein is “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” I’d amend it to a less eloquent, more prosaic statement: unless we know how things are counted, we don’t know if it’s wise to count on the numbers. The problem isn’t with statistical tests themselves but with what we do before and after we run them. First, we count if we can, but counting depends a great deal on previous assumptions about categorization. (...) Second, after we’ve gathered some numbers relating to a phenomenon, we must reasonably aggregate them into some sort of recommendation or ranking. This is not easy. By appropriate choices of criteria, measurement protocols and weights, almost any desired outcome can be reached." - John Allen Paulos, "Metric Mania", in ''New York Times'', 10 May 2010.[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16FOB-WWLN-t.html] Whether Einstein really did originate the quotation which Paulos mentions, is in dispute. The quote is also credited to William Bruce Cameron, ''Informal Sociology, a casual introduction to sociological thinking''. New York: Random House, 1963, p. 13.[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/]&lt;/ref&gt; To quantify a phenomenon, we may have to introduce special assumptions and definitions which disregard part of the phenomenon in its totality. 
*The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] concluded that formalization "runs the risk of leaving behind the subjectmatter we are interested in" and "also runs the risk of increasing rather than decreasing the muddle."&lt;ref&gt;J. Coates, "Keynes, vague concepts and fuzzy logic." In: G.C. Harcourt &amp; P.A. Riach (ed.), ''A second edition of the General Theory'', Volume 2.

*[[Michael Polanyi]] stated that "the process of formalizing all knowledge to the exclusion of any [[Tacit knowledge|tacit knowing]] is self-defeating", since to mathematize a concept we need to be able to identify it in the first instance without mathematization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Polanyi, ''The tacit dimension'' [1966]. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurement====
Programmers, statisticians or logicians are concerned in their work with the main operational or technical significance of a concept which is specifiable in objective, quantifiable terms. They are not primarily concerned with all kinds of imaginative frameworks associated with the concept, or with those aspects of the concept which seem to have no particular functional purpose – however entertaining they might be. However, some of the qualitative characteristics of the concept may not be quantifiable or measurable at all, at least not directly. The temptation exists to ignore them, or try to infer them from data results.

If, for example, we want to count the number of trees in a forest area with any precision, we have to define what counts as one tree, and perhaps distinguish them from saplings, split trees, dead trees, fallen trees etc. Soon enough it becomes apparent that the quantification of trees involves a degree of abstraction – we decide to disregard some timber, dead or alive, from the population of trees, in order to count those trees that conform to our chosen concept of a tree. We operate in fact with an abstract concept of what a tree is, which diverges to some extent from the true diversity of trees there are. 

Even so, there may be some trees, of which it is not very clear, whether they should be counted as a tree, or not; a certain amount of "fuzziness" in the concept of a tree may therefore remain. The implication is, that the seemingly "exact" number offered for the total quantity of trees in the forest may be much less exact than one might think - it is probably more an estimate or indication of magnitude, rather than an exact description.&lt;ref&gt;What statisticians then often try to do, is to create a model which can predict the magnitude of the difference between the true (accurate and exact) number and the computed number obtained, in this case the true number of trees. Such a model however still relies on imperfect or fallible definitions. Even if fuzzy values are used instead, it is likely that a definite and exact number can never be reached. At most one can say that the number is correct, if the definitions are accepted.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet - and this is the point - the imprecise measure can be very useful and sufficient for all intended purposes.

It is tempting to think, that if something can be measured, it must exist, and that if we cannot measure it, it does not exist. Neither might be true. Researchers try to measure such things as intelligence or gross domestic product, without much scientific agreement about what these things actually are, how they exist, and what the correct measures might be.

When one wants to count and quantify distinct objects using numbers, one needs to be able to distinguish between those separate objects, but if this is difficult or impossible, then, although this may not invalidate a quantitative procedure as such, quantification is not really possible in practice; at best, we may be able to assume or infer indirectly a certain distribution of quantities that must be there. In this sense, scientists often use [[Proxy (statistics)|proxy variables]] to substitute as measures for variables which are known (or thought) to be there, but which themselves cannot be observed or measured directly.

===Vague or fuzzy===
The exact relationship between vagueness and fuzziness is disputed.

====Philosophy====
Philosophers often regard fuzziness as a particular kind of vagueness,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Haack, ''Deviant logic, fuzzy logic - beyond the formalism.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider that "no specific assignment of semantic values to vague predicates, not even a fuzzy one, can fully satisfy our conception of what the extensions of vague predicates are like".&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Vagueness and Second-Level Indeterminacy", in: Richard Dietz &amp; Sebastiano Moruzzi (eds.), ''Cuts and clouds. Vagueness, Its Nature, and Its Logic.'' Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying recent literature on how to characterize vagueness, Matti Eklund states that appeal to lack of sharp boundaries, borderline cases and “sorites-susceptible" predicates are the three informal characterizations of vagueness which are most common in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Matti Eklund, "Characterizing Vagueness". ''Philosophy Compass'', 2, 2007, pp. 896-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zadeh's argument====
However, [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] claimed that "vagueness connotes insufficient [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]], whereas fuzziness connotes unsharpness of [[Class (set theory)|class boundaries]]". Thus, he argued, a sentence like "I will be back in a few minutes" is fuzzy ''but not'' vague, whereas a sentence such as "I will be back sometime", is fuzzy ''and'' vague. His suggestion was that fuzziness and vagueness are logically quite different qualities, rather than fuzziness being a type or subcategory of vagueness. Zadeh claimed that "inappropriate use of the term 'vague' is still a common practice in the literature of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===

In the scholarly inquiry about [[ethics]] and [[meta-ethics]], vague or fuzzy concepts and borderline cases are standard topics of controversy. Central to ethics are theories of "value", what is "good" or "bad" for people and why that is, and the idea of "rule following" as a condition for moral integrity, consistency and non-arbitrary behaviour. 

Yet, if human valuations or moral rules are only vague or fuzzy, then they may not be able to orient or guide behaviour. It may become impossible to operationalize rules. Evaluations may not permit definite moral judgements, in that case. Hence, clarifying fuzzy moral notions is usually considered to be critical for the ethical endeavour as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dougherty, "Vague value", in: ''Philosophy and phenomenological research'', Vol. 89, No. 2, September 2014, pp. 352–372 [https://philpapers.org/archive/DOUVV.pdf]; Tom Dougherty, "Vagueness and Indeterminacy in Ethics". In: Tristram McPherson &amp; David Plunkett, ''The Routledge Handbook of Metaethics''. Oxford: Routledge, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excessive precision====
Nevertheless, [[Scott Soames]] has made the case that vagueness or fuzziness can be ''valuable'' to rule-makers, because "their use of it is valuable to the people to whom rules are addressed".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be more practical and effective to allow for some leeway (and personal responsibility) in the interpretation of how a rule should be applied - bearing in mind the overall purpose which the rule intends to achieve. 

If a rule or procedure is stipulated too exactly, it can sometimes have a result which is contrary to the aim which it was intended to help achieve. For example, "The [[Children and Young Persons Act 2008|Children and Young Persons Act]] could have specified a precise age below which a child may not be left unsupervised. But doing so would have incurred quite substantial forms of arbitrariness (for various reasons, and particularly because of the different capacities of children of the same age)".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rule conflict====
A related sort of problem is, that if the application of a legal concept is pursued too exactly and rigorously, it may have consequences that cause a serious conflict with ''another'' legal concept. This is not necessarily a matter of bad law-making. When a law is made, it may not be possible to anticipate all the cases and events to which it will apply later (even if 95% of possible cases are predictable). The longer a law is in force, the more likely it is, that people will run into problems with it, that were not foreseen when the law was made. 

So, the further implications of one rule may conflict with another rule. "Common sense" might not be able to resolve things. In that scenario, too much precision can get in the way of justice. Very likely a special court ruling wil have to set a norm. The general problem for jurists is, whether "the arbitrariness resulting from precision is worse than the arbitrariness resulting from the application of a vague standard".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, "The Value of Vagueness." Chapter 2 in: Andrei Marmor &amp; Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Foundations of Language in the Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013, pp. 26-43, at p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
The definitional disputes about fuzziness remain unresolved so far, mainly because, as anthropologists and psychologists have documented, different languages (or symbol systems) that have been created by people to signal meanings suggest different [[ontology|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995. [[Gregory Bateson]], ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology''. Chicago: University Of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply: it is not merely that describing "what is there" involves symbolic representations of some kind. How distinctions are drawn, influences perceptions of "what is there", and vice versa, perceptions of "what is there" influence how distinctions are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Vassos Argyrou, "Anthropology of Magic". In: James D. Wright (ed.), ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 2015, 2nd edition, Vol. 14, p. 438. Dominic Hyde, ''Vagueness, Logic and Ontology''. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 2008. See also [[object-oriented ontology]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important reason why, as [[Alfred Korzybski]] noted, people frequently confuse the symbolic representation of reality, conveyed by languages and signs, with reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Korzybski]], ''Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics'' (5th ed.). Forest Hills, N.Y.: Institute of General Semantics, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzziness implies, that there exists a potentially ''infinite'' number of truth values between complete truth and complete falsehood. If that is the case, it creates the foundational issue of what, in the case, can justify or prove the existence of the categorical absolutes which are assumed by logical or quantitative inference. If there is an infinite number of shades of grey, how do we know what is totally black and white, and how could we identify that?
====Tegmark====
To illustrate the ontological issues, cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]] argues boldly that the universe consists of math: "If you accept the idea that both space itself, and all the stuff in space, have no properties at all except mathematical properties," then the idea that everything is mathematical "starts to sound a little bit less insane."&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Lewis, "What's the Universe Made Of? Math, Says Scientist." ''Live Science'', 30 January 2014.[http://www.livescience.com/42839-the-universe-is-math.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tegmark moves from the ''[[Epistemology|epistemic]]'' claim that mathematics is the only known symbol system which can in principle express absolutely everything, to the ''[[Methodology|methodological]]'' claim that everything is reducible to mathematical relationships, and then to the ''[[Ontology|ontological]]'' claim, that ultimately everything that exists is mathematical (the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]). The argument is then reversed, so that ''because'' everything is mathematical in reality, mathematics is ''necessarily'' the ultimate universal symbol system.

The main criticisms of Tegmark's approach are that (1) the steps in this argument do not necessarily follow, (2) no conclusive proof or test is possible for the claim that such an exhaustive mathematical expression or reduction is feasible, and (3) it may be that a complete reduction to mathematics cannot be accomplished, without at least partly altering, negating or deleting a non-mathematical significance of phenomena, experienced perhaps as [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;See also Raphael van Riel &amp; Robert Van Gulick, "Scientific reduction". In: ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2014.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zalta====
In his [[meta-mathematics|meta-mathematical]] [[metaphysics]], [[Edward N. Zalta]] has claimed that for every set of properties of a concrete object, there ''always'' exists ''exactly'' one abstract object that encodes ''exactly'' that set of properties and no others - a foundational assumption or [[axiom]] for his [[ontology]] of abstract objects&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward N. Zalta]], ''Abstract Objects. An introduction to axiomatic metaphysics''. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; By implication, for every fuzzy object there exists always at least one [[defuzzification|defuzzified]] concept which encodes it exactly. It is a modern interpretation of [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic epistemology|metaphysics of knowledge]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman Gulley, ''Plato's theory of knowledge''[1962]. Milton Park: Routledge, 2013, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which expresses confidence in the ability of science to conceptualize the world exactly.

====Platonism====
The Platonic-style interpretation was critiqued by [[Hartry H. Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hartry H. Field]], ''Science without numbers. A defense of nominalism.'' Second edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Balaguer argues that we do not really know whether mind-independent abstract objects exist or not; so far, we cannot prove whether [[Platonic realism]] is definitely true or false.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, ''Platonism and Anti-Platonism in Mathematics''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Defending a cognitive realism, [[Scott Soames]] argues that the reason why this unsolvable conundrum has persisted, is because the ultimate constitution of the meaning of concepts and propositions was misconceived.

Traditionally, it was thought that concepts can be truly representational, because ultimately they are related to intrinsically representational Platonic complexes of [[Problem of universals|universals]] and [[particular]]s. However, once concepts and propositions are regarded as cognitive-event types, it is possible to claim that they are able to be representational, because they are constitutively related to intrinsically representational cognitive acts in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the platonic epistemology required by the classic Frege-Russell account... the epistemology of naturalized propositions sees acquaintance with, and knowledge of, propositions as rooted in acquaintance with, and knowledge of, acts and events that make up one's cognitive life" - Scott Soames, ''What is meaning?''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As another philosopher put it, 
{{Quotation|"The question of how we can know the world around us is not entirely unlike the question of how it is that the food our environment provides happens to agree with our stomachs. Either can become a mystery if we forget that minds, like stomachs, originated in and have been conditioned by a pre-existent natural order."&lt;ref&gt;William Ashley, ''Marxism and moral concepts''. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1964, pp. 4-5. Similarly, [[Paul Lafargue]] had written in his essay "The Origin of Abstract Ideas" (1900) that "The brain has the property of thinking as the stomach has that of digesting. It cannot think but by the aid of ideas, which it fabricates with the materials furnished it by the natural environment and the social or artificial environment in which man evolves." [https://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1898/xx/abstract.htm]
&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Along these lines, it could be argued that reality, and the human cognition of reality, will inevitably contain some fuzzy characteristics, which can be represented only by concepts which are themselves fuzzy to some or other extent.

==Social science and the media==
The idea of fuzzy concepts has also been applied in the philosophical, sociological and linguistic analysis of human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;John Coates, ''The claims of common sense; Moore, Wittgenstein, Keynes and the social sciences''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology and linguistics===
In a 1973 paper, [[George Lakoff]] analyzed hedges in the interpretation of the meaning of categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Lakoff]], "Hedges: A Study in Meaning Criteria and the Logic of Fuzzy Concepts." ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'', Vol. 2, 1973, pp. 458–508.[http://georgelakoff.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/hedges-a-study-in-meaning-criteria-and-the-logic-of-fuzzy-concepts-journal-of-philosophical-logic-2-lakoff-19731.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ragin]] and others have applied the idea to sociological analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Ragin]], ''Redesigning Social Inquiry: Fuzzy Sets and Beyond''. University of Chicago Press, 2008. Shaomin Li, "Measuring the fuzziness of human thoughts: An application of fuzzy sets to sociological research". ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'', Volume 14, Issue 1, 1989, pp. 67–84; Mario Quaranta, "Fuzzy set theory and concepts: a proposal for concept formation and operationalization". ''Comparative Sociology'' Vol. 12, issue 6, 2013, pp. 785-820.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis ("fsQCA") has been used by German researchers to study problems posed by ethnic diversity in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stoiber, Frederik Caselitz, Marie Sophie Heinelt, “How to deal with socio-ethnic conflicts in Latin America?

Applications and Methodological Challenges”, November 22–23, 2013, Goethe University Frankfurt.[https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/conpar/download/stoibercaselitzheinelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], [[Taiwan]], [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], the [[European Union]] and [[Croatia]], economists have used fuzzy concepts to model and measure the underground economy of their country.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Draeseke &amp; David E.A. Giles, "A fuzzy logic approach to modelling the New Zealand underground economy." ''Mathematics and Computers in Simulation'', Vol. 59, No. 1, 2002, pp. 115–123.

In: ''Journal of Information and organizational Sciences'', Vol. 49, No. 1, 2016, pp.83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Kofi Kissi Dompere applied methods of fuzzy decision, approximate reasoning, negotiation games and fuzzy mathematics to analyze the role of money, information and resources in a "political economy of rent-seeking", viewed as a game played between powerful corporations and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness, democracy, control and collective decision choice system: a theory on political economy of rent-seeking and profit-harvesting''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept may be deliberately created by sociologists as an [[ideal type]] to understand something imaginatively, without any strong claim that it is a "true and complete description" or a "true and complete reflection" of whatever is being conceptualized.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Shils &amp; Henry A. Finch (eds.), ''Max Weber on the methodology of the social sciences''. Glencoe, Ill.: The Free Press, 1949, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a more general sociological or journalistic sense, a "fuzzy concept" has come to mean a concept which is meaningful but inexact, implying that it does not exhaustively or completely define the meaning of the phenomenon to which it refers – often because it is too abstract. In this context, it is said that fuzzy concepts "lack clarity and are difficult to test or operationalize".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Markusen, "Fuzzy Concepts, Scanty Evidence, Policy Distance: The Case for Rigour and Policy Relevance in Critical Regional Studies." In: ''Regional Studies'', Volume 37, Issue 6-7, 2003, pp. 701–717.&lt;/ref&gt; To specify the relevant meaning more precisely, additional distinctions, conditions and/or qualifiers would be required.

A few examples can illustrate this kind of usage:
*a handbook of sociology states that "The theory of interaction rituals contains some gaps that need to be filled and some fuzzy concepts that need to be differentiated."&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Rössel and [[Randall Collins]], "Conflict theory and interaction rituals. The microfoundations of conflict theory." In: [[Jonathan H. Turner]] (ed.), ''Handbook of Sociological Theory''. New York: Springer, 2001, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is, that if finer distinctions are introduced, then the fuzziness or vagueness would be eliminated. 
*a book on youth culture describes [[ethnicity]] as "a fuzzy concept that overlaps at times with concepts of race, minority, nationality and tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Jenkins, "Ethnicity, culture, drugs and sex". In: Peter Aggleton, Andrew Ball and Purnima Mane (eds.), "Sex, Drugs and Young People: International Perspectives." London: Routledge, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, part of the fuzziness consists in the inability to distinguish precisely between a concept and a different, but closely related concept.
*a book on sociological theory argues that the [[Critical Theory]] of domination faces the problem that "reality itself has become a rather meaningless, fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Chaplin, ''Sociology and visual representation''. London: Routledge, 1994, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion here is, that the variations in how theoretical concepts are applied have become so large, that the concepts could mean all kinds of things, and therefore are crucially vague (with the implication, that they are not useful any longer for that very reason).
*A history book states: "[[Sodomy]] was a vague and fuzzy concept in [[medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], and was often associated with a variety of supposedly related moral and criminal offenses, including [[heresy]], [[witchcraft]], [[sedition]], and [[treason]]. St [[Thomas Acquinas]]... categorized sodomy with an assortment of sexual behaviours "from which generation [i.e. procreation] cannot follow".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lynch (ed.), ''Christopher Marlowe: Edward II, with related texts''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2015, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, because a concept is defined by what it excludes, it remains somewhat vague what items of activity it would specifically ''include''.

===Mass media===
The main reason why the term "fuzzy concept" is now often used in describing human behaviour, is that human interaction has many characteristics which are difficult to quantify and measure precisely (although we know that they have magnitudes and proportions), among other things because they are interactive and reflexive (the observers and the observed mutually influence the meaning of events).&lt;ref&gt;[[Loïc Wacquant]], "The fuzzy logic of practical sense." in: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Loïc Wacquant]], ''An invitation to reflexive sociology''. London: Polity Press, 1992, chapter I section 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Those human characteristics can be usefully expressed only in an ''approximate'' way (see [[reflexivity (social theory)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ph. Manning "Fuzzy Description: Discovery and Invention in Sociology". In: ''History of the Human Sciences'', Vol. 7, No. 1, 1994, pp. 117–23.[http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&amp;context=clsoc_crim_facpub]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper stories frequently contain fuzzy concepts, which are readily understood and used, even although they are far from exact. Thus, many of the meanings which people ordinarily use to negotiate their way through life in reality turn out to be "fuzzy concepts". While people often do need to be exact about some things (e.g. money or time), many areas of their lives involve expressions which are far from exact.

Sometimes the term is also used in a [[pejorative]] sense. For example, a [[New York Times]] journalist wrote that [[Prince Sihanouk]] "seems unable to differentiate between friends and enemies, a disturbing trait since it suggests that he stands for nothing beyond the fuzzy concept of peace and prosperity in Cambodia".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Shenon, "Their prince is back: Cambodians are baffled." ''New York Times'', 6 June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied social science===
The use of fuzzy logic in the social sciences and humanities has remained limited until recently. [[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] said in a 1994 interview that:

{{Quotation|"I expected people in the social sciences – economics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, politics, sociology, religion and numerous other areas to pick up on it. It's been somewhat of a mystery to me why even to this day, so few social scientists have discovered how useful it could be."&lt;ref&gt;Betty Blair, "Interview with Lotfi Zadeh, Creator of Fuzzy Logic". ''Azerbaijan International'', Winter 1994, pp. 46–47.[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_fuzzylogic.html]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Two decades later, after a digital [[information explosion]] due to the growing use of the internet and mobile phones worldwide,  fuzzy concepts and fuzzy logic are being widely applied in [[big data]] analysis of social, commercial and psychological phenomena. Many [[sociometry|sociometric]] and [[psychometrics|psychometric]] indicators are based partly on fuzzy concepts and fuzzy variables.

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] once claimed that "the logic of natural language we are in effect already using can serve as a "fuzzy logic" better than its trade name variant without any additional assumptions or constructions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan van Benthem (logician)|Johan van Benthem]] et al. (eds.), ''The age of alternative logics. Assessing philosophy of logic and mathematics today''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; That might help to explain why fuzzy logic has not been used much to formalize concepts in the "soft" social sciences. 

[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] rejected such an interpretation, on the ground that in many human endeavours as well as technologies it is highly important to define more exactly "to what extent" something is applicable or true, when it is known that its applicability can vary to some important extent among large populations. Reasoning which accepts and uses fuzzy concepts can be shown to be perfectly valid with the aid of fuzzy logic, because the degrees of applicability of a concept can be more precisely and efficiently defined with the aid of numerical notation.

Another possible explanation for the traditional lack of use of fuzzy logic by social scientists is simply that, beyond basic statistical analysis (using programs such as [[SPSS]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) the mathematical knowledge of social scientists is often rather limited; they may not know how to formalize and code a fuzzy concept using the conventions of fuzzy logic. The standard software packages used provide only a limited capacity to analyze fuzzy data sets, if at all, and considerable skills are required. 

Yet Jaakko Hintikka may be correct, in the sense that it can be much more efficient to use natural language to denote a complex idea, than to formalize it in logical terms. The quest for formalization might introduce much more complexity, which is not wanted, and which detracts from communicating the relevant issue. Some concepts used in social science may be impossible to formalize exactly, even though they are quite useful and people understand their appropriate application quite well.

==Uncertainty==

Fuzzy concepts can generate [[uncertainty]] because they are imprecise (especially if they refer to a process in motion, or a process of transformation where something is "in the process of turning into something else"). In that case, they do not provide a clear orientation for action or decision-making ("what does X really mean, intend or imply?"); reducing fuzziness, perhaps by applying fuzzy logic,&lt;ref&gt;Kofi Kissi Dompere, ''Fuzziness and approximate reasoning; epistemics on uncertainty, expectation and risk in rational behaviour''. Berlin: Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; might generate more certainty.

===Relevance===
However, this is not necessarily always so.&lt;ref&gt;Masao Mukaidono, ''Fuzzy logic for beginners''. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A concept, even although it is not fuzzy at all, and even though it is very exact, could equally well fail to capture the meaning of something adequately. That is, a concept can be very precise and exact, but not – or insufficiently – ''applicable'' or ''relevant'' in the situation to which it refers. In this sense, a definition can be "very precise", but "miss the point" altogether.

===Security===
A fuzzy concept may indeed provide ''more'' security, because it provides a meaning for something when an exact concept is unavailable – which is better than not being able to denote it at all. A concept such as [[God]], although not easily definable, for instance can provide security to the believer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]], ''The Case for God''. New York: Anchor, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observer effect===
In physics, the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] and [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bohm]], ''Wholeness and the implicate order.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul ARK paperback edition, 1983, p. 86f.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that there is a physical limit to the amount of precision that is knowable, with regard to the movements of subatomic particles and waves. That is, features of physical reality exist, where we can know that they vary in magnitude, but of which we can never know or predict exactly how big or small the variations are. This insight suggests that, in some areas of our experience of the physical world, fuzziness is inevitable and can never be totally removed. Since the [[Universe|physical universe]] itself is incredibly large and diverse, it is not easy to imagine it, grasp it or describe it without using fuzzy concepts.

==Language==
Ordinary language, which uses symbolic conventions and associations which are often not logical, inherently contains many fuzzy concepts – "knowing what you mean" in this case depends partly on knowing the context (or being familiar with the way in which a term is normally used, or what it is associated with). 

This can be easily verified for instance by consulting a [[dictionary]], a [[thesaurus]] or an [[encyclopedia]] which show the multiple meanings of words, or by observing the behaviours involved in ordinary relationships which rely on mutually understood meanings (see also [[Imprecise language]]). [[Bertrand Russell]] regarded ordinary language (in contrast to logic) as intrinsically vague.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell. "Vagueness". In: ''Australasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy'', Vol. 1, pp. 84–92, 1923. Reprinted in: ''Bertrand Russell Papers'', Vol. 9, pp. 147–54. Nadine Faulkner, "Russell and vagueness." ''Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', Summer 2003, pp. 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicature===
To communicate, receive or convey a [[message]], an individual somehow has to bridge his own intended meaning and the meanings which are understood by others, i.e., the message has to be conveyed in a way that it will be socially understood, preferably in the intended manner. Thus, people might state: "you have to say it in a way that I understand". Even if the message is clear and precise, it may nevertheless not be received in the way it was intended.

Bridging meanings may be done instinctively, habitually or unconsciously, but it usually involves a choice of terms, assumptions or [[symbols]] whose meanings are not completely fixed, but which depend among other things on how the receivers of the message respond to it, or the [[context (language use)|context]]. In this sense, meaning is often "negotiated" or "interactive" (or, more cynically, manipulated). This gives rise to many fuzzy concepts.

The semantic challenge of conveying meanings to an audience was explored in detail, and analyzed logically, by the British philosopher [[Paul Grice]] - using, among other things, the concept of [[implicature]].&lt;ref&gt;A critique of Grice is provided by Wayne A. Davis, ''Implicature: intention, convention, and principle in the failure of Gricean theory.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. An example of a specific application of Gricean theory is: Penelope Brown &amp; Stephen C. Levinson, ''Politeness: some universals in language use''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicature refers to what is ''suggested'' by a message to the recipient, without being either explicitly expressed or logically entailed by its content. The suggestion could be very clear to the recipient (perhaps a sort of code), but it could also be vague or fuzzy.

===Paradoxes===
Even using ordinary [[set theory]] and [[Principle of bivalence|binary logic]] to reason something out, logicians have discovered that it is possible to generate statements which are logically speaking not completely true or imply a [[paradox]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes &amp; George Brecht, ''Vicious Circles and Infinity. An anthology of Paradoxes.'' Penguin Books, 1978. Nicholas Rescher, ''Epistemological Studies''. Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2009, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; even although in other respects they conform to logical rules (see [[Russell's paradox]]). [[David Hilbert]] concluded that the existence of such logical paradoxes tells us "that we must develop a meta-mathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic method; their importance is methodological as well as epistemological".
&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Cantini, "Paradoxes and Contemporary Logic", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 30 April 2012.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/#RusCon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Various different aspects of human experience commonly generate concepts with fuzzy characteristics.
===Human vs. Computer===
The formation of fuzzy concepts is partly due to the fact that the human brain does not operate like a computer (see also [[Chinese room]]).&lt;ref&gt;See further Radim Bělohlávek &amp; George J. Klir (eds.) ''Concepts and Fuzzy Logic''. MIT Press, 2011. [[John R. Searle]], "Minds, brains and programs". ''The behavioral and brain sciences'', Vol. 3, No. 3, 1980, pp. 417–457. [[Robert Epstein]], "The empty brain", ''Aeon'', 18 May 2016.[https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer]&lt;/ref&gt;
*While ordinary computers use strict binary logic gates, the brain does not;  i.e., it is capable of making all kinds of neural associations according to all kinds of ordering principles (or fairly chaotically) in associative patterns which are not logical but nevertheless meaningful. For example, a work of art can be meaningful without being logical. A pattern can be regular, ordered and/or non-arbitrary, hence meaningful, without it being possible to describe it completely or exhaustively in formal-logical terms.
*Something can be meaningful although we cannot name it, or we might only be able to name it and nothing else.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Collins, ''Tacit &amp; explicit knowledge''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Human brains can also interpret the same phenomenon in several different but interacting frames of reference, at the same time, or in quick succession, without there necessarily being an explicit logical connection between the frames (see also [[framing effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]], "The framing of decisions and psychology of choice". ''Science'', Vol. 211, No. 4481, January 1981, pp. 453-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[fuzzy-trace theory]], partly inspired by [[Gestalt psychology]], human intuition is a non-arbitrary, reasonable and rational process of cognition; it literally "makes sense" (see also: [[Problem of multiple generality]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Brainerd and V. F. Reyna, “Gist is the grist: fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism”. ''Developmental Review'', Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1990, pp. 3-47, at p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
In part, fuzzy concepts arise also because [[learning]] or the growth of [[understanding]] involves a transition from a vague awareness, which cannot orient behaviour greatly, to clearer insight, which can orient behaviour. At the first encounter with an idea, the sense of the idea may be rather hazy. When more experience with the idea has occurred, a clearer and more precise grasp of the idea results, as well as a better understanding of how and when to use the idea (or not). 

In his study of [[implicit learning]], [[Arthur S. Reber]] affirms that there does not exist a very sharp boundary between the conscious and the unconscious, and "there are always going to be lots of fuzzy borderline cases of material that is marginally conscious and lots of elusive instances of functions and processes that seem to slip in and out of personal awareness".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur S. Reber]], ''Implicit learning and tacit knowledge. An essay on the cognitive unconscious''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, an inevitable component of fuzziness exists and persists in human consciousness, because of continual variation of gradations in awareness, along a continuum from the [[conscious]], the [[preconscious]], and the [[subconscious]] to the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]]. The hypnotherapist [[Milton H. Erickson]] noted likewise that the conscious mind and the unconscious normally interact.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H. Erickson, Volume II: human behavior &amp; psychotherapy.'' New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits===
Some psychologists and logicians argue that fuzzy concepts are a necessary consequence of the reality that any kind of distinction we might like to draw has ''limits of application''. At a certain level of generality, a distinction works fine. But if we pursued its application in a very exact and [[rigorous]] manner, or overextend its application, it appears that the distinction simply does not apply in some areas or contexts, or that we cannot fully specify how it should be drawn. An [[analogy]] might be, that zooming a [[telescope]], [[camera]], or [[microscope]] in and out, reveals that a pattern which is sharply focused at a certain distance becomes blurry at another distance, or disappears altogether.

===Complexity===
Faced with any large, complex and continually changing phenomenon, any short statement made about that phenomenon is likely to be "fuzzy", i.e., it is meaningful, but – strictly speaking – incorrect and imprecise.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cornelius Benjamin, "Science and vagueness". In: ''Philosophy of science'', Vol. 6 No. 4, 1939, pp. 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; It will not really do full justice to the reality of what is happening with the phenomenon. A correct, precise statement would require a lot of elaborations and qualifiers. Nevertheless, the "fuzzy" description turns out to be a useful shorthand that saves a lot of time in communicating what is going on ("you know what I mean").

===Cognition===
In [[psychophysics]], it was discovered that the perceptual distinctions we draw in the mind are often more definite than they are in the real world. Thus, the brain actually tends to "sharpen up" or "enhance" our perceptions of differences in the external world. 
*Between black and white, we are able to detect only a limited number of shades of gray, or colour gradations (there are "[[Absolute threshold|detection thresholds]]").&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Knoblauch, "Color Vision", in: ''Steven's handbook of experimental psychology, Vol 1: sensation and perception'' (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Motion blur]] refers to the loss of detail when a person looks at a fast-moving object, or is moving fast while the eyes are focused on something stationary. In a movie reel, the human eye can detect a sequence of up to 10 or 12 still images per second. At around 18 to 26 frames per second, the brain will "see" the sequence of individual images as a moving scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tarantola, "Why Frame Rate Matters". Gizmodo.com, 14 January 2015.[https://gizmodo.com/why-frame-rate-matters-1675153198]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are more gradations and transitions in reality, than our conceptual or perceptual distinctions can capture, then it could be argued that how those distinctions will actually apply, must ''necessarily'' become vaguer at some point.

===Novelty===
In interacting with the external world, the human mind may often encounter new, or partly ''new phenomena or relationships'' which cannot (yet) be sharply defined given the background knowledge available, and by known distinctions, associations or generalizations.

{{Quotation|"Crisis management plans cannot be put 'on the fly' after the crisis occurs. At the outset, information is often [[vague]], even contradictory. Events move so quickly that decision makers experience a sense of loss of control. Often denial sets in, and managers unintentionally cut off information flow about the situation" - [[L. Paul Bremer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Paul Bremer]], "Corporate governance and crisis management", in: ''Directors &amp; Boards'', Winter 2002&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Chaos===
It also can be argued that fuzzy concepts are generated by a certain sort of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or way of working which evades definite distinctions, makes them impossible or inoperable, or which is in some way chaotic. To obtain concepts which are not fuzzy, it must be possible to [[Test method|test]] out their application in some way. But in the absence of any relevant clear distinctions, lacking an orderly environment, or when everything is "in a state of [[flux]]" or in transition, it may not be possible to do so, so that the amount of fuzziness increases.

==Everyday occurrence==

Fuzzy concepts often play a role in the creative process of forming new concepts to understand something. In the most primitive sense, this can be observed in infants who, through practical experience, learn to identify, distinguish and generalise the correct application of a concept, and relate it to other concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Piaget]] &amp; [[Bärbel Inhelder]], ''The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence''. New York: Basic Books, 1958; Philip J. Kelman &amp; Martha E. Arterberry, ''The cradle of knowledge: development of perception in infancy''. Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fuzzy concepts may also occur in scientific, journalistic, programming and philosophical activity, when a thinker is in the process of clarifying and defining a newly emerging concept which is based on distinctions which, for one reason or another, cannot (yet) be more exactly specified or validated. Fuzzy concepts are often used to denote [[Complexity|complex]] phenomena, or to describe something which is developing and changing, which might involve shedding some old meanings and acquiring new ones.

===Areas===
*In [[meteorology]], where changes and effects of complex interactions in the atmosphere are studied, the weather reports often use fuzzy expressions indicating a broad trend, likelihood or level. The main reason is that the forecast can rarely be totally exact for any given location.
*In [[biology]], protein complexes with multiple structural forms are called [[fuzzy complex]]es. The different conformations can result in different, even opposite functions. The conformational ensemble is modulated by the environmental conditions. Post-translational modifications or alternative splicing can also impact the ensemble and thereby the affinity or specificity of interactions. [[Genetic fuzzy systems]] use [[algorithms]] or [[genetic programming]] which simulate natural evolutionary processes, in order to understand their structures and parameters.
*In [[medical diagnosis]], the assessment of what the symptoms of a patient are often cannot be very exactly specified, since there are many possible qualitative and quantitative gradations in severity, incidence or frequency that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Seising, "On the absence of strict boundaries — Vagueness, haziness, and fuzziness in philosophy, science, and medicine". ''Applied Soft Computing'', Vol 8, 2008, pp. 1232–1242, at p. 1235.&lt;/ref&gt; Different symptoms may also overlap to some extent. These gradations can be difficult to measure, it may cost a lot of time and money, and so the medical professionals might use approximate "fuzzy" categories in their judgement of a medical condition or a patient's condition. Although it may not be exact, the diagnosis is often useful enough for treatment purposes. Fuzzy logic is increasingly employed in diagnostic and medical equipment capable of measuring gradations of a condition.&lt;ref&gt;Kazem Sadegh-Zadeh "The Fuzzy Revolution: Goodbye to the Aristotelian Weltanschauung". In: ''Artificial Intelligence in Medicine'', 21, 2001, pp. 18–19.[http://www.iiia.csic.es/~puyol/SEIAD2001/publicacions/sadegh.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[information services]] fuzzy concepts are frequently encountered because a customer or client asks a question about something which could be interpreted in different ways, or, a document is transmitted of a type or meaning which cannot be easily allocated to a known type or category, or to a known procedure. It might take considerable inquiry to "place" the information, or establish in what framework it should be understood.
*In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] which aims to study the structure of subjective experience without preconceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Priest, Theories of the mind. London: Penguin Books, 1991, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; an important insight is that how someone experiences something can be influenced ''both'' by the influence of the thing being experienced itself, but ''also'' by how the person responds to it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammond, Jane Howarth and Russell Keat, ''Understanding Phenomenology''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the actual experience the person has, is shaped by an "interactive object-subject relationship". To describe this experience, fuzzy categories are often necessary, since it is often impossible to predict or describe with great exactitude what the interaction will be, and how it is experienced.
*In [[translation]] work, fuzzy concepts are analyzed for the purpose of good translation. A concept in one language may not have quite the same meaning or significance in another language, or it may not be feasible to translate it literally, or at all.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Griebel, "Fuzzy concepts in translators’ minds". In: Valérie Dullion, ''Between specialised texts and institutional contexts – competence and choice in legal translation''. Amsterdam:  John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2017. (Special issue of ''Translation and Translanguaging in Multilingual Contexts'', Vol. 3, No. 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have concepts which do not exist in another language, raising the problem of how one would most easily render their meaning. In [[computer-assisted translation]], a technique called [[Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)|fuzzy matching]] is used to find the most likely translation of a piece of text, using previous translated texts as a basis.
*In [[hypnotherapy]], fuzzy language is deliberately used for the purpose of trance induction. Hypnotic suggestions are often couched in a somewhat vague, general or ambiguous language requiring interpretation by the subject. The intention is to distract and shift the conscious awareness of the subject away from external reality to her own internal state. In response to the somewhat confusing signals she gets, the awareness of the subject spontaneously tends to withdraw inward, in search of understanding or escape.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Havens (ed.), ''The wisdom of Milton H.  Erickson, Volume I: hypnosis and hypnotherapy''. New York: Irvington Publishers, 1992, p. 106. Joseph O'Connor &amp; John Seymour (ed.), ''Introducing neuro-linguistic programming''. London: Thorsons, 1995, p. 116f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[business]] and [[economics]], it was discovered that "we are guided less by a correct exact knowledge of our self-interest than by a socially learned, evolved, intuitive grasp derived from mental shortcuts ([[Framing effect (psychology)|frames]], reference points, envy, addiction, temptation, fairness)".&lt;ref&gt;Francese Trillas, "Fuzzy logic and modern economics." In:  Rudolf Seising, Enric Trillas &amp; [[Janusz Kacprzyk]] (eds.), ''Towards the future of fuzzy logic''. Basel: Springer International Publishing, 2015, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, economic preferences are often ''fuzzy'' preferences, a highly important point for suppliers of products and services. Fuzzy set empirical methodologies are increasingly used by economic analysts to analyze the extent to which members of a population belong to a specific market category, because that can make a big difference to business results.
*In [[sexology]],  sex and gender are conceptualized by gender pluralists as a spectrum or continuum, or a set of scaled characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Surya Monro, ‘’Bisexuality’’. Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea that people are either heterosexual [[men]], heterosexual [[women]], [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexual]] or [[transsexual]] is far too simplistic; [[gender identity]] is a matter of degree, a graded concept, which for that very reason is a ''fuzzy'' concept with unsharp boundaries. For example, somebody who is "mainly" heterosexual, may occasionally have had non-heterosexual contacts, without this warranting a definite "bisexual" label. A great variety of sexual orientations are possible and can co-exist. In the course of history, typical male or female gender roles and gender characteristics can also gradually change, so that the extent to which they express "masculine" or "feminine" traits is, at any time, a matter of degree, i.e. fuzzy. 
*In [[politics]], it can be highly important and problematic how exactly a conceptual distinction is drawn, or indeed whether a distinction is drawn at all; distinctions used in administration may be deliberately sharpened, or kept fuzzy, due to some political motive or [[Political power|power]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart Kosko]], "Yes, Candidates, There Is a Fuzzy Math". ''New York Times'', 7 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians may be deliberately vague about some things, and very clear and explicit about others; if there is information that proves their case, they become very precise, but if the information doesn't prove their case, they become vague or say nothing. 
*In [[statistical]] research, it is an aim to measure the magnitudes of phenomena. For this purpose, phenomena have to be grouped and categorized, so that distinct and discrete counting units can be defined. It must be possible to allocate all observations to mutually exclusive categories, so that they are properly quantifiable. Survey observations do not spontaneously transform themselves into countable data; they have to be identified, categorized and classified in such a way, that identical observations can be grouped together, and that observations are not counted twice or more.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Gordon &amp; David Bendien, "Standard classifications". ''New Zealand Statistics Review'', September 1993, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed questionnaire ensures that the questions are interpreted in the same way by all respondents, and that the respondents are really able to answer them within the formats provided. Again, for this purpose, it is a requirement that the concepts being used are exactly and comprehensibly defined for all concerned, and not fuzzy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Bauer et al., "Vague concepts in survey questions. A general problem illustrated with the left-right scale." SSRN Electronic Journal, April 2014.[http://pablobarbera.com/static/vague-concepts.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; There could be a margin of measurement error, but the amount of error must be kept within tolerable limits, and preferably its magnitude should be known.
*In [[theology]] an attempt is made to define more precisely the meaning of [[spirtuality|spiritual]] concepts, which refer to how human beings construct the meaning of human existence, and, often, the relationship people have with a [[supernatural]] world. Many spiritual concepts and beliefs are fuzzy, to the extent that, although abstract, they often have a highly personalized meaning, or involve personal interpretation of a type that is not easy to define in a cut-and-dried way. A similar situation occurs in [[psychotherapy]]. The Dutch theologian Kees de Groot has explored the imprecise notion that [[psychotherapy]] is like an "implicit [[religion]]", defined as a "fuzzy concept" (it all depends on what one means by "psychotherapy" and "religion").&lt;ref&gt;C.N. de Groot, "Sociology of religion looks at psychotherapy." ''Recherches sociologiques'' (Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), Vol. 29, No. 2, 1998, pp. 3–17 at p. 4.[http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=76988]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher of spirituality [[Ken Wilber]] argued that "nothing is 100% right or wrong", things merely "vary in their degree of incompleteness and dysfunction"; no one and nothing is 100% good or evil, each just varies "in their degree of ignorance and disconnection". This insight suggests, that ''all'' human valuations can be considered as graded concepts, where each qualitative judgement has at least implicitly a sense of quantitative proportion attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Manson, "The rise and fall of Ken Wilber", markmanson.net, 4 June 2012.[https://markmanson.net/ken-wilber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[legal system]], it is essential that rules are interpreted and applied in a standard way, so that the same sorts of cases and the same sorts of circumstances are treated equally. Otherwise one would be accused of arbitrariness,&lt;ref&gt;That is, in applying rules, the rules are not consistently followed, and the pattern of their application therefore does not follow rules.&lt;/ref&gt; which would not serve the interests of justice. Consequently, lawmakers aim to devise definitions and categories which are sufficiently precise, so that they are not open to different interpretations. For this purpose, it is critically important to remove fuzziness, and differences of interpretation are typically resolved through a court ruling based on evidence. Alternatively, some other procedure is devised which permits the correct distinction to be discovered and made.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see e.g. Ralf Posche, "Ambiguity And Vagueness In Legal Interpretation", in: Lawrence M. Solan &amp; Peter M. Tiersma (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law''. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp. 128-144.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Business administration|administration]], [[Archive|archiving]] and [[accounting]], fuzziness problems in interpretation and boundary problems can arise, because it is not clear to what category exactly a case, item, document, transaction or piece of data belongs. In principle, each case, event or item must be allocated to the correct category in a procedure, but it may be, that it is difficult to make the appropriate or relevant distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;David Henry, "Fuzzy Numbers', ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', 3 October 2004.[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-10-03/fuzzy-numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalities===
It could be argued that many concepts used fairly universally in daily life (e.g. "love", "God", "health",  "social", "tolerance" etc.) are ''inherently or intrinsically'' fuzzy concepts, to the extent that their meaning can never be completely and exactly specified with logical operators or objective terms, and can have multiple interpretations, which are at least in part purely subjective. Yet despite this limitation, such concepts are not meaningless. People keep using the concepts, even if they are difficult to define precisely.

===Multiple meanings===
It may also be possible to specify one personal meaning for the concept, without however placing restrictions on a different use of the concept in other contexts (as when, for example, one says "this is what I mean by X" in contrast to other possible meanings). In ordinary speech, concepts may sometimes also be uttered purely randomly; for example a child may repeat the same idea in completely unrelated contexts, or an [[Expletive attributive|expletive]] term may be uttered arbitrarily. A feeling or sense is conveyed, without it being fully clear what it is about.

[[Happiness#definitions|Happiness]] may be an example of a word with variable meanings depending on context.

===Ambiguities===
Fuzzy concepts can be used deliberately to create [[ambiguity]] and [[vagueness]], as an evasive tactic, or to bridge what would otherwise be immediately recognized as a [[contradiction]] of terms. They might be used to indicate that there is definitely a connection between two things, without giving a complete specification of what the connection is, for some or other reason. This could be due to a failure or refusal to be more precise. But it could also could be a prologue to a more exact formulation of a concept, or to a better understanding of it.

==Efficiency==

Fuzzy concepts can be used as a practical method to describe something of which a complete description would be an unmanageably large undertaking, or very time-consuming; thus, a simplified indication of what is at issue is regarded as sufficient, although it is not exact.

===Popper===
There is also such a thing as an "economy of distinctions", meaning that it is not helpful or efficient to use more detailed definitions than are really necessary for a given purpose. In this sense, [[Karl Popper]] rejected [[pedant]]ry and commented that:

{{Quotation| "...it is always undesirable to make an effort to increase precision for its own sake — especially linguistic precision — since this usually leads to loss of clarity, and to a waste of time and effort on preliminaries which often turn out to be useless, because they are bypassed by the real advance of the subject: one should never try to be more precise than the problem situation demands. I might perhaps state my position as follows. Every increase in clarity is of intellectual value in itself; an increase in precision or exactness has only a pragmatic value as a means to some definite end..."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Unended quest: an intellectual autobiography''. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The provision of "too many details" could be disorienting and confusing, instead of being enlightening, while a fuzzy term might be sufficient to provide an orientation. The reason for using fuzzy concepts can therefore be purely pragmatic, if it is not feasible or desirable (for practical purposes) to provide "all the details" about the meaning of a shared symbol or sign. Thus people might say "I realize this is not exact, but you know what I mean" – they assume practically that stating all the details is not required for the purpose of the communication.

===Fuzzy logic gambit===
[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]] picked up this point, and drew attention to a "major misunderstanding" about applying fuzzy logic. It is true that the basic aim of fuzzy logic is to make what is imprecise more precise. Yet in many cases, fuzzy logic is used paradoxically to "imprecisiate what is precise", meaning that there is a deliberate tolerance for imprecision for the sake of simplicity of procedure and economy of expression. 

In such uses, there is a tolerance for imprecision, because making ideas more precise would be unnecessary and costly, while "imprecisiation reduces cost and enhances tractability" (tractability means "being easy to manage or operationalize"). Zadeh calls this approach the "Fuzzy Logic Gambit" (a gambit means giving up something now, to achieve a better position later).

In the Fuzzy Logic Gambit, "what is sacrificed is precision in [quantitative] value, but not precision in meaning", and more concretely, "imprecisiation in value is followed by precisiation in meaning". Zadeh cited as example [[Fuzzy control system|Takeshi Yamakawa]]'s programming for an [[inverted pendulum]], where differential equations are replaced by fuzzy if-then rules in which words are used in place of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lotfi Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]], "What is fuzzy logic?". ''IFSA Newsletter'' (International Fuzzy Systems Association), Vol. 10, No. 1, March 2013. Takeshi Yamakawa "Stabilization of an Inverted Pendulum by a High-speed Fuzzy Logic Controller Hardware System". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Vol.32, pp. 161–180, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy vs. Boolean===
Common use of this sort of approach, particularly in programming, has led some logicians to regard fuzzy logic merely as an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (a [[two-valued logic]] or binary logic is simply replaced with a [[many-valued logic]]). 

However, Boolean concepts have a logical structure which differs from fuzzy concepts. An important feature in Boolean logic is, that an element of a set can also belong to any number of other sets; even so, the element ''either'' does, ''or'' does not belong to a set (or sets). By contrast, whether an element belongs to a fuzzy set is a matter of degree, and not always a definite yes-or-no question.

All the same, the Greek mathematician Costas Drossos suggests in various papers that, using a "non-standard" mathematical approach, we could also construct fuzzy sets with Boolean characteristics and Boolean sets with fuzzy characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. C. A. Drossos, "Foundations of fuzzy sets: A nonstandard approach". ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'', Volume 37, Issue 3, 28 September 1990, pp. 287-307.&lt;/ref&gt; This would imply, that in practice the boundary between fuzzy sets and Boolean sets is itself fuzzy, rather than absolute. For a simplified example, we might be able to state, that a concept ''X'' is definitely applicable to a finite set of phenomena, and definitely not applicable to all other phenomena. Yet, within the finite set of relevant items, ''X'' might be ''fully'' applicable to one subset of the included phenomena, while it is applicable only “to some varying extent or degree” to another subset of phenomena which are also included in the set.

==Clarifying methods==
In [[mathematical logic]], [[computer programming]], [[philosophy]] and [[linguistics]] fuzzy concepts can be analyzed and defined more accurately or comprehensively, by describing or modelling the concepts using the terms of [[fuzzy logic]] or other [[substructural logic]]s. More generally, clarification techniques can be used such as:

*1. Contextualizing the concept by defining the setting or situation in which the concept is used, or how it is used appropriately  ([[Context (language use)|context]]).
*2. Identifying the [[intention]], [[purpose]], aim or goal associated with the concept ([[teleology]] and [[design]]).
*3. Comparing and contrasting the concept with related ideas in the present or the past ([[comparative]] and [[comparative research]]).
*4. Creating a [[Conceptual model|model]], likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[prototype]] or [[narrative]] which shows what the concept is about or how it is applied ([[isomorphism]] or [[simulation]]).
*5. ''Probing the [[Presupposition|assumptions]]'' on which a concept is based, or which are associated with its use ([[critical thought]], [[tacit assumption]]).
*6. ''[[Map (mathematics)|Map]]ping or [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]ing'' the applications of the concept using some basic [[parameters]], or using some diagrams or flow charts to understand the relationships between elements involved ([[Visualization (graphics)|visualization]] and [[concept map]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guy W. Mineau et al. (eds.), ''Conceptual graphs for knowledge representation''. Berlin: Springer, 1993. Tru Hoang Cao, ''Conceptual graphs and fuzzy logic''. Berlin: Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*7. Examining ‘’how likely’’ it is that the concept applies, statistically or intuitively ([[probability theory]]).
*8. Specifying relevant ''conditions'' to which the concept applies, as a procedure ([[computer programming]], [[formal concept analysis]]).
*9. [[Abstract and concrete|Concretizing]] the concept – finding specific examples, illustrations, details or cases to which it applies ([[Exemplification theory|exemplar]], [[exemplification]]).
*10. ''Reducing or restating'' fuzzy concepts in terms which are simpler or similar, and which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy ([[Computer algebra#Simplification|simplification]], [[dimensionality reduction]], [[plain language]], [[KISS principle]] or [[concision]]).
*11. Trying out a concept, by using it in interactions, practical work or in communication, and assessing the feedback to understand how the boundaries and distinctions of the concept are being drawn ([[trial and error]] or [[pilot experiment]]). 
*12. Engaging in a structured [[dialogue]] or repeated [[discussion]], to exchange ideas about how to get specific about what it means and how to clear it up ([[Scrum (software development)|scrum method]]).
*13. Allocating different applications of the concept to different but related ''sets'' ([[Boolean logic]]).
*14. Identifying ''operational rules'' defining the use of the concept, which can be stated in a language and which cover all or most cases ([[material conditional]]).
*15. [[Categorization|Classifying, categorizing, grouping]], or inventorizing all or most cases or uses to which the concept applies ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[cluster analysis]] and [[typology (statistics)|typology]]).
[[File:Operationalization of Free and Fair Judiciary.png|thumb|400px|An [[operationalization]] diagram, one method of clarifing fuzzy concepts.]]
*16. Applying a ''[[meta-language]]'' which includes fuzzy concepts in a more inclusive categorical system which is not fuzzy ([[meta]]).
*17. Creating a ''[[Measurement|measure]] or [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]]'' of the degree to which the concept applies ([[metrology]]).
*18. Examining the ''distribution patterns'' or distributional frequency of (possibly different) uses of the concept ([[statistics]]).
*19. Specifying a series of [[logical operators]] or inferential system which captures all or most cases to which the concept applies ([[algorithm]]).
*20. ''Relating'' the fuzzy concept to other concepts which are not fuzzy or less fuzzy, or simply by ''replacing'' the fuzzy concept altogether with another, alternative concept which is not fuzzy yet "works the same way" ([[Proxy (statistics)|proxy]])
*21. Engaging in [[meditation]], or taking the proverbial "run around the block" to clarify the mind, and thus improve precision of thought about the definitional issue ([[self-care]]).

In this way, we can obtain a more exact understanding of the meaning and use of a fuzzy concept, and possibly decrease the amount of fuzziness. It may not be possible to specify all the possible meanings or applications of a concept completely and exhaustively, but if it is possible to capture the majority of them, statistically or otherwise, this may be useful enough for practical purposes.

==Defuzzification==
{{main|Defuzzification}}
A process of [[defuzzification]] is said to occur, when fuzzy concepts can be logically described in terms of [[fuzzy set]]s, or the relationships between fuzzy sets, which makes it possible to define variations in the meaning or applicability of concepts as ''quantities''. Effectively, qualitative differences are in that case described more precisely as quantitative variations, or quantitative variability. Assigning a numerical value then denotes the magnitude of variation along a scale from zero to one.

The difficulty that can occur in judging the fuzziness of a concept can be illustrated with the question ''"Is this one of those?"''. If it is not possible to clearly answer this question, that could be because "this" (the object) is itself fuzzy and evades definition, or because "one of those" (the concept of the object) is fuzzy and inadequately defined.

Thus, the source of fuzziness may be in (1) the nature of the reality being dealt with, (2) the concepts used to interpret it, or (3) the way in which the two are being related by a person.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Timothy Williamson, ''Vagueness''. London: Routledge, 1996, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that the personal meanings which people attach to something are quite clear to the persons themselves, but that it is not possible to communicate those meanings to others except as fuzzy concepts.

==Research==
The term INAH (interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus), first proposed in 1989 by a group of the University of California at Los Angeles, refers to 4 previously undescribed cell groups of the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area (PO-AHA) of the human brain, which is a structure that influences [[gonadotropin]] secretion, maternal behaviour, and sexual behavior in several mammalian species. There are four nuclei in the PO-AHA (INAH1-4). One of these nuclei, INAH-3, was found to be 2.8 times larger in the male brain than in the female brain regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=L.S.|last2=Hines|first2=M.|last3=Shryne|first3=J.E.|last4=Gorski|first4=R.A.|title=Two sexually dimorphic cell groups in the human brain.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=Feb 1989|volume=9|issue=2|pages=497–506|pmid=2918374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study authored by [[Simon LeVay]] and published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggests that the region is an important biological [[Neural substrate|substrate]] with regard to [[sexual orientation]]. This article reported the INAH-3 to be smaller on average in [[homosexual]] men than in [[heterosexual]] men, and in fact has approximately the same size in homosexual men as in heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Central Nervous System Dimorphisms Related to Reproductive Behaviors" Dale Purves ed., ''Neuroscience'', 2:ed (2001) Online https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=neurosci.section.2127&lt;/ref&gt; Further research has found that the INAH3 is smaller in volume in homosexual men than in heterosexual men because homosexual men have a higher neuronal packing density (the
number of neurons per cubic millimeter) in the INAH3 than heterosexual men; there is no difference in the number or cross-sectional area of [[neuron]]s in the INAH3 of homosexual versus heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=ByneINAH3HIV&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byne|first=William|last2=Tobet|first2=Stuart|last3=Mattiace|first3=Linda A.|last4=Lasco|first4=Mitchell S.|last5=Kemether|first5=Eileen|last6=Edgar|first6=Mark A.|last7=Morgello|first7=Susan|last8=Buchsbaum|first8=Monte S.|last9=Jones|first9=Liesl B.|date=2001-09-01|title=The Interstitial Nuclei of the Human Anterior Hypothalamus: An Investigation of Variation with Sex, Sexual Orientation, and HIV Status|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X01916800|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=40|issue=2|pages=86–92|doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1680|pmid=11534967}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Bynetrend|group=note|In their study, Byne et al. found that there was a trend for the INAH3 to be smaller in homosexual men than heterosexual men though the size difference did not quite reach statistical significance by the test that they employed. LeVay notes that Byne et al. used a two-tailed t-test, which is the appropriate test in cases where there is no advance prediction about the direction of a difference. However, LeVay explains that because his 1991 study had determined the INAH3 to be smaller in homosexual versus heterosexual men, using a one-tailed test would have been appropriate. In addition, a one-tailed test would have found a statistically significant difference in INAH3 size between homosexual and heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simon LeVay|title=Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973767-3|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It has also been found that there is no effect of HIV infection on the size of INAH3, that is, HIV infection cannot account for the observed difference in INAH3 volume between homosexual and heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=ByneINAH3HIV/&gt;

LeVay noted three possibilities that could account for his findings: 1. The structural differences in INAH3 between homosexual and heterosexual males were present prenatally or in early life and aided in establishment of the men’s sexual orientation; 2. The differences appeared postnatally as a result of the men’s sexual feelings or behavior and; 3. Both the differences in INAH3 and sexual orientation are linked to some third [[confounding variable]] (such as a developmental event in prenatal or early life). LeVay found the first possibility most probable and noted that the second possibility was unlikely in light of various homologous studies in other species.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeVay|first1=S.|last2=Hamer|first2=D.H.|title=Evidence for a biological influence in male homosexuality.|journal=Scientific American|date=May 1994|volume=270|issue=5|pages=44–9|pmid=8197444|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0594-44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proven that in rats, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) appears during the perinatal sensitive period as a consequence of the dependence of its constituent neurons on circulating androgen, thus offering indirect support for the first possibility. After this period, even extreme interventions, such as castration, have little effect on the size of the nucleus, which would help contradict the second possibility of behavior changing brain structure.&lt;ref name="Gorski 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorski|first1=R.A.|last2=Gordon|first2=J.H.|last3=Shryne|first3=J.E.|last4=Southam|first4=A.M.|title=Evidence for a morphological sex difference within the medial preoptic area of the rat brain.|journal=Brain Research|date=Jun 16, 1978|volume=148|issue=2|pages=333–46|pmid=656937|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(78)90723-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Döhler 1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Döhler|first1=K.D.|last2=Coquelin|first2=A.|last3=Davis|first3=F.|last4=Hines|first4=M.|last5=Shryne|first5=J.E.|last6=Gorski|first6=R.A.|title=Pre- and postnatal influence of testosterone propionate and diethylstilbestrol on differentiation of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area in male and female rats.|journal=Brain Research|date=Jun 8, 1984|volume=302|issue=2|pages=291–5|pmid=6733514|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(84)90242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the human INAH-3 is the homologue of the rat’s SDN-POA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simon LeVay|title=Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973767-3|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koutcherov 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koutcherov|first1=Y.|last2=Paxinos|first2=G.|last3=Mai|first3=J.K.|title=Organization of the human medial preoptic nucleus.|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=Jul 20, 2007|volume=503|issue=3|pages=392–406|pmid=17503490|doi=10.1002/cne.21355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have studied correlations between INAH-3 volume and other aspects of sexual identity. A study of [[transgender]] individuals by neuroanatomist [[Dick Swaab]] found male-to-female transgenders to have a size and number of neurons of INAH-3 closer to a normal female range, and that female-to-male transgenders have a size and number of INAH-3 neurons closer to a normal male range. This finding that the size of the INAH-3 more closely corresponded to the gender the subject identified with rather than their biological or chromosomal gender has since been repeated, but is still controversial due to potential confounds of hormone replacement therapy.&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia-Falgueras|first1=A.|last2=Swaab|first2=D.F.|title=A sex difference in the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus: relationship to gender identity.|journal=Brain : A Journal of Neurology|date=Dec 2008|volume=131|issue=Pt 12|pages=3132–46|pmid=18980961|doi=10.1093/brain/awn276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sillyolme.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/the-incredable-shrinking-brain/] Kay Brown (2010), "the Incredible Shrinking Brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">An '''international medical graduate''' ('''IMG'''), earlier known as a '''foreign medical graduate''' ('''FMG'''), is a [[physician]] who has graduated from a medical school outside of the country where he or she intends to practice. Generally, the medical school of graduation is one listed in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED) as accredited by the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] or the [[World Health Organization]].

Medical schools around the world vary in education standards, curricula, and evaluation methods. Many countries have their own certification program, equivalent to the ECFMG in the United States. The purpose of [[ECFMG]] Certification is to assess the readiness of international medical graduates to enter clinical specialty training programs as [[resident physician]]s and fellowship programs in the United States.

== License requirements by country ==

The requirements to obtain a license to practice varies by country and often by state or province.

===Australia===
{{main article|Overseas trained doctors in Australia}}

IMGs (or Overseas Trained Doctors) who wish to be licensed in [[Australia]] must apply to the [[Australian Medical Council|Australian Medical Council (AMC)]] to arrange an appropriate assessment pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/pub/downloads/359-applying-to-amc|title=IMG guides:   Applying to the Australian Medical Council| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard pathway involves an IMG sitting a series of assessments, including AMC MCQ Exam and AMC clinical exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ass/apo/sp |title= Assessments &amp; examinations: Standard pathway| publisher= Australian Medical Council |date=27 February 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC MCQ Exam consists of 150 MCQs organized through computer adaptive scoring.

For AMC clinical exam, a candidate is required to pass 12 out of 16 cases including one compulsory case in each of Gyne and pediatrics.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary exams and obtained AMC certification can then apply to an Australian specialty training positions.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080613222254/http://www.amc.org.au/prelim1.asp]

Australia is in the process of establishing a national registration process for all the doctors under Medical Board of Australia.

In 2010 the [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)]] launched an [[Inquiry process into registration and accreditation processes for international medical graduates]] which reported in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=haa/overseasdoctors/report.htm | title=Inquiry into Registration Processes and Support for Overseas Trained Doctors | publisher= Parliament of Australia | accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Several organizations have put pressure on the government such as the Association For Access to Health Care Services, and Association of International Physicians and Surgeons of [[Ontario]]. Bill 97, Increasing Access to Qualified Health Professionals for Ontarians Act, was passed in 2008, requiring the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] to provide adequate numbers of doctors by issuing transitional licenses. However, the college has not complied with the law.

In addition to undergoing the regular licensing process as required of all Canadian medical school graduates, IMGs must pass the [[Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada|LMCC]] Evaluating Examination. IMGs in Canada also have a harder time getting into residency programs compared to Canadian graduates &amp;mdash; only ten percent of IMG applicants get a position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readersdigest.ca/health/healthy-living/why-canada-shutting-out-doctors readersdigest.ca - Why Is Canada Shutting Out Doctors?]: "In 2003, 625 international graduates competed. Only 67—about ten percent—found a position"&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of United States M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs and are thus exempt from the Evaluating Examination; graduates of U.S. osteopathic medical schools ''are'' considered IMGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcc.ca/en/exams/ee/apply.shtml |title=Evaluating Examination: Apply |publisher=Medical Council of Canada |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{update section|date=December 2017}}
[[Image:2007ACGME-2.PNG|250px|right]][[Image:2007ACGME-3.PNG|250px|right]]
Graduates of Canadian M.D. programs are ''not'' considered IMGs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/2010ib/ibfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: 1. What Is ECFMG Certification? |work=2010 ECFMG Information Booklet |publisher=Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates |accessdate=2010-04-16 |quote=Medical schools outside the United States and Canada vary in their educational standards and curricula. The purpose of ECFMG Certification is to assess whether graduates of these schools are ready to enter U.S. residency and fellowship programs that are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian physician with an [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] are qualified to take the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]]. However, since the 2010s, the process of obtaining a license was becoming increasingly complicated&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; India has exported more physicians to the United States than any other foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16774871&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathway====
The main pathway for IMGs who wish to be licensed as physicians in the [[United States]] is to complete a U.S. [[residency (medicine)|residency]] hospital program. The general method to apply for residency programs is through the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (abbreviated NRMP, also called "the Match"). To participate in the NRMP, an IMG is required to have an [[ECFMG certification]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html nrmp.org &gt; Independent Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084648/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by the "rank order list certification deadline" time (usually in February of the year of the match).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html nrmp.org &gt; 2012 Main Match Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035954/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Updated 05/19/2011&lt;/ref&gt; To acquire an ECFMG certification, the main requirements are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfmg.org/2011ib/ibmec.html ecfmg.org &gt; Medical Education Credentials] Last update: September 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Completion of [[USMLE Step 1]], [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge]] and [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills]]
*A medical diploma of [[medical education]] taken at an institution registered in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED)
In comparison, regular graduates from medical schools in the United States and Canada need to complete USMLE Steps 1 and 2 as well, but can participate in the NRMP while still doing their final year of medical school before acquiring their medical diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html nrmp.org &gt; U.S. Seniors &gt; Registering with the NRMP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084824/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, taking regular administrative delays into account, and with residency programs starting around July, there is a gap of at least half a year for IMGs between graduation from medical school and beginning of a residency program.

Those IMGs who have passed the necessary [[USMLE]] exams and obtained the ECFMG certification can then apply to U.S. residency positions via the [[NRMP]] and [[Electronic Residency Application Service|ERAS]].

USMLE exam scores are considered in the [[National Resident Matching Program#International medical graduates|matching process]] for entering a residency program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Catherine Rampell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html|title=Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors|publisher=New York Times|date=August 11, 2018|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study came to the result that almost half of IMGs were unsuccessful in their first attempts in the pursuit of a U.S. residency position, and three-quarters began a residency after five years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742193?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Participation in U.S. Graduate Medical Education by Graduates of International Medical Schools] By Jolly, Paul PhD; Boulet, John PhD; Garrison, Gwen PhD; Signer, Mona M. MPH. Posted: 05/23/2011; ''Academic Medicine''. 2011;86(5):559-564.&lt;/ref&gt; It also indicated that IMGs were considerably older when they first applied for a residency position than are most U.S. medical graduates, with mean age of IMGs when the ECFMG certificate was issued being 32.4 years, with a standard deviation of 5.8 years.&lt;ref name=jolly2011/&gt;

All applicants to residency programs in [[California]] need a ''{{visible anchor|Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter}}'' (PTAL), colloquially called a "California Letter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ö/www.ecfmg.org/eras/applicants-documents-pta.html Postgraduate Training Authorization Letter (PTAL) or “California Letter”], [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]]. Last updated June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Obtainment of a PTAL requires graduation from a [[medical school]] listed by the Medical Board of California, which is more stringent than the [[International Medical Education Directory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm.mednet.ucla.edu/IMG/residency/PTAL.asp University of California, Los Angeles - PTAL], Updated January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires having a [[Social Security number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Applicants/Physicians_and_Surgeons/#8 The Medical Board of California - Physicians and Surgeons]. Retrieved May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[United States visa|visa]] requirements, non-U.S.-citizen doctors usually enter via the J1 or the H-1B visa. The J1 reqires a 2-year home residence after completion of training in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/life-career/immigration-information-international-medical-graduates|title=Immigration Information for International Medical Graduates|publisher=American Medical Association|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-1B visa does not have this 2-year home residence requirement, but further requires the [[USMLE Step 3]]. And initially, a B-1 visitor visa is required for taking the USMLE Step 2 clinical skills examination and the USMLE Step 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seak.com/blog/uncategorized/10-biggest-immigration-mistakes-physicians-make/|title=The 10 Biggest Immigration Mistakes Physicians Make|website=www.seak.com|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality of care==
One study examining quality of care by international medical graduates is noted as follows.  "One-quarter of practicing physicians in the United States are graduates of international medical schools. The quality of care provided by doctors educated abroad has been the subject of ongoing concern. Our analysis of 244,153 hospitalizations in Pennsylvania found that patients of doctors who graduated from international medical schools and were not U.S. citizens at the time they entered medical school had significantly lower mortality rates than patients cared for by doctors who graduated from U.S. medical schools or who were U.S. citizens and received their degrees abroad. The patient population consisted of those with congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. We found no significant mortality difference when comparing all international medical graduates with all U.S. medical school graduates".&lt;ref name=Norcini_1467&gt;{{Harvnb|Norcini|2010|pp=1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data on older Medicare patients admitted to hospital in the US showed that patients treated by international graduates had lower mortality than patients cared for by US graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.j273 |title=Quality of care delivered by general internists in US hospitals who graduated from foreign versus US medical schools: observational study |publisher=BMJ |date=3 February 2017| doi=10.1136/bmj.j273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2927">'''''Liber Scintillarum''''' (literally "The Book of Sparks") is a late seventh or early eighth-century [[Patristic anthology|florilegium]] of [[biblical]] and [[patristic]] sayings in [[Latin]]. It was compiled by '''Defensor''', a monk who in the preface identifies himself as a member of [[Ligugé Abbey|St Martin's Abbey]] at Ligugé, near Poitiers, and who wrote the work at the behest of his teacher [[Ursinus the Abbot|Ursinus]], the abbot of St Martin's. Virtually nothing is known of the monk beyond what the preface offers us. The compilation was written sometime between 636, when the important source [[Isidore of Seville]] died, and about 750, when the earliest extant manuscript appears to have been produced.

The "sparks" (''scintillae'') of the title refer to sayings (such as maxims and proverbs) of the Lord and his saints, which have been excerpted from the Bible and the Church Fathers, and rearranged into as many as 81 chapters. The headings of these chapters refer mainly to vices (e.g. avarice, fornication), virtues (patience, wisdom), devotional practices (confession, prayer) and common themes of human life (marriage, feasting).

In the early part of the eleventh century, a copy of the Latin text was accompanied by an [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] [[Old English]] gloss, for which a little space between the lines was available. It is found in [[British Library|BL]], Royal MS 7 C IV, together with ''De vitiis et peccatis'', again with an interlinear Old English gloss. It belonged to [[Rochester Cathedral]] Priory and probably joined the [[Old Royal Library]] as part of the spoils of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], like the [[Rochester Bestiary]].

A '''lovemap''' is a person's internal blueprint for their ideal erotic situations. The concept was originated by sexologist [[John Money]] in his discussions of how people develop their sexual preferences. Money defined it as "a developmental representation or template in the mind and in the brain depicting the idealized lover and the idealized program of sexual and erotic activity projected in imagery or actually engaged in with that lover."{{sfn|Money|1986|p=290}}

== History ==
John Money first wrote the word ''lovemap'' in 1980 for an article later published under the title "Pairbonding and [[Limerence]]". Prior to that, Money discussed lovemaps in a precursory form with his students in lectures, employing the term as a replacement for the expression, "an idealized and highly idiosyncratic image."{{sfn|Money|1986|p = xv-xvi}} In a 1997 review article, Money revisited  the concept of 'love map' and expanded it to three categories, ''haptoerotic'' (cutaneous), ''morphoerotic'' (visual) and ''gnomoerotic'' (narrative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Money, J. | year = 1997 | title = Evolutionary sexology: the hypothesis of song and sex | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 399–402 | doi=10.1016/s0306-9877(97)90035-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the concept of "love maps", applied to [[interpersonal relationships]], has found some acceptance and is frequently referenced in books about love and sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] and Chris McLaughlin discussed it in their 2001 book ''The Science of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilson, G.D.  |author2=McLaughlin, C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Science of Love|location=Great Britain | publisher=Fusion Press|year=2001|isbn=1-901250-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and expression ==
Money describes the formation of an individual's lovemap as similar to the acquisition of a native language, in that it becomes established at an early age{{sfn|Money|1986|p = 14}} and bears the mark of the person's unique individuality, like an accent in a spoken language.{{sfn|Money|1986|p = 19}} According to Money, lovemaps are not present at birth, but begin to develop shortly thereafter, and manifest in full after puberty.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=xvi}} The individual may not discover certain aspects of their lovemap until triggered by a relevant experience (such as pornography use) later in life.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 16}}

Psychologist Gregory Lehne states that lovemaps may be influenced by genetic or prenatal factors, but that their specific content must come from the senses.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 14}} Lehne says that some perceptions are encoded in the person's lovemap after becoming sexualized for uncertain reasons, possibly because of their [[Association (psychology)|associations]] with provoked or random [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] [[arousal]], [[sexual arousal]], or hormonal fluctuations.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 14}} These associations typically form during experiences before the age of eight, Money proposes.{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 15}}{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} As an example, Lehne argues that a child who accidentally becomes sexually aroused during [[spanking]] may go on to develop an interest in [[erotic spanking]].{{sfn|Lehne|2009|p = 15}} Once formed, the lovemap is extremely difficult to alter.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}}

A lovemap is usually quite specific as to details of the physiognomy, build, race, color, temperament, and manner of the ideal lover.{{sfn|Money|1986|p = 19}} Money suggests that love is like an [[ink blot test]], where pair-bonding occurs if projections (shaped by a person's lovemap) on the other are mutual, typically in a courtship phase of mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Money|first=John|title=Gay, Straight, and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-505407-5|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
Money analyzed a large range of sexual predilections and behaviors using his model of the "lovemap".  In his book on the subject, some of the most notable concepts include:{{sfn|Money|1986}}

*[[Heterosexual]] lovemaps – love mappings associative to persons of the opposite gender.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=xvi}}
*[[Homosexual]] lovemaps – love mappings associative to persons of the same gender.
*Vandalized lovemaps –  According to Money, these occur when the love mapping process becomes traumatized, as when a young child is either exposed to, or forced to participate in such inappropriate behaviors as [[child sexual abuse]], incest, or sexual sado-masochism.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=17-19}} He states that such a lovemap is typically formed between the ages of five and eight.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} A vandalized lovemap may be paraphilic or hyposexual.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}}
*[[paraphilia|Paraphilic]] lovemaps – when lust is attached to fantasies and practices that are socially forbidden, disapproved, ridiculed, or penalized.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} According to Money, it can result from lust being displaced from a "vandalized" area of an ordinary lovemap following abuse.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=19}} Alternatively, Money suggests that a paraphilic lovemap could arise from a non-sexual childhood experience that induced genital arousal in the child.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=20}}

[[File:BattleofSluys.jpeg|thumb|Melee aboard ships at the [[Battle of Sluys]] 1340 (BNF Fr. 2643, 15th century)]]
[[File:Battle of Lutzen.jpg|thumb|''[[Battle of Lutzen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]]'' by  [[Carl Wahlbom]] depicting a melee in which King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] was killed on 16 November 1632.]]
'''Melee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|l|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|eɪ}}, French: '''mêlée''' {{IPA-fr|mɛle|}}) or '''pell-mell''' battle  generally refers to disorganized [[close combat]] in battles fought at abnormally close range with little central control once it starts.{{sfn|OED|2015}}

In the 1579 translation of [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives of the noble Grecians and Romanes'', [[Sir Thomas North]] uses the term 'pelmel' to refer to a disorganized retreat.&lt;ref name="phrases"&gt;https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/pell-mell.html&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was later used in its current spelling in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', 1594:

{{Quote
|text= "March on, ioine brauelie, let vs to it pell mell, If not to heauen then hand in hand to hell."
}}

The phrase comes from the French expression ''pêle-mêle'', a rhyme based on the old French ''mesler'', meaning to mix or mingle. 
&lt;ref name="phrases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pell-mell&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term ''melee'' was first used in English in c. 1640 (also derived from the old French ''mesler'',&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/melee#English&lt;/ref&gt;  but the Old French stem survives in ''[[:wikt:medley|medley]]'' and ''[[:wikt:meddle|meddle]]'').{{sfn|OED|2015}}

In military aviation, a melee has been described as "[a]n air battle in which several aircraft, both friend and foe, are confusingly intermingled".{{sfn|Kumar|DeRemer|Marshall|2004|p=462}}

[[Lord Nelson]] described his tactics for the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] as inducing a "pell mell battle" focused on engagements between individual ships where the superior morale and skill of the [[Royal Navy]] would prevail.{{sfn|Fremont-Barnes|2005|p=38}}

The [[destroyer]] night action of the second [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on 13 November 1942, was so utterly chaotic and the ships were so intermingled that an officer on {{USS|Monssen|DD-436|6}} later likened it to "a barroom brawl after the lights had been shot out".&lt;ref name="guadalcanal441"&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Museum of Particularly Bad Art logo.jpg|right|180px|thumbnail|The logo for Museum of Particularly Bad Art. (Picture of [[Elvis]] and [[Priscilla Presley]])]]
'''The Museum of Particularly Bad Art Exhibition''' (MOPBA) is an annual event held on [[Chapel Street]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] celebrating poor [[art]] forms, primarily in the forms of [[painting]]s and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. MOPBA relies on a core group of art pieces owned by [[Helen Round]] but the public are invited to enter pieces that are their own or that have been found that are considered poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/eish/kitsch-becomes-an-artform-in-australia-418024|title=Kitsch becomes an artform in Australia - IOL News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/er-dette-arets-verste-kunstverk_-1.7300495|title=Er dette årets verste kunstverk?|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event primarily is a charity event that funds three charities within the [[City of Stonnington|Stonnington]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/16/1089694559243.html|title=Art that's no oil painting - Arts - www.theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The entries from the public are judged by meeting one point on the selection criteria. Selection points for entry of an art piece into MOPBA are:

* Completely devoid of technical skill ([[Colour]], [[Lightness (color)|tone]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[shading]]);
* Unusual, poor or tasteless subject matters;
* Passion of the [[artist]] but is driven by an [[Amateur|uneducated hand]];
* An instinctual feeling that the art piece is poor.

The founder of MOPBA is [[Helen Round]]. In the early 1990s, ''[[Foreign Correspondent (TV series)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' reported on the [[Museum of Bad Art]] in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], United States. At this point of her life, Round was in the process of establishing a retail shop named "Fat Helen’s Bric a Brac shop", that was to specialise in the [[kitsch]], inane and tasteless.  It was also a hobby of Round's to peruse [[op shop]]s, [[garage sale]]s and [[Market (place)|market]]s. She was inspired by what she came across in these places and commenced her pursuit of collecting and preserving the mediocre. Round started collecting in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Particularly Bad Art: About|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=2|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/kunst-in-melbourne-museum-der-haesslichkeiten-a-583180.html|title=Kunst in Melbourne: Museum der Hässlichkeiten|date=9 October 2008|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Round  has collected 200 examples of original art of poor taste. Of notable fame is the original portrait of [[actor]] [[Scott Baio]] that Round located in an op shop in the suburb of [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/suzanne-carbone/amanda-needs-love/2005/08/02/1122748636560.html|title=Amanda needs to be loved - Carbone &amp; Money - Opinion - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;

The Exhibition awards the Itchiball Prize to the submitted art piece that is considered by the public to be the poorest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/deepend/dreadful-art/3339714|title=Dreadful art|date=8 August 2006|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is a play on words and parody of the '[[Archibald Prize]]', Australia's most important [[portrait]]ure painting award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Itchyball Prize|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=8|website=Museum of Particularly Bad Art|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanowood''' is heat-insulating material made from wood that is considered a slightly better insulator than [[Styrofoam]]. Unlike Styrofoam, the material is more environmentally friendly and [[biodegradable]]. It is considered light, strong and created entirely from stripped-down wood fibers.&lt;ref name="phys_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' an invention that could reduce humanity's carbon footprint| author = Khan, Amina| work = phys.org| date = 2018-03-12| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://phys.org/news/2018-03-nanowood-humanity-carbon-footprint.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The material was invented by engineer, Liangbing Hu and his team at [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. The material "when exposed to the solar spectrum" reflected approximately 95% of radiation energy absorbing only approximately 2%. Silica aerogel "absorbed approximately 20% and transmits approximately 60% of the radiative heat" according to study authors.&lt;ref name="lati_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' a new invention that could greatly reduce humanity's carbon footprint| last = Khan | first = Amina| work = latimes.com| date = 10 March 2018| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-nanowood-20180309-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanowood could potentially save "billions in energy costs" according to Tian Li, a team member.&lt;ref name="smit_Coul"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Could 'Nanowood' Replace Styrofoam?| last = Matchar | first = Emily| work = Smithsonian| date = 2018-03-26| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/could-nanowood-replace-styrofoam-180968575/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National University of Northwestern Buenos Aires''' (''Universidad Nacional del Noroeste de la Provincia de Buenos Aires'' or UNNOBA hereafter) is a [[national university]] with head office and campus in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junín]], [[Argentina]]. This city concentrates 80% of the activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=20139 |title = Guillermo Tamarit: "La centralidad del proyecto UNNOBA está en Junín y eso nadie lo discute" |author = [[Diario Democracia]] (Junín) |date = April 29, 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100502034000/http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=20139 |archivedate = May 2, 2010 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly 2 out of 3 students take classes there.&lt;ref name="inscriptos"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=23549 |title = Aumenta la cantidad de inscriptos en Genética, Informática e Ingenieria y decrece en Abogacia |author = [[Diario Democracia]] (Junín) |date = December 29, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has also a campus in [[Pergamino, Buenos Aires Province|Pergamino]] city.

The UNNOBA was created on December 16, 2002, as the composition between the [[w:es:Centro Universitario Regional Junín|Junín Regional University Center]] (CURJ), started in 1990, which reached 15,000 students, and the [[w:es:Centro Regional Universitario de Pergamino|Pergamino Regional University Center]] (CRUP), established a year later, which had 2,600 students.

The University may establish more branches in other locations of the influence area which covers the northwest of the province of Buenos Aires, southern Santa Fe and Córdoba and northeast of La Pampa.

The university and the municipality of Junín, are the mainstays of the Buenos Aires Northwestern Technological Center (''Polo Tecnológico del Noroeste Bonaerense'') and the Regional Research Laboratory in Biofuels, both projects located in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junin]]. On the other hand, the Pergamino Biotechnology Center the School of Agricultural, Environmental and Natural Sciences (ECANA in Spanish) are being developed in [[Pergamino]]. It also has agreements with the [[National Agricultural Technology Institute]] (INTA) and the [[Maiztegui National Human Viral Disease Institute]] (INEVH) of [[Pergamino]].

The '''Optical Ground Station''' ('''OGS''') '''telescope''' (or '''ESA Space Debris Telescope'''), installed in the [[Teide Observatory]], has been built by [[Carl Zeiss]]. The telescope is ESA's [[Optical Ground Station]] forming a part of the [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] experiment and is operated by the IAC ([[Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias]]) and Ataman Science S.L.U.

The telescope is a 1 m [[Ritchey-Chretien]] / Coudé telescope with field of view of 0.7 degrees, supported by an English-built mount inside a dome 12.5 metre in diameter. Its main purposes are: 
# to be the optical ground station of the [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis telecommunications satellite]] (the project from which the telescope takes its name)
# to make surveys of [[space debris]] in different orbits around the Earth, 
# to test observing strategies of [[near-Earth object]]s as part of ESA's [[Space Situational Awareness programme]], and
# to make scientific astronomical night observations.

It is equipped with a cryogenically cooled mosaic CCD-Camera of 4k*4k pixels. The detection threshold is between 19th and 21st [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]], which corresponds to a capability to detect [[space debris]] objects as small as 10&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[geostationary ring]]. As a large part of the observation time is dedicated to space debris surveys, in particular the observation of [[space debris]] in the [[geostationary ring]] and in [[geostationary transfer orbit]]s, the term ESA Space Debris Telescope became used very frequently. Space debris surveys are carried out every month, centered on New Moon.

Since 2006, the telescope has also been used as a receiver station for quantum communication experiments (such as [[Bell test experiments| testing Bell inequalities]], [[quantum cryptography]], [[quantum teleportation]]), with the sender station being 143&amp;nbsp;km away in the [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory|observatory on La&amp;nbsp;Palma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLWO7YJ6H_index_0.html |title=ESA observatory breaks world quantum teleportation record |work=ESA press release |date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible because this telescope can be tilted to a near-horizontal position to point it at La&amp;nbsp;Palma, which many large astronomical telescopes are unable to do.

{{linguistics}}
An '''orthography''' is a set of [[convention (norm)|conventions]] for [[writing]] a [[language]]. It includes norms of [[spelling]], [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].

Most significant languages in the modern era are written down, and for most such languages a standard orthography has been developed, often based on a [[standard language|standard variety]] of the language, and thus exhibiting less [[dialect]] variation than the spoken language. Sometimes there may be variation in a language's orthography, as between [[American and British English spelling differences|American and British spelling]] in the case of [[English orthography]]. In some languages orthography is regulated by [[List of language regulators|language academies]], although for many languages (including English) there are no such authorities, and orthography develops in a more organic way. Even in the latter languages, a significant amount of consensus arises [[natural language|naturally]], although a maximum of consistency or standardization occurs only when [[linguistic prescription|prescriptively]] imposed according to [[style guide]]s.

== Etymology and meaning ==
The English word ''orthography'' dates from the 15th century. It comes from the [[French language|French]] ''orthographie'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''orthographia'', which derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀρθός ''orthós'', "correct", and γράφειν ''gráphein'', "to write".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=orthography&amp;searchmode=none orthography], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthography is largely concerned with matters of [[spelling]], and in particular the relationship between [[phoneme]]s and [[grapheme]]s in a language.&lt;ref&gt;Seidenberg, Mark S. 1992. "Beyond Orthographic Depth in Reading: Equitable Division of Labor." In: Ram Frost &amp; Leonard Katz (eds.). ''Orthography, Phonology, Morphology, and Meaning'', pp. 85–118. Amsterdam: Elsevier, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Mark. 2007. "Lexicography for Your Friends." In Terry Crowley, Jeff Siegel, &amp; Diana Eades (eds.). ''Language Description, History and Development: Linguistic Indulgence in Memory of Terry Crowley.'' pp. 395–406. Amsterdam: Benjamins, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements that may be considered part of orthography include [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas, Florian. 1996. ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthography thus describes or defines the set of symbols used in writing a language, and the rules regarding how to use those symbols.

Most [[natural language]]s developed as oral languages, and [[writing system]]s have usually been crafted or adapted as ways of representing the spoken language. The rules for doing this tend to become [[standardization|standardized]] for a given language, leading to the development of an orthography that is generally considered "correct". In [[linguistics]] the term ''orthography'' is often used to refer to any method of writing a language, without judgment as to right and wrong, with a scientific understanding that orthographic standardization exists on a spectrum of strength of convention. The original sense of the word, though, implies a dichotomy of correct and incorrect, and the word is still most often used to refer specifically to a thoroughly standardized, [[prescriptive linguistics|prescriptively]] correct, way of writing a language. A distinction may be made here between [[emic and etic|''etic'' and ''emic'']] viewpoints: the purely descriptive (etic) approach, which simply considers any system that is actually used—and the emic view, which takes account of language users' perceptions of correctness.

==Units and notation==
Orthographic units, such as letters of an [[alphabet]], are technically called [[grapheme]]s. These are a type of [[abstraction]], analogous to the [[phoneme]]s of spoken languages; different physical forms of written symbols are considered to represent the same grapheme if the differences between them are not significant for meaning. For example, different forms of the letter "b" are all considered to represent a single grapheme in the orthography of, say, English.
 
Graphemes or sequences of them are sometimes placed between angle brackets, as in {{angbr|b}} or {{angbr|back}}. This distinguishes them from phonemic transcription, which is placed between slashes ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/bæk/}}), and from [[phonetic transcription]], which is placed between square brackets ({{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[bæk]}}).

== Types ==
The [[writing systems]] on which orthographies are based can be divided into a number of types, depending on what type of unit each symbol serves to represent. The principal types are ''[[logogram|logographic]]'' (with symbols representing words or [[morpheme]]s), ''[[syllabary|syllabic]]'' (with symbols representing syllables), and ''[[alphabet]]ic'' (with symbols roughly representing [[phoneme]]s). Many writing systems combine features of more than one of these types, and a number of detailed classifications have been proposed. Japanese is an example of a language that can be written in all three: logographic [[kanji]], syllabic [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], and alphabetic [[romaji]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koda|first1=Keiko|last2=Zehler|first2=Annette M.|title=Learning to Read Across Languages|date=Mar 3, 2008|publisher=Routledge|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Correspondence with pronunciation==
Orthographies that use [[alphabet]]s and [[syllabary|syllabaries]] are based on the principle that the written symbols ([[grapheme]]s) correspond to units of sound of the spoken language: [[phoneme]]s in the former case, and [[syllable]]s in the latter. However, in virtually all cases, this correspondence is not exact. Different languages' orthographies offer different degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. [[English orthography]], for example, is highly irregular, whereas the orthographies of languages such as [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] represent pronunciation much more faithfully, although the correspondence between letters and phonemes is still not exact. [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] orthographies are remarkably consistent: approximation of the principle "one letter per sound".

An orthography in which the correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are highly complex or inconsistent is called a ''[[deep orthography]]'' (or less formally, the language is said to have ''irregular spelling''). An orthography with relatively simple and consistent correspondences is called ''shallow'' (and the language has ''regular spelling'').

One of the main reasons for which spelling and pronunciation deviate is that [[sound change]]s taking place in the spoken language are not always reflected in the orthography, and hence spellings correspond to historical rather than present-day pronunciation. One consequence of this is that many spellings come to reflect a word's [[morphophonemic]] structure rather than its purely phonemic structure (for example, the English regular past tense [[morpheme]] is consistently spelled ''-ed'' in spite of its different pronunciations in various words). This is discussed further at {{slink|Phonemic orthography|Morphophonemic features}}.

The [[syllabary]] systems of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[hiragana]] and [[katakana]]) are examples of almost perfectly shallow orthographies—the kana correspond with almost perfect consistency to the spoken syllables, although with a few exceptions where symbols reflect historical or morphophonemic features: notably the use of ぢ ''ji'' and づ ''zu'' (rather than じ ''ji'' and ず ''zu'', their pronunciation in standard Tokyo dialect) when the character is a voicing of an underlying ち or つ (see [[rendaku]]), and the use of は, を, and へ to represent the sounds わ, お, and え, as relics of [[historical kana usage]].

The Korean ''[[hangul]]'' system was also originally an extremely shallow orthography, but as a representation of the modern language it frequently also reflects morphophonemic features.

For full discussion of degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in alphabetic orthographies, including reasons why such correspondence may break down, see [[Phonemic orthography]].

===Defective orthographies===
An orthography based on the principle that symbols correspond to phonemes may, in some cases, lack characters to represent all the phonemes or all the phonemic distinctions in the language. This is called a [[defective orthography]]. An example in English is the lack of any indication of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Another is the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''th'', which represents two different phonemes (as in ''then'' and ''thin''). A more systematic example is that of [[abjad]]s like the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] alphabets, in which the short vowels are normally left unwritten and must be inferred by the reader.

When an alphabet is borrowed from its original language for use with a new language—as has been done with the [[Latin alphabet]] for many languages, or Japanese [[Katakana]] for non-Japanese words—it often proves defective in representing the new language's phonemes. Sometimes this problem is addressed by the use of such devices as [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (such as ''sh'' and ''ch'' in English, where pairs of letters represent single sounds), [[diacritic]]s (like the [[caron]] on the letters ''š'' and ''č'', which represent those same sounds in [[Czech language|Czech]]), or the addition of completely new symbols (as some languages have introduced the letter ''[[w]]'' to the Latin alphabet) or of symbols from another alphabet, such as the [[rune]] ''[[Thorn (letter)|þ]]'' in Icelandic.

After the classical period, Greek developed a lowercase letter system that introduced [[diacritic]] marks to enable foreigners to learn pronunciation and in some cases, grammatical features. However, as pronunciation of letters changed over time, the [[diacritic]] marks were reduced to representing the stressed syllable. In Modern Greek typesetting, this system has been simplified to only have a single accent to indicate which syllable is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Bulley, Michael. 2011. "Spelling Reform: A Lesson from the Greeks". ''English Today'', 27(4), p. 71. {{doi|10.1017/S0266078411000575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Porton Down is situated just northeast of the village of [[Porton (village)|Porton]] near [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]], in [[Wiltshire]], England. To the northwest lies the [[MoD Boscombe Down]] airfield operated by [[QinetiQ]]. On some maps, the land surrounding the complex is identified as a "Danger Area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordnance Survey map number '184' of the 'Landranger' series of maps|url= http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk |website=Online Ordnance Survey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of government use==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:2inchMortarsPortonDown.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[2 inch Medium Mortar|2-inch mortar]] trials, 1917&lt;/center&gt;]]
Porton Down opened in 1916 as the War Department Experimental Station, shortly renamed to the Royal Engineers Experimental Station, for testing chemical weapons in response to German use of this means of war in 1915.  The laboratory's remit was to conduct research and development regarding chemical weapons agents used by the British armed forces in the [[First World War]], such as [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]], and [[phosgene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C14396|title=War Office, Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Defence : Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment, later Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment, Porton: Reports and Technical Papers|format=5136 files and volumes |publisher=The National Archives|date=1918-1993|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Work at Porton started in March 1916. At the time, only a few cottages and farm buildings were scattered on the downs at Porton and [[Idmiston]]. By May 1917, the focus for anti-gas defence and respirator development had moved from London to Porton Down, and by 1918, the original two huts had become a large hutted camp with 50 officers and 1,100 other ranks. After the [[Armistice]] in 1918, Porton Down was reduced to a skeleton staff.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical and Biological Defence at Porton Down 1916-2000|last=Carter|first=G B|date=2000|location=London|publisher=The Stationery Office|pages=126–127|isbn=0-11-772933-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post First World War ===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:PortonOfficialHistory.JPG|thumb|200px|'[[Chemical and Biological Defence at Porton Down, 1916-2000]]' by [[G.B. Carter]], Porton Down's official historian.]] --&gt;
In 1919, the War Office set up the Holland Committee to consider the future of chemical warfare and defence. By 1920, the Cabinet agreed to the Committee's recommendation that work should continue at Porton Down. From that date a slow permanent building programme began, coupled with the gradual recruitment of civilian scientists. By 1922, there were 380 servicemen, 23 scientific and technical civil servants, and 25 "civilian subordinates". By 1925, the civilian staff had doubled.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

By 1926, the chemical defence aspects of Air Raid Precautions (ARP) for the civilian population was added to the Station's responsibilities. In 1929 the Royal Engineers Experimental Station became the Chemical Warfare Experimental Station (CWES) (1929–1930), and in 1930 the Chemical Defence Experimental Station (CDES) (1930–1948).&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;
In 1930 Britain ratified the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] with reservations, which permitted the use of chemical warfare agents only in retaliation. By 1938, the international situation was such that the Cabinet authorised offensive chemical warfare research and development and the production of war reserve stocks of chemical warfare agents by the chemical industry.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

=== Second World War ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:PortonDownOrdnanceSurveyMap.JPG|thumb|200px|An Ordnance Survey map of 'Dstl, Porton Down' and its surrounding 'Danger Areas' as of 12 April 2007. Note that 'Danger Areas' are spotted all over [[Salisbury Plain]] from Porton Down outwards.

A smaller view of this is available online&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk Online Ordnance Survey small map&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], research at CDES concentrated on chemical weapons such as [[nitrogen mustard]]. As [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies penetrated Germany, they discovered operational stockpiles of munitions and weapons that contained new chemical warfare agents, including highly toxic organophosphorous [[nerve agent]]s such as [[sarin]], unknown to Britain and the Allies at the time.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

To examine biological weapons, a highly secret separate department, called the Biology Department, Porton (BDP), was established within CDES in 1940, under veteran microbiologist [[Paul Fildes]]. Its focus included [[anthrax]] and [[botulinum toxin]], and in 1942 it famously carried out tests of an anthrax bio-weapon at [[Gruinard Island]]. In 1946, it was renamed the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) and, in 1957, the Microbiological Research Establishment (MRE). 

The [[Common Cold Unit]] (CCU) was sometimes confused with the MRE, with which it occasionally collaborated but was not officially connected. The CCU was located at Harvard Hospital, Harnham Down, on the west side of [[Salisbury]].&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

=== Post-war period ===

When the Second World War ended, the advanced state of German technology regarding the organophosphorous nerve agents, such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[sarin]] and [[soman]], had surprised the Allies, who were eager to capitalise on it. Subsequent research took the newly discovered German nerve agents as a starting point, and eventually [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] nerve agent was developed at Porton Down in 1952.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, research and development at Porton Down was aimed at providing Britain with the means to arm itself with a modern nerve agent-based capability and to develop specific means of defence against these agents. In the end these aims came to nothing on the offensive side because of the decision to abandon any sort of British chemical warfare capability in favour of nuclear weapons. On the defensive side there were years of difficult work to develop the means of prophylaxis, therapy, rapid detection and identification, decontamination, and more effective protection of the body against nerve agents, capable of exerting effects through the skin, the eyes and respiratory tract.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;
[[File:Scientist Looking at Containers of Liquid at Porton Down MOD 45154411.jpg|thumb|upright|Scientist looking at containers of liquid at Porton Down]]
Tests were carried out on servicemen to determine the effects of nerve agents on human subjects, with one recorded death due to a nerve gas experiment. There have been persistent allegations of unethical [[human experimentation]] at Porton Down, such as those relating to the death of Leading Aircraftman [[Ronald Maddison]], aged 20, in 1953. Maddison was taking part in sarin nerve agent toxicity tests; sarin was dripped onto his arm and he died shortly afterwards. 

In the 1950s, the station, now renamed the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment (CDEE), became involved with the development of [[CS gas|CS]], a riot-control agent, and took an increasing role in trauma and [[wound ballistics]] work. Both these facets of Porton Down's work had become more important because of the unrest and increasing violence in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt; 

On 1 August 1962, Geoffrey Bacon, a scientist at the Microbiological Research Establishment, died from an accidental infection of the plague bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. In the same month an [[autoclave]] exploded, shattering two windows. Both incidents generated considerable media coverage at the time.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

In 1970, the senior establishment at Porton Down was renamed the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) for the next 21 years. Preoccupation with defence against nerve agents continued, but in the 1970s and 1980s, the Establishment was also concerned with studying reported chemical warfare by Iraq against Iran and against its own [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt; 

Porton Down was the laboratory where initial samples of the [[Ebola]] virus were sent in 1976 during the first confirmed outbreak of the disease in Africa. The laboratory now contains samples of some of the world's most aggressive pathogens, including Ebola, anthrax and the plague, and is leading the UK's current research into viral inoculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The front line of the UK's Ebola prevention efforts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28773174|website=BBC News|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

Until 2001 the military installation of Porton Down was part of the UK government's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] (DERA) when it was split into [[QinetiQ]], initially a fully government-owned company, and the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]] (Dstl). Dstl incorporates all of DERA's activities deemed unsuitable for the privatisation planned for QinetiQ, particularly Porton Down.

In 2013 Dstl scientists tested samples from Syria for Sarin, which is still manufactured there, to test soldiers' equipment.&lt;ref name=mosley/&gt;

Public Health England have planned since September 2015&lt;ref name=itv&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/story/2015-09-17/public-health-england-to-move-from-porton-down-in-wiltshire/ Public Health England to move from Porton Down in Wiltshire] itv.com. 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to transfer their Porton Down staff to [[Harlow]], and in July 2017 it had bought a vacant site from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), aiming to consolidate operations there in 2024&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-40547531 Harlow site to be home to government's public health arm] BBC News,9 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Site names ===

The location's government use has been split into two separately controlled locations since 1979: the original military establishment under the Ministry of Defence, and the site to the south under the Department of Health, which had been opened in 1951 for the Microbiological Research Establishment, then in 1979 transferred to the Ministry of Health to focus on public health research, with the Defence aspects returning to the then-titled Chemical Defence Establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=P|last2=Carter|first2=G|title=From Biological Warfare to Healthcare: Porton Down, 1940-2000|date=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK| isbn=9780333753835| pages=280| edition=1st| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_Biological_Warfare_to_Healthcare.html?id=7rx7QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associated locations ===

==== Sutton Oak, Merseyside ====
A factory in Sutton Oak, [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]] was requisitioned in 1917 by the War Department, renamed HM Factory, Sutton Oak and started producing the chemical warfare agent [[Diphenylchlorarsine|diphenyl chloroarsine]]. The site switched to producing [[Adamsite]] in 1922. In 1923 the War Office halted the requisition and purchased the site, renaming it the War Office Research Establishment, a.k.a. Chemical Warfare Research Establishment, and later the Chemical Defence Research Establishment Sutton Oak. During the 1920s, the site switched to producing [[Mustard Gas|mustard gas]] products, starting with the HS variant and adding the HT variant in the 1930s, and also filling armaments. After WW2, the site also produced the [[nerve agent]] [[sarin]] for experimental purposes. The site closed in 1957, with much of the work transferring to Chemical Defence Establishment Nancekuke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.suttonbeauty.org.uk/suttonhistory/poisongas/|website=suttonbeauty.org| title=Magnum Poison Gas Works|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== RRH Portreath, Cornwall ====
This Royal Air Force site, built in 1940, was renamed [[CDE Nancekuke|Chemical Defence Establishment Nancekuke]] in July 1949. Manufacture of sarin in a pilot production facility commenced there in the early 1950s, producing about 20 tons from 1954 until 1956.  It was intended as a stockpile and production facility for the UK's chemical defences during the [[Cold War]], focussed on nerve agents, including small amounts of [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] intended mainly for laboratory test purposes and to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential mass-production; full-scale production of VX agent never took place. In the late 1950s, the chemical weapons production plant was mothballed, but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production could easily re-commence if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|title=Nancekuke Remediation Project|publisher=Ministry of Defence (Archived by The National Archives)|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101208174527/http://www.mod.uk:80/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/DefenceEstateandEnvironment/Nancekuke/|archive-date=8 December 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of concern==

=== Trials ===

==== Open air ====
In 1942, [[Gruinard Island]] was dangerously contaminated with [[anthrax]] after a cloud of anthrax spores was released over the island during a trial. In 1981, a team of activists landed on the island and collected soil samples, a bag of which was left at the door at Porton Down. Testing showed that it still contained anthrax spores and in 1986 the Government felt obliged to take the necessary steps to successfully decontaminate the island.

Between 1963 and 1975 the MRE carried out [[Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments|trials in Lyme Bay]] in which live bacteria were sprayed from a ship to be carried ashore by the wind to simulate an anthrax attack. The bacteria sprayed were the less dangerous ''[[Bacillus globigii]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', but it was later admitted that the bacteria could adversely affect some vulnerable people. The town of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] lay downwind of the spraying. When the trials became public knowledge in the late 1990s, Dorset County Council, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Purbeck District Council demanded a Public Inquiry to investigate the experiments. The Government refused a Public Inquiry but instead commissioned Professor Brian Spratt, to conduct an Independent Review of the possible adverse health effects. He concluded that individuals with certain chronic conditions may have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr23.net/govt/spray_dorset.htm|title=The Dorset Biological Warfare Experiments 1963-75|accessdate= 17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human trials ====
[[File:Rmaddison.jpg|thumb|Leading Aircraftman Ronald Maddison who died an unlawful death at Porton Down in 1953, as determined by a jury in 2004]] Porton Down has been involved in human testing at various points throughout the Ministry of Defence's use of the site. Up to 20,000 people took part in various trials from 1949 up to 1989:&lt;ref name=lsd/&gt; 
From 1999 until 2006, it was investigated under [[Operation Antler (Porton Down investigation)|Operation Antler]]. In 2002 a first inquest and&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2488473.stm Nerve gas inquest to be re-opened] BBC News report, 18 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; in May 2004, a second inquest into the death of [[Ronald Maddison]] during testing of the nerve agent [[sarin]] commenced after his relatives and their supporters had lobbied for many years, which found his death to have been unlawful.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/4013767.stm|title=Nerve gas death was 'unlawful' |date=15 November 2004|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Defence challenged the verdict&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/4459217.stm|title=MoD 'can challenge Porton case'|date=19 April 2005|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was upheld and the government settled the case in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4709526.stm|title=MoD agrees sarin case settlement|date=13 February 2006|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 500 veterans claimed they suffered from the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;David Shukman [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/5018084.stm MOD pays out over nerve gas death] BBC News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, three ex-servicemen were awarded compensation in an out-of-court settlement after they had claimed they were given [[LSD]] without their consent during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=lsd&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4745748.stm|title=MI6 payouts over secret LSD tests|date=24 February 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/24/military.past|title=MI6 pays out over secret LSD mind control tests|last=Evans|first=Rob|date=24 February 2006|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the MoD paid 360 veterans of the tests £3m without admitting liability.&lt;ref name=mosley/&gt;

=== Secrecy ===
Most of the work carried out at Porton Down has to date remained secret. [[Bruce George]], Member of Parliament and Chairman of the [[Defence Select Committee]], told [[BBC News]] on 20 August 1999 that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I would not say that the Defence Committee is micro-managing either DERA or Porton Down. We visit it, but, with eleven members of Parliament and five staff covering a labyrinthine department like the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces, it would be quite erroneous of me and misleading for me to say that we know everything that's going on in Porton Down.

===Use of animals===
Dstl's Porton Down site conducts animal testing. The "three Rs" of "reduce" (the number of animals used), "refine" (animal procedures) and "replace" (animal tests with non-animal tests) are used as the basic code of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100914/text/100914w0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 14 Sep 2010  (pt 0001)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a decrease in animal experimentation in recent years.&lt;ref name="publications.parliament.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100323/text/100323w0002.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 23 Mar 2010  (pt 0002)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dstl complies with all UK legislation relating to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100324/text/100324w0001.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 24 Mar 2010  (pt 0001)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals used include [[mouse|mice]], [[guinea pig]]s, [[rat]]s, pigs, [[ferret]]s, sheep, and non-human [[primate]]s (believed to be marmosets and [[rhesus macaque]]).

Different departments at Porton Down use animal experiments in different ways. Dstl's Biomedical Sciences department is involved with drug evaluation and efficacy testing (toxicology, pharmacology, physiology, behavioural science, human science), trauma and surgery studies, and animal breeding. The Physical Sciences department also uses animals in its "Armour Physics" research.

Like other aspects of research at Porton Down, precise details of animal experiments are generally kept secret. Media reports have suggested they include exposing monkeys to [[anthrax]], draining the blood of pigs and injecting them with ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacteria, and exposing animals to a variety of lethal, toxic nerve agents. Different animals are used for very different purposes. According to a 2002 report from the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Defence, mice are used mainly to research "the development of vaccines and treatments for microbial and viral infections", while pigs are used to "develop personal protective equipment to protect against blast injury to the thorax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F4AAE7BE-9D64-4FB5-A41F-481807F4DB21/0/awac6threport.pdf |title=Sixth Report of the Animal Welfare Advistory Committee|date=February 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503133310/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F4AAE7BE-9D64-4FB5-A41F-481807F4DB21/0/awac6threport.pdf |archivedate=3 May 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UFO claims===
In 2008, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' published a story which said "UFO believers" claimed that alien bodies were taken to Porton Down from the site of an alleged UFO crash on the [[Berwyn range]] in North Wales, an event referred to as the [[Berwyn Mountain UFO incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1030805/New-UFO-witness-reopens-1970s-mystery-Welsh-Roswell.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=New UFO witness reopens 1970s mystery of the 'Welsh Roswell'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dstl states that: "No aliens, either alive or dead have ever been taken to Porton Down or any other Dstl site."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth About Porton Down|URL=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-truth-about-porton-down|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Positivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that certain ("positive") knowledge is based on [[natural phenomena]] and their properties and relations. Thus, information derived from [[sensory experience]], interpreted through [[reason]] and [[logic]], forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"/&gt; Positivism holds that valid knowledge (certitude or [[truth]]) is found only in this [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]].

Verified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as [[empirical evidence]]; thus positivism is based on [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"&gt;John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, ''Sociology'', Seventh Canadian Edition, [[Pearson Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism also holds that [[society]], like the physical world, operates according to general [[Scientific law|laws]]. [[Introspection|Introspective]] and [[intuitive knowledge]] is rejected, as are [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Manion et al." &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Louis |year=2007 |title=Research Methods In Education |pages=9 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00388_4.x |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=55 |last2=Maldonado |first2=Antonio |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the modern sense of the approach was formulated by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/thinkers/Auguste-Comte.php |title=Auguste Comte | encyclopedia = Sociology Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed positivism into a ''[[Religion of Humanity]]''.

==Etymology==
The English noun ''positivism'' was re-imported in the 19th century from the French word ''positivisme'', derived from ''positif'' in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (lat. ''positīvus'') has been used in a similar sense to discuss law ([[positive law]] compared to [[natural law]]) since the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le petit Robert'' s. v. ''positivisme''; ''OED'' s. v. ''positive''&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Overview==

===Antecedents===
Positivism is part of a more general ancient quarrel between [[philosophy]] and [[poetry]], notably laid out by [[Plato]] and later reformulated as a quarrel between the sciences and the [[humanities]],&lt;ref name="Egan1997p114"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Egan |first1=Kieran |author-link1=Kieran Egan (educationist) |year=1997 |title=The Educated Mind |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0-226-19036-5|quote=Positivism is marked by the final recognition that science provides the only valid form of knowledge and that facts are the only possible objects of knowledge; philosophy is thus recognized as essentially no different from science [...] Ethics, politics, social interactions, and all other forms of human life about which knowledge was possible would eventually be drawn into the orbit of science [...] The positivists' program for mapping the inexorable and immutable laws of matter and society seemed to allow no greater role for the contribution of poets than had Plato. [...] What Plato represented as the quarrel between philosophy and poetry is resuscitated in the "two cultures" quarrel of more recent times between the humanities and the sciences.|title-link=The Educated Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato elaborates a critique of poetry from the point of view of philosophy in his dialogues ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' 245a, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 209a, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' 398a, ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' 817 b-d and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, T. J. ''Introduction to Ion.'' London: [[Penguin Books]], 1987, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) popularized the distinction between [[Geisteswissenschaft]] (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften ([[natural science|natural sciences]]).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p.27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration that laws in physics may not be absolute but relative, and, if so, this might be more true of social sciences,&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; was stated, in different terms, by [[G. B. Vico]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico, ''Principi di scienza nuova'', ''Opere'', ed. Fausto Nicolini (Milan: R. Ricciardi, 1953), p. 365–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico, in contrast to the positivist movement, asserted the superiority of the science of the human mind (the humanities, in other words), on the grounds that natural sciences tell us nothing about the inward aspects of things.&lt;ref name="MoreraEsteve1990p13"&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p.13 ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivists===
Positivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larrain |first1=Jorge |year=1979 |title=The Concept of Ideology |location=London |publisher=Hutchinson |page=197 |quote=one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) and [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) believed the [[scientific method]], the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace [[metaphysics]] in the [[history]] of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of [[social research]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"&gt;{{cite book |author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical Sociological Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA103 |year=2002|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-0-631-21348-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911), in contrast, fought strenuously against the assumption that only explanations derived from science are valid.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; He reprised the argument, already found in Vico, that scientific explanations do not reach the inner nature of phenomena&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; and it is humanistic [[knowledge]] that gives us insight into thoughts, feelings and desires.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; Dilthey was in part influenced by the [[Historism|historicism]] of [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt;

===Antipositivism===
{{main article|Antipositivism}}
At the turn of the 20th century the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], rejected the doctrine, thus founding the antipositivist tradition in sociology. Later antipositivists and [[critical theorist]]s have associated positivism with "[[scientism]]"; science ''as [[ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]], ''Technik und Wissenschaft als Ideologie'', Frankfurt am Main: [[Suhrkamp]], 1968, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career (1969),&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg (1969) ''[[The Part and The Whole]]''&lt;/ref&gt; German theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], Nobel laureate for pioneering work in [[quantum mechanics]], distanced himself from positivism by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can any one conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|editor=Ruth Nanda Nanshen|others=Translator: [[Arnold J. Pomerans]]|title=Werner Heisenberg - Physics and Beyond - Encounters and Conversations|series=World Perspectives|volume=42|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|page=213|chapter=Positivism, Metaphysics and Religion|lccn=78095963|oclc=15379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Logical positivism and postpositivism===
{{main article|Logical positivism|Postpositivism}}
In the early 20th century, logical positivism—a descendant of Comte's basic thesis but an independent movement—sprang up in [[Vienna Circle|Vienna]] and grew to become one of the dominant schools in Anglo-American philosophy and the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. Logical positivists (or 'neopositivists') rejected metaphysical speculation and attempted to reduce statements and propositions to pure [[logic]]. Strong critiques of this approach by philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have been highly influential, and led to the development of [[postpositivism]].

===In historiography===
In [[historiography]] the debate on positivism has been characterized by the quarrel between positivism and [[historicism]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; (Historicism is also sometimes termed ''[[historism]]'' in the German tradition.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[François Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], [[Routledge]], 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against positivist approaches in historiography include that [[history]] differs from sciences like [[physics]] and [[ethology]] in [[Theory|subject matter]] and [[Methodology|method]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"/&gt; That much of what history studies is nonquantifiable, and therefore to quantify is to lose in precision. Experimental methods and mathematical models do not generally apply to history, and it is not possible to formulate general (quasi-absolute) laws in history.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other fields===
Positivism in the social sciences is usually characterized by [[quantitative approach]]es and the proposition of quasi-absolute laws. A significant exception to this trend is represented by [[cultural anthropology]], which tends naturally toward [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace, Edwin R.  and Gach, John (2008) ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]] the positivist movement was influential in the development of [[operationalism]]. The 1927 philosophy of science book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' in particular, which was originally intended for physicists, coined the term [[operational definition]], which went on to dominate psychological method for the whole century.&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology's Bridgman vs. Bridgman's Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''Theory and Psychology'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], practising researchers tend to emulate the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a ''de facto'' fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology.&lt;ref name="Boland2012"&gt;[http://positivists.org/blog/economic-positivism Lawrence A. Boland, ''Economic Positivism'' positivists.org 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see  "Law, Legislation and Liberty") rejected positivism in the social sciences as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In [[jurisprudence]], "[[legal positivism]]" essentially refers to the rejection of [[natural law]]; thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a "scientific" view of law.

In the early 1970s, urbanists of the positivist-quantitative school like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] started to question the positivist approach itself, saying that the arsenal of scientific theories and methods developed so far in their camp were "incapable of saying anything of depth and profundity" on the real problems of contemporary cities.&lt;ref name="Portugali2012p51"&gt;Portugali, Juval and Han Meyer, Egbert Stolk (2012) ''Complexity Theories of Cities Have Come of Age'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2VZCQhvfBpIC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 20th century sociology===
In contemporary social science, strong accounts of positivism have long since fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater detail [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, [[replicability]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"&gt;Gartell, David, and Gartell, John. 1996. "Positivism in sociological practice: 1967-1990". ''Canadian Review of Sociology'', Vol. 33 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This positivism is generally equated with "[[quantitative research]]" and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization of this kind of sociology is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"&gt;Boudon, Raymond.  1991.  "Review: What Middle-Range Theories are".  Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 20 Num. 4 pp 519-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 21st century sociology===
Other new movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged to reconcile the overarching aims of social science with postmodern critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis|first=John|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|isbn=978-0-13-800270-1|pages=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straker|first=David|title=Positivism|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/positivism.htm|publisher=changingminds.org|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now at least twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"&gt;Halfpenny, Peter. ''Positivism and Sociology: Explaining Social Life.'' London:Allen and Unwin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological positivism==

===Comte's positivism===
[[File:Buste Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Auguste Comte]]]]
[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1844 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Auguste Comte] in [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' therefore set out to define the empirical goals of sociological method.

{{quotation|"The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand—not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one. ... This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity," which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology."|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)|&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;}}

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general "[[law of three stages]]". The idea bears some similarity to [[Marx]]'s belief that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak (see [[dialectical materialism]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's mentor. Comte intended to develop a secular-scientific ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'', (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; The theological phase of man was based on whole-hearted belief in all things with reference to [[God]]. God, Comte says, had reigned supreme over human existence pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Humanity's place in society was governed by its association with the divine presences and with the church. The theological phase deals with humankind's accepting the doctrines of the church (or place of worship) rather than relying on its rational powers to explore basic questions about existence. It dealt with the restrictions put in place by the religious organization at the time and the total acceptance of any "fact" adduced for society to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Comte describes the metaphysical phase of humanity as the time since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a time steeped in logical [[rationalism]], to the time right after the [[French Revolution]]. This second phase states that the universal rights of humanity are most important. The central idea is that humanity is invested with certain rights that must be respected. In this phase, democracies and dictators rose and fell in attempts to maintain the innate rights of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard von Mises]], ''Positivism: A Study In Human Understanding'', 5 (Paperback, [[Dover Books]], 1968 {{ISBN|0-486-21867-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of the trilogy of Comte's universal law is the scientific, or positive, stage. The central idea of this phase is that individual rights are more important than the rule of any one person. Comte stated that the idea of humanity's ability to govern itself makes this stage inherently different from the rest. There is no higher power governing the masses and the intrigue of any one person can achieve anything based on that individual's free will. The third principle is most important in the positive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; Comte calls these three phases the universal rule in relation to society and its development. Neither the second nor the third phase can be reached without the completion and understanding of the preceding stage. All stages must be completed in progress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte believed that the appreciation of the past and the ability to build on it towards the future was key in transitioning from the theological and metaphysical phases. The idea of progress was central to Comte's new science, sociology. Sociology would "lead to the historical consideration of every science" because "the history of one science, including pure political history, would make no sense unless it was attached to the study of the general progress of all of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 622&lt;/ref&gt; As Comte would say: "from science comes prediction; from prediction comes action."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 566&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philosophy of human intellectual development that culminated in science. The irony of this series of phases is that though Comte attempted to prove that human development has to go through these three stages, it seems that the positivist stage is far from becoming a realization. This is due to two truths: The positivist phase requires having a complete understanding of the universe and world around us and requires that society should never know if it is in this positivist phase. [[Anthony Giddens]] argues that since humanity constantly uses science to discover and research new things, humanity never progresses beyond the second metaphysical phase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre.JPG|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil]]
Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Emile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. As an approach to the [[philosophy of history]], positivism was appropriated by historians such as [[Hippolyte Taine]]. Many of Comte's writings were translated into English by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] writer, [[Harriet Martineau]], regarded by some as the first female sociologist. Debates continue to rage as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Saint-Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993) ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless influential: Brazilian thinkers turned to Comte's ideas about training a scientific elite in order to flourish in the industrialization process. [[Brazil]]'s national [[motto]], ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") was taken from the positivism motto, "Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal", which was also influential in [[Positivism in Poland|Poland]].

In later life, Comte developed a '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

===Proletarian positivism===
[[Fabien Magnin]] was the first working class adherent to Comte's ideas. Comte appointed him as his successor as president of the Positive Society in the event of Comte's death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickering|first1=Mary|title=Auguste Comte: Volume 3: An Intellectual Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnin was in touch with the English positivists [[Richard Congreve]] and [[Edward Spencer Beesly]]. He established the [[Cercle des prolétaires positivistes]] in 1863 which was affiliated to the [[First International]]. [[Eugène Sémérie]] was a psychiatrist who was also involved in the Positivist movement, setting up a positivist club in Paris after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. "Positivism is not only a philosophical doctrine, it is also a political party which claims to reconcile order – the necessary basis for all social activity – with Progress, which is its goal." he wrote.&lt;ref name="FPC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sémérie|first1=Eugène|title=Founding of a Positivist Club|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/comte/1870/semerie.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durkheim's positivism===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the details of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "[[social facts]]" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies, he posited, sociology would be able to determine whether a given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". Durkheim described sociology as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley Ornstein has alleged, in a consumer textbook published by [[Pearson Education]], that accounts of Durkheim's positivism are possibly exaggerated and oversimplified; Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in exactly the same way as natural science, whereas Durkheim saw a far greater need for a distinctly sociological scientific methodology. His lifework was fundamental in the establishment of practical [[social research]] as we know it today—techniques which continue beyond sociology and form the methodological basis of other [[social sciences]], such as [[political science]], as well of [[market research]] and other fields.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=94–98, 100–104|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antipositivism and critical theory===
{{Main article|Antipositivism|Critical theory}}
At the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships—especially among [[ideal type]]s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |pages=239–240 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Weber regarded sociology as the study of [[social action]], using critical analysis and [[verstehen]] techniques. The sociologists [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and [[Charles Cooley]] were also influential in the development of sociological antipositivism, whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophy, [[hermeneutics]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] facilitated the movement in general.

[[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] theory of [[historical materialism]] and critical analysis drew upon positivism,&lt;ref&gt;"Main Currents of Marxism" by Leszek Kolakowski page 331, 327,&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition which would continue in the development of [[critical theory]]. However, following in the tradition of both [[Max Weber|Weber]] and [[Marx]], the critical theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] (in its relation to the cultural [[rationalisation (sociology)|"rationalisation"]] of the modern West) as meaning that scientific thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself. Positivism may be espoused by "[[Technocracy|technocrats]]" who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt; New movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged in order to reconcile postpositivist aims with various so-called '[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]' perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.

===Contemporary positivism===
In the original Comtean usage, the term "positivism" roughly meant the use of scientific methods to uncover the laws according to which both physical and human events occur, while "sociology" was the overarching science that would synthesize all such knowledge for the betterment of society. "Positivism is a way of understanding based on science"; people don't rely on the faith of God but instead of the science behind humanity. "Antipositivism" formally dates back to the start of the twentieth century, and is based on the belief that natural and human sciences are ontologically and epistemologically distinct. Neither of these terms is used any longer in this sense.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt;  Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also become broad, with many philosophies broadly rejecting the scientifically based social epistemology and other ones only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science.  However, positivism (understood as the use of scientific methods for studying society) remains the dominant approach to both the research and the theory construction in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The majority of articles published in leading American sociology and political science journals today are positivist (at least to the extent of being [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] rather than [[qualitative research|qualitative]]).&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;Brett, Paul. 1994. "A genre analysis of the results section of sociology articles". ''English For Specific Purposes''. Vol 13, Num 1:47–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity may be because research utilizing positivist quantitative methodologies holds a greater prestige{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in the social sciences than qualitative work; quantitative work is easier to justify, as data can be manipulated to answer any question.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Linda |last1=Grant |first2=Kathryn B. |last2=Ward |author3=Xue Lan Rong |title=Is There An Association between Gender and Methods in Sociological Research? |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=52 |issue=6 |year=1987 |pages=856–862 |jstor=2095839|doi=10.2307/2095839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}} Such research is generally perceived as being more scientific and more trustworthy, and thus has a greater impact on policy and public opinion (though such judgments are frequently contested by scholars doing non-positivist work).&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}}

===The role of science in social change===
The contestation over positivism is reflected in older (see the [[Positivism dispute]]) and current debates over the proper role of science in the public sphere. [[Public sociology]]—especially as described by [[Michael Burawoy]]—argues that sociologists should use empirical evidence to display the problems of society so they might be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: [http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/ASA%20Presidential%20Address.pdf "For Public Sociology"] ([[American Sociological Review]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3): 183–190.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that critical theory—public sociology in particular—relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologists assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

==Logical positivism==
{{Main article|Logical positivism}}
[[File:Schlick sitting.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Moritz Schlick]], the founding father of logical positivism and the [[Vienna Circle]].]]
[[Logical positivism]] (later and more accurately called logical empiricism) is a school of philosophy that combines [[empiricism]], the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of [[rationalism]], the idea that our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.

Logical positivism grew from the discussions of a group called the "First Vienna Circle" which gathered at the [[Café Central]] before [[World War I]]. After the war [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], a member of that early group, helped bring [[Moritz Schlick]] to Vienna. Schlick's [[Vienna Circle]], along with [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]], propagated the new doctrines more widely in the 1920s and early 1930s.

It was [[Otto Neurath]]'s advocacy that made the movement self-conscious and more widely known. A 1929 pamphlet written by Neurath, Hahn, and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the doctrines of the Vienna Circle at that time. These included: the opposition to all [[metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]] and [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']] propositions; the rejection of metaphysics not as wrong but as meaningless (i.e., not empirically verifiable); a criterion of meaning based on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early work (which he himself later set out to refute){{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; the idea that all knowledge should be codifiable in a single standard language of science; and above all the project of "rational reconstruction," in which ordinary-language concepts were gradually to be replaced by more precise equivalents in that standard language. However, the project is widely considered to have failed.&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of Ptolemy, Hume, d'Alembert, Compte, Mill, and Mach. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—neo-Thomisism, neo-Kantianism, intuitionism, dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and existentialism. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C.

After moving to the United States, Carnap proposed a replacement for the earlier doctrines in his ''Logical Syntax of Language''. This change of direction, and the somewhat differing beliefs of Reichenbach and others, led to a consensus that the English name for the shared doctrinal platform, in its American exile from the late 1930s, should be "logical empiricism."{{cn|date=February 2018}} While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, it has continued to influence philosophy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|volume=IX|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical positivism==
Historical positivism is the [[historiography|historiographical]] view that historical evidence requires no interpretation, the work of the historian being to compile the primary sources, “letting them speak for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://colegiomoz.blogspot.com/2017/11/historiografia-positivista.html?m=1 | title=Historiografia positivista - Colégio-moz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its tenets were later contradicted by [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the Holocaust, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further thinkers&lt;!--'Popper legend' redirects here--&gt;==
Within years of the publication of  [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s book ''A General View of Positivism'' (1848), other scientific and philosophical thinkers began creating their own definitions for positivism. They included [[Émile Zola]], [[Emile Hennequin]], [[Wilhelm Scherer]], and [[Dimitri Pisarev]]. Émile Zola was an influential French [[novelist]], the most important example of the literary school of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], and a major figure in the political liberalization of [[France]].

Emile Hennequin was a Parisian publisher and writer who wrote theoretical and critical pieces. He "exemplified the tension between the positivist drive to systematize literary criticism and the unfettered imagination inherent in literature." He was one of the few thinkers who disagreed with the notion that subjectivity invalidates observation, judgment and prediction. Unlike many positivist thinkers before him, he believed that [[subjectivity]] does play a role in science and society. His contribution to positivism pertains not to science and its objectivity, but rather to the subjectivity of art and the way artists, their work, and audiences interrelate. Hennequin tried to analyse positivism strictly on the predictions, and the mechanical processes, but was perplexed due to the contradictions of the reactions of patrons to artwork that showed no scientific inclinations.

Wilhelm Scherer was a German [[Philology|philologist]], a university professor, and a popular literary historian. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on "hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in 'objective' historical or philological facts". His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.

Dimitri Pisarev was a Russian critic who showed the greatest contradictions with his belief in positivism. His ideas incorporated imagination and style though he did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were "an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position." He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.

[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Stephen Hawking]]]]
[[Stephen Hawking]] was a recent high-profile advocate of positivism, at least in the physical sciences. In ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;31) he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by [[Karl Popper]] and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. ... If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the claim that Popper was a positivist is a common misunderstanding that Popper himself termed the "'''Popper legend'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Stadler]], ''The Vienna Circle: Studies in the Origins, Development, and Influence of Logical Empiricism'', Springer, 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he developed his beliefs in stark opposition to and as a criticism of positivism and held that scientific theories talk about how the world really is, not, as positivists claim, about phenomena or observations experienced by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', 1934, 1959 (1st English ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] regarded Popper as a positivist because of his alleged devotion to a [[unified science]]. However, this was also part of the "Popper legend"; Popper had in fact been the foremost critic of this doctrine of the Vienna Circle, critiquing it, for instance, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', p256 [[Routledge]], London, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science today==
{{See also|Constructive empiricism}}
The key features of positivism as of the 1950s, as defined in the "received view",&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (ed.) 1981. Scientific revolutions. - Oxford Univ. Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; are:
# A focus on science as a product, a linguistic or numerical set of statements;
# A concern with [[axiomatization]], that is, with demonstrating the logical structure and coherence of these statements;
# An insistence on at least some of these statements being testable; that is, amenable to being verified, confirmed, or shown to be false by the empirical observation of reality.  Statements that would, by their nature, be regarded as untestable included the [[teleology|teleological]]; thus positivism rejects much of classical metaphysics.
# The belief that science is markedly cumulative;
# The belief that science is predominantly [[Trans-cultural diffusion|transcultural]];
# The belief that science rests on specific results that are dissociated from the personality and social position of the investigator;
# The belief that science contains theories or research traditions that are largely commensurable;
# The belief that science sometimes incorporates new ideas that are discontinuous from old ones;
# The belief that science involves the idea of the unity of science, that there is, underlying the various scientific disciplines, basically one science about one real world.
# The belief that science is nature and nature is science; and out of this duality, all theories and postulates are created, interpreted, evolve, and are applied.

Positivism is elsewhere{{Non sequitur|date=February 2018}}{{where|date=February 2018}} defined{{by who|date=February 2018}} as the belief that all true knowledge is scientific,&lt;ref name="bullock"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]] and [[Stephen Trombley]], [Eds] ''The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', London: [[Harper-Collins]], 1999, pp. 669–737&lt;/ref&gt; and that all things are ultimately measurable. Positivism is closely related to [[reductionism]], in that both involve the belief that "entities of one kind... are reducible to entities of another,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; such as societies to configurations of individuals, or mental events to neural phenomena. It also involves the contention that "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; and even that "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; or that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

While most social scientists today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology and political science journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;Holmes, Richard.  1997. "Genre analysis, and the social sciences: An investigation of the structure of research article discussion sections in three disciplines". ''English For Specific Purposes'', vol. 16, num. 4:321–337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"/&gt;  It can be thus argued that "natural science and social science [research articles] can therefore be regarded with a good deal of confidence as members of the same genre".&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Positivism dispute}}
Historically, positivism has been criticized for its [[reductionism]], i.e., for contending that all "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events," "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals," and that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

[[Max Horkheimer]] criticized the classic formulation of positivism on two grounds. First, he claimed that it falsely represented human social action.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Theodor Adorno (1903-1969)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adorno/|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first criticism argued that positivism systematically failed to appreciate the extent to which the so-called social facts it yielded did not exist 'out there', in the objective world, but were themselves a product of socially and historically mediated human consciousness.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism ignored the role of the 'observer' in the constitution of social reality and thereby failed to consider the historical and social conditions affecting the representation of social ideas.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism falsely represented the object of study by [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] social reality as existing objectively and independently and labour actually produced those conditions.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Secondly, he argued, representation of social reality produced by positivism was inherently and artificially conservative, helping to support the status quo, rather than challenging it.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This character may also explain the popularity of positivism in certain political circles. Horkheimer argued, in contrast, that critical theory possessed a reflexive element lacking in the positivistic traditional theory.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

Some scholars today hold the beliefs critiqued in Horkheimer's work, but since the time of his writing critiques of positivism, especially from philosophy of science, have led to the development of [[postpositivism]]. This philosophy greatly relaxes the epistemological commitments of logical positivism and no longer claims a separation between the knower and the known. Rather than dismissing the scientific project outright, postpositivists seek to transform and amend it, though the exact extent of their affinity for science varies vastly. For example, some postpositivists accept the critique that observation is always value-laden, but argue that the best values to adopt for sociological observation are those of science: skepticism, rigor, and modesty. Just as some critical theorists see their position as a moral commitment to egalitarian values, these postpositivists see their methods as driven by a moral commitment to these scientific values. Such scholars may see themselves as either positivists or antipositivists.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. "The Arrogance of Public Sociology". ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism has also come under fire on religious and philosophical grounds, whose proponents state that truth begins in [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], but does not end there. Positivism fails to prove that there are not abstract ideas, laws, and principles, beyond particular observable facts and relationships and necessary principles, or that we cannot know them. Nor does it prove that material and corporeal things constitute the whole order of existing beings, and that our knowledge is limited to them. According to positivism, our abstract concepts or general ideas are mere collective representations of the experimental order—for example; the idea of "man" is a kind of blended image of all the men observed in our experience. This runs contrary to a [[Platonism|Platonic]] or [[Christian]] ideal, where an idea can be abstracted from any concrete determination, and may be applied identically to an indefinite number of objects of the same class {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} From the idea's perspective, Platonism is more precise. Defining an idea as a sum of collective images is imprecise and more or less confused, and becomes more so as the collection represented increases. An idea defined explicitly always remains clear.

[[Experientialism]], which arose with second generation cognitive science, asserts that knowledge begins and ends with experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E. T., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (1999). ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. Basic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoes of the "positivist" and "antipositivist" debate persist today, though this conflict is hard to define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;Hanson, Barbara. 2008. "Wither Qualitative/Quantitative?: Grounds for Methodological Convergence." ''Quality and Quantity'' 42:97–111.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as choice of methodology or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as "positivists" are actually postpositivists.&lt;ref name="Bryman"&gt;Bryman, Alan. 1984. "The Debate about Quantitative and Qualitative Research: A Question of Method or Epistemology?." ''The British Journal of Sociology'' 35:75–92.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar has described this debate in terms of the social construction of the "other", with each side defining the other by what it is ''not'' rather than what it ''is'', and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the "antipositivist" articulation of a social [[meta-theory]] which includes a philosophical critique of [[scientism]], and "positivist" development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of work that they see as violating such standards.

== Introduction ==
Psycho-oncology is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of physical, psychological, social, and behavioral aspects of the cancer experience for both patients and caregivers. Also known as Psychiatric Oncology or Psychosocial Oncology, researchers and practitioners in the field are concerned with aspects of individuals' experience with cancer beyond medical treatment, and across the cancer trajectory, including at diagnosis, during treatment, transitioning to and throughout survivorship, and approaching the end-of-life. Founded by [[Jimmie C. Holland|Jimmie Holland]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in 1977 via the incorporation of a psychiatric service within the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the field has expanded drastically since and is now universally recognized as an integral component of quality cancer care.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J. C., &amp; Bultz, B. D. (2007). The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign. ''Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network'', ''5''(1), 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;Cancer centers in major academic medical centers across the country now uniformly incorporate a psycho-oncology service into their clinical care, and provide infrastructure to support research efforts to advance knowledge in the field.

Psycho-oncology deals with psychological reactions to the experience of cancer, the behavioral component of coping with cancer as well as health behavior change including preventative medicine, and social factors that are associated with diagnosis and treatment of cancer, including communication with providers and loved ones and social support. In addition, research related to the influence of psychosocial factors on biological disease-related processes has burgeoned over the past two decades. Much research takes a [[Biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;approach to account for the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors in coping with cancer. The integration of psycho-oncology into routine oncologic care represents a major step forward in terms of care for the whole patient. 

== Psychological ==
Diagnosis and treatment of cancer is known to influence psychological well-being to a significant degree. Rates of psychological distress are elevated for most individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer when compared to population norms.&lt;ref&gt;Zabora J, BrintzenhofeSzoc K, Curbow B, et al. The prevalence of psychological distress by cancer site. ''Psycho-Oncol''. 2001;10:19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlson LE, Angen M, Cullem J, et al. High levels of untreated distress and fatigue in cancer patients. ''Br J Cancer''. 2004;90:2297-2304.&lt;/ref&gt;Common psychological reactions to cancer are mood and anxiety-related concerns. Elevated rates of depression and anxiety in response to a cancer diagnosis is often attributable to uncertainty regarding mortality and well as going through arduous treatments and concerns related to functional interference and body-image or other self-concept related distress. Understanding how individuals react psychologically to cancer is important to support their overall well-being and maximize quality of life during treatment and beyond. While the prevalence of psychological disturbance in reaction to cancer is relatively high when compared to population norms, many individuals report fairly stable psychological well-being through the cancer trajectory and some even report improved psychological well-being. 

=== Depression and Anxiety ===
Common psychological reactions to cancer diagnosis and treatment include [[Depression (mood)|depressive symptoms]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[anxiety]]. Factors that may contribute to clinically significant anxiety and depression in the context of cancer include threat to life, uncertainty regarding prognosis and treatment outcome, worry regarding toxic treatments, functional impairment as a result of toxic treatments, and physical symptoms themselves, commonly including fatigue, pain, nausea, hair loss, neuropathy, and [[Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment|chemo brain]]. These topics have been incorporated into psychotherapy treatments tailored to the experience of living with cancer. While the majority of individuals diagnosed with cancer do not exhibit clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, prevalence after cancer diagnosis is substantially higher than population norms&lt;ref&gt;Derogatis, L. R., Morrow, G. R., Fetting, J., Penman, D., Piasetsky, S., Schmale, A. M., ... &amp; Carnicke, C. L. (1983). The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among cancer patients. ''Jama'', ''249''(6), 751-757.&lt;/ref&gt;. Psychological well-being is not only associated with overall quality of life, but has been shown to be associated with shorter survival.&lt;ref&gt;Petticrew, M., Bell, R., &amp; Hunter, D. (2002). Influence of psychological coping on survival and recurrence in people with cancer: systematic review. ''Bmj'', ''325''(7372), 1066.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping ===
Psychological and behavioral responses by individuals to diagnosis and treatment of cancer in an effort to manage the substantial stress and threat to health are of primary interest in the field of psycho-oncology. These responses constitute what can be referred to as one's [[Coping (psychology)|coping]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;response to a health threat. Cognitive adaptation to cancer is particularly challenging due to the multiple domains that cancer treatment effects. There are two broad categories of coping behavior, including approach-oriented oping and avoidance-oriented coping&lt;ref&gt;Roth, S; Cohen, L (1986). "Approach, avoidance, and coping with stress". ''American Psychologist''. 813-819. '''41''' (7): 813–819. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1037/0003-066x.41.7.813.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Approach coping construes cognitive, behavioral, and emotion facets of adjustment to cancer including expressing emotions, taking an active role in one's own treatment, remaining active, and discussing difficulties with loved ones. Generally, research supports the idea that the use of approach-oriented coping supports more positive adjustments and psychological well-being than avoidance-oriented coping.

[[Avoidance coping]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is an individual's maladaptive attempt to mitigate psychological damage from a stressful event. Emotional suppression and avoidance of discussion related to the topic of cancer, as well as passive behaviors preclude individuals from directly managing the concerns that are giving rise to psychological distress. Many psychological treatments are designed to enhance individuals' ability to implement more adaptive coping behaviors and cognitions and reduce maladaptive coping. 

=== Positive Psychological Reactions ===

==== Benefit Finding and Post Traumatic Growth ====
Benefit finding is a cognitive process in which individuals identify positive contributions that a diagnosis of cancer has made to their lives. It is an example of a positively oriented [[Coping (psychology)|coping strategy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;or approach oriented coping strategy. For example, an individual may identify that diagnosis of cancer led them to consider what really matters in life, subsequently leading them to an increased quality of life. Research primary conducted with breast cancer survivors has shown that interventions to increase the identification of benefits to a highly stressful experience like cancer diagnosis can improve quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, A. L., Danoff-Burg, S., Sworowski, L. A., Collins, C. A., Branstetter, A. D., Rodriguez-Hanley, A., ... &amp; Austenfeld, J. L. (2002). Randomized, controlled trial of written emotional expression and benefit finding in breast cancer patients. ''Journal of Clinical Oncology'', ''20''(20), 4160-4168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Posttraumatic growth|Post traumatic growth]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;is significant to cancer diagnosis due to the potentially life threatening nature of the diagnosis. Individuals may be forced to consider their own mortality and may adapt by altering the way they relate to others, the world, and even themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Barskova, T., &amp; Oesterreich, R. (2009). Post-traumatic growth in people living with a serious medical condition and its relations to physical and mental health: A systematic review. ''Disability and rehabilitation'', ''31''(21), 1709-1733.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer presents individuals with a major health threat that often challenges one's sense of self as they attempt to navigate changes to their lives as a result of diagnosis and treatment. Meaning making is the effort to restore order and purpose to people's lives that has been changed so drastically by the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, V. (2008). The existential plight of cancer: meaning making as a concrete approach to the intangible search for meaning. ''Supportive care in cancer'', ''16''(7), 779-785.&lt;/ref&gt;Meaning making can be a part of a positive growth process that occurs after diagnosis with cancer and is associated with greater quality of life and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Park, C. L., Edmondson, D., Fenster, J. R., &amp; Blank, T. O. (2008). Meaning making and psychological adjustment following cancer: the mediating roles of growth, life meaning, and restored just-world beliefs. ''Journal of consulting and clinical psychology'', ''76''(5), 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ==
In addition to behavioral responses to cognitive reactions to diagnosis and treatment, the field of psycho-oncology address behaviors associated with risk of developing cancer and behaviors that place individuals at risk of poor disease outcomes. Included in this domain of interest are preventive medicine behaviors of smoking cessation and use of skin protection as well as adherence to treatment regimens.

=== Health Promoting Behaviors/preventative medicine ===
Behavior modification to reduce the risk of developing cancer is a major public health concern due to health care costs associated with individuals being treated for cancer&lt;ref&gt;Gotay, C. C. (2005). Behavior and cancer prevention. ''Journal of Clinical Oncology'', ''23''(2), 301-310.&lt;/ref&gt;Behavior change falls squarely within the interests of the field of psycho-oncology due to the psychological factors associated with implementing behavior change. Chief among behaviors that are targeted to decrease individuals' risk for cancer are smoking and alcohol consumption, diet and exercise, and sun exposure. These health behaviors are known to increase the likelihood of developing cancer in addition to myriad other health conditions. 

Engagement with screening procedures is also of importance with regard to cancer prevention and in some cancers an underutilized resource. Fear and anxiety are barriers for some to getting screened for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Consedine, N. S., Magai, C., Krivoshekova, Y. S., Ryzewicz, L., &amp; Neugut, A. I. (2004). Fear, anxiety, worry, and breast cancer screening behavior: a critical review. ''Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Biomarkers'', ''13''(4), 501-510.&lt;/ref&gt;However, cancer screening presents the opportunity to catch tumors that are present in very early stages and avoid intensive, systemic treatments in favor or more acute and localized treatments with a higher cancer of cure (e.g., surgical resection).

Behavioral modification is also relevant to improving the quality of life of those who are living with cancer. For example, a common and debilitating symptom of cancer is fatigue. However, a prescribed treatment for fatigue is to engage in a higher level of physical activity, despite its difficulty.

Effects of yoga interventions on fatigue in cancer patients and survivors: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. ''Explore'', ''9''(4), 232-243.&lt;/ref&gt;and tai chi&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Y., Luo, T., Xie, H., Huang, M., &amp; Cheng, A. S. (2014).

''Complementary therapies in medicine'', ''22''(1), 173-186.&lt;/ref&gt;that have been shown to help with fatigue and pain and improve overall physical and psychological quality of life. 

=== Treatment Adherence ===
Historically, terminology related to the uptake of treatment by the patient was referred to as compliance, implying a more passive role on the part of the patient, and a more clearly delineated hierarchy between the doctor and patient. However, modern models of ethical treatment call of more equality between patient and provider and discussion related to treatment has shifted towards adherence. Adherence to medical treatment is of crucial importance to managing cancer effectively and is a topic that largely falls under the purview of psycho-oncology for the cognitive-behavioral causes for lack of treatment adherence&lt;ref&gt;DiMatteo, M. R., Lepper, H. S., &amp; Croghan, T. W. (2000). Depression is a risk factor for noncompliance with medical treatment: meta-analysis of the effects of anxiety and depression on patient adherence. ''Archives of internal medicine'', ''160''(14), 2101-2107.&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of factors can contribute to lack of treatment adherence including toxic side effects, misinformation or lack of understanding of treatment regimen, lack of communication with medical providers, and lack of medical support (e.g., treatment self-management), in addition to psychological factors like depression and anxiety. Treatment adherence has become an increasingly important topic of study in psycho-oncology due to the advent and proliferation of oral [[Chemotherapy|antineoplastics]].&lt;ref&gt;Greer, J. A., Amoyal, N., Nisotel, L., Fishbein, J. N., MacDonald, J., Stagl, J., ... &amp; Pirl, W. F. (2016). A systematic review of adherence to oral antineoplastic therapies. ''The oncologist'', ''21''(3), 354-376.&lt;/ref&gt;Individuals on oral chemotherapy must manage sometimes complex treatment regimens at home, on their own, and be able to communication effectively with treatment providers to manage toxic side effects that may influence ability or willingness to take the prescribed drug without the assistance of nursing as in traditional intravenous chemotherapy. 

== Social ==

=== Social Support and Isolation ===
During a stressful experience such as cancer diagnosis, social connections can provide valuable emotional and practical support. Research in the broader field of Health Psychology has revealed significant influences of social support on the psychological well-being of individuals as well as associations with disease processes, particularly in cardiovascular disease&lt;ref&gt;Valtorta, N. K., Kanaan, M., Gilbody, S., Ronzi, S., &amp; Hanratty, B. (2016). Loneliness and social isolation as risk factors for coronary heart disease and stroke: systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal observational studies. ''Heart'', ''102''(13), 1009-1016.&lt;/ref&gt;. Patients undergoing treatment for cancer often rely on a social support network of varying size, including spouses, children, friends and other family, to support them through difficult treatments and functional impairment. These types of social support refer to instrumental social support and are related to task-based support. Additionally, the emotional toll that cancer diagnosis can take on a person necessitates a degree of emotional support from the support network. Both instrumental and emotional social support have been shown in research to improve quality of life in patients being treated for cancer&lt;ref&gt;Nausheen, B., Gidron, Y., Peveler, R., &amp; Moss-Morris, R. (2009). Social support and cancer progression: a systematic review. ''Journal of psychosomatic research'', ''67''(5), 403-415.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Conversely, a diagnosis of cancer can be significantly socially isolating for individuals. Life changes including functional impairment may separate people from their friends and family, and a shift from "healthy" to "ill" in terms of self-identity can lead to a sense of social isolation as well. Research has shown that social isolation and perceptions of loneliness have significant negative impact on physical and psychological quality of life in individuals with cancer&lt;ref&gt;Holt-Lunstad, J., Smith, T. B., Baker, M., Harris, T., &amp; Stephenson, D. (2015). Loneliness and social isolation as risk factors for mortality: a meta-analytic review. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', ''10''(2), 227-237.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Communication ===
Communication with medical providers and loved ones has been identified as an important social factor throughout the cancer trajectory. Communication has been shown to be associated with improved medication adherence and satisfaction with care.&lt;ref&gt;Zolnierek, K. B. H., &amp; DiMatteo, M. R. (2009). Physician communication and patient adherence to treatment: a meta-analysis. ''Medical care'', ''47''(8), 826.&lt;/ref&gt;CBT-based interventions have incorporated strategies for communication with providers about topics including symptom management and prognostic understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, J. A., Park, E. R., Prigerson, H. G., &amp; Safren, S. A. (2010). Tailoring cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat anxiety comorbid with advanced cancer. ''Journal of cognitive psychotherapy'', ''24''(4), 294.&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally, open communication between patients and caregivers is associated with improved quality of life in patients and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, E. A., Janke, E. A., Bechtel, C. F., Ramirez, M., &amp; Cohen, A. (2013). A systematic review of psychosocial interventions to improve cancer caregiver quality of life. ''Psycho‐Oncology'', ''22''(6), 1200-1207.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological ==

=== Stress Pathways to Disease ===
Knowledge from other fields of health psychology, prominently including psychosocial contributors to cardiovascular disease risk and outcomes, led to the exploration of the influence of psychological factors on biological processes associated with cancer. As knowledge of biological processes related to cancer development and progression advance&lt;ref&gt;Hanahan, D., &amp; Weinberg, R. A. (2011). Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation. ''cell'', ''144''(5), 646-674.&lt;/ref&gt;so too does that knowledge of the association between biological processes, namely [[inflammation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and psychological processes. Research has revealed bio-behavioral pathways to disease&lt;ref&gt;Antoni, M. H., Lutgendorf, S. K., Cole, S. W., Dhabhar, F. S., Sephton, S. E., McDonald, P. G., ... &amp; Sood, A. K. (2006). The influence of bio-behavioural factors on tumour biology: pathways and mechanisms. ''Nature Reviews Cancer'', ''6''(3), 240.&lt;/ref&gt;which indicates that importance of treatment of psychological concerns that emerge as a result of a cancer diagnosis in efforts to reduce the likelihood of cancer progression. Additionally, knowledge continues to advance related to treatment refractory symptoms of cancer including pain and fatigue that may be biobehaviorally driven which has advanced novel treatment approaches&lt;ref&gt;Bower, J. E., &amp; Lamkin, D. M. (2013). Inflammation and cancer-related fatigue: mechanisms, contributing factors, and treatment implications. ''Brain, behavior, and immunity'', ''30'', S48-S57.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Psychosocial Treatment Models ==

=== Adaptations of CBT, ACT, other effective interventions ===
Multiple evidence based treatments for mood and anxiety disorders in the general population have been adapted to deal with stressors directly related to cancer. Common maladaptive cognitions that are associated with cancer include misinterpreting pain or other physical sensations as cancer progression, or struggling to adapt to the uncertainty of treatment and life after treatment. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and related psychotherapies are particularly well suited to manage these cognitive concerns that emerge throughout the cancer process and serve to interfere with individuals' quality of life&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, R. L., Demoncada, A. C., &amp; Feuerstein, M. (2006). Psychosocial interventions for depression, anxiety, and quality of life in cancer survivors: meta-analyses. ''The International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine'', ''36''(1), 13-34.&lt;/ref&gt;. CBT and adjacent therapies have also been used to support management of chronic pain and fatigue that patients treatment with chemotherapy often experience, helping to improve both their interpretations of the symptoms but also help manage their lives behaviorally in the context of functional impairment&lt;ref&gt;Syrjala, K. L., Jensen, M. P., Mendoza, M. E., Yi, J. C., Fisher, H. M., &amp; Keefe, F. J. (2014). Psychological and behavioral approaches to cancer pain management. ''Journal of clinical oncology'', ''32''(16), 1703.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kwekkeboom, K. L., Cherwin, C. H., Lee, J. W., &amp; Wanta, B. (2010). Mind-body treatments for the pain-fatigue-sleep disturbance symptom cluster in persons with cancer. ''Journal of pain and symptom management'', ''39''(1), 126-138.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Mindfulness ===
Mindfulness is a burgeoning area of interest as a common element across multiple modalities in mental health treatment&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, S. G., Sawyer, A. T., Witt, A. A., &amp; Oh, D. (2010). The effect of mindfulness-based therapy on anxiety and depression: A meta-analytic review. ''Journal of consulting and clinical psychology'', ''78''(2), 169.&lt;/ref&gt;, having shown effectiveness in ameliorating depressive symptoms and anxiety. Particular to cancer, mindfulness has been applied to general stress reduction through mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)&lt;ref&gt;Ledesma, D., &amp; Kumano, H. (2009). Mindfulness‐based stress reduction and cancer: a meta‐analysis. ''Psycho‐Oncology: Journal of the Psychological, Social and Behavioral Dimensions of Cancer'', ''18''(6), 571-579.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rush, S. E., &amp; Sharma, M. (2017). Mindfulness-based stress reduction as a stress management intervention for cancer care: a systematic review. ''Journal of evidence-based complementary &amp; alternative medicine'', ''22''(2), 348-360.&lt;/ref&gt;, with evidence growing for not only decreased levels of cancer-related distress in response to mindfulness-baed treatments, but impact on biomarkers of disease and enhanced survival.&lt;ref&gt;Rouleau, C. R., Garland, S. N., &amp; Carlson, L. E. (2015). The impact of mindfulness-based interventions on symptom burden, positive psychological outcomes, and biomarkers in cancer patients. ''Cancer management and research'', ''7'', 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Routine Distress Screening ===
As awareness of the prevalence of psychological distress that accompanies a cancer diagnosis and increased efforts to integrate evidence based psychosocial treatments into overall oncologic care, screening for adjustment to diagnosis and treatment became important&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/default.aspx|title=NCCN Distress Management Guidelines|last=National Comprehensive Cancer Network|first=|date=24 November 2018|website=NCCN.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Routine distress screening throughout the cancer process (e.g., diagnosis, treatment, survivorship) is crucial to identifying individuals who are already struggling with symptoms of depression or anxiety or for identifying those at risk for psychological issues related to cancer. Historically, communication about psychological adjustment was lacking between patients and providers regarding topics related to adjustment to diagnosis, living with cancer, living cancer-free in survivorship, or transitioning to end of life care. The stigmatized nature of psychological concerns made it difficult to identify those patients who could benefit from early intervention to prevent or attenuate symptoms of depression or anxiety that may emerge.

The '''psychology of programming''' ('''PoP''') is the field of research that deals with the [[psychological]] aspects of writing [[Computer program|program]]s (often [[computer]] programs). The field has also been called the '''''empirical studies of programming''''' ('''ESP'''). It covers research into computer programmers' cognition; tools and methods for programming-related activities; and programming education.

Psychologically, computer programming is a human activity which involves [[cognition]]s such as [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]] [[computer language]], [[learning]], [[problem solving]], and [[reasoning]].

==History==
The history of psychology of programming dates back to late 1970s and early 1980s, when researchers realized that computational power should not be the only thing to be evaluated in programming tools and technologies, but also the usability from the users.&lt;ref&gt;Jorma Sajaniemi. Psychology of Programming: Looking into Programmers’ Heads. Human Technology [Internet]. 2008 May 4–8 [cited 2012 Oct 4]; 4(1): Available from: http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume4/2008/ge-sajaniemi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the first Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers, [[Ben Shneiderman]] listed several important destinations for researchers. These destinations include refining the use of current languages, improving present and future languages, developing special purpose languages, and improving tools and methods. Two important workshop series have been devoted to psychology of programming in the last two decades: the Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP), based primarily in the US, and the Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop (PPIG), having a European character. ESP has a broader scope than pure psychology in programming, and on the other hand, PPIG is more focused in the field of PoP. However, PPIG workshops and the organization PPIG itself is informal in nature, It is group of people who are interested in PoP that comes together and publish their discussions.

==Goals and purposes==
It is desirable to achieve a programming performance such that creating a program meets its specifications, is on schedule, is adaptable for the future and runs efficiently.&lt;ref name="weinberg"&gt;{{Citation |last=Weinberg |first=Gerald M. |authorlink=Gerald Weinberg |title=The Psychology of Computer Programming |place=New York |publisher=Dorset House |year=1998 |edition=Silver |url=https://leanpub.com/thepsychologyofcomputerprogramming |isbn=0-932633-42-0 |format=&lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:Weinberg+intitle:The+Psychology+of+Computer+Programming]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to satisfy all these goals at a low cost is a difficult and common problem in software engineering and project management. By understanding the psychological aspects of computer programming, we can better understand how to achieve a higher programming performance, and to assist programmers to produce better software with less error.

==Research methods==
Some methods which one can use to study the psychological aspects of computer programming include [[introspection]], [[observation]], [[experiment]], and [[qualitative research]].&lt;ref name="weinberg"/&gt;

The '''Reactor Institute Delft''' ({{lang-nl|Reactor Instituut Delft}}), or RID, is a nuclear research institute at [[Delft University of Technology]] in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. 

The institute features the '''Hoger Onderwijs Reactor''' ('''HOR''', {{lang-nl|Higher Education Reactor}}), a 2&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; pool-type [[research reactor]]. Neutron research instruments are developed using several neutron beam lines leading from the core. One of the most intense positron beam lines in the world is powered by [[Pair production|gamma-pair production]] near the reactor core.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rid.tudelft.nl/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The institute is part of the Faculty of Applied Sciences since its name change to Reactor Institute. Previously, it was a separate part of the university and known as the '''Interfacultair Reactor Instituut''' (IRI, {{lang-nl|Interfacultary Reactor Institute}})

{{Short description|Cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning}}

{{Reading}}

'''Reading''' is the complex [[cognitive process]] of decoding [[symbols]] to derive meaning. 

Success in this process is measured as ''[[reading comprehension]]''. Reading is a means for [[language acquisition]], communication, and sharing [[information]] and ideas. The symbols are typically visual ([[written]] or [[printing|printed]]) but may be tactile ([[Braille]]). Like all languages, it is a complex interaction between text and reader, shaped by prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and the language community—which is culturally and socially situated. The reading process requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. Reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Consumers of literature deviate from literal words to create images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe. Because reading is a complex process, it cannot be controlled or restricted to one or two interpretations. There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather it provides readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"&gt;De Certeau, Michel. "Reading as Poaching." ''The Practice of Everyday Life''. Trans. Steven F. Rendall. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984. 165-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
Readers use a variety of reading strategies to decode (to translate symbols into sounds or visual representations of [[speech]]) and comprehension. Readers may use context clues to identify the meaning of unknown words. Readers integrate the words they have read into their existing framework of knowledge or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]].

Other types of reading are not speech based [[writing system]]s, such as music [[Musical notation|notation]] or [[pictograms]]. The common link is the interpretation of [[symbols]] to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of [[Braille]]).

==Overview==
[[File:03282012Casa hogar niñas tlahuac30.JPG|thumb|Volunteer reads to a girl at the [[Casa Hogar de las Niñas]] in [[Mexico City]]]]
Currently most reading is either of the printed word from ink or [[toner]] on paper, such as in a [[book]], [[magazine]], [[newspaper]], [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]], or [[notebook]], or of electronic displays, such as [[computer display]]s, [[television]], [[mobile phone]]s or [[e-reader]]s. [[Handwriting|Handwritten]] text may also be produced using a [[graphite]] [[pencil]] or a [[pen]].
Short texts may be written or [[paint]]ed on an object.

Often the text relates to the object, such as an address on an envelope, product info on packaging, or text on a [[traffic sign|traffic]] or street sign. A [[slogan]] may be painted on a wall. A text may also be produced by arranging stones of a different color in a wall or road. Short texts like these are sometimes referred to as environmental print.

Sometimes text or images are in [[relief]], with or without using a color contrast. Words or images can be carved in stone, wood, or metal; instructions can be printed in relief on the plastic housing of a [[home appliance]], or myriad other examples.

A requirement for reading is a good [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between letters and background (depending on colors of letters and background, any pattern or image in the background, and [[lighting]]) and a suitable font size. In the case of a computer screen, it is important to see an entire line of text without [[scrolling]].

The field of visual word recognition studies how people read individual words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cornelissen PL, Kringelbach ML, Ellis AW, Whitney C, Holiday IE, Hansen PC |title=Activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus in the first 200 ms of reading: evidence from magnetoencephalography (MEG) |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e5359 |year=2009 |pmid=19396362 |pmc=2671164 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005359|editor1-last=Aleman|editor1-first=André|last2=Kringelbach |last3=Ellis |last4=Whitney |last5=Holliday |last6=Hansen |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.5359C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wheat KL, Cornelissen PL, Frost SJ, Hansen PC |title=During visual word recognition, phonology is accessed within 100 ms and may be mediated by a speech production code: evidence from magnetoencephalography |journal= Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=15 |pages=5229–33 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20392945 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4448-09.2010|pmc=3419470|last2=Cornelissen |last3=Frost |last4=Hansen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Nation K |title=Form-meaning links in the development of visual word recognition |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This has revealed that reading is performed as a series of eye [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] with [[saccade]]s between them. Humans also do not appear to fixate on every word in a text, but instead pause on some words mentally while their eyes are moving. This is possible because human languages show certain linguistic regularities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The process of recording information to read later is [[writing]]. In the case of computer and [[microfiche]] storage there is the separate step of displaying the written text. For humans, reading is usually faster and easier than writing.

Reading is typically an individual activity, though on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners. Reading aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension, is a form of [[intrapersonal communication]]: in the early 1970s&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pritchard SC, Coltheart M, Palethorpe S, Castles A |title=Nonword reading: comparing dual-route cascaded and connectionist dual-process models with human data |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=1268–88 |date=October 2012 |pmid=22309087 |doi=10.1037/a0026703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed the [[dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud]], accordingly to which there were two separate mental mechanisms, or cognitive routes, that are involved in this case, with output of both mechanisms contributing to the [[pronunciation]] of a written stimulus.&lt;ref name="Pritchard 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=coltheart1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coltheart|first=Max|author2=Curtis, Brent |author3=Atkins, Paul |author4= Haller, Micheal |title=Models of reading aloud: Dual-route and parallel-distributed-processing approaches|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1993|volume=100|issue=4|pages=589–608|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.100.4.589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamada 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada J, Imai H, Ikebe Y |title=The use of the orthographic lexicon in reading kana words |journal=J Gen Psychol |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=311–23 |date=July 1990 |pmid=2213002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading to young children is a recommended way to instill language and expression, and to promote comprehension of text. [[Personalised books]] for children are recommended to improve engagement in reading by featuring the child themselves in the story.

Before the reintroduction of separated text in the late [[Middle Ages]], the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Manguel/Silent_Readers.html | title=THE SILENT READERS | website=Alberto Manguel, Chapter 2 of A History of Reading (New York; Viking, 1996) | accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading skills==
{{Main article|Learning to read}}
[[Literacy]] is the ability to use the symbols of a writing system. It is the ability to interpret what the information symbols represent, and re-create those same symbols so that others can derive the same meaning. [[Illiteracy]] is the inability to derive meaning from the symbols used in a writing system.

===Reading rate===
[[File:Reading speed by age.jpg|thumb|Average reading rate in ''words per minute'' (wpm) depending on age and measured with different tests in English, French and German]]
Many studies show that increasing reading speed improves comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED523331.pdf|title=Reading Rate and Comprehension|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|date=August 2011|website=ERIC:ED523331}}&lt;/ref&gt;Reading speed requires a long time to reach adult levels. The table to the right shows how reading-rate varies with age,&lt;ref&gt;''Im Auge des Lesers, foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung: vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude''(2006), ppgs. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of the period (1965 to 2005) and the language (English, French, German). The Taylor values probably are higher, for disregarding students who failed the comprehension test. The reading test by the French psychologist Pierre Lefavrais ("L'alouette", published in 1967) tested reading aloud, with a penalty for errors, and could, therefore, not be a rate greater than 150 wpm. According to Carver (1990), children's reading speed increases throughout the school years. On average, from grade 2 to college, reading rate increases 14 standard-length words per minute each year (where one standard-length word is defined as six characters in text, including punctuation and spaces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Carver, Ronald P. |title=Reading rate: a review of research and theory |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-12-162420-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the data from Taylor (English) and Landerl (German) are based on texts of increasing difficulty; other data were obtained when all age groups were reading the same text.

Rates of reading include reading for memorization (fewer than 100 [[words per minute]] [wpm]); reading for learning (100–200 wpm); reading for comprehension (200–400 wpm); and [[skimming (reading)|skimming]] (400–700 wpm). Reading for comprehension is the essence of the daily reading of most people. Skimming is for superficially processing large quantities of text at a low level of comprehension (below 50%).

Advice for choosing the appropriate reading-rate includes reading flexibly, slowing when concepts are closely presented and when the material is new, and increasing when the material is familiar and of thin concept. [[Speed reading]] courses and books often encourage the reader to continually accelerate; comprehension tests lead the reader to believe his or her comprehension is continually improving; yet, competence-in-reading requires knowing that skimming is dangerous, as a default [[Habit (psychology)|habit]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method|date=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading speed has been used as a measure in research to determine the effect of interventions on human vision.

Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involves acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Some argue that this competes with phonics and synthetic phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning to spell.

Other methods of teaching and learning to read have developed, and become somewhat controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Feitelson |first=Dina |title=Facts and Fads in Beginning Reading: A Cross-Language Perspective |year=1988 |publisher=Ablex |location=Norwood, New Jersey, United States |isbn=978-0-89391-507-0 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning to read in a second language, especially in adulthood, may be a different process than learning to read a native language in childhood.
There are cases of very young children learning to read without having been taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Hughes, Diana |author2=Stainthorp, Rhona |title=Learning from children who read at an early age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=978-0-415-17495-4 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case with [[Truman Capote]] who reportedly taught himself to read and write at the age of five.

The novelist [[Nicholas Delbanco]] taught himself to read at age six during a transatlantic crossing by studying a book about boats.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Brain activity in young and older children can be used to predict future reading skill. Cross model mapping between the orthographic and phonologic areas in the brain are critical in reading. Thus, the amount of activation in the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus while performing reading tasks can be used to predict later reading ability and advancement. Young children with higher phonological word characteristic processing have significantly better reading skills later on than older children who focus on whole-word orthographic representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McNorgan C, Alvarez A, Bhullar A, Gayda J, Booth JR |title=Prediction of reading skill several years later depends on age and brain region: implications for developmental models of reading |journal=[[The Journal of Neuroscience]] |volume=31 |issue=26 |pages=9641–8 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21715629 |pmc=3147303 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0334-11.2011 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21715629|last2=Alvarez |last3=Bhullar |last4=Gayda |last5=Booth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types and methods of reading, with differing rates that can be attained for each, for different kinds of material and purposes:
* ''[[Subvocalization|Subvocalized]]'' reading combines sight reading with internal sounding of the words as if spoken. Advocates of speed reading claim it can be a bad habit that slows reading and comprehension, but other studies indicate the reverse, particularly with difficult texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moidel|first=Steve|title=Speed Reading for Business|publisher=Barron's Educational|location=Hauppauge, NY|pages=23–24|isbn=978-0-7641-0401-5|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rayner|first=Keith|others=Pollatsek, Alexander|title=The Psychology of Reading|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1995|pages=192–194|isbn=978-0-8058-1872-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Speed reading]]'' is a collection of methods for increasing reading speed without an unacceptable reduction in comprehension or retention. Methods include skimming or the [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]] of words in a body of text to increase the rate of reading. It is closely connected to [[speed learning]].
* ''[[Incremental reading]]'' is a software-assisted reading method designed for [[long-term memory|long-term memorization]]. "Incremental reading" means "reading in portions": in each session, parts of several electronic articles are read inside a prioritized reading list. In the course of reading, important pieces of information are extracted and converted into [[flashcard]]s, which are then reviewed by a [[spaced repetition]] algorithm.
* ''[[Proofreading]]'' is a kind of reading for the purpose of detecting [[typographical]] errors. One can learn to do it rapidly, and professional proofreaders typically acquire the ability to do so at high rates, faster for some kinds of material than for others, while they may largely suspend comprehension while doing so, except when needed to select among several possible words that a suspected typographic error allows.
* ''Rereading'' is reading a book more than once. "One cannot read a book: one can only reread it," [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once said.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Meyer Spacks (2011). ''On Rereading'', [[Harvard University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-674-06222-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in the ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (Cristel Antonia (2012)) found re-reading offers mental health benefits because it allows for a more profound emotional connection and self-reflection, versus the first reading, which is more focused on the events and plot.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Waugh. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2101516/Reading-book-really-better-second-time-round--reading-offer-mental-health-benefits.html "Reading a book really is better the second time round - and can even offer mental health benefits"], ''Daily Mail'', 15 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bookandpencil.png|thumb|250px|mini|right|Many take notes while reading.]]
* ''Structure-proposition-evaluation (SPE)'' method, popularized by [[Mortimer Adler]] in ''[[How to Read a Book]]'', mainly for non-fiction treatise, in which one reads a writing in three passes: (1) for the structure of the work, which might be represented by an outline; (2) for the logical propositions made, organized into chains of inference; and (3) for evaluation of the merits of the arguments and conclusions. This method involves [[suspended judgment]] of the work or its arguments until they are fully understood.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''Survey-question-read-recite-review ([[SQ3R]])'' method, often taught in public schools, which involves reading toward being able to teach what is read, and is appropriate for instructors preparing to teach material without referring to notes.
{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Multiple intelligences]]''-based methods, which draw on the reader's diverse ways of thinking and knowing to enrich appreciation of the text. Reading is fundamentally a linguistic activity: one can basically comprehend a text without resorting to other intelligences, such as the visual (e.g., mentally "seeing" characters or events described), auditory (e.g., reading aloud or mentally "hearing" sounds described), or even the logical intelligence (e.g., considering "what if" scenarios or predicting how the text will unfold based on context clues). However, most readers already use several kinds of intelligence while reading. Doing so in a more disciplined manner—i.e., constantly, or after every paragraph—can result in a more vivid, memorable experience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* ''[[Rapid serial visual presentation]] (RSVP)'' reading involves presenting the words in a sentence one word at a time at the same location on the display screen, at a specified eccentricity. RSVP eliminates inter-word saccades, limits intra-word saccades, and prevents reader control of fixation times (Legge, Mansfield, &amp; Chung, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Legge GE, Mansfield JS, Chung ST |title=Psychophysics of reading. XX. Linking letter recognition to reading speed in central and peripheral vision |journal=Vision Research |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=725–43 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11248262 |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(00)00295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP controls for differences in reader eye movement, and consequently is often used to measure reading speed in experiments.
Reading process is therefore a communication context.

==Assessment==

===Types of tests===
* Sight word reading: reading words of increasing difficulty until they become unable to read or understand the words presented to them. Difficulty is manipulated by using words that have more letters or syllables, are less common and have more complicated spelling–sound relationships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* Nonword reading: reading lists of pronounceable nonsense words out loud. The difficulty is increased by using longer words, and also by using words with more complex spelling or sound sequences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k12academics.com/educational-psychology/reading-activity/reading-assessment#.WKHjtneZNo4|title=Reading Assessment - K12 Academics|first=Chris|last=Glavin|date=6 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reading comprehension: a passage is presented to the reader, which they must read either silently or out loud. Then a series of questions are presented that test the reader's comprehension of this passage.
* Reading fluency: the rate with which individuals can name words.
* Reading accuracy: the ability to correctly name a word on a page.

Some tests incorporate several of the above components at once. For instance, the [[Nelson-Denny Reading Test]] scores readers both on the speed with which they can read a passage, and also their ability to accurately answer questions about this passage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Recent research has questioned the validity of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, especially with regard to the identification of reading disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Coleman C, Lindstrom J, Nelson J, Lindstrom W, Gregg KN |title=Passageless comprehension on the Nelson-Denny reading test: well above chance for university students |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=244–9 |year=2010 |pmid=19933897 |doi=10.1177/0022219409345017|last2=Lindstrom |last3=Nelson |last4=Lindstrom |last5=Gregg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading from paper and from some screens requires more [[lighting]] than many other activities. Therefore, the possibility of doing this comfortably in [[café]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[bus]]es, at [[bus stop]]s or in [[park]]s greatly varies depending on available lighting and time of day.

Reading from screens that produce their own light does not depend on external light, except that external light may lessen visual fatigue. For controlling what is on the screen ([[scrolling]], turning the page, etc.), a [[touch screen]] or [[Keyboard (computing)#Illumination|keyboard illumination]] further reduces dependency on external light.

==History==
[[File:Men reading the Koran in Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Syria.jpg|thumb|Men reading]]
The history of reading dates back to the [[History of writing|invention of writing]] during the 4th millennium BC. Although reading [[printing|print]] text is now an important way for the general population to access information, this has not always been the case. With [[Literacy#Ancient and medieval literacy|some exceptions]], only a small percentage of the population in many countries was considered [[Literacy|literate]] before the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. Some of the pre-modern societies with generally high literacy rates included [[classical Athens]] and the Islamic [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Delivering Education|author = Andrew J. Coulson|page = 117|publisher = [[Hoover Institution]]|url = http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817928928_105.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars assume that reading aloud (Latin ''clare legere'') was the more common practice in antiquity, and that reading silently (''legere tacite'' or ''legere sibi'') was unusual.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"&gt;Carruthers, Mary. 2008. ''The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture''. 2nd. ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 212 ff..&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|''Confessions'']], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] remarks on [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]]'s unusual habit of reading silently in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Carruthers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jajdelska, Elspeth. 2007. ''Silent Reading and the Birth of the Narrator''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], elite individuals promoted passive reading, rather than creative interpretation. Reading has no concrete laws, but lets readers escape to produce their own products introspectively, promoting deep exploration of texts during interpretation. Some thinkers of that era believed that construction, or the creation of writing and producing a product, was a sign of initiative and active participation in society—and viewed consumption (reading) as simply taking in what constructors made.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt; Also during this era, writing was considered superior to reading in society. They considered readers of that time passive citizens, because they did not produce a product. [[Michel de Certeau]] argued that the elites of the Age of Enlightenment were responsible for this general belief. Michel de Certeau believed that reading required venturing into an author's land, but taking away what the reader wanted specifically. This view held that writing was a superior art to reading within the hierarchical constraints of the era.&lt;ref name="Certeau, Michel 1984"/&gt;

In 18th-century Europe, the then new practice of reading alone in bed was, for a time, considered dangerous and immoral. As reading became less a communal, oral practice, and more a private, silent one—and as [[sleeping]] increasingly moved from communal sleeping areas to individual bedrooms, some raised concern that reading in bed presented various dangers, such as fires caused by bedside candles. Some modern critics, however, speculate that these concerns were based on the fear that readers—especially women—could escape familial and communal obligations and transgress moral boundaries through the private fantasy worlds in books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mavrody|first1=Nika|title=The Dangers of Reading in Bed|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/reading-in-bed/527388/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repatriation''' is the return of art or [[cultural heritage]], usually referring to ancient or [[looted art]], to their country of origin or former owners (or their heirs). The disputed cultural property items are physical artifacts of a group or society that were taken from another group usually in an act of looting, whether in the context of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]] or war. The contested objects range widely from [[sculpture]]s and paintings to monuments and human remains.

== Background ==

===War and looting===

==== Ancient world====
[[File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9066.jpg|thumb|Victory Stele of Naram Sin, Akkadian Dynasty, reign of Naram-Sin (2254-2218 BC). Musée du Louvre, Paris.]]
War and the subsequent looting of defeated peoples has been common practice since ancient times. The stele of King [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]], which is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, is one of the earliest works of art known to have been looted in war. The stele commemorating Naram-Sin's victory in a battle against the [[Lullubi]] people in 2250 BCE was taken as war plunder about a thousand years later by the [[Elamites]] who relocated it to their capital in [[Susa]], Iran. There, it was uncovered in 1898 by French archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Sumerian poem titled ''[[Curse of Akkad]]'', Naram-Sin was responsible for the collapse of the [[Akkadian Empire]] as he looted and destroyed the [[Temple of Enlil]] and incited the wrath of the gods as a result, see Miles, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palladion]] was the earliest and perhaps the most important stolen statue in western literature.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Miles, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The small carved wooden statue of an armed [[Athena]] served as Troy's protective [[talisman]], which is said to have been stolen by two Greeks who secretly smuggled the statue out of the [[Temple of Athena]]. It was widely believed in antiquity that the conquest of Troy was only possible because the city had lost its protective talisman. This myth illustrates the sacramental significance of statuary in Ancient Greece as divine manifestations of the gods that symbolized power and were often believed to possess supernatural abilities. The sacred nature of the statues is further illustrated in the supposed suffering of the victorious Greeks afterward, including [[Odysseus]], who was the mastermind behind the robbery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

According to Roman myth, Rome was founded by [[Romulus]], the first victor to dedicate spoils taken from an enemy ruler to the [[Temple of Jupiter Feretrius]]. In Rome's many subsequent wars, blood-stained armor and weaponry were gathered and placed in temples as a symbol of respect toward the enemies' deities and as a way to win their patronage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Miles, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman power spread throughout Italy where Greek cities once reigned, Greek art was looted and ostentatiously displayed in Rome as a triumphal symbol of foreign territories brought under Roman rule.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; However, the triumphal procession of [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the fall of Syracuse in 211 is believed to have set a standard of reverence to conquered sanctuaries as it engendered disapproval by critics and a negative social reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[Emperor Augustus]] was sufficiently embarrassed by the history of Roman plunder of Greek art to return some pieces to their original homes.&lt;ref&gt;Isager, Jacob, ''Pliny on Art and Society: The Elder Pliny's Chapters On The History Of Art'', p. 173, 2013, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-135-08580-3}}, 978-1-135-08580-3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIwWTaEXQM0C&amp;pg=PA173 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern era====
One of the most infamous cases of esurient art plundering in wartime was the [[Nazi]] appropriation of art from both public and private holdings throughout Europe and Russia. The looting began before [[World War II]] with illegal seizures as part of a systematic persecution of Jews, which was included as a part of Nazi crimes during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;See film, ''Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War'' by L.H. Nicholas, New York, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Germany plundered 427 museums in the [[Soviet Union]] and ravaged or destroyed 1,670 [[Russian Orthodox]] churches, 237 [[Catholic]] churches and 532 synagogues.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unplundering Art|newspaper=Economist|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known recent case of wartime looting was the plundering of ancient artifacts from the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in Baghdad at the outbreak of the war in 2003. Although this was not a case in which the victors plundered art from their defeated enemy, it was result of the unstable and chaotic conditions of war that allowed looting to happen and which some would argue was the fault of the invading US forces.

Archaeologists and scholars criticized the US military for not taking the measures to secure the museum, a repository for a myriad of valuable ancient artifacts from the ancient [[Mesopotamian]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barry Meier and James Glanz|title=Looted treasure returning to Iraq national museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/world/africa/26iht-treasure.2300298.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 November 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the several months leading up to the war, scholars, art directors, and collector met with [[the Pentagon]] to ensure that the US government would protect Iraq's important archaeological heritage, with the National Museum in Baghdad being at the top of the list of concerns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Greenfield, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Between April 8, when the museum was vacated and April 12, when some of the staff returned, an estimated 15,000 items and an additional 5,000 cylinder seals were stolen.&lt;ref name="poole1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Poole|first=Robert M.|title=Looting Iraq|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|date=February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120703020429/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|archivedate=3 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the National Library was plundered of thousands of [[cuneiform]] tablets and the building was set on fire with half a million books inside; fortunately, many of the manuscripts and books were preserved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; A US task force was able to retrieve about half of the stolen artifacts by organizing and dispatching an inventory of missing objects and by declaring that there would be no punishment for anyone returning an item.&lt;ref name="poole1"/&gt; In addition to the vulnerability of art and historical institutions during the Iraq war, Iraq's rich archaeological sites and areas of excavated land (Iraq is presumed to possess vast undiscovered treasures) have fallen victim to widespread looting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Greenfield, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Hordes of looters disinterred enormous craters around Iraq's archaeological sites, sometimes using bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 archaeological sites in Iraq have been despoiled.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

=== Modern imperialism and looting ===
[[File:Paris Louvre c1845.jpg|thumb|Paris Louvre ca. 1845]]
The scale of plundering that took place under [[Napoleon]]'s French Empire was unprecedented in modern history with the only comparable looting expeditions taking place in ancient Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;Well known examples include [[Lucius Mummius]]' sack of Corinth or [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]' plunder of Syracuse, See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; They also supported their actions with the opinion that their sophisticated artistic taste would allow them to appreciate the plundered art.&lt;ref&gt;See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's soldiers crudely dismantled the art by tearing paintings out of their frames hung in churches and sometimes causing damage during the shipping process.  Napoleon's soldiers appropriated private collections and even the papal collection.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Of the most famous artworks plundered included the [[Horses of Saint Mark|Bronze Horses of Saint Mark]] in Venice and the [[Laocoön and His Sons]] in Rome (both since returned), with the later being considered the most impressive sculpture from antiquity at the time.

[[File:Gruppo del laocoonte, 04.JPG|thumb|left|Laocoön group, ca. 40-20 BCE. Museo Pio Clementino, Vatican]]
The Laocoön had a particular meaning for the French because it was associated with a myth in connection to the founding of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The Laocoön was the fabled Trojan priest who warned the Trojans not to accept the Wooden Horse that the Greeks offered to Athena. A god hostile to Troy sent sea serpents to kill him and his sons, which led to the fall of Troy and heralded the eventual founding of Rome, see Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; When the art was brought into Paris, the pieces arrived in the fashion of a triumphal procession modeled after the common practice of ancient Romans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

Napoleon's extensive plunder of Italy was criticized by such French artists as [[Antoine-Chrysostôme Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755–1849), who circulated a petition that gathered the signatures of fifty other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically one of the names included [[Vivant Denon]], the future Director of the [[Louvre]] and future facilitator of Napoleon's despoliation of artifacts from Egypt (see Miles, p. 326)&lt;/ref&gt; With the founding of the [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris in 1793, Napoleon's aim was to establish an encyclopedic exhibition of art history, which later both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] would attempt to emulate in their respective countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|L'Expédition d'Égypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte by Leon Cogniet, ca. 1835. Musée du Louvre, Paris. Depicts Napoleon and his savants studying Egypt.]]
Napoleon continued his art conquests in 1798 when he invaded Egypt in an attempt to safeguard French trade interests and to undermine Britain's access to India via Egypt. His expedition in Egypt is noted for the 167 "savants" he took with him including scientists and other specialists equipped with tools for recording, surveying and documenting ancient and modern Egypt and its natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the expedition discoveries included the [[Rosetta Stone]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]] near Thebes. The French military campaign was short-lived and unsuccessful and the majority of the collected artifacts (including the Rosetta Stone) were seized by British troops, ending up in the [[British Museum]]. Nonetheless, the information gathered by the French expedition was soon after published in the several volumes of ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'', which included 837 copperplate engravings and over 3,000 drawings. In contrast to the disapproving public reaction to the looting of Italian works of art, the appropriation of Egyptian art saw widespread interest and fascination throughout Europe, inciting a phenomenon which came to be called "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Miles, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demands for restitution ===
A precedent for art repatriation was set in Roman antiquity when [[Cicero]] prosecuted [[Verres]], a senate member and illegal appropriator of art. Cicero's speech influenced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] European thought and had an indirect impact on the modern debate about art repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's argument uses military episodes of plunder as "case law" and expresses certain standards when it comes to appropriating cultural property of another people.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero makes a distinction between public and private uses of art and what is appropriate for each and he also asserts that the primary purpose of art is religious expression and veneration. He also sets standards for the responsibilities of imperial administration abroad to the code of ethics surrounding the collection of art from defeated Greece and Rome in wartime. Later, both Napoleon and Lord Elgin would be likened to Verres in condemnations of their plundering of art.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Allied victory in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the Napoleonic Era.]]Art was repatriated for the first time in modern history when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] overturned art plundered by Napoleon to Italy after he and Marshal Bluchers armies defeated the French at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This decision contrasted sharply to a long-held tradition to the effect that "[[Spoils system|to the victors go the spoils]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This is remarkable considering that in the battle of Waterloo alone, the financial and human costs were colossal; the decision to not only refrain from plundering France but to repatriate France's prior seizures from the Netherlands, Italy, Prussia, and Spain, was extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the British paid for the restitution of the papal collection to Rome because the Pope could not finance the shipping himself.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; When British troops began packing up looted art from the Louvre, there was a public outcry in France. Crowds reportedly tried to prevent the taking of the [[Horses of Saint Mark]] and there were throngs of weeping ladies outside the Louvre Museum.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Miles, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unprecedented nature of this repatriation effort, there are recent estimations that only about 55 percent of what was taken was actually repatriated: the Louvre Director at the time, [[Vivant Denon]], had sent out many important works to other parts of France before the British could take them.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;  Wellington viewed himself as representing all of Europe's nations and he believed that the moral decision would be to restore the art in its apparently proper context.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Lord Castlereagh]] he wrote:

{{cquote|The Allies then, having the contents of the museum justly in their power, could not do otherwise than restore them to the countries form which, contrary to the practice of civilized warfare, they had been torn during the disastrous period of the French revolution and the tyranny of Bonaparte. ... Not only, then, would it, in my opinion, be unjust in the Sovereigns to gratify the people of France on this subject, at the expense of their own people, but the sacrifice they would make would be impolitic, as it would deprive them of the opportunity of giving the people of France a great moral lesson. |||Excerpt from letter of Wellington to Viscount Castlereagh, K.G., Paris| September 23, 1815&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;}}

Wellington also forbade pilfering among his troops as he believed that it led to the lack of discipline and distraction from military duty. He also held the view that winning support from local inhabitants was an important break from Napoleon's practices.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The great public interest in art repatriation helped fuel the expansion of public museums in Europe and launched museum-funded archaeological explorations. The concept of art and cultural repatriation gained momentum through the latter decades of the twentieth century and began to show fruition by the end of the century when key works were ceded back to claimants.

== Legal issues ==

=== National government laws ===
In 1863 US President [[Abraham Lincoln]] summoned [[Francis Lieber]], a German-American jurist and political philosopher, to write a legal code to regulate Union soldiers' behavior toward Confederation prisoners, noncombatants, spies and property.  The resulting ''General Orders No.100'' or the [[Lieber Code]], legally recognized cultural property as a protected category in war.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lieber Code had far-reaching results as it became the basis for the Hague Convention of 1907 and 1954 and has led to Standing Rules of Engagement (ROE) for US troops today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Miles, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the ROE clauses instruct US troops not to attack "schools, museums, national monuments, and any other historical or cultural sites unless they are being used for a military purpose and pose a threat".&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

In 2004 the US passed the Bill HR1047 for the Emergency Protection for Iraq Cultural Antiquities Act, which allows the President authority to impose emergency import restrictions by Section 204 of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCIPA).&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Britain and Switzerland put into effect statutory prohibitions against illegally exported Iraqi artifacts.  In the UK, the Dealing in Cultural Objects Bill was established in 2003 that prohibited the handling of illegal cultural objects.

=== International conventions ===
The Hague Convention of 1907 aimed to forbid pillaging and sought to make wartime plunder the subject of legal proceedings, although in practice the defeated countries did not gain any leverage in their demands for repatriation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;  The Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict took place in the wake of widespread destruction of cultural heritage in [[World War II]] is the first international treaty of a worldwide vocation focusing exclusively on the protection of cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict.

The [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law) Convention on Stolen or Illicitly Exported Cultural Objects of 1995 called for the return of illegally exported cultural objects &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326162020/http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm |date=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
The 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention against Illicit Export under the Act to implement the Convention (the Cultural Property Implementation Act) allowed for stolen objects to be seized if there were documentation of it in a museum or institution of a state party and the following agreement in 1972 promoted world cultural and natural heritage&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978 UNESCO Convention strengthened existing provisions; the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of illicit Appropriation was established.  It consists of 22 members elected by the General Conference of UNESCO to facilitate bilateral negotiations for the restitution of "any cultural property which has a fundamental significance from the point of view of the spiritual values and cultural heritage of the people of a Member State or Associate Member of UNESCO and which has been lost as a result of colonial or foreign occupation or as a result of illicit appropriation".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riviere|first=Francoise|title=Editorial|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also created to "encourage the necessary research and studies for the establishment of coherent programmes for the constitution of representative collections in countries whose cultural heritage has been dispersed".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"/&gt;

In response to the Iraqi National Museum looting, UNESCO Director-General, [[Kōichirō Matsuura]] convened a meeting in Paris on April 17, 2003 in order to assess the situation and coordinate international networks in order to recover the cultural heritage of Iraq.  On July 8, 2003, [[Interpol]] and UNESCO signed an amendment to their 1999 Cooperation Agreement in the effort to recover looted Iraqi artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bouchenaki|first=Mounir|title=Return and restitution of cultural property in the wake of the 1970 Convention|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political issues ==

=== Colonialism and identity ===
From early on, the field of archaeology was deeply involved in political endeavors and in the construction of national identities. This early relationship can be seen during the [[Renaissance]] and the proto-Italian reactions against the [[High Gothic]] movement, but the relationship became stronger during 19th century Europe when archaeology became institutionalized as a field of study furnished by artifacts acquired during the rise of European colonialism led by the British and French.&lt;ref&gt;Silberman, pp. 249-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonialism and the field of archaeology mutually supported one another as the need to acquire knowledge of ancient artifacts justified further colonial dominance.

As further justification for colonial rule, the archaeological discoveries also shaped the way European colonialists identified with the artifacts and the ancient people who made them.  In the case of Egypt, colonial Europe's mission to bring the glory and magnificence of ancient Egypt closer to Europe and incorporate it into knowledge of world history, or better yet, European history placed ancient Egypt in a new spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Said 86&lt;/ref&gt;  With the archaeological discoveries, ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Colla 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization;&lt;ref&gt;Miles 320&lt;/ref&gt; by the same token, the appropriation of ancient Egyptian history as European history further legitimated Western colonial rule over Egypt.  But while ancient Egypt became patrimony of the West, modern Egypt remained a part of the Muslim world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  The writings of European archaeologists and tourists illustrate the impression that modern Egyptians were uncivilized, savage, and the antithesis of the splendor of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Museums furnished by colonial looting have largely shaped the way a nation imagines its dominion, the nature of the human beings under its power, the geography of the land, and the legitimacy of its ancestors, working to suggest a process of political inheriting.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 164&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to understand the paradoxical way in which the objects on display at museums are tangible reminders of the power held by those who gaze at them.&lt;ref&gt;Colla 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliot Colla describes the structure of the Egyptian sculpture room in the British Museum as an assemblage that "form[s] an abstract image of the globe with London at the center".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Colla 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Museum]], as Colla describes, presents a lesson of human development and progress:  "the forward march of human civilization from its classical origins in Greece and Rome, through Renaissance Italy, to modern-day London".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

The restoration of monuments was often made in colonial states to make natives feel as if in their current state, they were no longer capable of greatness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Anderson 181&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sometimes colonial rulers argued that the ancestors of the colonized people did not make the artifacts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Some scholars also argue that European colonialists used monumental archaeology and tourism to appear as the guardian of the colonized, reinforcing unconscious and undetectable ownership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Colonial rulers used peoples, religions, languages, artifacts, and monuments as source for reinforcing European nationalism, which was adopted and easily inherited from the colonial states.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

=== Nationalism and identity ===
As a direct reaction and resistance to colonial oppression, archaeology was also used for the purpose of legitimating the existence of an independent nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Andreu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Egyptian Nationalists utilized its ancient history to invent the political and expressive culture of "[[Pharaonism]]" as a response to Europe’s "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Colla 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Masada02 ST 04.jpg|thumb|Masada fortress, Israel]]  Some argue that in colonized states, nationalist archaeology was used to resist colonialism and racism under the guise of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, pp. 3-11&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is true that both colonialist and nationalist discourse use the artifact to form mechanisms to sustain their contending political agendas, there is a danger in viewing them interchangeably since the latter was a reaction and form of resistance to the former.  On the other hand, it is important to realize that in the process of emulating the mechanisms of colonial discourse, the nationalist discourse produced new forms of power.  In the case of the Egyptian nationalist movement, the new form of power and meaning that surrounded the artifact furthered the Egyptian independence cause but continued to oppress the rural Egyptian population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=June 2015}} argue that archaeology can be a positive source of pride in cultural traditions, but can also be abused to justify cultural or racial superiority as the Nazis argued that Germanic people of Northern Europe was a distinct race and cradle of Western civilization that was superior to Jewish race.{{citation needed|reason=We need a source that substantiates the relationship between archaeology and the Nazi concept of Germanic racial superiority.|date=June 2015}} In some conflicts that involve land ownership, archaeology is used to encourage confrontation by means of constructing of national myth as seen with the ancient fortress of [[Masada]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Paul|title=Masada legend galvanizes Israel|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7830416.stm|accessdate=6 November 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, archaeology allows rulers to justify the domination of neighboring peoples as [[Saddam Hussein]] used [[Mesopotamia]]'s magnificent past to justify his [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars employ the idea that identity is fluid and constructed, especially national identity of modern nation-states, to argue that the post-colonial countries have no real claims to the artifacts plundered from their borders since their cultural connections to the artifacts are indirect and equivocal.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xx-xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; This argument asserts that artifacts should be viewed as universal cultural property and should not be divided among artificially created [[nation-states]]. Moreover, that encyclopedic museums are a testament to diversity, tolerance and the appreciation of many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars would argue that this reasoning is a continuation of colonialist discourse attempting to appropriate the ancient art of colonized states and incorporate it into the narrative of Western history.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Controversy ==

{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
}}
The debate surrounding art repatriation differs case by case due to the specific nature of legal and historical issues surrounding each case, but below are listed general arguments commonly used:

=== Arguments against repatriation ===
* Artifacts are a part of a universal human history and encyclopedic museums like the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] cultivate the dissemination of knowledge, tolerance, and broad cultural understanding.
* Artifacts were frequently excavated or uncovered by looters, who brought to light a piece of artwork that would otherwise never have been seen; foreign-led excavation teams have uncovered items that contribute to cultural knowledge and understanding.
* Nationalist retentionist cultural property laws claiming ownership are founded on constructed boundaries of modern nations with weak connections to the culture, spirit, and race to the ancient peoples who produced those antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuno|first=James|title=Who Owns Antiquity? The Battle Over Our Ancient Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2010/10/20101022140412aidan0.7519953.html#By_James_Cuno|title=Who’s Right? Repatriation of Cultural Property|first=James|last=Cuno|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural identities are dynamic, inter-related and overlapping so no modern nation-state can claim cultural property as their own or else they are promoting a sectarian view of culture.
* Having artwork disseminated around the world encourages international scholarly and professional exchange.
* Encyclopedic museums are located in cosmopolitan cities such as London, Paris and New York, and if the artworks were to be moved, they would be seen by far fewer people. If the [[Rosetta Stone]] were to be moved from The British Museum to The [[Cairo Museum]], the number of people who view it would drop from about 5.5 million visitors to 2.5 million visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone] The Telegraph. By Charlotte Edwardes and Catherine Milner, 20 Jul 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for repatriation ===
* Encyclopedic museums such as the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] were established as repositories for looted art during imperial and colonial rule, and thus are located in metropolitan cities out of view and reach of the cultures from which they were appropriated.
* Precedence of repatriated art has already been set in many cases but the artworks that museums currently refuse to repatriate are the most valuable and famous artworks.
* Foreign-led excavations have justified colonial rule; in the pursuit of obtaining knowledge about the artifacts, there was a need to establish control over the artifacts and the countries where they were located.
* The argument that art is a part of a universal human history is a derivative of colonial discourse that appropriated ancient art of other cultures into the Western historical narrative.
* The encyclopedic museums that house much of the world's artworks and artifacts are located in Western cities and privilege European scholars, professionals and people.
* The argument that artwork will not be protected outside of the Western world is hypocritical as much of the artwork transported out of colonized countries was crudely removed and damaged and sometimes lost in transportation. The [[Elgin marbles]] for example, were also damaged during the cleaning and "preservation" process.
* Art is best appreciated and understood in its  original historical and cultural context. Moreover the ''Napried'', one of the ships commissioned by [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola|di Cesnola]] to transport approximately 35,000 pieces of antiquities that he had collected from [[Cyprus]], was lost at sea carrying about 5,000 pieces in its cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://napried.com/|title=Napried Exploration|website=napried.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Art taken out of the country as a spoil of war, looting, imperialism, and colonialism is unethical, even if it isn't reflected in legislation.  The possession of artwork taken under these conditions is a form of continued colonialism.
* The lack of existing legal recourse for claiming the return of illicitly appropriated cultural property is a result of colonization.
* Cultural property is a symbol of cultural heritage and identity and the appropriation of historical artworks is an affront to a nation's pride.

== International examples ==
[[File:Nofretete Neues Museum.jpg|thumb|The iconic bust of Nefertiti]]

=== Egypt ===
Egypt is seeking the repatriation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] from the [[British Museum]] and the [[Nefertiti bust]] from the [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin.

=== Greece ===
Greece is seeking repatriation of the [[Elgin Marbles]] from the [[British Museum]], taken from the [[Parthenon]] by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]]. Since 1816, the [[British Museum]] has held the Parthenon Marbles ("In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while other critics compared The British Consul at Greece Elgin's actions to vandalism or looting", text from the Marbles article), and, despite the tortuous and ill explained path from Greece to England, the museum strongly defends its right to own and display the marbles.
[[File:Euphronios krater side A MET L.2006.10.jpg|thumb|Euphronios Krater]]

=== Italy ===
In February 2006, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] negotiated the repatriation of the [[Euphronios krater]] to [[Italy]], from where it was thought to have been looted in the early 1970s.

=== Canada ===
The [[Haisla people|Haisla]] [[totem Pole]] of [[Kitimat, British Columbia]] was originally prepared for chief G'psgoalux in 1872.  This aboriginal artifact was donated to a Swedish museum in 1929. According to the donor, he had purchased the pole from the [[Haisla people]] while he lived on the Canadian west coast and served as Swedish consul. After being approached by the Haisla people, the Swedish government decided in 1994 to return the pole, as the exact circumstances around the acquisition were unclear. The pole was returned to Kitimat in 2006 after a building had been constructed in order to preserve the pole.

=== India ===
The U.K. has rejected India's fresh demand to return its priceless artifacts like "[[Koh-i-Noor|Kohinoor Diamond]]" and "[[Sultanganj Buddha]]" that were stolen/looted/smuggled during British colonial rule citing a law (The British Museum Act, 1963) that prevents it from giving back the items. ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) is planning to join a campaign with the support of UNESCO and other countries to regain the artifacts.

=== South Korea ===
In November 2010, Japan agreed to return some 1,000 cultural objects to South Korea that were plundered during its colonial occupation from 1910-45. The collection includes a collection of royal books called [[Uigwe]] from the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392-1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tong|first=Xiong|title=S Korea to retrieve stolen cultural property from Japan: media|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-11/08/c_13596596.htm|accessdate=15 November 2010|newspaper=Xinhua News Agency|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
During an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea [[Donald Gregg]] received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely. Former Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge [[Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.]] in Washington, D.C. awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as "extensive and shocking." The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgment from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">'''Sacro-Egoism''' is a term defining a sociological approach in [[Western world|Western society]] wherein the ultimate authority regarding religious thought and interpretation rests with the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Definition created by Dr. John S. Knox, PhD in Theology &amp; Religion (2009), [[University of Birmingham]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

As theological thought evolved, specifically after the advent of [[liberalism]] in the nineteenth century, a change began to take place in the religious world. Religious attitudes and prioritization seem to begin shifting from Sacro-Clericalism, where authority is given to the church and its representatives, to Sacro-Egoism, where the individual assumes greatest authority. The role of the individual, the self, was elevated more than ever before and self-reliance was glamorized, epitomized, and utilized in society—even until the present.

[[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theologians]] like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and Tillich ". . . sought to anchor that faith in common human experience, and interpret it in ways that made sense within the modern worldview."&lt;ref&gt;Alister McGrath, Historical Theology: An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 1998), 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher, known as the father of modern liberal theology, considered religion and Christianity to be ". . . the distinctly human awareness of something infinite beyond the self on whom the self is dependent for everything."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Olson, The Story of Christian Theology: Twenty Centuries of Tradition &amp; Reform (Illinois, IN: [[Inter-Varsity Press|InterVarsity Press]], 1999), 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though first a subtle and infrequent occurrence, more and more the authority and centrality of the Church began to lose ground to the prominence of the individual. Culturally, the expression of religion and Christianity encountered ". . . a turn towards life lived by reference to one's own subjective experiences (relational as much as individualistic)."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heelas and Linda Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution: Why Religion is Giving Way to Spirituality (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2005), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaning on one's own understanding became an asset, not a detriment, to religious life and approval.

According to Heelas and Woodhead, "The subjectivities of each individual become a, if not the, unique source of significance, meaning and authority."&lt;ref&gt;Heelas and Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution, 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Grasso continues this understanding stating, "Liberalism's movement toward an ever deeper [[individualism]] receives signal expression in the ascendancy of the type of liberalism that dominates our intellectual scene, in the ascendancy . . . termed the liberalism of the unencumbered self."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Grasso, ‘Christianity, Enlightenment Liberalism, and the Quest for Freedom,’ Modern Age (Fall 2006): 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Starks and Robinson comment that modernists ". . . see individuals and not a deity as the ultimate arbiters of [[moral authority]] and hold to a largely individually directed universe."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Starks and Robert Robinson, ‘Moral Cosmology, Religion, and Adult Values for Children,’ Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 46, no. 1 (March 2007): 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious focus has moved from the institution to the individual.

Currently, this shift can be observed in a variety of ways as mentioned earlier, most visibly in lowered membership and attendance numbers. This situation has been attributed to poor religious offerings, to a modern emphasis on the secular world, to ineffective participation and devotion of believers worldwide, or to the will of God (in some religious circles). While all these may be partially true, the danger is making a synecdoche of the products of decline and overestimating their importance and influence in religion.

Christian society has never operated from a vacuum. Furseth and Repstad state, "It is simply not true that individuals invent their own world-view in a void."&lt;ref&gt;Inger Furseth and Pål Repstad, An Introduction to the [[Sociology of religion|Sociology of Religion]] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; From its earliest beginnings, this [[Religion|religious movement]] has interacted closely with culture, as did its founder. Thus, this interaction ". . . is two-way: Christianity both influences and is influenced by culture."&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Historical Theology, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the expression of [[Christianity|Christian faith]] has never been static. Sociological studies of Religion such as the Kendal Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/projects/ieppp/kendal/methods.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the McMinnville Project&lt;ref&gt;John S. Knox PhD Dissertation Research Project (2006-7).&lt;/ref&gt; aptly demonstrate a religious transformation from older traditional patterns. Sacro-Egoism suggests that at the heart and in the origins of Christianity and modern religion is a personalized, dynamic, individualistic faith. This is Sacro-Egoism.

The '''San Buenaventura Conservancy''' is an [[historic preservation]] organization in [[Ventura, California]] also known by its early name of San Buenaventura. It works to recognize and revitalize historic, archeological and cultural resources in the region. The Conservancy is a membership based historic preservation non-profit 501c3 organization. The group was formed in 2004 after the demolition of the Mayfair Theater, an [[S. Charles Lee]], [[Streamline Moderne]], movie theater in downtown [[Ventura, California]] that was razed and replaced with a condo project.

== Mission ==

The San Buenaventura Conservancy mission statement: ''"To work through advocacy and outreach to recognize preserve and revitalize the irreplaceable historic, architectural and cultural resources of San Buenaventura and surrounding areas. To seek to increase public awareness of and participation in local preservation issues, and disseminate information useful in the preservation of structures and neighborhoods of San Buenaventura."''  [http://www.sbconservancy.org San Buenaventura Conservancy website]

== Programs &amp; Projects ==

The organization produces annual historic architecture tours in the historic neighborhoods and districts in midtown, downtown and the west side of  [[Ventura, California]]. The conservancy is an all-volunteer organization with a ten-member board. Some of the Conservancy's most successful projects outside of the Ventura architectural Weekend tours and trade shows has been the ability of the board to work closely the City of  [[Ventura, California]] and developers to find preservation solutions for historic buildings. At times the Conservancy advocates for specific historic buildings like Willett Ranch [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2008/feb/27/historical-willett-buildings-to-remain-on-site/ link to article] and the Top Hat Burger Palace in Ventura, the Frank Petit House in South [[Oxnard, California]], the Charles McCoy house, in [[Port Hueneme, California]], and the Bracero farm Worker Camp in [[Piru, California]], and the [[Wagon Wheel, Oxnard, California|Wagon Wheel Motel]] on the 101 Freeway in [[Oxnard, California]]. Additionally the Conservancy works to strengthen preservation policies of local municipalities. It has achieved success at integrating appropriate preservation actions and policies into Ventura's General Plan, Downtown Specific Plan, and Westside Community Plan.

On March 2, 2009 the San Buenaventura Conservancy – with attorney Susan Brandt-Hawley – filed suit in Ventura County Superior Court against the City of [[Oxnard, California]], claiming that the City’s approval of the Oxnard Village Specific Plan project violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). [http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/todays-news/lawsuit-stalls-loss-of-1947.html link to article] The project, as approved, requires the demolition of the Wagon Wheel Motel and restaurant, El Ranchito and bowling alley along with everything built on the {{convert|64|acre|m2|adj=on}} site. The Conservancy case argues that the project can be feasibly accomplished without demolition of the Wagon Wheel, and CEQA therefore does not allow the Class 1 impact. The lawsuit requests issuance of a peremptory writ ordering the City to set aside its approval of the project pending compliance with CEQA.

The original Ventura County Superior Court case was presented July 10, 2009. The Judge sided with the city of Oxnard. The San Buenaventura Conservancy has appealed the ruling and received a stay of demolition until the outcome of the appeal case: San Buenaventura Conservancy v. City of Oxnard et al. (CEQA) (Case: B220512 2nd District, Division 6.) [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2010/dec/15/final-arguments-presented-in-wagon-wheel-case/ link to article]  On Wednesday December 15, a three judge panel at the California 2nd district Court of Appeal in [[Ventura, California]] heard arguments from attorneys representing the case: Susan Brandt-Hawley for the San Buenaventura Conservancy, and Rachel Cook representing the developer ( Oxnard Village Investments, LLC.) and the city of [[Oxnard, California]]. The Appeals Court sided with the City of Oxnard on March 17, 2011 and agreed with the Superior court that the CEQA review was sufficient. The Wagon Wheel was demolished a week later.

'''Social architecture''' is the conscious design of an environment that encourages a desired range of social behaviors leading towards some goal or set of goals. The environment social architecture influences may be [[Social structure|social systems]], or digital spaces such as [[Social media|media]] tools (sometimes synonymous with [[Web 2.0]]) and [[User experience design|UX strategy]]. In building design it can refer to the architecture of social spaces such as bars and restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Gatsby. "Social Architecture: A New Approach To Designing Social Spaces." ''Huffington Post'' 06/05/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In social systems, "social architects" seek to modify human behaviors ([[behavior modification|behavior change]]) through carefully designed programs or workshops that seek to involve the members of a population to improve, for example, the livability and safety or environmental impact of their own communities.

In digital spaces,  "social architecture" is sometimes confused with "[[information architecture]]" or "[[interaction design]]".

The theory of social architecture can be applied to solve talent attraction and retention issues, while simultaneously combating a community's social issues. The Milwaukee-based firm, [http://www.newaukee.com NEWaukee] is the first social architecture firm in the United States.

== Architecture of On-Line Communities ==
In September 2011 [[Pieter Hintjens]] presented "Social Architecture 101" at Mix-IT in Lyon. Hintjens defined the term like this: "Social Architecture by analogy with conventional architecture, is the process, and the product, of planning, designing, and growing an online community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/pieterh/social-architecture101 Social Architecture 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hintjens' 2016 book, "Social Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Social-Architecture-Building--line-Communities-ebook/dp/B01F8I7Z7E Pieter Hintjens, "Social Architecture: Building On-line Communities", 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a theoretical framework and a set of tools for building online communities, including a contribution process&lt;ref&gt;[http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/ (C4)]&lt;/ref&gt; for open source software communities. The book refers to the [[ZeroMQ]] community as an example built using these tools and process.

== Kevin Werbach's interview on Amy Jo Kim ==
[[Amy Jo Kim]] is an American author and researcher on the subject of developing online communities. On [[Kevin Werbach]] interview on Amy Jo Kim. Kevin states that "Amy Jo Kim is an expert in the development of social architectures."

== Social architecture on team-building ==

Social Architecture is different from interaction design and information architecture. Rather, it can be illustrated with the combination of two. Specifically, the idea is to use structural (e.g. software, organizational rule) tools to design a socio-technical infrastructure for participants to behave in the wanted direction of the designer. It can be used as a conceptual framework for directing building a real-world community of which member communication is mostly taking off online. Social architecture aims for creating an effective infrastructure for non-face-to-face communication and management.

As more and more across-devices team-building platform (such as [https://slack.com Slack] [http://basecamp.com Basecamp]\[https://www.teambition.com Teambition]\[https://tower.im Tower.im]) has been used, they provide some empirically-designed communication pattern for new joined teams whose major communications taking off online.

The popular team-building platforms have some common features that their designers see as providing more efficient online communications. Mostly the team leader (or any member) will create a team on the platform with customizable name and invite other team members to join this team. The created team will be able to use designed features from the platform. They include:

'''Newsfeed''': Similar to Facebook's news feed, it is a semi-public feed where all joined team members can post or update their thoughts and get immediate or delayed feedback from other team members.

'''Discussion Board:''' Team members can create threads related to topics for all members to participate in discussing.

'''File Sharing:''' Team member can upload files from their multi-platform devices and cloud storage.

'''Chatroom and Private chat:''' They provide real-time chat among all team members or between specific team members.

'''Task-distribution and checklist:''' Team members can(be) distribute tasks and set deadlines.

'''Calendar:''' A shared calendar with deadlines and important dates.

The term '''suspension of disbelief''' or '''willing suspension of disbelief''' has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary|author=&lt;!--None listed.--&gt;|date=2018|dictionary=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]|title=suspend disbelief (phrase)|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|access-date=29 July 2018|edition=Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=|oclc=656668849|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729045913/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|archive-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. '''Cognitive estrangement''' in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199532919|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "suspension of disbelief" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= From 'King Kong' to 'Indecent Proposal,' audiences have been asked to buy a premise that can make – or break – a film|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=15 April 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-15/entertainment/ca-23034_1_indecent-proposal|accessdate=2010-10-24|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief is often an essential element for a magic act or a circus sideshow act. For example, an audience is not expected to actually believe that a woman is [[Sawing a woman in half|cut in half]] or transforms into a gorilla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Botos|first=Tim|title=‘Gorilla Girl' sideshow act hangs on despite changing times|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/archive/x144223716/-Gorilla-Girl-sideshow-act-hangs-on-despite-changing-times|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=GateHouse News Service; Patriot Ledger|date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to enjoy the performance.

According to the theory, suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. [[Black-and-white]] films provide an obvious early example that audiences are willing to suspend disbelief, no matter how implausible the images appear, for the sake of entertainment. With the exception of totally color blind people ([[Achromatopsia|achromats]]), no person viewing these films sees the real world without color, but some are still willing to suspend disbelief and accept the images in order to be entertained. Suspension of disbelief is also supposed to be essential for the enjoyment of many films and television shows involving complex stunts, special effects, and seemingly unrealistic plots and characterizations.

== Coleridge's original formulation ==
Coleridge coined the phrase in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'', published in 1817, in the context of the creation and reading of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William.  ''On Language; Suspension of Disbelief''. New York Times. 7 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XIV describes the preparations with [[Wordsworth]] for their revolutionary collaboration ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (first edition 1798), for which Coleridge had contributed the more romantic, gothic pieces including ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. [[Alexander Pope]], notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural. Coleridge wished to revive the use of fantastic elements in poetry. The concept of "willing suspension of disbelief" explained how a modern, enlightened audience might continue to enjoy such types of story.

Coleridge recalled:

{{quote|... It was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. Mr. Wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object, to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us ...&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, 1817, Chapter XIV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The notion of such an action by an audience was however recognized in antiquity, as seen particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace, who also lived in an age of increasing skepticism about the supernatural, in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (with the quotation ''[[Ut pictura poesis]]'').

== Examples in literature ==
{{See also|Dramatic convention}}
Suspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who refers to it in the Prologue to ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'':

{{quote|[…] make imaginary puissance […] 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings […] turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.}}

== Psychology ==
Psychological critic Norman Holland points to a neuroscientific explanation.  When we hear or watch any narrative, our brains go wholly into perceiving mode, turning off the systems for acting or planning to act, and with them go our systems for assessing reality. We have, in Coleridge's second, more accurate phrase, "poetic faith". That's why humans have such trouble recognizing lies: they first believe, then have to make a conscious effort to disbelieve.

Only when we stop perceiving to think about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really "into" the fiction – "transported", in the psychologists' term – we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, "disinterested". We respond aesthetically, without purpose.  We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if we stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Spiderman? Sure! The Neuroscience of Disbelief|journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=312–320|url=https://www.researchgate.net/researcher/2003369909_Norman_Holland|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Literature and the Brain|url=http://www.literatureandthebrain.com|website=Literatureandthebrain.com|publisher=PsyArt|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief has also been used within a mental health context by Frank DeFulgentis in his book ''Flux''. It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]. In the book, the author suggests 'suspending disbelief' as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine. We can thereby allow ourselves to be absorbed in the activities around us until these irrationalities vanish on their own accord.

== Criticisms ==

[[Aesthetics|Aesthetic philosophers]] generally reject claims that suspension of disbelief accurately characterizes the relationship between people and "fictions." [[Kendall Walton]] notes that, if viewers were to truly suspend disbelief at a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions. For instance, audience members would cry out, "Look behind you!" to an endangered on-screen character or call the police when they witnessed an on-screen murder.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2025831 Fearing Fictions]", Kendall L. Walton, [[JSTOR]] (''[[Journal of Philosophy|The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol. 75, No. 1 (01-1978), pp. 5–27). Retrieved 3 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these criticisms simply fail to notice that Coleridge's original statement came in a restrictive clause. The formulation "...that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith," of necessity implies that there are different sorts of suspension of disbelief and specifies that poetic faith is one instance of a larger class. One need not choose to believe that a character in a horror film is a real person in order, for example, to choose to believe that the character is looking at the building seen in the following reverse-shot.{{or|date=August 2018}}

Not all authors believe that suspension of the disbelief adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] challenges this concept in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", choosing instead the paradigm of secondary belief based on inner [[consistency]] of reality. Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an [[Fictional universe#Definition|internally consistent fictional world]], the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. “On Fairy-Stories.” The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983, pp. 109–61.

'''Timothy James "T.J." Clark''' (born 12 April 1943 in [[Bristol]], England) is a British art historian and writer. He taught art history in a number of universities in England and the United States, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Clark has been influential in developing the field of art history, examining modern paintings as an articulation of the social and political conditions of modern life. His orientation is distinctly leftist, and he has often referred to himself as a Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/clarkt|title=Clark, T. J.|first=|last=admin|date=21 February 2018|website=arthistorians.info|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/T-J--Clark-and-the-Marxist-critique-of-modern-painting-6863|title=T.J. Clark and the Marxist critique of modern painting|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

[[File:UC-Berkeley-campus-overview-from-hills.h.jpg|thumb|University of California, Berkeley, where Clark was a professor until his retirement in 2010]]

Clark attended [[Bristol Grammar School]]. He completed his undergraduate studies at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], he obtained a first-class honours degree in 1964. He received his PhD in art history from the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], [[University of London]] in 1973. He lectured at the [[University of Essex]] 1967–69 and then at [[Camberwell College of Arts]] as a senior lecturer, 1970–74.

During this time he was also a member of the British Section of the [[Situationist International]], from which he was expelled along with the other members of the English section. He was also involved in the group [[King Mob]].

In 1973 he published two books based on his PhD dissertation: ''The Absolute Bourgeois: Artists and Politics in France, 1848–1851'' and ''Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the Second French Republic, 1848–1851.'' He taught at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1974–76. In 1976, he became a founding member of the Caucus for Marxism and Art of the [[College Art Association]].

Clark returned to Britain in 1976 when he was appointed professor and head of the Department of Fine Art at the [[University of Leeds]].  In 1980 Clark joined the Department of Fine Arts at [[Harvard University]], which angered some of the more conservative, connoisseurship-oriented faculty members, especially the [[Renaissance]] art historian [[Sydney Freedberg]], with whom he had a public feud.

In 1982 he published an essay, "[[Clement Greenberg]]'s Theory of Art", critical of prevailing Modernist theory, which prompted a notable and pointed exchange with [[Michael Fried]]. This exchange contributed to the debate between formalist and social histories of art.

Clark's works have taken art history in a new direction, away from traditional preoccupations with [[artistic|style]] and [[iconography]]. His books regard modern paintings as expressions of sociopolitical conditions in modern life.

In 1988 he joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, where he held the George C. and Helen N. Pardee Chair as Professor of Modern Art until his retirement.

In 1991 Clark was awarded the College Art Association's Distinguished Teaching of Art History Award. Notable students include Brigid Doherty, Hollis Clayson, [[Thomas E. Crow]], Margaret Werth, Nancy Locke, Christina Kiaer, [[Michael Kimmelman]], Howard Lay, Michael Leja, Ara H. Merjian, Richard Meyer, [[John O'Brian]], Bridget Alsdorf, Matthew Jackson, Joshua Shannon, and [[Jonathan Weinberg]].

As a member of [[Retort collective|Retort]], a Bay Area-based collective of radical intellectuals, he co-authored the book ''Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War'', published by Verso Books in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/nopqrs/r-titles/retort_afflicted_powers.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923235124/http://www.versobooks.com/books/nopqrs/r-titles/retort_afflicted_powers.shtml |archivedate=23 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }} {{ISBN|1844670317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Clark received a Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mellon.org/news_publications/announcements-1/2005-distinguished/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526042346/http://www.mellon.org/news_publications/announcements-1/2005-distinguished/ |archivedate=26 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he received an honorary degree from the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]. He and his wife [[Anne Wagner]], who also taught art history at Berkeley, retired in 2010 and moved to London. He continues to be active as a guest lecturer, author, and now as a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wheelercentre.com/calendar/event/tj-clark-the-art-historian-and-the-poet/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611055847/http://wheelercentre.com/calendar/event/tj-clark-the-art-historian-and-the-poet/ |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Picasso and Truth: From Cubism to Guernica'' is based on his Mellon Lectures in Fine Art delivered in spring 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mills.edu/news/2010/newsarticle02022010art_historians.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903074707/http://www.mills.edu/news/2010/newsarticle02022010art_historians.php |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temperance songs''' are those musical compositions that were sung and performed to promote the [[Temperance Movement]] from the 1840s to the 1920s.  It was a distinct [[genre]] of [[American music]]. In 1830 the US per capita consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] was 9.5 gallons yearly, almost four times the rate of consumption in 2008. In response, many [[List of Temperance organizations|temperance organizations]] formed over the next eighty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Songs of the Temperance Movement and Prohibition | publisher=Library of Congress | url = https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197382#item-article | accessdate = 2015-10-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temperance song lyrics were sung with already well-known songs of the period, for example, "[[Oh! Susanna]]". This [[Stephen Foster]] melody was used with lyrics in support of temperance and the title changed to “There’s A Good Time Coming,” in 1857, ten years after the publication of the [[s:Oh! Susanna|original lyrics of "Oh! Susanna"]].

== Development and genre history ==

[[File:Molly and the baby, Don't you know.ogg|thumb|A recording of "Molly and the Baby", a temperance song from 1916]]
A consistent [[Theme (arts)|theme]] within temperance songs of 19th and 20th century society was that drinking negatively impacted a stable [[family]] life and that it was at the center of much suffering. "Molly and the Baby Don't You Know" is about a father promising not to drink for the sake of his young child and [[suffering]] wife. Some temperance songs were intended to produce [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about the consequences of alcohol consumption. Themes including [[physical abuse|abuse]] were common, such as "The Drunkard's Child," by [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst|Mrs. Parkhurst]], 1870. In this song, a mother hears her child decry that her father's drinking and their poverty leads to her being ignored by her peers. An archived field-recording of this song, sung by John McCready, relates the song of a dying child of an [[alcoholic intoxication|alcoholic]]. The child fears he or she will not be allowed to enter [[heaven]].&lt;ref name=LIBC!&gt;{{cite web | title = Songs of the Temperance Movement and Prohibition | publisher=Library of Congress

=== Comrades, Fill No Glass for Me ===

Foster’s Temperance song, “Comrades, Fill No Glass for Me” (1855), is thought to be a narrative of his own drinking struggle. The melody to these lyrics are unknown:
''Oh, comrades, fill no glass for me,

''To drown my soul in liquid flame'',

=== A License Party Trick (sung to the tune of Oh! Susanna) ===

::: There was a great election once, (We need not name the date,)
:::: Out in Ohio, and it lost Republicans the State.
::: That party runs the Government With still house revenue,
:::: And boasts much of its temperance, From its “high license” view.

: ''(chorus)''
::: Oh, high license,
:::: How is that for high?
::: You’ll make your party very sick and
:::: It will surely die.
::::::: ''etc, etc''

&lt;!-- We cannot include all the lyrics of a song and certainly not several. Song lyrics belong in wikisource or as ogg files that can be referenced here.

Republicans are anxious, Sir, With two faced policy,&lt;br&gt;
To suit both rum and temperance,&lt;br&gt;
Just as the case may be;&lt;br&gt;
To hoodwink Prohibitionists, This is a cunning trick,&lt;br&gt;
But in the end, ‘twill hurt themselves,&lt;br&gt;
And make them very sick.

How can one trust such party, Sir, With plans so opposite,&lt;br&gt;
That offers either right or wrong, To all who vote for it?&lt;br&gt;
No wonder people in disgust&lt;br&gt;
Upon such morals frown; Like as Ohio, they will put&lt;br&gt;
Such double dealing down.

That party is the wrong one, Sir, To wear a temp’rance name&lt;br&gt;
Yet make high license fallacy&lt;br&gt;
Its highest moral aim!&lt;br&gt;
It cannot carry both at once,&lt;br&gt;
The church and the saloon, As other States will let it know,&lt;br&gt;
Besides Ohio, soon.

Of late, severe rebuke unto Republicans has come,&lt;br&gt;
And yet, deluded people trust The treachery of rum!&lt;br&gt;
They cling to party, though it be The known ally of drink!&lt;br&gt;
But with some more experience,&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

:::: They'll vote with us, we think.

This temperance song was sung to the tune of "Oh! Susanna", and was written in response to [[abolitionist]] and legislative developments of the times. In 1851, the state of [[Maine]] established statewide prohibition. Other states subsequently adopted similar [[legislation]]. "A License Party Trick" specifically refers to legislation passed in 1883 in [[Ohio]] when [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] lost the governorship and the majority in the state [[Ohio House of Representatives|House]] and [[Ohio Senate|senate]]. The ousted legislators and [[Charles Foster (Ohio politician)|Governor Charles Foster]]'s (no relation) attempt to tax and regulate alcohol sales resulted in the loss of support of temperance supporters. Voters found the politician's attempts at legislation as too [[liberalism|liberal]]. The legislative defeat was also attributed to the lack of support of [[Germans|German]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] [[voter]]s who believed the proposed [[liquor]] policies to be overly restrictive.

== Other songwriters ==
[[File:Temperance song hand book.jpg|thumb|350px|This is the songbook used at the Womens Temperance Organization from Wilkinsburg, PA]]
From the 1840s to 1920, the American Temperance Movement produced a large number of songs. Some of the more notable composers were Stephen Foster, [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst|Mrs. E.A. Parkhurst]], M. Evans, [[George Frederick Root|George F. Root]], and [[Henry Clay Work|Henry Work]]. Another specific example of a popular song of the times is "The Drunkard's Child," by Mrs. Parkhurst written in 1870. In the song a child complains to her mother that she is ignored by others because she is poor and her father drinks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The temperance songwriters tended to write songs sympathetic to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. This is in contrast to Stephen Foster who wrote [[minstrel songs]]. This genre is seen as racist today, and his own family opposed the [[abolition of slavery]]. Foster differed from the other temperance [[composer]]s in that he also wrote [[drinking songs]]. Some [[historian]]s believe that Foster drank heavily.&lt;ref name=SAND/&gt;

[[James Lord Pierpont]], composer of “[[Jingle Bells]],” created temperance songs with the [[melody]] of this still  popular holiday tune.&lt;ref name=SAND/&gt;

== Songs of Temperance organizations ==
Some locally organized temperance organizations printed and published their own temperance songs, some of which were derived from hymns. For example, the [[Old 100th|doxology]] has been modified with the following lyrics:
::::Praise God from Whom all blessings flow,
:::Praise him who saves from deepest woe,
::::Praise him who leads the temperance host,
:::Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Sirian Experiments''''' is a 1980 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the third book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues the story of [[Earth]]'s [[evolution]], which has been manipulated from the beginning by advanced [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilisation]]s.&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DE143BF930A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Sirian Experiments |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=13 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in December 1980 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1981 by [[Jonathan Cape]]. The book was shortlisted for the [[List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/1981 |title=The Man Booker Prize 1981 |work=[[Booker Prize]] |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sirian Experiments'' relates directly to the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]'', which is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, [[Canopus]], [[Sirius]] and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. ''Shikasta'' is told from the Canopean viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/shikastaby.html |title=Shikasta |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sirian Experiments'' (subtitled ''The Report by Ambien II, of the Five'') tells the story of Shikasta from the Sirian point of view and describes the activities of Sirians on the planet and the strained relations of Sirius with Canopus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/theexperiments.html |title=The Sirian Experiments |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessing stated in an [[afterword]] in the [[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8|next book]] in this series that ''The Sirian Experiments'' and ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination with the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]].{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and reception==
Because of its focus on characterisation and social/cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of technological details, ''The Sirian Experiments'' is not strictly science fiction but [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing calls her ''Canopus in Argos'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} Robert Alter of ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre [[literary critic]] [[Northrop Frye]] called the "anatomy", which is "a combination of fantasy and morality" and that "presents us with a vision of the world in terms of a single intellectual pattern."&lt;ref name=NYTreview&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3D8173BF932A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Doris Lessing in the Visionary Mode |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Robert |last=Alter |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=11 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing has stated that she has used this series as a vehicle to "put questions, both to myself and to others" and to "explore ideas and sociological possibilities."{{sfn|Lessing|1994b|loc="Preface", p. 11}}

While Lessing's switch to "science fiction" in the late 1970s was not well received by all,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mural.uv.es/vemivein/feminismcommunism.htm |title=Doris Lessing on Feminism, Communism and 'Space Fiction' |work=[[University of Valencia]] Press |first=Lesley |last=Hazelton |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series in general has drawn positive criticism. Two reviews of ''The Sirian Experiments'' in ''The New York Times'' said that Lessing achieves "… a largeness of vision beyond the horizon of the conventional novel."&lt;ref name=NYTreview/&gt; and that it has "… some playful moments and some splendid ones. It is interesting, however, primarily because Doris Lessing wrote it."&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on the other hand, which had spoken highly of the first two books in this series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947537,00.html |title=Visit to a Small Planet |first=Paul |last=Gray |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=22 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924037,00.html |title=Soul Mates |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=21 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt that this one "may be a small misstep on a long journey."&lt;ref name=TIMEreview&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949106,00.html |title=More Lessing |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=23 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Sirian Empire, centred in the [[Sirius]] star system, has advanced technology that made their citizens effectively immortal (barring accidents) and sophisticated machines that did almost everything for them. But this technology came at a price: many Sirians became afflicted with "the existentials", a debilitating malady that left them feeling worthless and with no reason to exist. To overcome this problem and give its people "something to do", Sirius embarked on a conquest of space and [[Colonisation|colonised]] many planets. But they also encroached on territory of the superior Canopean Empire that led to a costly war, which [[Canopus]] won. As a gesture of reconciliation, Canopus returned all the captured Sirian territory and invited Sirius to jointly colonise a new and promising planet called Rohanda (an allegorical [[Earth]]). Canopus took the northern continents and gave Sirius the southern continents.

Ambien II, one of the Five who run the Sirian Colonial Service and also govern the Sirian Empire, represents Sirius on Rohanda. She sets in motion a series of [[biology|bio]]-[[Sociology|sociological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] experiments where large numbers of primitive [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] from Sirian colonised planets are space-lifted to Rohanda and adapted there for work elsewhere in the Empire. In the north, Canopus nurtures Rohanda's bourgeoning [[humanoid]]s and accelerates their [[evolution]]. They also put a Lock on the planet that links it to the harmony and strength of the Canopean Empire. Canopus keeps Ambien II updated with reports of all their work, but she is suspicious of Sirius's former enemy, seeing them as a competitor rather than a partner, and is unable to correctly interpret them.

Then an unforeseen "cosmic re-alignment" breaks the Lock and Shammat of the malicious Puttiora Empire begins exploiting the situation by corrupting Rohanda's Natives. Canopus, seeing Rohanda decline, renames the planet [[Shikasta]] (the stricken). Sirius, unconcerned about Canopus's troubles in the north, continue to refer to the planet as Rohanda.

In an attempt to foster better relations with Sirius, Klorathy, a senior Canopean Colonial administrator, invites Ambien II to observe events in their territory. Ambien II, eager to learn more about Canopus, agrees. As Rohanda evolves and civilisations come and go, Ambien II and Klorathy meet several times to watch Rohanda's degeneration. Canopus does what it can to help communities, but with Shammat's evil and a broken Lock, they make little progress. From time to time Klorathy requests Ambien II's help and while working on the planet, she meets Nasar, another Canopean official. She also encounters Tafta, the Shammat commander on Rohanda, and at one point nearly succumbs to his corruption.

Ambien II eventually abandons the Sirian Experiments in the south when they are overrun by Shammat. The Five want her to abandon Rohanda altogether, but she has become too attached to the planet and is warming to Canopus and seeing the error of her (and Sirius's) ways. The Five question her ties to their former enemy, but when she tries to explain herself, they do not hear what she is saying, just as she initially could not hear what Canopus was saying. The Five then send her to Planet 13 on "corrective exile" to write a report on what has happened (this book). When she later releases the report, the Five issues a statement denying the authenticity of Ambien II's work.

==Signs and symptoms==

[[File:FireAntBite.jpg|thumb|Formation of pustules on a human leg]]

Reactions seen in humans vary; some are hypersensitive to venom while others show resilience. [[Hypersensitivity]] can be attributed to certain medical problems such as heart conditions or diabetes. Bacterial infections attributed to sting injuries also pose a problem and may require further medical attention. Most humans can withstand many stings, but others may suffer from severe reactions such as anaphylaxis.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drees|first1=B.M.|title=Medical problems and treatment considerations for the red imported fire ant|url=https://fireant.tamu.edu/files/2011/12/FAPFS023_2002rev_Medical.pdf|work=Texas Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Project|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are stung by red imported fire ants may experience intense local burning or flare-ups, followed by reddening of the skin at the sting site. This area will swell into a bump, hive or [[Cutaneous condition#Primary lesions|vesicle]] within 20 minutes.

Many of them will experience pruritic lumps around areas where the ants stung, known as late-phase responses or cutaneous allergic reactions.&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stafford|first1=C.T.|title=Fire ant allergy|journal=Allergy Proceedings|date=1992|volume=13|issue=1|pages=11–16|pmid=1577260|doi=10.2500/108854192778878971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caro_et_al_1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caro|first1=M.R.|last2=Derbes|first2=V.J.|last3=Jung|first3=R.|title=Skin responses to the sting of the imported fire ant (''Solenopsis Saevissima'')|journal=Archives of Dermatology|date=1957|volume=75|issue=4|pages=475–488|doi=10.1001/archderm.1957.01550160001001|pmid=13410107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pustule formation can only be prevented if the ants are removed before they have a chance to sting. Once venom has been injected, pustules will form and no form of treatment will prevent them from occurring. Medications such as antibiotics, [[2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine|diphenylhydrazines]], [[epinephrine]]s or [[topical steroids]] will not affect pustular reactions.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caro_et_al_1957"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parrino|first1=J.|last2=Kandawalla|first2=N.M.|last3=Lockey |first3=R.F.|title=Treatment of local skin response to imported fire ant sting |journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=1981 |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1361–1364 |pmid=7302637 |doi=10.1097/00007611-198111000-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.6 to 6% of people who have been stung by the ants, and it can be fatal if left untreated.&lt;ref name="Prahlow_Barnard_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt; Typical symptoms of anaphylaxis include dizziness, headaches, fever, severe chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood pressure, loss of breath, serious swelling, and slurred speech.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xu_et_al_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/fireants.html|title=Insects and Scorpions – Fire Ants |accessdate=11 April 2008|date=2008|work=The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922153947/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/fireants.html|archivedate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case reports a victim feeling strong [[vertigo]] 5 to 10 minutes after being stung, followed by glassy eyes, dry mouth, paleness, unconsciousness and severe cramps on the sting sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haddad Junior|first1=V.|last2=Larsson |first2=C.E.|title=Anaphylaxis caused by stings from the ''Solenopsis invicta'', lava-pés ant or red imported fire ant|journal=Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia|date=2015|volume=90|issue=3 |pages=22–25|doi=10.1590/abd1806-4841.20153420 |pmid=26312665|pmc=4540499}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Peripheral neuropathy|neuropathy]], seizures (even without any evidence of prior systemic reactions), [[Stroke|cerebrovascular accidents]], and [[nephrotic syndrome]] have been associated with red imported fire ant stings.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Candiotti|first1=Keith A.|last2=Lamas|first2=Ana M.|title=Adverse neurologic reactions to the sting of the imported fire ant |journal=International Archives of Allergy and Immunology|date=1993|volume=102|issue=4 |pages=417–420 |doi=10.1159/000236592 |pmid=8241804}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of [[neurotoxin]]s have been identified in red imported fire ant venom, which may explain why some victims experience hallucinations after they have been stung.&lt;ref name="Gebel_2012"/&gt;

==Treatment==

{{main|Allergen immunotherapy}}
[[File:Adrenalina.jpg|thumb|left|Adrenaline (also called epinephrine) can quickly reverse the adverse events of dyspnoea and hypotension]]

It is suggested that a conservative approach be used when treating sting injuries; specifically, the kind of treatment used should be based on the symptoms. For minor sting injuries, with symptoms only including pustule formations and pain, over-the-counter products are available to prevent infection. Ants should be removed by washing the area with antiseptic soap, and itchiness. It is rare for ant sting sites to become infected, so the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is not always required.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pesek_Lockey_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pesek|first1=R.D.|last2=Lockey|first2=R.F.|title=Management of insect sting hypersensitivity: an update|journal=Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Research|date=2013|volume=5|issue=3|pages=129–137|doi=10.4168/aair.2013.5.3.129|pmid=23638310|pmc=3636446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims who show signs of anaphylaxis are treated with antihistamines, [[epinephrine]]s, and parenteral corticosteroids.&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt; Epinephrine is the first product for use to treat systemic allergic responses, particularly if a patient is experiencing [[dyspnoea]] or [[hypotension]] because it is capable of reversing adverse events quickly and is very safe to use. It is recommended that people who have suffered from anaphylaxis carry an [[epinephrine autoinjector]] (EpiPen), should dyspnoea or hypotension begin to occur.&lt;ref name="Solley_et_al_2002"/&gt;

Whole body extract immunotherapy (WBE) to treat victims of anaphylaxis has been in use since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moffitt |first1=J.E. |last2=Barker|first2=J.R.|last3=Stafford |first3=C.T.|title=Management of imported fire ant allergy: Results of a survey |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology |date=1997|volume=79|issue=2|pages=125–130 |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)63098-0 |pmid=9291416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Triplett|first1=R.F.|title=Sensitivity to the imported fire ant: successful treatment with immunotherapy |journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=1973|volume=66|issue=4|pages=477–480 |pmid=4708246 |doi=10.1097/00007611-197304000-00019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who has a suspected allergy to the venom is redirected to an allergist for assessment.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt; The treatment uses the entire body of the ant and not just the venom, and unlike fire ant venom immunotherapy (which is occasionally used), WBE contains venom proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordvall|first1=S.L.|last2=Johansson|first2=S.G.|last3=Ledford|first3=D.K.|last4=Lockey|first4=R.F.|title=Allergens of the imported fire ant.|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=1988|volume=82|issue=4|pages=567–576 |pmid=3171000|doi=10.1016/0091-6749(88)90966-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce a patient's sensitivity to the venom, gradual increases of dose extracts are injected into the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Allergies: Insect Sting Allergy|url=http://acaai.org/allergies/types/insect-sting-allergies|publisher=American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBE immunotherapy appears to be very effective in preventing systemic reactions; in one study of participants who completed WBE immunotherapy, two out of fifteen participants suffered from allergic reactions upon being stung 18 months after immunotherapy.&lt;ref name="Pesek_Lockey_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=T.|last2=Hylander|first2=R. |last3=Ortiz|first3=A.|last4=Martin|first4=M.|title=Imported fire ant immunotherapy: Effectiveness of whole body extracts|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=1992|volume=90|issue=2 |pages=210–215|doi=10.1016/0091-6749(92)90073-B|pmid=1500625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paull|first1=B.R.|title=Imported fire ant allergy.

==Stings to animals==

The stings of the red imported fire ant in animals are painful, and may prove life-threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prahlow |first1=Joseph A. |last2=Barnard |first2=Jeffrey J. |title=Fatal Anaphylaxis Due to Fire Ant Stings |journal=The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology |date=June 1998 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=137–142 |doi=10.1097/00000433-199806000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dogs, stings from the red imported fire ant can cause pustular [[Cutaneous condition|dermatosis]], a condition where [[pustule]]s appear in crops as a result of the ant sting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conceição|first1=L.G.|last2=Haddad|first2=V.

The pustules remain for approximately 24 hours, whereas in humans they can last for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rakich|first1=P.M.|last2=Latimer |first2=K.S.|last3=Mispagel |first3=M.E.|last4=Steffens |first4=W.L. |title=Clinical and histologic characterization of cutaneous reactions to stings of the imported fire ant (''Solenopsis invicta'') in dogs |journal=Veterinary Pathology|date=1993 |volume=30|issue=6|pages=555–559 |doi=10.1177/030098589303000609|pmid=8116149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In livestock, red imported ants mostly sting animals in regions with no hair, particularly around the ears, eyes, muzzle, the [[perineum]] and ventral portion of the abdomen. Newborn or young livestock can be blinded or killed when attacked by the ants.&lt;ref name="Drees_et_al_2002"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drees|first1=B.M.|last2=Jensen|first2=J.M. |last3=Joyce|first3=J.R.|last4=Barr|first4=C.L. |last5=Reagor|first5=J.C.|title=Diagnosing and treating animals for red imported fire ant injury|url=http://fireant.tamu.edu/files/2013/02/FAPFS022.2002rev.pdf|work=Texas Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Project|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|accessdate=30 March 2016|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Capinera|2008|p=189}} Healthy individuals are less likely to be attacked than weak or sick animals. Red [[papule]] and mild swelling occur, followed by vesicopustule with a red halo developing within 24 to 48 hours. The eyes and eyelids are commonly damaged from the stings; in sheep and goats, ophthalmic ointment containing antibiotics and corticosteroids can be used to treat the eyes of sheep and goats, but this treatment is not recommended for horses. In non-domestic animals, cases of red imported fire ants stings in animals such as ferrets, moles squirrels, white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, and newborn blackbucks have been reported, as well as lizards and screech owl nestlings. The aftermath of the injuries is like those in domestic animals.&lt;ref name="Drees_et_al_2002"/&gt;

Red imported fire ants are known to actively kill vertebrate animals, and cause significant livestock losses.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C.T. (1986) Agricultural and medical impact of the imported fire ants. In: Lofgren, C.S. and Vander Meer, R.K. (eds) Fire Ants and Leq.fcutting Ants: Biology and Management. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, pp. 48-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals may trigger major stinging episodes when they disturb active nests, with thousands of ants participating in the attack. During such episodes an animal may suffer from hundreds to thousands of individual stings. It is suspected that many victims of the red imported fire ants may be [[Animal psychopathology#Depression|depressed]] as a result of the effects of the toxin. Some animals may swallow red imported fire ants as they lick or bite around the sites they are stinging. This can cause additional injuries inside the animal itself, especially in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In suckling white tail deer fawns, sting sites have been found in the oesophagus and [[abomasum]]; toxins from the ingested ants may cause inflammation of the gastrointestinal lining.&lt;ref name="Drees_et_al_2002"/&gt;

The '''Faculty of Mathematics''' is one of six faculties of the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], offering over 500 courses in [[mathematics]], [[statistics]] and [[computer science]]. The Faculty also houses the [[David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science]], formerly the Faculty's computer science department.

==History==
The Faculty was founded on January 1, 1967, a successor to the University of Waterloo's Department of Mathematics, which had grown to be the largest department in the [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Arts|Faculty of Arts]] under the chairmanship of [[Ralph Gordon Stanton|Ralph Stanton]] (and included such influential professors as [[W. T. Tutte]]).{{r|history}} Initially located in the Physics building, the Faculty was moved in May 1968 into the newly constructed Mathematics and Computing (MC) Building. Inspired by Stanton's famously gaudy ties, the students draped a large pink tie over the MC Building on the occasion of its opening, which later became a symbol of the Faculty.&lt;ref name=pinktie&gt;{{cite web|title=Legend of the Pink Tie|url=https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/About/pinktie.shtml|date=17 August 2011|website=Faculty of Mathematics|publisher=University of Waterloo|access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its founding, the Faculty included five departments: [[Computer science|Applied Analysis and Computer Science]], [[Applied Mathematics]], [[Combinatorics|Combinatorics and Optimization]], [[Pure Mathematics]], and [[Statistics]]. In 1975 the Department of Applied Analysis and Computer Science became simply the Department of Computer Science; in 2005 it became the [[David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science]]. The Statistics Department also was later renamed the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science.{{r|history}}

The Faculty of Mathematics finished construction of a third building, Mathematics 3 (M3), in 2011. It now houses the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science and a large lecture hall.

==Academics==
===Degrees===
The Faculty of Mathematics grants the [[Bachelor of Mathematics|BMath]] (Bachelor of Mathematics) degree for most of its undergraduate programs. Computer Science undergraduates can generally choose between graduating with a BMath or a [[Bachelor of Computer Science|BCS]] (Bachelor of Computer Science) degree. The former requires more coursework in mathematics. Specialized degrees exist for the [[Software Engineering]] program (the [[Bachelor of Software Engineering|BSE]], or Bachelor of Software Engineering) and Computing and Financial Management ([[Bachelor of Computing|BCFM]], or Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management). Postgraduate students are generally awarded an [[Master of Mathematics|MMath]] (Master of Mathematics) or [[PhD]].

In the 2018 [[QS World University Rankings]], the University of Waterloo was ranked 39th globally for Mathematics (and 3rd in Canada) and 31st globally for Computer Science (and 2nd in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/mathematics|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2018: Mathematics|website=[[QS World University Rankings]]|access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/computer-science-information-systems|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2018: Computer Science &amp; Informational Systems|website=[[QS World University Rankings]]|access-date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University was ranked third in Canada for Mathematics and second in Canada for Computer Science in 2018 by the [[Maclean's|Maclean's University Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best mathematics universities in Canada: 2018 rankings|date=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[Maclean's]]|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-mathematics-universities-in-canada-2018-rankings/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best computer science universities in Canada: 2018 ranking|date=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[Maclean's]]|url=https://www.macleans.ca/education/best-computer-science-universities-in-canada-2018-ranking/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
[[Image:UW-MathFaculty-PinkTie.jpg|230px|thumb|right|The Pink Tie]]
Students in the Faculty of Mathematics are represented by the Mathematics Society (MathSoc), which represents student interests to the university, operates the Math Coffee and Donut Shop, publishes the Faculty newspaper ''mathNEWS'', and runs student services including an exam bank and lounge space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MathSoc Services|url=http://mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca/Services|website=University of Waterloo Mathematics Society|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pi Day]] is celebrated by the Department in each term: on 14 March (3/14), on 22 July (22/7, [[Pi Approximation Day]]), and on 10 November (the 314th day of the year). Typical activities include throwing pie at MathSoc executives and/or popular professors, viewing mathematics-related films, competing in [[pi]] recitation contests, and eating pie (on 22/7, cake is served instead, which is approximately pie).

===Tie Guard===
A yearly tradition at the University of Waterloo, a group of senior math students volunteer for the position of Tie Guard each year, and are selected by the [[University of Waterloo Federation of Students]] representatives from the Faculty of Mathematics. It is expected that the appointed Tie Guard volunteers will be on hand 24 hours a day for the duration of the orientation week, to guard the Faculty's mascot (a 40 foot pink tie which hangs off the side of the building) and to provide [[first aid]] and information to incoming students.{{r|pinktie}}

The Tie Guard was founded in 1994 after several previous attempts on the Pink Tie resulted in both damaged mascots and injuries to students, the most notorious of which was the Tie Liberation Organization (TLO) kidnapping in 1988. In more recent years the tie guard has expanded and now several students are appointed to the Tie Guard each year. A new pink tie was draped over the Mathematics 3 Building in 2011.

[[File:Cartuja1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Valldemossa Charterhouse]] 
[[File:Cartuja kartäuserkloster2.JPG|thumb|Tower]]
The '''Valldemossa Charterhouse''' (Catalan: ''Cartoixa de Valldemossa'', Spanish: ''Cartuja de Valldemosa''), translatable as: Carthusian Monastery of Valldemossa) is a palace in [[Valldemossa]], [[Majorca]] that was residence of the king [[Sancho of Majorca]] former royal residence and Royal [[Charterhouse (monastery)|Charterhouse]] (15th century).

== History ==
The origin of the complex dates back to the time of King [[James II of Majorca]], who chose this exceptional place in the [[Sierra de Tramuntana]], located more than 400 meters high, to build a palace for his son Sancho, known as the "Palace of the King Sancho". In the year 1399 [[Martin of Aragon]] yielded all the royal possessions of Valldemossa to the [[Carthusian]] friars. These founded the Charterhouse and inhabited it until 1835, when it happened to private hands by the [[Spanish confiscation|Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal]].

The church, a neoclassical building decorated by great artists and craftsmen of the time, began to be built in 1751 on the primitive church erected in 1446. The complex has a cloister -one of the oldest parts of the current buildings-, the old pharmacy of the Carthusians, garden and the rooms of the Prioral Cell-chapel, former library, audience room, bedroom ...- where the historical and artistic legacy of the Carthusians is preserved, showing how the monks lived. In the cells there are the documents and memories of the stay of the musician [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the writer [[George Sand]] the winter of the years 1838-1839. In the cell 4 Chopin composed his '' [[Preludes (Chopin)|Preludes Op. 28]]'' and Sand wrote ''[[A Winter in Majorca]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10086">'''Weiser Antiquarian Books''' is the oldest occult bookstore in the United States. It specialises in books on Aleister Crowley and his circle, magic, mysticism, eastern religions and alternative spirituality. Its earlier New York incarnation, The Weiser Bookshop, was described by Leslie A. Shepherd as "perhaps the most famous occult bookstore in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Shepherd,  Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology, 2nd Printing, Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Company. Vol. 2, p. 978.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early years==
The original Samuel Weiser Bookstore was started in New York City's famous "[[Book Row]]" area by Samuel Weiser in 1926. It moved several times within the "Book Row" before relocating to 117 4th Avenue, where it remained for a number of decades.&lt;ref&gt;(Anon) International Directory For Antiquarian Booksellers 1958, Zurich: ILAB, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; To start with Samuel Weiser Books sold general used books, but with an emphasis on the occult and comparative religion. In 1949 Samuel Weiser was joined by his brother Ben who had worked with him for a few years in the 1930s.   Throughout the 1950s and 1960s they increased Weiser Books' specialist focus on the occult at a time when many bookstores refused to handle such subjects.

One of the customers of the shop was [[Karl Germer]], successor to [[Aleister Crowley]] as head of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]. After Crowley's death, most of his papers and other possessions were shipped to Germer including the unbound sheets of the 1937 edition of his book ''The Equinox of the Gods''. In 1955 Germer sold the sheets to Samuel Weiser who had them bound up in maroon cloth and sold through the shop. This was probably one of the first books to be published by Samuel Weiser – although it retained the original O.T.O. title page and imprint.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the printing history of the Germer / Weiser issue of ''The Equinox of the Gods'' are given in {{cite web | title = Weiser Antiquarian Books Catalog # 10. Aleister Crowley: Books, Ephemera &amp; A Drawing | url = http://www.weiserantiquarian.com/catalogten/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090105225650/http://www.weiserantiquarian.com/catalogten | archivedate = 5 January 2009 | publisher = Weiser Antiquarian Books | date = 17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germer also sold Weiser a collection of the First Edition of Crowley's masterwork on the tarot, ''The Book of Thoth''. Despite being leather bound, printed on handmade paper, and in an edition of only 200 copies signed by Crowley himself, interest in "the Beast" was low at the time and for nearly two decades copies could be purchased from the shop for $50 or less (as of 2009, they command thousands of dollars).

Rising rents and urban change forced many of the bookstores out of "Book Row." A number moved into the adjacent Broadway, with Weiser, whose stock had now grown to over a hundred thousand volumes, taking a premises at 845 Broadway. The new building had a huge basement, which the Weiser brothers crammed with books on all manner of subjects. After a heart attack forced Samuel Weiser into semi-retirement, Ben Weiser was joined by Samuel's son Donald.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Mondlin and Roy Meador, "Book Row, an Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade," Foreword by [[Madeleine B. Stern]]. Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, New York, 2004, pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1960s onwards ==
Samuel Weiser had begun publishing in the mid-1950s, and through the late 1950s produced a small number of books under the Occult Research Press imprint before starting to publish under his own name. The development of the 1960s "counter-culture," and the growth of popular interest in esotericism and Eastern religious and mystical traditions, allowed Ben and Donald Weiser to expand the company's publishing activities. They recruited many contemporary authors, such as Israel Regardie, who were customers.  The shop's stock also provided them with rare and out-of-print books that they could reprint.

The late 1960s saw the bookstore go through another move, this time into two floors at 734 Broadway, not far from Astor Place.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson (Editor). "The Encyclopedia of New York City," New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The move gave Donald Weiser, who now ran the business with the assistance of Fred Mendel, the chance to further increase their specialisation. In addition to used and rare books on the occult, Weiser Books, or "The Weiser Bookstore" as it was then known, also stocked new domestic and imported titles. The publishing side of the business was also expanded, and moved into its own premises at 625 Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Mondlin and Roy Meador, "Book Row, an Anecdotal and Pictorial History of the Antiquarian Book Trade," p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s the costs of maintaining a number of businesses in New York City had grown increasingly difficult to sustain, and Donald Weiser moved Samuel Weiser Publishing and the new book distribution wing of the company to York, Maine.

In 1985 he also moved the specialist rare books section of the company, now named Weiser Antiquarian Books, to York, where it shared a two storey warehouse with the publishing company's distribution centre. Much to the dismay of its many New York city customers, soaring city rents brought about the closure of the Broadway store in the early 1990s. Its huge stock of books was packed into shipping containers and moved to the new location in Maine, to be added to the stock of Weiser Antiquarian Books.

In the year 2000 Donald Weiser sold the publishing division of the company. Its new owners renamed it [[Red Wheel Weiser Conari|Red Wheel / Weiser]] but kept its York premises until 2006, when they moved the publishing company's editorial department to San Francisco and its marketing department to Newburyport, Massachusetts.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

In 2005 Donald Weiser retired, and Weiser Antiquarian Books was purchased by its then-director Marilyn Rinn, and Australian writer and bookseller, Keith Richmond. The following year they moved the company to its current premises in Cape Neddick Maine: a one-time art gallery for American artist Walt Kuhn, which had more recently been the headquarters of Samuel Weiser Publishing. In 2007 they also began publishing under the Teitan Press imprint which was founded by Martin P. Starr and Frank Winston.

==Catalogs==
For decades the Weiser Bookstore issued printed catalogs that listed anywhere between a few hundred and several thousand items, with basic descriptions of the book's author, title, condition and price. The advent of the internet brought an end to these printed catalogs, and for some years Weiser Antiquarian Books only listed its books on various internet book-sites and directly on to its own website.

In January 2006, Weiser Antiquarian Books began issuing a new series of on-line catalogs. Most of these catalogs are devoted to a specific author or theme. A large number have been devoted to the works of [[Aleister Crowley]] (in whom the store specialises), as well as authors including [[Dion Fortune]], [[Israel Regardie]], [[John Dee]] and [[Austin Osman Spare]]. In a number of cases – such as their catalogs on [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]] and [[Kenneth Grant]] – these are the first{{cn|date=December 2011}} bookseller catalogs devoted specifically to these authors. Other catalogs have been devoted to specific journals - notably ''[[The Occult Review]]'', ''The Inner Light'', and ''Ambix'', - and subjects such as [[alchemy]], [[spiritualism]], [[Hermetica]], [[Hermetic Qabalah]],  [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]], The [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and [[Rosicrucianism]]. Others have been devoted to books from specific collections: for example those of Helen Parsons Smith, Ray Burlingame, Edward Noel FitzGerald and Jean Michaud, or to collections of documents such as the [[Karl Germer]] / Reea Leffingwell correspondence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weiserantiquarian.com/catalogsevensupplement/ |title=Weiser Antiquarian Books - Supplement to Catalog # 7.

The catalogs contain bibliographical, historical and biographical information about the books offered for sale, and often detail previously unpublished manuscript and other material. They are often cited by researchers in on-line and printed publications.&lt;ref&gt;A number of Weiser Antiquarian listings have, for example, been adapted (with permission) by bibliographer Alan Pritchard for use in his online bibliography of Alchemy: {{cite web | url = http://www.alchemy-bibliography.co.uk/ | work = Alchemy: a bibliography of English-language writings | title = Using the Bibliography | first = Alan | last = Pritchard | date = 27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of customers and researchers, the older catalogs are now kept in an online archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weiser Antiquarian Books |url=http://weiserantiquarian.com/catalogarchivepage/ |title=Weiser Antiquarian Books - Catalogue Archive Page |publisher=Weiser Antiquarian Books |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Weiser Antiquarian Books is now primarily an internet retailer, and does not maintain an open shop, but is open to established customers by prior appointment.

'''Women's empowerment'' is the procedure in which women elaborate and recreate what is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Gender equality and women's empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1." ''Gender &amp; Development'' 13.1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosedale|first=Sarah|date=2005-03-01|title=Assessing women's empowerment: towards a conceptual framework|journal=Journal of International Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1002/jid.1212|issn=1099-1328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other  at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]]. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized [[gender]]s in a particular political or social context.

Women's [[economic empowerment]] refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the 
resources, [[asset]]s, [[income]] and their own time, as well as the ability to [[Risk management|manage risk]] and improve their economic status and well being.&lt;ref name="Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&gt;Oxfam (Forthcoming), "Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&lt;/ref&gt;

While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of [[gender empowerment]] refers to people of any gender, stressing the [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction]] between biological  and [[Gender role|gender as a role]]. It thereby also refers to other marginalized genders in a

== Importance of women's empowerment in societies ==
Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/40248/1/IDL-40248.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency|year=2009|editor2=Lila Shahani|publisher=Earthscan|location=Sterling, VA|editor1=Deneulin, Séverine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Kamla|last2=Yesudian|first2=P. Princy|date=2006|title=Evidence of women's empowerment in India: a study of socio-spatial disparities|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=65|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/s10708-006-7556-z|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]].

== Methods ==
Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic empowerment ===
Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051–1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped nations are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Geleta, Esayas Bekele. "Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective." ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461–76|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way it is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit doesn't relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they don't have the time to be as active in the market as men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political empowerment ===
Political empowerment supports creating policies that would best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Popular methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; As of 2017, the global average of women whom hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further recommendations have been to increase women's rights to [[vote]], voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labour market and running their business. Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must to be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1–33|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and assessment ==
Women empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), which shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. GEM is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence".&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt;

Some critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. "Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure." ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197–203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Barriers ==

Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms. Many women feel these pressures, while others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198289647|editor1=Martha C. Nussbaum|location=Oxford|pages=1–15|chapter=Introduction|editor2=Jonathan Glover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if [[legislators]], [[NGOs]], etc. are aware of the benefits women's empowerment and participation can have, many are scared of disrupting the status of the women and continue to let [[societal norms]] get in the way of development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the increasing access to the internet can also result in an increased exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000" /&gt; Releasing personal information on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such sites. Types of victimization include [[cyber stalking]], harassment, [[online pornography]], and [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morahan-Martin, J.|year=2000|title=Women and the Internet: Promise and Perils|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=683–691|doi=10.1089/10949310050191683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] in particular is a large barrier for women in the workplace. It appears in almost all industries, but is most notable in the following: business, trade, banking and finance, sales and marketing, hospitality, civil service, and education, lecturing and teaching.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/|title=Statistics|date=22 April 2010|work=AWARE RSS|publisher=AWARE|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), sexual harassment is a clear form of gender discrimination based on sex, a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women. Furthermore, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is urging for increased measures of protection for women against sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. 54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment. 79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

Recent studies also show that women face more barriers in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stein, A.I.|year=2009|title=Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=yjlf|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Feminism|volume=20|issue=2|pages=357–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the median earnings of men and women who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the "[[Gender pay gap|wage gap]]" has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, but some experts say that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/careers/motherhood-penalty-can-affect-women-who-never-even-have-child-n548511|title='Motherhood Penalty' Can Affect Women Who Never Even Have a Child|author=Safia Samee Ali|date=April 11, 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.

However, despite the struggle for equal pay in the United States, the tech industry{{clarify|date=June 2017}} has made progress in helping to encourage equal pay across gender. In March 2016, tech career website Dice released a study of more than 16,000 tech professionals that found that when you compare equivalent education, experience and position, there is no pay gap—and hasn't been for the last six years.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; This new industry is paving a way for other companies to do the same. However, this industry also struggles to employ women in executive positions. This is partially due to the barrier of sexual harassment and pregnancy that was aforementioned.

Such barriers make it difficult for women to advance in their workplace or receive fair compensation for the work they provide.

== Role of education ==
It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marniemi|first=J.|last2=Parkki|first2=M. G.|date=1975-09-01|title=Radiochemical assay of glutathione S-epoxide transferase and its enhancement by phenobarbital in rat liver in vivo|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=17|pages=1569–1572|issn=0006-2952|pmid=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNDP. 2013. Human Development Report. The Rise of the South. Human Progress in a Diverse World; New York, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013/2014: Teaching and Learning, Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002343/234325E.pdf|title=Mobile phones and literacy: Empowerment in Women's Hands; A Cross-Case Analysis of Nine Experiences|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100123-9|location=33|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite significant improvements in recent decades, education is not universally available and gender inequalities persist. A major concern in many countries is not only the limited numbers of girls going to school but also the limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom. More specifically, there should be more efforts to address the lower participation and learning achievement of [[Female education in STEM|girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Internet as a tool of empowerment ==

The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]], women have begun to use social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] for [[online activism]].&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, J.|author2=Pollock, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Online Activism for Women's Rights|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=699–706|doi=10.1089/10949310050191700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Churchyard, N.|year=2009|title=The Question of Empowerment: Women's Perspective on Their Internet Use|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=341–363|doi=10.1177/097185241001300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 29, 2013, an online campaign started by 100 female advocates forced the leading social networking website, Facebook, to take down various pages that spread hatred about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McVeigh, T.|date=June 6, 2013|title=Online Feminist activists of the digital age|work=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/06/06/2003564076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[blogging]] has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephan, P.|date=August 13, 2013|title=Breast cancer patients blog their blues away|url=http://breastcancer.about.com/b/2013/08/13/blog-the-blues-away.htm|journal=Breastcancer.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"/&gt;

With the easy accessibility and affordability of [[e-learning]] (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Radovic-Markovic, M.|author2=Nelson-Porter, B.|author3=Omolaja, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The new alternative women's entrepreneurship education: E-learning and virtual universities|journal=International Women Online Journal of Distance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=46–54|url=http://wojde.org/FileUpload/bs295854/File/06a.markovic.pdf|issn=2147-0367}}&lt;/ref&gt; By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.

Often times, the internet is very useful as source of empowerment for women through its creation, dispersion, and utilization of hashtags on social media. One prime example of hashtags supporting women empowerment was in 2017 when the #AintNoCinderella hashtag came into existence. This hashtag spread like wildfire on social media after Varnika Kundu (a 29-year-old woman in India) was driving home past midnight on August 4 when she was followed and harassed by two men in a SUV{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Kundu was blamed for being out late at night, particularly by the BJP government Vice-President Ramveer Bhatti. This lead to women all across India and the world posting pictures of themselves out late at night with the hashtag "#AintNoCinderella" to show that women do not have a particular curfew to which they have to adhere to (like Cinderella did). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ain-t-no-cinderella-women-hit-out-bjp-leader-blaming-chandigarh-stalking-victim-66456|title=Ain’t no Cinderella: Women hit out at BJP leader for blaming Chandigarh stalking victim|date=2017-08-08|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing projects ==
The UN came out with a set of goals called the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, to help make the world a better place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17, the fourth goal works to allow access to education for all people alike. A large effort has been made to include women in schools to better their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/|title=Education - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fifth goal focuses on empowering women and girls to achieve gender equality through equal access to various types of opportunities (health care, education, work, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some prominent non-profits that help empower women:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thepowerofpurpose.com/10-amazing-nonprofits-empowering-women-2017/|title=10 Amazing Nonprofits Empowering Women in 2017 - The Power of Purpose|date=2017-01-26|work=The Power of Purpose|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. involvement ===

Domestically, the U.S. empowered women through passings of laws such as allowing women to vote in 1920, banning discrimination based on gender in 1964, banning discrimination against pregnant women in 1978, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of women in politics allowed for more gender equality. The first female speaker of House, the first First Lady to run for president, and first women to serve on the Supreme Court were monumental events that proved socially the acceptance of "subservient" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/detailed-timeline/|title=Detailed Timeline {{!}} National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. provides foreign aid to third world countries in various forms, one of which is by providing education programs. There are currently bills in Congress that work to ensure education to girls, one of which is the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act. These are enacted with the belief that proper education will pull them out of poverty and reduce exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2408|title=H.R.2408 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act|last=Steve|first=Chabot|date=2017-10-04|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another action taken on by the U.S is the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] program, initiated by the Bush administration in 2003. The U.S. spent more than $1.4 billion in funding sub-Saharan Africa during the duration of the program. This program was taken into effect in response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, and it promoted abstinence among young girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=June 15, 2007|title=Bush Boosts AIDS Relief: Cause for Applause and Pause|jstor=20036459|journal=Science|volume=316|issue=5831|pages=1552|pmid=17569832|doi=10.1126/science.316.5831.1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a partnership with DREAMS, and its main purpose with PEPFAR was to allow both girls and women to develop into Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pepfar.gov/partnerships/ppp/dreams/|title=Working Together for an AIDS-Free Future for Girls and Women|website=www.pepfar.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are criticisms that this program did not really do much to reduce HIV risk behavior, and critics such as John Dietrich worried that the context of aid enforced Western beliefs of choosing abstinence before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran, et al.|date=May 2016|title=Abstinence Funding Was Not Associated With Reductions In HIV Risk Behavior In Sub-Saharan Africa|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/03/476601108/u-s-spent-1-4-billion-to-stop-hiv-by-promoting-abstinence-did-it-work|title=U.S. Spent $1.4 Billion To Stop HIV By Promoting Abstinence.

'''''Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible''''' is a [[Bible concordance|concordance]] to the [[Bible]] compiled by [[Robert Young (biblical scholar)|Robert Young]] first published in 1879.

==Contents==
* ''Hints and Helps to Bible Interpretation'' (only in some later editions)
* ''Analytical Concordance'' - Each entry can contain the multiple original language words in the original language and in a phonetic vocalization into English. It also gives the extended meaning and usage of the word in the original language. This is a "[[Bible concordance]]" to the [[King James Version|King James Version (KJV)]] and not a [[lexicon]] of the [[Biblical Hebrew|OT Hebrew]] or [[Koine|NT Greek]] languages.
* ''Index lexicons to the Old and New Testaments, being a guide to parallel passages'' prepared by Wm. B. Stevenson.
* The British eighth edition also includes ''A complete list of Scripture Proper Names as in the Authorised and Revised Versions, showing their modern pronunciation and the exact form of the original Hebrew'' by the same author. This appendix also has an informative introduction.

==Editions==
British editions and American editions are numbered differently.

===British editions===

* First published 1879, followed by editions 2&amp;ndash;6.
* Seventh edition published 1900, revised throughout by the Glasgow [[Professor of Hebrew and Semitic Languages]], [[William Barron Stevenson]] (1869-1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1426&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of William Barron Stevenson|website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was originally published separately some time before its second edition which appeared in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Recent-Explorations-Bible-Lands-Thomas/dp/B002IBADT2/|title=Recent Explorations in Bible Lands / by Thomas Nicol|last=Nicol|first=Thomas|date=1893|publisher=Edinburgh : George Adam Young|edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
