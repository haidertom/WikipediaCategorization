'''Antitranspirants''' are compounds applied to the [[leaves]] of [[plant]]s to reduce [[transpiration]].  They are used from [[Christmas tree]]s, on cut [[flowers]], on newly transplanted [[shrub]]s, and in other applications to preserve and protect plants from drying out too quickly.  They have also been used to protect leaves from [[salt burn]] and [[fungal disease]]s {{citation needed|date=June 2007}}.

They block the active excretion of hydrogen cation from the guard cells. Due to presence of carbon dioxide, a rapid acidification of cytoplasm takes place leading to stomatal closure. Milbarrow(1974) has described the formation of these chemicals in the chloroplast. It moves to the stomata, where it is responsible for checking the intake of Potassium ion or induces loss of potassium ion from the guard cells.

Antitranspirants are of two types: metabolic inhibitors and film-forming antitranspirants.

Metabolic inhibitors reduce the [[stomata]]l opening and increase the leaf resistance to water vapour diffusion without affecting [[carbon dioxide]] uptake. Examples include [[phenylmercury acetate]], [[abscisic acid]] (ABA), and [[aspirin]].

Film-forming antitranspirants form a colorless film on the leaf surface that allows diffusion of gases but not of water vapour. Examples include [[silicon oil]], [[wax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agriinfo.in/?page=topic&amp;superid=1&amp;topicid=447 Antitranspirants, Agriculture Information Bank]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Environmental Professionals''' (AEP) is a California-based [[non-profit]] organization of [[interdisciplinary]] professionals including [[environmental science]], [[resource management]], [[environmental planning]] and other professions contributing to this field.  AEP is the first organization of its kind in the USA, and its influence and model have spawned numerous other regional organizations throughout the United States, as well as the separate [[National Association of Environmental Professionals]] (NAEP).  Its mission is to improve the technical skills of members, and the organization is dedicated to "the enhancement, maintenance and protection of the natural and human environment".  From inception in the mid-1970s the organization has been closely linked with the upkeep of the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA), California being one of the first states to adopt a comprehensive law to govern the environmental review of public policy and project review.

==History, organization and governance==

AEP was incorporated in the State of California in 1975 and held its first organization wide meeting of members in [[Palo Alto]], California on the [[Stanford University]] campus.  At that meeting the first directors and officers were elected and [[by-laws]] adopted.  From then on the board of directors has met quarterly to establish governance, coordinate legislative liassion and plan annual meeting.  The board represents eight geographical regions and also has three at large members.

==Publications and member activities==

AEP publishes a quarterly magazine, the [[Environmental Monitor]], which contains technical articles, [[legislative]] updates and other information useful to its members.  As mentioned above the organization has developed a skilled legislative [[advocacy]] program, which is remarkable in its pursuit of clarity of language, efficient functioning of environmental review and ethical goals for its profession.  AEP also provides annual recognition awards for excellence in various categories, provides members with information on career development and works to achieve standards for performance in the environmental disciplines.

The Environmental Monitor magazine is recognized throughout the interdisciplinary professions as a leading source of state of the art coverage.  Articles may include topics of [[air quality]], [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] conservation, [[water quality]], [[archaeology]], [[urban planning]], [[acoustics]] and other technical matters; however coverage is also given to legislation, AEP activities and professional career development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4272">In [[machine learning]], '''Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS)''', Bayesian Programs write (synthesize) new Bayesian programs.  This is in contrast to the field of [[Probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programs]] where humans write new probabilistic (Bayesian) programs.

[[Bayesian probability|Bayesian probabilities]] is a strategy to learn distributions over Bayesian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603542/ai-software-juggles-probabilities-to-learn-from-less-data/|title=AI Software Juggles Probabilities to Learn from Less Data|last=Knight|first=Will|date=|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-03-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian Program Synthesis can be compared to the work on Bayesian Program Learning by Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum's,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where probabilistic program components were hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lake|first=Brenden M.|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|last3=Tenenbaum|first3=Joshua B.|date=2015-12-11|title=Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6266/1332|journal=Science|language=en|volume=350|issue=6266|pages=1332–1338|doi=10.1126/science.aab3050|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26659050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The framework ==
Bayesian Program Synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2017/0216/Startup-pairs-man-with-machine-to-crack-the-black-box-of-neural-networks|title=Startup pairs man with machine to crack the 'black box' of neural networks|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=2017-02-16|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-03-04|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This strategy allows more automatic synthesis of new programs via inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. 

The modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robohub.org/talking-machines-probabilistic-programming-with-ben-vigoda/|title=Talking Machines: Probabilistic programming, with Ben Vigoda {{!}} Robohub|website=robohub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayesian methods and models are frequently used to incorporate prior knowledge. When good prior knowledge can be incorporated into a Bayesian model, effective inference can often be performed with much less data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ais-factions-get-feisty-really-theyre-team/|title=AI’s Factions Get Feisty. But Really, They’re All on the Same Team|last=Metz|first=Cade|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-03-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This framework can be also be contrasted with the family of automated [[program synthesis]] fields, including program synthesis, [[programming by example]], and [[programming by demonstration]]. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian Program Synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2435">'''Bioculture''' is the combination of biological and cultural factors that affect human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://bioculture.au.dk/research/biocultural-theory/&lt;/ref&gt; Bioculture is an area of study bounded by the [[medical sciences]], [[social sciences]], [[landscape ecology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[biotechnology]], disability studies, the [[humanities]], and the [[economy|economic]] and global environment. Along these lines, one can see the biosphere — the [[earth]] as it is affected by the [[human]] — as the adaptation of the natural to the human and biocultures as the inter-adaptation of the human to the new technologies and ways of knowing characterized by the 21st century’s attitude toward the [[Human body|body]]. It assumes that in bioculture there's a diverse way to know the workings of the body and mind, and that these are primarily culturally derived, and an expert's way of knowing produces specific strong results. However the results do not have an exclusive purview over the body and [[mind]]. Plus it seeks to develop and encourage not only the experts but also parts of people's bodies and minds as the subject of study.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd B, "Getting it all wrong - Bioculture critiques cultural critique" American Scholar  75 (4): 18-30 Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melby MK, Smith EO "PMS: A bioculture-bound syndrome."

An alternative definition of the term bioculture is all the practical aspects of the use of [[living things in culture]], including agriculture, production of food and clothing, forestry, animal breeding and training, the pet trade, use of living things in science, zoos and aquariums, animal sports, and the raising of game for sport hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Paul W. |title=Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics |edition=25th Anniversary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TdcnC98eRwC&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1-4008-3853-3 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], a '''blacklist''' or '''block list''' is a basic [[access control]] mechanism that allows through all elements (email addresses, users, passwords, [[URLs]], [[IP address]]es, [[domain name]]s, file [[MD5 Hash|hashes]], etc.), except those explicitly mentioned. Those items on the list are denied access. The opposite is a [[whitelist]], which means only items on the list are let through whatever gate is being used. A [[Greylisting|greylist]] contains items that are temporarily blocked (or temporarily allowed) until an additional step is performed.

Blacklists can be applied at various points in a security architecture, such as a [[Host (network)|host]], [[web proxy]], [[DNS]] servers, [[email]] server, [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], [[directory server]]s or application authentication gateways. The type of element blocked is influenced by the access control location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Information Security: A Strategic-Based Approach|url = https://booksì.google.com/books?id=eZBqAAAAQBAJ|publisher = Newnes|date = 2013-11-12|isbn = 9781597499729|language = en|first = Timothy|last = Shimeall|first2 = Jonathan|last2 = Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNS servers may be well-suited to block domain names, for example, but not URLs. A firewall is well-suited for blocking IP addresses, but less so for blocking malicious files or passwords.

Example uses include a company that might prevent a list of software from running on its network, a school that might prevent access to a list of web sites from its computers, or a business that wants to ensure their computer users are not choosing easily guessed, poor passwords.

==Example systems to protect==
Blacklists are used to protect a variety of systems in computing. The content of the blacklist is likely needs to be targeted to the type of system defended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Domain Blacklist Ecosystem - A Case Study|url = https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2015/06/domain-blacklist-ecosystem---a-case-study.html|website = insights.sei.cmu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information systems===

An information system includes end-point hosts like user machines and servers. A blacklist in this location may include certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer to peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices and Web sites can also be blacklisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainer | first=Watson|title=Introduction to Information Systems|year=2012|publisher=Wiley Custom Learning Solutions|isbn=978-1-118-45213-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Email===

Most email providers have a [[Email spam|anti-spam]] feature that essentially blacklists certain [[email address]]es if they are deemed unwanted. How this happens is when a successful [[phishing]] attack (from an address that is forged from reliable accounts to try to recover personal information) is executed, then the email device deems the address to be spam, and proceeds to blacklist the address.

An [[e-mail spam]] [[mail filter|filter]] may keep a blacklist of email addresses, any mail from which would be prevented from reaching its intended destination. It may also use sending domain names or sending IP addresses to implement a more general block.

In addition to private email blacklists, there are lists that are kept for public use, examples are

* China Anti-Spam Alliance &lt;ref&gt;http://anti-spam.org.cn/?locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fabel Spamsources &lt;ref&gt;https://mxtoolbox.com/problem/blacklist/fabelsources&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spam and Open Relay Blocking System]]
* The DrMX Project

===Web browsing===
The goal of a blacklist in a web browser is to prevent the user from visiting a malicious or deceitful web page via filtering locally. A common web browsing blacklist is Google's [[Google Safe Browsing|Safe Browsing]], which is installed by default in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

===Usernames and passwords===
Blacklisting can also apply to user credentials. It is common for systems or websites to blacklist certain reserved usernames that are not allowed to be chosen by the system or website's user populations.  These reserved usernames are commonly associated with built-in system administration functions.

Password blacklists are very similar to username blacklists but typically contain significantly more entries than username blacklists. Password blacklists are applied to prevent users from choosing passwords that are easily guessed or are well known and could lead to unauthorized access by malicious parties. Password blacklists are deployed as an additional layer of security, usually in addition to a password policy, which sets the requirements of the password length and/or character complexity.  This is because there are a significant number of password combinations that fulfill many password policies but are still easily guessed (i.e., Password123, Qwerty123).

==Distribution methods==
Blacklists are distributed in a variety of ways. Some use simple [[mailing list]]s. A [[DNSBL]] is a common distribution method that leverages the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] itself. Some lists make use of [[rsync]] for high-volume exchanges of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guidelines|url = http://www.surbl.org/guidelines|website = www.surbl.org|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web-server functions may be used; either simple [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|GET]] requests may be used or more complicated interfaces such as a [[RESTful API Modeling Language|RESTful]] API.

==Examples==
* For a list of some DNS-based blacklists, see the [[Comparison of DNS blacklists]].
* Companies like [[Google]], [[Symantec]] and [[Sucuri]] keep internal blacklists of sites known to have malware and they display a warning before allowing the user to click them.
* [[Content-control software]] such as [[DansGuardian]] and [[SquidGuard]] may work with a blacklist in order to block [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] of sites deemed inappropriate for a work or educational environment. Such blacklists can be obtained free of charge or from commercial vendors such as [[Squidblacklist.org]].
* A [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] or [[Intrusion detection system|IDS]] may also use a blacklist to block known hostile IP addresses and/or networks. An example for such a list would be the [[OpenBL]] project.
* Many [[copy protection]] schemes include [[software blacklist]]ing.
* The company [https://www.passwordrbl.com Password RBL] offers a password blacklist for Microsoft's [[Active Directory]], web sites and apps, distributed via a [[RESTful API Modeling Language|RESTful]] API.
* Members of [[online auction]] sites may add other members to a personal blacklist. This means that they cannot bid on or ask questions about your auctions, nor can they use a "buy it now" function on your items.
* Yet another form of list is the yellow list which is a list of email server IP addresses that send mostly good email but do send some spam. Examples include [[Yahoo]], [[Hotmail]], and [[Gmail]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} A yellow listed server is a server that should never be accidentally blacklisted. The yellow list is checked first and if listed then blacklist tests are ignored.
* In [[Linux]] [[modprobe]], the &lt;code&gt;blacklist modulename&lt;/code&gt; entry in a modprobe configuration file indicates that all of the particular [[loadable kernel module|module]]'s internal aliases are to be ignored. There are cases where two or more modules both support the same devices, or a module invalidly claims to support a device.
* Many web browsers have the ability to consult anti-[[phishing]] blacklists in order to warn users who unwittingly aim to visit a [[Internet fraud|fraudulent website]].
* Many [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] programs support blacklists that block access from sites known to be owned by companies enforcing copyright.  An example is the Bluetack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php?autocom=faq&amp;CODE=02&amp;qid=18 |title= B.I.S.S. Forums - FAQ - Questions about the Blocklists |work=Bluetack Internet Security Solutions |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020052855/http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php?autocom=faq&amp;CODE=02&amp;qid=18 |archivedate=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2015-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; blocklist set.

==Considerations of usage==
As expressed in a recent conference paper focusing on blacklists of domain names and IP addresses used for Internet security, "these lists generally do not intersect. Therefore, it appears that these lists do not converge on one set of malicious indicators."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Blacklist Ecosystem Analysis: Spanning Jan 2012 to Jun 2014|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2808129|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 2nd ACM Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security|date = 2015-01-01|pages = 13–22|first = Leigh|last = Metcalf|first2 = Jonathan M.|last2 = Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Paint It Black: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Malware Blacklists|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11379-1_1|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2014-09-17|isbn = 9783319113784|pages = 1–21|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-11379-1_1|language = en|first = Marc|last = Kührer|first2 = Christian|last2 = Rossow|first3 = Thorsten|last3 = Holz|editor-first = Angelos|editor-last = Stavrou|editor-first2 = Herbert|editor-last2 = Bos|editor-first3 = Georgios|editor-last3 = Portokalidis}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern combined with an economic model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modeling malicious domain name take-down dynamics: Why eCrime pays|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6805779|publisher = IEEE|journal = eCrime Researchers Summit (eCRS), 2013|date = 2013-01-01|pages = 1–9|first = Jonathan M.|last = Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that, while blacklists are an essential part of network defense, they need to be used in concert with whitelists and greylists.

An example would be the Adblock Plus blocklist that includes a number of features including whitelists within the blacklist by adding a prefix of two at symbols and two pipe symbols e.g. "@@||www.blocksite.com".

'''Bouldnor Cliff''' is a submerged prehistoric settlement site in the [[Solent]]. The site dates from the [[Mesolithic]] era and is in approximately {{convert|11|m|yd|0}} of water just offshore of the village of [[Bouldnor]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] in the United Kingdom. The preservation of organic materials from this era that do not normally survive on dry land has made Bouldnor important to the understanding of Mesolithic Britain, and the BBC Radio 4's Making History programme described it "probably Europe's most important Mesolithic site" albeit concealed under water.

The site was first discovered by divers from the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology (now the [[Maritime Archaeology Trust]]) in 1999, when a lobster was observed discarding worked flint tools from its burrow on the seabed.&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Archaeology, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several years of fieldwork have revealed that Bouldnor was a settlement site about 8,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, at a time when lower sea levels meant that the Solent was just a river valley. The work done so far has already revealed that the technology of Mesolithic settlers was probably 2,000&amp;nbsp;years ahead of what had previously been believed.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{Citation | title = Diving into the Past| newspaper =Isle of Wight County Press | pages =14 | date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site formation==
Investigations suggest that during the [[Mesolithic]] era, between 8000 and 4000&amp;nbsp;BC, the western Solent was a sheltered river basin, rich in woodland and fed by a river at [[Lymington]] and drained by the [[Western Yar]] at [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]].&lt;ref name =M10&gt;Momber, Tomalin, Scaife, Satchell &amp; Gillespie, preface p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; As sea levels rose, the Solent eventually flooded and the settlement area was swamped. The rising waters deposited silt and mud onto the original land surface, covering and preserving it.&lt;ref name= BBCAtlantis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6928293.stm|title=Fight on to save Stone Age Atlantis|publisher=BBC| date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Fishermen had reported recovering stone tools from the seabed of the Solent since the 1960s, but it was not until 1987 that the submerged remains of an ancient forest were discovered at Bouldnor. Later radiocarbon dating of pollen revealed this to be approximately 8,000&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref name=BA32&gt;British Archaeology, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, regular dives revealed a submerged cliff east of [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]] with large quantities of peat that dated to a similar period.&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt;

The [[Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology]] began mapping the cliff face and selected four main sites of interest (named BC 1–4). It was while diving in {{convert|11|m|yd|0}} of water on BC 2 in 1999, that divers noticed a burrowing lobster discarding [[stone tool|worked flints]] from its burrow. The lobster had burrowed through thick mud deposits that had formed since the Solent flooded, and into the original surface of the cliff when the Solent was dry.&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt;

Since 1999, divers have excavated at Bouldnor every year. Further discoveries were made at BC 2 and BC 4, and a later a new site was discovered nearby (BC 5).&lt;ref name=BA33&gt;British Archaeology, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The dangerous diving conditions in the fast flowing waters of the Solent make archaeological investigation particularly difficult and archaeologists have used several new techniques to make analysis of the sea bed easier. This has included 'box sampling' – collecting large areas of sea bed in metal tins to raise them to the surface and more thoroughly excavate their contents on dry land.&lt;ref name=CP/&gt;

==Findings==
Archaeologists have discovered large quantities of burnt flints, mounds of timbers and pits dug into the ground. Wood from this era does not normally preserve well in land environments, so the quantity of wood found at Bouldnor makes the site of international importance.&lt;ref name=BA34&gt;British Archaeology, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a large mound of worked timbers at BC 5, archaeologists discovered large areas of burnt clay, burnt flint and charcoal, which has been interpreted as the floor of a living space.&lt;ref name=BA34/&gt; Other timbers show signs of having been extensively worked on. Some split oak suggests that particularly large structures, or possibly boats, were being constructed at the site.&lt;ref name=BA34/&gt; Another timber shows signs of having been fashioned as a type of [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|conduit]], which is not something that has ever been seen in Mesolithic archaeology before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Making History | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010xzzp | credits =  | network = BBC | station = Radio 4 | location = Southampton| airdate = 10 May 2011 | time = 3pm – 3.30pm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the worked timbers indicate technological skills that had previously only been associated with the Neolithic era, 2000&amp;nbsp;years later than Bouldnor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/bouldnor |title=Bouldnor Cliff|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnt hazelnuts and oak charcoal have also been found at BC 5.&lt;ref name=BA33/&gt; Like the wood, these types of organic material do not normally survive well in dry, land based, environments.&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis/&gt; A pit dug into the clay at BC 5 had been filled with burnt clay nodules, charcoal and burnt stones, which had been covered with a large piece of wood. Examining the pit walls revealed that the pit had probably been filled with hot stones on several occasions.&lt;ref name=BA34/&gt; Other [[trench]]es have revealed chipped wood flakes, flint knapping flakes and even wound fibres that appear to have been used as string.&lt;ref&gt;Momber, Tomalin, Scaife, Satchell &amp; Gillespie, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the finds suggest evidence of small scale industry as well as settlement.&lt;ref name=M10/&gt;

The work done at Bouldnor is exhibited in the Maritime Archaeology Trust's [[Sunken Secrets]] exhibition at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunkensecrets.hwtma.org.uk/currentexhibitions|title=Sunken Secrets – Current Exhibitions|accessdate=7 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427105202/http://sunkensecrets.hwtma.org.uk/currentexhibitions#|archive-date=27 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International trade===
Research published in 2015 has identified wheat DNA at the site. As this wheat is of a type not native to Britain, it suggests the possibility of trade with Europe much earlier than had previously been supposed by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Balter 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balter|first1=Michael|title=DNA recovered from underwater British site may rewrite history of farming in Europe.|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/archaeology/2015/02/dna-recovered-underwater-british-site-may-rewrite-history-farming-europe?intcmp=highwire|publisher=Science|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was questioned and it was suggested that the wheat DNA was too pristine and probably represents contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ancient DNA dispute raises questions about wheat trade in prehistoric Britain|url = http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-dna-dispute-raises-questions-about-wheat-trade-in-prehistoric-britain-1.18702|website = Nature News &amp; Comment|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Contesting the presence of wheat in the British Isles 8,000 years ago by assessing ancient DNA authenticity from low-coverage data|url = http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e10005|journal = eLife|date = 2015-11-03|issn = 2050-084X|pmc = 4629168|pmid = 26525598|pages = e10005|volume = 4|doi = 10.7554/eLife.10005|first = Clemens L.|last = Weiß|first2 = Michael|last2 = Dannemann|first3 = Kay|last3 = Prüfer|first4 = Hernán A.|last4 = Burbano}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original authors published a response to this contested point.&lt;ref name="Kistler 2015"&gt;{{Cite biorxiv |title = Thermal age, cytosine deamination and the veracity of 8,000 year old wheat DNA from sediments|biorxiv = 032060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Probing the Nanoscale''' (CPN) at [[Stanford University]] was founded in 2004 by researchers from Stanford University and [[IBM]]. The center is one of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSEC). The goal of the center is to develop and apply novel nanoprobes that dramatically improve our capability to observe, manipulate, and control [[nanoscale]] objects and phenomena. Developed technology will be transferred to industry for commercial implementation. Nanoprobe development and applications are under way in five theme groups, focusing on Individual Nanomagnet Characterization, Nanoscale Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nanoscale Electrical Imaging, Plasmonic Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and BioProbes.

Besides the scientific research activities, CPN members actively engage in public outreach programs to bring nanoscale science and technology to a broad and diverse audience. A Summer Institute for Middle School Teachers is held each summer and gives teachers the opportunity to learn about nanotechnology, engage with scientists, develop course material and get hands-on experience in research labs. Nanoprobe lectures and video recordings from various workshops are also available on-line.

'''Computer-assisted language learning (CALL), British, or Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI)/Computer-Aided Language Instruction (CALI), American'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John|date=1983|title=Computer assisted language learning|url=|journal=Language Teaching|volume=16(2)|pages=102-114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''',''' is briefly defined in a seminal work by Levy (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;1) as "the search for and study of applications of the computer in language teaching and learning".&lt;ref name=levy1997&gt;Levy M. (1997) ''CALL: context and conceptualisation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; CALL embraces a wide range of [[information and communications technology]] applications and approaches to teaching and learning foreign languages, from the "traditional" drill-and-practice programs that characterised CALL in the 1960s and 1970s to more recent manifestations of CALL, e.g. as used in a [[virtual learning environment]] and Web-based [[distance learning]]. It also extends to the use of [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards,&lt;ref name=schmidcutrim2009&gt;Schmid Euline Cutrim (2009) ''Interactive whiteboard technology in the language classroom: exploring new pedagogical opportunities'', Saarbrücken, Germany: VDM Verlag Dr. Müller.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-mediated communication (CMC),&lt;ref name=lamyhampel&gt;Lamy M.-N. &amp; Hampel R. (2007) ''Online communication in language learning and teaching'', Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Virtual worlds|language learning in virtual worlds]], and [[Mobile Assisted Language Learning|mobile-assisted language learning (MALL)]].&lt;ref name=shieldkukulska&gt;Shield L. &amp; Kukulska-Hulme A. (eds.) (2008) Special edition of ''ReCALL'' (20, 3) on ''Mobile Assisted Language Learning''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CALI (computer-assisted language instruction) was in use before CALL, reflecting its origins as a subset of the general term CAI (computer-assisted instruction). CALI fell out of favour among language teachers, however, as it appeared to imply a teacher-centred approach (instructional), whereas language teachers are more inclined to prefer a student-centred approach, focusing on learning rather than instruction. CALL began to replace CALI in the early 1980s (Davies &amp; Higgins 1982: p.&amp;nbsp;3)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1982) ''Computers, language and language learning'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now incorporated into the names of the growing number of [[#Professional associations|professional associations]] worldwide.

An alternative term, technology-enhanced language learning (TELL),&lt;ref&gt;Bush M. &amp; Terry R. (1997) (eds.) ''Technology-enhanced language learning'', Lincolnwood, Illinois: National Textbook Company.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged around the early 1990s: e.g. the TELL Consortium project, University of Hull.

The current philosophy of CALL puts a strong emphasis on student-centred materials that allow learners to work on their own. Such materials may be structured or unstructured, but they normally embody two important features: interactive learning and individualised learning. CALL is essentially a tool that helps teachers to facilitate the language learning process. It can be used to reinforce what has already been learned in the classroom or as a remedial tool to help learners who require additional support.

The design of CALL materials generally takes into consideration principles of language pedagogy and methodology, which may be derived from different learning theories (e.g. behaviourist, cognitive, constructivist) and second-language learning theories such as Stephen Krashen's [[monitor hypothesis]].

A combination of face-to-face teaching and CALL is usually referred to as [[blended learning]]. Blended learning is designed to increase learning potential and is more commonly found than pure CALL (Pegrum 2009: p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref&gt;Pegrum M. (2009) ''From blogs to bombs: The future of digital technologies in education'', Perth: University of Western Australia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

See Davies ''et al.'' (2011: Section 1.1, ''What is CALL?'').&lt;ref name=davieswalkeretal&gt;Davies G., Walker R., Rendall H. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Module 1.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; See also Levy &amp; Hubbard (2005), who raise the question ''Why call CALL "CALL"?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = M. | last2 = Hubbard | first2 = P. | year = 2005 | title = Why call CALL "CALL"? | url = | journal = Computer Assisted Language Learning | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 143–149 | doi=10.1080/09588220500208884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CALL dates back to the 1960s, when it was first introduced on university mainframe computers. The PLATO project, initiated at the University of Illinois in 1960, is an important landmark in the early development of CALL (Marty 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marty | first1 = F | year = 1981 | title = Reflections on the use of computers in second language acquisition | url = | journal = System | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 85–98 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(81)90023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the microcomputer in the late 1970s brought computing within the range of a wider audience, resulting in a boom in the development of CALL programs and a flurry of publications of books on CALL in the early 1980s.

Dozens of CALL programs are currently available on the internet, at prices ranging from free to expensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=12 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other programs are available only through university language courses.

There have been several attempts to document the history of CALL. Sanders (1995) covers the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, focusing on CALL in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders R. (ed.) (1995) ''Thirty years of computer-assisted language instruction'', Festschrift for John R. Russell, ''CALICO Journal'' Special Issue, 12, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Delcloque (2000) documents the history of CALL worldwide, from its beginnings in the 1960s to the dawning of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Delcloque P. (2000) ''History of CALL'' [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/History_of_CALL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2005) takes a look back at CALL's past and attempts to predict where it is going.&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2005) ''Computer Assisted Language Learning: Where are we now and where are we going?'' [ Online]: http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/docs/UCALL_Keynote.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard (2009) offers a compilation of 74 key articles and book excerpts, originally published in the years 1988-2007, that give a comprehensive overview of the wide range of leading ideas and research results that have exerted an influence on the development of CALL or that show promise in doing so in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard P. (2009) (ed.) ''Computer-assisted language learning'', Volumes I-IV, Routledge: London and New York: http://www.stanford.edu/~efs/callcc/&lt;/ref&gt; A published review of Hubbard's collection can be found in ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 14, 3 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' (2010) 14, 3, pp. 14-18 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/issues/october2010/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler-Pascoe (2011) looks at the history of CALL from a different point of view, namely the evolution of CALL in the dual fields of educational technology and second/foreign language acquisition and the paradigm shifts experienced along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Butler-Pascoe M. E. (2011) "The history of CALL: the intertwining paths of technology and second/foreign language teaching", ''International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT)'' 1, 1: 16-32: http://www.igi-global.com/ijcallt&lt;/ref&gt;

See also Davies et al. (2011: Section 2, ''History of CALL'').&lt;ref name=davieswalkeretal/&gt;

==Typology and phases==

During the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to establish a CALL typology. A wide range of different types of CALL programs was identified by Davies &amp; Higgins (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1985) ''Using computers in language learning: a teacher's guide'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones &amp; Fortescue (1987),&lt;ref&gt;Jones C. &amp; Fortescue S. (1987) ''Using computers in the language classroom'', Harlow: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardisty &amp; Windeatt (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Hardisty D. &amp; Windeatt S. (1989) ''CALL'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Levy (1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;118ff.).&lt;ref name=levy1997/&gt; These included gap-filling and Cloze programs, multiple-choice programs, free-format (text-entry) programs, adventures and simulations, action mazes, sentence-reordering programs, exploratory programs—and "total Cloze", a type of program in which the learner has to reconstruct a whole text. Most of these early programs still exist in modernised versions.

Since the 1990s, it has become increasingly difficult to categorise CALL as it now extends to the use of [[blogs]], [[wikis]], [[social networking]], [[podcasting]], [[Web 2.0]] applications, [[#Virtual worlds|language learning in virtual worlds]] and [[interactive whiteboards]] (Davies et al. 2010: Section 3.7).&lt;ref name=davieswalkeretal/&gt;

Warschauer (1996)&lt;ref name=warschauer96&gt;Warschauer M. (1996) "Computer-assisted language learning: an introduction". In Fotos S. (ed.) ''Multimedia language teaching'', Tokyo: Logos International [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/warschauer.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Warschauer &amp; Healey (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warschauer | first1 = M. | last2 = Healey | first2 = D. | year = 1998 | title = Computers and language learning: an overview | url = | journal = Language Teaching | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 57–71 | doi=10.1017/s0261444800012970}}&lt;/ref&gt; took a different approach. Rather than focusing on the typology of CALL, they identified three historical phases of CALL, classified according to their underlying pedagogical and methodological approaches:

* Behavioristic CALL: conceived in the 1950s and implemented in the 1960s and 1970s.
* Communicative CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Integrative CALL: embracing Multimedia and the Internet: 1990s.

Most CALL programs in Warschauer &amp; Healey's first phase, Behavioristic CALL (1960s to 1970s), consisted of drill-and-practice materials in which the computer presented a stimulus and the learner provided a response. At first, both could be done only through text. The computer would analyse students' input and give feedback, and more sophisticated programs would react to students' mistakes by branching to help screens and remedial activities. While such programs and their underlying pedagogy still exist today, behaviouristic approaches to language learning have been rejected by most language teachers, and the increasing sophistication of computer technology has led CALL to other possibilities.

The second phase described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Communicative CALL, is based on the [[communicative approach]] that became prominent in the late 1970s and 1980s (Underwood 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Underwood J. (1984) ''Linguistics, computers and the language teacher: a communicative approach'', Rowley, Massachusetts: Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; In the communicative approach the focus is on using the language rather than analysis of the language, and grammar is taught implicitly rather than explicitly. It also allows for originality and flexibility in student output of language. The communicative approach coincided with the arrival of the PC, which made computing much more widely available and resulted in a boom in the development of software for language learning. The first CALL software in this phase continued to provide skill practice but not in a drill format—for example: paced reading, text reconstruction and language games—but the computer remained the tutor. In this phase, computers provided context for students to use the language, such as asking for directions to a place, and programs not designed for language learning such as [[Sim City]], ''Sleuth'' and [[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]] were used for language learning. Criticisms of this approach include using the computer in an ad hoc and disconnected manner for more marginal aims rather than the central aims of language teaching.

The third phase of CALL described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Integrative CALL, starting from the 1990s, tried to address criticisms of the communicative approach by integrating the teaching of language skills into tasks or projects to provide direction and coherence. It also coincided with the development of multimedia technology (providing text, graphics, sound and animation) as well as Computer-mediated communication (CMC). CALL in this period saw a definitive shift from the use of the computer for drill and tutorial purposes (the computer as a finite, authoritative base for a specific task) to a medium for extending education beyond the classroom. Multimedia CALL started with interactive laser videodiscs such as ''Montevidisco'' (Schneider &amp; Bennion 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Schneider E.W. &amp; Bennion J.L. (1984) "Veni, vidi, vici, via videodisc: a simulator for instructional courseware". In Wyatt D.H. (ed.) ''Computer-assisted language instruction'', Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A la rencontre de Philippe'' (Fuerstenberg 1993),&lt;ref&gt;Fuerstenberg G. (1993) ''A la rencontre de Philippe'': Videodisc, Software, Teacher's Manual and Student Activities Workbook: Yale University Press [Online]: http://web.mit.edu/fll/www/projects/Philippe.html&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were simulations of situations where the learner played a key role. These programs later were transferred to CD-ROMs, and new [[role-playing games]] (RPGs) such as ''Who is Oscar Lake?'' made their appearance in a range of different languages.

In a later publication Warschauer changed the name of the first phase of CALL from Behavioristic CALL to Structural CALL and also revised the dates of the three phases (Warschauer 2000):&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer M. (2000) "CALL for the 21st Century", IATEFL and ESADE Conference, 2 July 2000, Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Structural CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Communicative CALL: 1980s to 1990s.
* Integrative CALL: 2000 onwards.

Bax (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S | year = 2003 | title = CALL – past, present and future | url = | journal = System | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 13–28 | doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(02)00071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; took issue with Warschauer &amp; Haley (1998) and Warschauer (2000) and proposed these three phases:

* Restricted CALL – mainly behaviouristic: 1960s to 1980s.
* Open CALL – i.e. open in terms of feedback given to students, software types and the role of the teacher, and including simulations and games: 1980s to 2003 (i.e. the date of Bax's article).
* Integrated CALL – still to be achieved. Bax argued that at the time of writing language teachers were still in the Open CALL phase, as true integration could only be said to have been achieved when CALL had reached a state of "normalisation" – e.g. when using CALL was as normal as using a pen.

See also Bax &amp; Chambers (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Making CALL work: towards normalisation | url = | journal = System | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 465–479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bax (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bax S. (2011) "Normalisation revisited: the effective use of technology in language education", ''International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT)'' 1, 2: 1-15: http://www.igi-global.com/ijcallt&lt;/ref&gt; in which the topic of "normalisation" is revisited.

==Flashcards==

A basic use of CALL is in vocabulary acquisition using [[flashcard]]s, which requires quite simple programs. Such programs often make use of [[spaced repetition]], a technique whereby the learner is presented with the vocabulary items that need to be committed to memory at increasingly longer intervals until long-term retention is achieved. This has led to the development of a number of applications known as spaced repetition systems (SRS),&lt;ref&gt;Mounteney M. ''Spaced repetition learning systems (SRS):'' http://www.omniglot.com/language/srs.php. Accessed 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; including the generic [[Anki (software)|Anki]] or [[SuperMemo]] package and programs such as BYKI&lt;ref&gt;BYKI (Before You Know It): A personalized language-learning system, designed to promote language proficiency by expanding the learner's vocabulary. The system makes use of a flashcard interface and tracks everything that has been learned, automatically presenting and re-presenting the material at appropriate intervals: http://www.byki.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and phase-6,&lt;ref&gt;phase-6: A flashcard system that presents vocabulary at phased intervals, aiding long-term retention. http://www.phase-6.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which have been designed specifically for learners of foreign languages.

==Software design and pedagogy==

Above all, careful consideration must be given to [[pedagogy]] in designing CALL software, but publishers of CALL software tend to follow the latest trend, regardless of its desirability. Moreover, approaches to teaching foreign languages are constantly changing, dating back to [[grammar-translation]], through the [[direct method (education)|direct method]], [[Audio-lingual method|audio-lingualism]] and a variety of other approaches, to the more recent [[communicative approach]] and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] (Decoo 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Decoo W. (2001) ''On the mortality of language learning methods''. Paper given as the James L. Barker lecture on 8 November 2001 at Brigham Young University [Online]: https://web.archive.org/web/20080208190123/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Designing and creating CALL software is an extremely demanding task, calling upon a range of skills. Major CALL development projects are usually managed by a team of people:

* A subject specialist (also known as a content provider) – usually a language teacher – who is responsible for providing the content and pedagogical input. More than one subject specialist is required for larger CALL projects.
* A programmer who is familiar with the chosen programming language or authoring tool.
* A graphic designer, to produce pictures and icons, and to advise on fonts, colour, screen layout, etc.
* A professional photographer or, at the very least, a very good amateur photographer. Graphic designers often have a background in photography too.
* A sound engineer and a video technician will be required if the package is to contain substantial amounts of sound and video.
* An instructional designer. Developing a CALL package is more than just putting a text book into a computer. An instructional designer will probably have a background in cognitive psychology and media technology, and will be able to advise the subject specialists in the team on the appropriate use of the chosen technology (Gimeno &amp; Davies 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Gimeno-Sanz A. &amp; Davies G. (2010) CALL software design and implementation. Module 3.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

CALL inherently supports [[learner autonomy]], the final of the eight conditions that Egbert et al. (2007) cite as "Conditions for Optimal Language Learning Environments". Learner autonomy places the learner firmly in control so that he or she "decides on learning goals" (Egbert et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref&gt;Egbert J., Chao C.-C., &amp; Hanson-Smith E. (2007) Introduction: Foundations for Teaching and Learning. In Egbert J. &amp; E. Hanson-Smith (eds.) '' CALL environments: Research, practice, and critical issues '' (2nd edition). Alexandria, VA: TESOL. (pp. 1-14).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is all too easy when designing CALL software to take the comfortable route and produce a set of multiple-choice and gap-filling exercises, using a simple authoring tool (Bangs 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bangs P. (2011) Introduction to CALL authoring programs. Module 2.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but CALL is much more than this; Stepp-Greany (2002), for example, describes the creation and management of an environment incorporating a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] and [[whole language]] philosophy. According to constructivist theory, learners are active participants in tasks in which they "construct" new knowledge derived from their prior experience. Learners also assume responsibility for their learning, and the teacher is a facilitator rather than a purveyor of knowledge. Whole language theory embraces constructivism and postulates that language learning moves from the whole to the part, rather than building sub-skills to lead towards the higher abilities of comprehension, speaking, and writing. It also emphasises that comprehending, speaking, reading, and writing skills are interrelated, reinforcing each other in complex ways. Language acquisition is, therefore, an active process in which the learner focuses on cues and meaning and makes intelligent guesses. Additional demands are placed upon teachers working in a technological environment incorporating constructivist and whole language theories. The development of teachers’ professional skills must include new pedagogical as well as technical and management skills. Regarding the issue of teacher facilitation in such an environment, the teacher has a key role to play, but there could be a conflict between the aim to create an atmosphere for learner independence and the teacher's natural feelings of responsibility. In order to avoid learners’ negative perceptions, Stepp-Greany points out that it is especially important for the teacher to continue to address their needs, especially those of low-ability learners.&lt;ref name=steppgreany&gt;Stepp-Greany J. (2002) "Student perceptions on language learning in a technological environment: implications for the new millennium", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 6, 1: 165-180 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol6num1/steppgreany/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia==

Language teachers have been avid users of technology for a very long time. Gramophone records were among the first technological aids to be used by language teachers in order to present students with recordings of native speakers’ voices, and broadcasts from foreign radio stations were used to make recordings on reel-to-reel tape recorders. Other examples of technological aids that have been used in the foreign language classroom include slide projectors, film-strip projectors, film projectors, videocassette recorders and DVD players. In the early 1960s, integrated courses (which were often described as multimedia courses) began to appear. Examples of such courses are ''Ecouter et Parler'' (consisting of a coursebook and tape recordings)&lt;ref&gt;Côté D., Narins Levy S. &amp; O'Connor P. (1962) ''Ecouter et Parler'', Paris: Librairie Marcel Didier.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deutsch durch die audiovisuelle Methode'' (consisting of an illustrated coursebook, tape recordings and a film-strip – based on the Structuro-Global Audio-Visual method).&lt;ref&gt;Burgdorf I. Montani K., Z. Skreb Z. &amp; Vidovic M. (1962) ''Deutsch durch die audio-visuelle Methode'', New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s standard microcomputers were incapable of producing sound and they had poor graphics capability. This represented a step backwards for language teachers, who by this time had become accustomed to using a range of different media in the foreign language classroom. The arrival of the multimedia computer in the early 1990s was therefore a major breakthrough as it enabled text, images, sound and video to be combined in one device and the integration of the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing (Davies 2011: Section 1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm&gt;Davies G. (2011) Introduction to multimedia CALL. Module 2.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers'' (ICT4LT), Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of CALL programs for multimedia computers that were published on CD-ROM and DVD from the mid-1990s onwards are described by Davies (2010: Section 3).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; CALL programs are still being published on CD-ROM and DVD, but Web-based multimedia CALL has now virtually supplanted these media.

Following the arrival of multimedia CALL, multimedia language centres began to appear in educational institutions. While multimedia facilities offer many opportunities for language learning with the integration of text, images, sound and video, these opportunities have often not been fully utilised. One of the main promises of CALL is the ability to individualise learning but, as with the language labs that were introduced into educational institutions in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of the facilities of multimedia centres has often devolved into rows of students all doing the same drills (Davies 2010: Section 3.1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; There is therefore a danger that multimedia centres may go the same way as the language labs. Following a boom period in the 1970s, language labs went rapidly into decline. Davies (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;28) lays the blame mainly on the failure to train teachers to use language labs, both in terms of operation and in terms of developing new methodologies, but there were other factors such as poor reliability, lack of materials and a lack of good ideas.&lt;ref name=davieslessons&gt;Davies G. (1997) "Lessons from the past, lessons for the future: 20 years of CALL". In Korsvold A-K. &amp; Rüschoff B. (eds.) ''New technologies in language learning and teaching'', Strasbourg: Council of Europe, p. 28. Also on the Web in a revised edition (2009): http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/coegdd1.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing a multimedia language centre requires not only staff who have a knowledge of foreign languages and language teaching methodology but also staff with technical know-how and budget management ability, as well as the ability to combine all these into creative ways of taking advantage of what the technology can offer. A centre manager usually needs assistants for technical support, for managing resources and even the tutoring of students. Multimedia centres lend themselves to self-study and potentially self-directed learning, but this is often misunderstood. The simple existence of a multimedia centre does not automatically lead to students learning independently. Significant investment of time is essential for materials development and creating an atmosphere conducive to self-study. Unfortunately, administrators often have the mistaken belief that buying hardware by itself will meet the needs of the centre, allocating 90% of its budget to hardware and virtually ignoring software and staff training needs (Davies et al. 2011: ''Foreword'').&lt;ref name=daviesmmlc&gt;Davies G., Hamilton R., Weidmann B., Gabel S., Legenhausen L., Meus V. &amp; Myers S. (2011) Managing a multimedia language centre. Module 3.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self access language learning centers|Self-access language learning centres]] or independent learning centres have emerged partially independently and partially in response to these issues. In self-access learning, the focus is on developing learner autonomy through varying degrees of self-directed learning, as opposed to (or as a complement to) classroom learning. In many centres learners access materials and manage their learning independently, but they also have access to staff for help. Many self-access centres are heavy users of technology and an increasing number of them are now offering online self-access learning opportunities. Some centres have developed novel ways of supporting language learning outside the context of the language classroom (also called 'language support') by developing software to monitor students' self-directed learning and by offering online support from teachers. Centre managers and support staff may need to have new roles defined for them to support students’ efforts at self-directed learning: v. Mozzon-McPherson &amp; Vismans (2001), who refer to a new job description, namely that of the "language adviser".&lt;ref&gt;Mozzon-McPherson M. &amp; Vismans R. (eds.) (2001) ''Beyond language teaching towards language advising'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] (now known simply as "the Web") in the early 1990s marked a significant change in the use of communications technology for all computer users. [[Email]] and other forms of [[electronic communication]] had been in existence for many years, but the launch of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], the first graphical [[Web browser]], in 1993 brought about a radical change in the ways in which we communicate electronically. The launch of the Web in the public arena immediately began to attract the attention of language teachers. Many language teachers were already familiar with the concept of [[hypertext]] on stand-alone computers, which made it possible to set up non-sequential structured reading activities for language learners in which they could point to items of text or images on a page displayed on the computer screen and branch to any other pages, e.g. in a so-called "stack" as implemented in the [[HyperCard]] program on Apple Mac computers. The Web took this one stage further by creating a worldwide hypertext system that enabled the user to branch to different pages on computers anywhere in the world simply by pointing and clicking at a piece of text or an image. This opened up access to thousands of authentic foreign-language websites to teachers and students that could be used in a variety of ways. A problem that arose, however, was that this could lead to a good deal of time-wasting if Web browsing was used in an unstructured way (Davies 1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43),&lt;ref name=davieslessons/&gt; and language teachers responded by developing more structured activities and online exercises (Leloup &amp; Ponterio 2003).&lt;ref&gt;LeLoup J. &amp; Ponterio R. (2003) "Interactive and multimedia techniques in online language lessons: a sampler", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 7, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol7num3/net/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2010) lists over 500 websites, where links to online exercises can be found, along with links to online dictionaries and encyclopaedias, concordancers, translation aids and other miscellaneous resources of interest to the language teacher and learner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2010) [http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/websites.htm Graham Davies's Favourite Websites]&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the (free) ''[[Hot Potatoes]]'' (Holmes &amp; Arneil) authoring tool, which was first demonstrated publicly at the EUROCALL 1998 conference, made it possible for language teachers to create their own online interactive exercises. Other useful tools are produced by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes M. &amp; Arneil S. ''Hot Potatoes'', University of Victoria, Canada. Downloadable from: http://hotpot.uvic.ca: A library of Clipart for use with ''Hot Potatoes'' and other authoring tools is also available at the University of Victoria site: http://hcmc.uvic.ca/clipart/&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days the Web could not compete seriously with [[multimedia]] CALL on CD-ROM and DVD. Sound and video quality was often poor, and interaction was slow. But now the Web has caught up. Sound and video are of high quality and interaction has improved tremendously, although this does depend on sufficient bandwidth being available, which is not always the case, especially in remote rural areas and developing countries. One area in which CD-ROMs and DVDs are still superior is in the presentation of listen/respond/playback activities, although such activities on the Web are continually improving.

Since the early 2000s there has been a boom in the development of so-called [[Web 2.0]] applications. Contrary to popular opinion, Web 2.0 is not a new version of the Web, rather it implies a shift in emphasis from Web browsing, which is essentially a one-way process (from the Web to the end-user), to making use of Web applications in the same way as one uses applications on a desktop computer. It also implies more interaction and sharing. Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to the Internet. Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; list the following examples of Web 2.0 applications that language teachers are using:

* Image storage and sharing
* [[Social bookmarking]]
* Discussion lists, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[social networking]]
* [[Chat room]]s, [[MUD]]s, [[MOO]]s and [[MUVE]]s (virtual worlds)
* [[Podcasting]]
* Audio tools
* [[Video sharing]] applications and [[screen capture (disambiguation)|screen capture]] tools (referring to both video screen capture tools and screenshot tools)
* Animation tools – comic strips, movies, etc.
* [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|Mashup]]s
* Blog assisted language learning (BALL)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esp-world.info/Articles_26/push%20button%20publishing%20ward%202004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no doubt that the Web has proved to be a main focus for language teachers, who are making increasingly imaginative use of its wide range of facilities: see Dudeney (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Dudeney G. (2007) ''The Internet and the language classroom'', Second Edition, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. (2008) ''Handbook of research on Web 2.0 and second language learning'', Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, the use of Web 2.0 tools calls for a careful reexamination of the role of the teacher in the classroom (Richardson 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson W. (2006) ''Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms''. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpora and concordancers==

Corpora have been used for many years as the basis of linguistic research and also for the compilation of dictionaries and reference works such as the Collins Cobuild series, published by HarperCollins.&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins: http://www.harpercollins.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Tribble &amp; Barlow (2001),&lt;ref&gt;Tribble C. &amp; Barlow M. (eds.) (2001) ''Using corpora in language teaching and learning'', Special Issue, ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 5, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num3/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair J. (ed.) (2004) ''How to use corpora in language teaching'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; and McEnery &amp; Wilson (2011)&lt;ref name=mcenerywilson&gt;McEnery A. &amp; Wilson A. (2011) Corpus linguistics. Module 3.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; describe a variety of ways in which corpora can be used in language teaching.

An early reference to the use of electronic concordancers in language teaching can be found in Higgins &amp; Johns (1984: pp.&amp;nbsp;88–94),&lt;ref&gt;Higgins J. &amp; Johns T. (1984) ''Computers in language learning'', London: Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; and many examples of their practical use in the classroom are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2010).&lt;ref name = lamyklarskov/&gt;

It was Tim Johns (1991), however, who raised the profile of the use of concordancers in the language classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL).&lt;ref&gt;Johns T. (1991) "From printout to handout: grammar and vocabulary teaching in the context of Data Driven Learning". In Johns T. &amp; King P. (eds.) ''Classroom concordancing'', Special issue of ''ELR Journal'' 4, University of Birmingham, Centre for English Language Studies: 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt; DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2011).&lt;ref name=lamyklarskov&gt;Lamy M-N. &amp; Klarskov Mortensen H. J. (2011) Using concordance programs in the Modern Foreign Languages classroom. Module 2.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Robb (2003) shows how it is possible to use Google as a concordancer, but he also points out a number of drawbacks, for instance there is no control over the educational level, nationality, or other characteristics of the creators of the texts that are found, and the presentation of the examples is not as easy to read as the output of a dedicated concordancer that places the key words (i.e. the search terms) in context.&lt;ref&gt;Robb T. (2003) "Google as a Quick 'n Dirty Corpus Tool", ''TESL-EJ'' 7, 2 [Online]: http://tesl-ej.org/ej26/int.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual worlds==

[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. Language teachers discovered that it was possible to exploit these text-only programs by using them as the basis for discussion. Jones G. (1986) describes an experiment based on the Kingdom simulation, in which learners played roles as members of a council governing an imaginary kingdom. A single computer in the classroom was used to provide the stimulus for discussion, namely simulating events taking place in the kingdom: crop planting time, harvest time, unforeseen catastrophes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Computer simulations in language teaching – the KINGDOM experiment | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 179–186 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early adventure games and simulations led on to multi-user variants, which were known as [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains). Like their predecessors, MUDs were text-only, with the difference that they were available to a wider online audience. MUDs then led on to [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding: see Donaldson &amp; Kötter (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Kötter | first2 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Language learning in cyberspace: teleporting the classroom into the target culture | url = | journal = CALICO Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 531–558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major breakthrough in the history of virtual worlds was the graphical user interface. [[Habitat (video game)|Lucasfilm's Habitat]] (1986), was one of the first virtual worlds that was graphically based, albeit only in a two-dimensional environment. Each participant was represented by a visual avatar who could interact with other avatars using text chat.

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as Traveler and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. Traveler included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars who were represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of Active Worlds as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the interest of language teachers with the launch of the first of the series of SLanguages conferences in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;SLanguages: http://www.slanguages.net/home.php&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 14.2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet/&gt; and Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2010)&lt;ref name=molka&gt;Molka-Danielsen, J. &amp; Deutschmann, M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Trondheim, Norway: Tapir Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a number of experiments and projects that focus on language learning in Second Life. See also the Wikipedia article [[Virtual world language learning]].

To what extent Second Life and other virtual worlds will become established as important tools for teachers of foreign languages remains to be seen. It has been argued by Dudeney (2010) in his ''That's Life'' blog that Second Life is "too demanding and too unreliable for most educators". The subsequent discussion shows that this view is shared by many teachers, but many others completely disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Second Life – The Long Goodbye: http://slife.dudeney.com/?p=446&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the pros and cons of Second Life, language teachers’ interest in virtual worlds continues to grow. The joint EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2009, and there are now many areas in Second Life that are dedicated to language learning and teaching, for example the commercial area for learners of English, which is managed by Language Lab,&lt;ref&gt;LanguageLab: http://www.languagelab.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and free areas such as the region maintained by the Goethe-Institut&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands.&lt;ref&gt;EduNation Islands: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of simulations created specifically for language education, such as those produced by the EC-funded NIFLAR&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; and AVALON&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; projects. NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|Opensim]].

==Human language technologies==

Human language technologies (HLT) comprise a number of areas of research and development that focus on the use of technology to facilitate communication in a multilingual information society. Human language technologies are areas of activity in departments of the European Commission that were formerly grouped under the heading [[language engineering]] (Gupta &amp; Schulze 2011: Section 1.1).&lt;ref name=guptaschulze&gt;Gupta P. &amp; Schulze M. (2011) Human Language Technologies (HLT). Module 3.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of HLT that is of greatest interest to the language teacher is [[natural language processing]] (NLP), especially [[parsing]], as well as the areas of [[speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]].

Speech synthesis has improved immeasurably in recent years. It is often used in electronic dictionaries to enable learners to find out how words are pronounced. At word level, speech synthesis is quite effective, the artificial voice often closely resembling a human voice. At phrase level and sentence level, however, there are often problems of intonation, resulting in speech production that sounds unnatural even though it may be intelligible. Speech synthesis as embodied in [[text to speech]] (TTS) applications is invaluable as a tool for unsighted or partially sighted people. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 4.1) list several examples of speech synthesis applications.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Speech recognition is less advanced than speech synthesis. It has been used in a number of CALL programs, in which it is usually described as [[automatic speech recognition]] (ASR). ASR is not easy to implement. Ehsani &amp; Knodt (1998) summarise the core problem as follows:

"Complex cognitive processes account for the human ability to associate acoustic signals with meanings and intentions. For a computer, on the other hand, speech is essentially a series of digital values. However, despite these differences, the core problem of speech recognition is the same for both humans and machines: namely, of finding the best match between a given speech sound and its corresponding word string. Automatic speech recognition technology attempts to simulate and optimize this process computationally."&lt;ref name=ehsaniknodt&gt;Ehsani F. &amp; Knodt E. (1998) "Speech technology in computer-aided language learning: strengths and limitations of a new CALL paradigm", ''Language Learning and Technology'' 2, 1: 45–60 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol2num1/article3/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs embodying ASR normally provide a native speaker model that the learner is requested to imitate, but the matching process is not 100% reliable and may result in a learner's perfectly intelligible attempt to pronounce a word or phrase being rejected (Davies 2010: Section 3.4.6 and Section 3.4.7).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt;

Parsing is used in a number of ways in CALL. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 5) describe how parsing may be used to analyse sentences, presenting the learner with a tree diagram that labels the constituent parts of speech of a sentence and shows the learner how the sentence is structured.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Parsing is also used in CALL programs to analyse the learner's input and diagnose errors. Davies (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2002) Article on CALL in the ''Good Practice Guide'' at the website of the Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies (LLAS), University of Southampton [Online]: http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/61&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

"Discrete error analysis and feedback were a common feature of traditional CALL, and the more sophisticated programs would attempt to analyse the learner's response, pinpoint errors, and branch to help and remedial activities. ... Error analysis in CALL is, however, a matter of controversy. Practitioners who come into CALL via the disciplines of [[computational linguistics]], e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human Language Technologies (HLT), tend to be more optimistic about the potential of error analysis by computer than those who come into CALL via language teaching. [...] An alternative approach is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to parse the learner's response – so-called ''intelligent CALL'' (ICALL) – but there is a gulf between those who favour the use of AI to develop CALL programs (Matthews 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matthews | first1 = C | year = 1994 | title = Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning as cognitive science: the choice of syntactic frameworks for language tutoring | url = | journal = Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 533–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the other extreme, those who perceive this approach as a threat to humanity (Last 1989:153)".&lt;ref&gt;Last R.W. (1989) ''Artificial intelligence techniques in language learning'', Chichester: Ellis Horwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underwood | first1 = J | year = 1989 | title = On the edge: Intelligent CALL in the 1990s | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 71–84 | doi=10.1007/bf00058770}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heift &amp; Schulze (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heift T. &amp; Schulze M. (eds.) (2007) ''Errors and intelligence in CALL: parsers and pedagogues'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; present a more positive picture of AI.

Research into speech synthesis, speech recognition and parsing and how these areas of NLP can be used in CALL are the main focus of the NLP Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group: http://siglp.eurocall-languages.org/&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[European Association for Computer-Assisted Language Learning|EUROCALL]] professional association and the ICALL Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;CALICO ICALL Special Interest Group: http://purl.org/calico/icall&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]] professional association. The EUROCALL NLP SIG also maintains a Ning.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group Ning: http://nlpsig.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The question of the impact of CALL in language learning and teaching has been raised at regular intervals ever since computers first appeared in educational institutions (Davies &amp; Hewer 2011: Section 3).&lt;ref name=ict4ltmod11&gt;Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to new technologies and how they can contribute to language learning and teaching. Module 1.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recent large-scale impact studies include the study edited by Fitzpatrick &amp; Davies (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) (2003) ''The impact of Information and Communications Technologies on the teaching of foreign languages and on the role of teachers of foreign languages'', EC Directorate General of Education and Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; and the EACEA (2009) study,&lt;ref&gt;Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission (2009) ''Study on the impact of ICT and new media on language learning'' [Online]: http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/studies/study_impact_ict_new_media_language_learning_en.php&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were produced for the European Commission.

A distinction needs to be made between the impact and the effectiveness of CALL. Impact may be measured quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the uptake and use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] in teaching foreign languages, issues of availability of hardware and software, budgetary considerations, Internet access, teachers’ and learners' attitudes to the use of CALL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=mahmoudi|first=elham|title=Attitude and student's performance in Computer Assisted English Language Learning (CALL) for Learning Vocabulary|journal=procedia social and behavioral science|date=June 30, 2012|volume=66|pages=489–498|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812052780|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.11.293}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in the ways in which languages are learnt and taught, and paradigm shifts in teachers’ and learners’ roles. Effectiveness, on the other hand, usually focuses on assessing to what extent ICT is a more effective way of teaching foreign languages compared to using traditional methods – and this is more problematic as so many variables come into play. Worldwide, the picture of the impact of CALL is extremely varied. Most developed nations work comfortably with the new technologies, but developing nations are often beset with problems of costs and broadband connectivity. Evidence on the effectiveness of CALL – as with the impact of CALL – is extremely varied and many research questions still need to be addressed and answered. Hubbard (2002) presents the results of a CALL research survey that was sent to 120 CALL professionals from around the world asking them to articulate a CALL research question they would like to see answered. Some of the questions have been answered but many more remain open.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard P. (2002) ''Survey of unanswered questions in Computer Assisted Language Learning: Effectiveness issues'' [Online]: http://www.stanford.edu/~efs/callsurvey/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Leakey (2011) offers an overview of current and past research in CALL and proposes a comprehensive model for evaluating the effectiveness of CALL platforms, programs and pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Leakey J. (2011) ''Evaluating Computer Assisted Language Learning: an integrated approach to effectiveness research in CALL'', Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial issue is the extent to which the computer is perceived as taking over the teacher's role. Warschauer (1996: p.&amp;nbsp;6) perceived the computer as playing an "intelligent" role, and claimed that a computer program "should ideally be able to understand a user's spoken input and evaluate it not just for correctness but also for appropriateness. It should be able to diagnose a student's problems with pronunciation, syntax, or usage and then intelligently decide among a range of options (e.g. repeating, paraphrasing, slowing down, correcting, or directing the student to background explanations)."&lt;ref name=warschauer96/&gt; Jones C. (1986), on the other hand, rejected the idea of the computer being "some kind of inferior teacher-substitute" and proposed a methodology that focused more on what teachers could do with computer programs rather than what computer programs could do on their own: "in other words, treating the computer as they would any other classroom aid".&lt;ref name=jones86&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = C | year = 1986 | title = It's not so much the program: more what you do with it: the importance of methodology in CALL | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 171–178 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warschauer's high expectations in 1996 have still not been fulfilled, and currently there is an increasing tendency for teachers to go down the route proposed by Jones, making use of a variety of new tools such as [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards&lt;ref name= schmidcutrim2009/&gt; and applications for online communication.&lt;ref name= lamyhampel/&gt;

Since the advent of the Web there has been an explosion in online learning, but to what extent it is effective is open to criticism. Felix (2003) takes a critical look at popular myths attached to online learning from three perspectives, namely administrators, teachers and students. She concludes: "That costs can be saved in this ambitious enterprise is clearly a myth, as are expectations of saving time or replacing staff with machines."&lt;ref&gt;Felix U. (2003) "Teaching languages online: deconstructing the myths", ''Australian Journal of Educational Technology'' 19, 1: 118-138 [Online]: http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet19/felix.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the effectiveness of CALL in promoting the four skills, Felix (2008) claims that there is "enough data in CALL to suggest positive effects on spelling, reading and writing", but more research is needed in order to determine its effectiveness in other areas, especially speaking online. She claims that students' perceptions of CALL are positive, but she qualifies this claim by stating that the technologies need to be stable and well supported, drawing attention to concerns that technical problems may interfere with the learning process. She also points out that older students may not feel comfortable with computers and younger students may not possess the necessary metaskills for coping effectively in the challenging new environments. Training in computer literacy for both students and teachers is essential, and time constraints may pose additional problems. In order to achieve meaningful results she recommends "time-series analysis in which the same group of students is involved in experimental and control treatment for a certain amount of time and then switched – more than once if possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix | first1 = U | year = 2008 | title = The unreasonable effectiveness of CALL: what have we learned in two decades of research? | url = | journal = ReCALL | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–161 | doi=10.1017/s0958344008000323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of technology training in CALL for language teaching professionals certainly vary. Within second language teacher education programs, namely pre-service course work, we can find "online courses along with face-to-face courses", computer technology incorporated into a more general second language education course, "technology workshops","a series of courses offered throughout the teacher education programs, and even courses specifically designed for a CALL certificate and a CALL graduate degree"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = K. H. | year = 2010 | title = CALL teacher education as an impetus for 12 teachers in integrating technology | url = | journal = ReCALL | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 53–69 | doi = 10.1017/s095834400999019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has identified four levels of courses with only components, namely "web-supplemented, web-dependent, mixed mod and fully online".&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. E. (2013) A Case for Online English Language Teacher Education. The International Research Foundation for English Language Education. http://www.tirfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TIRF_OLTE_One-PageSpread_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a rapidly growing interest in resources about the use of technology to deliver CALL. Journals that have issues that "deal with how teacher education programs help prepare language teachers to use technology in their own classrooms" include ''Language Learning and Technology'' (2002), ''Innovations in Language Learning and Teaching'' (2009) and the TESOL international professional association's publication of technology standards for TESOL includes a chapter on preparation of teacher candidates in technology use, as well as the upgrading of teacher educators to be able to provide such instruction. Both CALICO and EUROCALL have special interest groups for teacher education in CALL.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. E. (2013) A Case for Online English Language Teacher Education. The International Research Foundation for English Language Education. http://www.tirfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TIRF_OLTE_One-PageSpread_2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2172">'''de Vaucouleurs' law''', also known as the '''de Vaucouleurs profile''' or '''de Vaucouleurs model''', describes how the surface brightness &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of an [[elliptical galaxy]] varies as a function of apparent distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the galaxy:&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1948AnAp...11..247D  Recherches sur les Nebuleuses Extragalactiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\ln I(R) = \ln I_{0} - k R^{1/4}.
&lt;/math&gt;

By defining ''R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the radius of the [[Contour_line#Other_phenomena|isophote]] containing half of the total luminosity, de Vaucouleurs' profile may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\ln I(R) = \ln I_{e} + 7.669 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{R}{R_{e}} \right)^{1/4} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
I(R) = I_{e} e^{-7.669 \left[ \left(\frac{R}{R_{e}}\right)^{1/4} - 1 \right]}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the surface brightness at ''R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''. This can be confirmed by noting

:&lt;math&gt;
\int^{R_e}_0 I(r)2\pi r dr = \frac{1}{2} \int^{\infty}_0 I(r)2\pi r dr  .
&lt;/math&gt;

de Vaucouleurs' model is a special case of [[Sersic's law|Sersic's model]], with [[Sersic index]] n=4.  A number of (internal) density profiles that approximately reproduce de Vaucouleurs' law after projection onto the plane of the sky include [[Jaffe profile|Jaffe's model]] and [[Dehnen profile|Dehnen's model]].

The model is named after [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] who first formulated it in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gerard Henri de Vaucouleurs (1918 - 1995)|journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Institute of Physics 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gerard De Vaucouleurs | website=American Institute of Physics | date=2015-01-15 | url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/33930 | access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although an empirical model rather than a law of physics, it was so entrenched in astronomy during the 20th century that it was referred to as a "law".

A '''drama school''', '''stage school''' or '''theatre school''' is an undergraduate and/or graduate [[school]] or [[academic department|department]] at a [[college]] or [[university]]; or a free-standing institution (such as the Drama section at the [[Juilliard School]]); which specializes in the pre-professional training in [[drama]] and [[theatre]] arts, such as [[acting]], [[technical theatre|design and technical theatre]], [[arts administration]], and related subjects. If the drama school is part of a degree-granting institution, undergraduates typically take a [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]], or, occasionally, [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Design]].  Graduate students may take a [[Master of Arts]], [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Fine Arts]], [[Doctor of Arts]], [[Doctor of Fine Arts]], or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree.

==Entry and application process==
[[File:Dramaclubssst.jpg|thumb|Romanian students (Drama Club Botosani) in "The Taming of the Shrew"]]
Entry to drama school is usually through a competitive [[audition]] process. Some schools make this a two-stage process. Places on an acting course are limited (usually well below 100) so those who fare best at the audition are selected. Most academies state that applicants must be over 18 years of age.
Auditions usually involve the performance of [[monologue]]s and group workshops, and may also include a [[singing]] activity. This varies from academy to academy. If this is the case for an [[acting]] degree, the school looks more at how an applicant can put character into the song rather than how well they can sing. For a [[musical theatre]] degree, the emphasis is on showing one's talent as a [[singer]]. Most colleges offer callback auditions, often in several stages, in which students being considered for entry onto a course are brought back to audition again, demonstrating their talents further. It is also possible to get into a drama school by previous grades. Some auditioners may be under 18.

==Course content==

The courses offered by drama schools focus on practical courses, rather than theoretical classes. Their aim is to train students as professional [[actor]]s for stage (theatre or musical theatre) and camera-based work (film and television shows). Students are required to be enthusiastic and motivated in order to meet the demands of the program. At the beginning of the final year (usually the third), most drama schools stage a series of performances throughout the academic year to which [[Talent agent|agents]] and [[casting director]]s are invited. This helps to build the future of the graduates and serves as a showcase of what the students can do.

==Funding==

===United Kingdom===
In 1833 the actress [[Frances Maria Kelly]] managed the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] where she funded and operated a dramatic school, the earliest record of a drama school in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burwick|first1=Frederick|title=British Drama of the Industrial Revolution|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Conference of Drama Schools]] comprises Britain’s 22 leading Drama Schools. CDS exists in order to strengthen the voice of the member schools, to set and maintain the highest standards of training within the vocational drama sector, and to make it easier for prospective students to understand the range of courses on offer and the application process. Founded in 1969, the 22 member schools offer courses in Acting, Musical Theatre, Directing and Technical Theatre training. Graduates of CDS courses are currently working on stage, in front of the camera and behind the scenes in theatres and studios across Britain. In September 2016, Midlands Academy of Musical Theatre opened in Birmingham. Offering West End quality training in Musical Theatre to students aged 18+, and with the same or better opportunities as many London drama schools, they offer a regional option for prospective drama school students. In 2012 it was merged with the [[National Council for Drama Training]] to create a single national authority [[Drama UK]] responsible for both the provision of Drama Training and accreditation of official courses. In 2017 Drama UK was replaced by the [[Federation of Drama Schools]].

In the UK, funding varies from drama school to drama school. Historically drama schools were not part of the mainstream academic system, and therefore were not funded on the same basis as universities. Some drama schools are now part of a university, such as [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]], which is part of the [[City University of London]], and Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance, which is part of the University of Manchester, and these tend to charge similar tuition fees to universities. Student loans, drama awards and scholarships may help to provide students with their funding.
The most prominent funding scheme for performing arts education in the UK are the [[Dance and Drama Awards]].  This is a government scheme which subsidises the training offered at a selection of the leading performing arts schools in the fields of dance, drama, musical theatre and stage management.

===Ireland===

A number of third level institutions provide courses in Drama and Theatre Studies, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from TCD [http://www.tcd.ie/drama-film-music/ Drama Dept, TCD]&lt;/ref&gt; NUI Maynooth,&lt;ref&gt;Prospectus from NUIM English Dept [http://english.nuim.ie/madtherapy.shtml Dramatherapy Course]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dublin City University.  A decision by Trinity in Jan 2007 to drop its BA in Acting Studies for cost reasons met with disappointment from the theatre sector.&lt;ref&gt;Trinity News report http://www.trinitynews.ie/articles.php?tn=1&amp;issue=2&amp;id=215{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  website&lt;/ref&gt;  A Forum for Acting Training was convened with leading professionals from the industry who recommended in a report published 27 May 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Forum on Acting Training Report, May 2008, [http://www.tcd.ie/Communications/pdf/forum-on-acting-training-report.pdf Forum Report]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that an Academy for Dramatic Arts, independent of a University, but with third level accreditation should be created. The report was submitted to the Irish Government.  On 1 August 2008, [[The Irish Times]] reported that a [[RADA]] graduate, [[Danielle Ryan]], granddaughter of the late [[Tony Ryan]] who founded [[Ryanair]], had announced plans to develop an Irish Academy of Dramatic Arts part-funded from a Trust created by her late father, Captain Cathal Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Smyth, Irish Times, 1 August 2008 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0801/1217368811614.html Acting academy to include theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan went ahead and the academy, known as The Lir, opened in September 2011. The Lir is part of Trinity College and is situated in the Grand Canal Dock area. It is officially associated with [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art |RADA]].

{{refimprove|date=March 2011}}
{{Discrimination sidebar|expanded=Social}}

'''Elitism''' is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an [[elite]] — a select group of people with a certain [[ancestry]], intrinsic [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], high [[intellect]], [[wealth]], special skills, or experience — are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. In the United States, the term ''elitism'' often refers to the concentration of power in the [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast Corridor]] and on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where the typical American elite resides – journalists, lawyers, doctors, high-level civil servants, businesspeople, university lecturers, entrepreneurs, and financial advisors in the [[quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary sector]], often in established technological or political catchments of their [[higher education]] [[alma mater]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Alternatively, the term ''elitism'' may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Oppositions of elitism include [[anti-elitism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[populism]] and [[political theory]] of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].

[[Elite theory]] is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal. Elitism is closely related to [[social class]] and what [[sociologist]]s call [[social stratification]], which in the [[Anglo Saxon]] tradition have long been anchored in the "blue blood" claims of hereditary [[nobility]]. Members of the upper classes are sometimes known as the social elite. The term ''elitism'' is also sometimes used to denote situations in which a group of people claiming to possess high abilities or simply an [[in-group]] or [[En cadre|cadre]] grant themselves extra privileges at the expense of others. This form of elitism may be described as ''[[discrimination]]''.

==Characteristics==
Attributes that identify an elite vary; personal achievement may not be essential. Elitist status ''can'' be based on personal achievement, such as degrees from top-rate universities or impressive internships and job offers, it can (in archaic societies) be based on lineage or passed-on fame from parents or grandparents. As a term, "elite" usually describes a person or group of people who are members of the uppermost class of society, and wealth can contribute to that class determination. Personal attributes commonly purported by elitist theorists to be characteristic of the elite include: rigorous study of, or great accomplishment within, a particular field; a long track record of competence in a demanding field; an extensive history of dedication and effort in service to a specific discipline (e.g., medicine or law) or a high degree of accomplishment, training or wisdom within a given field. Elitists tend to favor social systems such as [[meritocracy]], [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] and [[plutocracy]] as opposed to radical [[democracy]], political [[egalitarianism]] and [[populism]]. Elitists also believe only a few "shakers and movers" truly change society rather than society being changed by the majority of people who only vote and elect the elites into power. To elitists, the public is abjectly powerless and can be manipulated only by the top group of elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elite (elitist) theory|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/elite_theory|website=auburn.edu|publisher=Auburn University|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[synonym]]s for "elite" might be "upper-class" or "[[aristocracy|aristocratic]]", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's [[means of production]]. This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative "class" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.

===Academic elitism===
{{anchor|Academic}}
{{see also|Ivory tower}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Elitism in the context of [[education]] is the practice of concentrating attention on or allocating funding to the best students, or those [[student]]s who rank highest in a particular field of endeavour. For example, a politician who promotes advanced classes for students deemed to be highly intelligent might be accused of elitism, even if this were argued to promote an egalitarian goal, such as curing disease. Elitism in education could be based on conventional assessment of learning ability, knowledge, or other abilities. However, an "elite" school can also mean a school for the wealthy or one that is hard to enter.

==Anti-elitism&lt;!--'Antielitism' and 'Antielitism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{main|Populism|Pluralism (political theory)}}
The term ''elitism'' and the [[pejorative]] title ''elitist'' are sometimes used by people who are not (or, who claim not to be) members of elite organizations. In politics, such terms are often used to disparage a politician's views as out of touch with the interests of the "[[average Joe]]". The implication is that the alleged elitist person or group thinks they are better than everyone else, and put themselves before others as a result. The definition of ''elitist'' is similar to that of the word "[[snob]]".

An elitist is not always seen as truly elite, but only privileged. The definition may have different appreciations depending on the political contexts. Since elitism may be viewed as something necessary for creating patterns of good intellectual or professional performance, it can be used also for maintaining conditions of lack of competition and privilege.

An early proponent of '''anti-elitism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was [[Georges Sorel]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Woodley, ''Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology'', Routledge, 2010, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egalitarianism===
{{further|Egalitarianism}}
Elitism endorses the exclusion of large numbers of people from positions of privilege or power. Thus, many populists seek the (perceived, if not present in practice) social equality of egalitarianism, [[populism]], [[socialism]], or [[communism]]. They may also support [[affirmative action]], [[social security]], [[luxury tax]]es, and highly [[progressive tax]]es for the wealthiest members of society. All of these measures seek to reduce the difference of power between the elite and the ordinary. However, these measures to reduce difference could be seen as anti-[[meritocracy|meritocratic]] in that they avoid rewarding or promoting those who are the most competitive or provide the most effort in their endeavors.

The terms ''elitism'' and ''meritocracy'' are not equivalent in meaning. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|date=January 2008|volume=29|issue=7–27|pages=7|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist theory]] as it relates to [[architecture]] has forged the way for the rediscovery of such [[women in architecture|female architects]] as [[Eileen Gray]]. These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Adolf Loos]] have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.

==The architecture==
In [[Dolores Hayden]]'s book ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' she explains the ways in which "a lost feminine tradition" led to a "redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life".&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Hayden, ''The Grand Domestic Revolution: A History of Feminist Designs for American Homes, Neighborhoods, and Cities,'' MIT Press, 1981. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's [[Villa Stein]] de-Monzie. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] is an excellent example of the way that the "modern" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., "Family Matters: The Schroder House, by Gerrit Rietveld and Truus Schröder," [[Yale University Press]], 2006. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European [[feminism]] of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.

Eileen Gray's [[E-1027]] is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.

Much like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's "5 points of new architecture" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Caroline. "E1027: The Nonheroic Modernism of Eileen Gray," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol.53, September 1994. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Like E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., ''Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History.'' Yale University Press, 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S. Pontryagin: Selected Works Vol. 2: Topological Groups |page= 429 |year=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JU0DT_wXu2oC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=2-88124-133-6 |publisher=Gordon and Breach|edition=3rd }}. Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J. Montaldi |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dZOuFo1QYMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=algebra+%22coordinate+system%22|isbn=0-412-40680-2 |year=1993 |publisher=CRC Press   }} As such, the coordinate system is a mathematical construct, a language, that may be related to motion, but has no necessary connection to motion.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;
{{cite book |title=Unification of Classical, Quantum and Relativistic Mechanics and of the Four Forces |author1=J X Zheng-Johansson |author2=Per-Ivar Johansson |page=13 
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1FU37uru6QC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=frame+coordinate+johansson|isbn=1-59454-260-0 
|publisher=Nova Publishers 
|year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Which is not to dispute that some coordinate systems may be a better choice for some observations than are others.

*Choice of what to measure and with what observational apparatus is a matter separate from the observer's state of motion and choice of coordinate system.

Here is a quotation applicable to moving observational frames &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; and various associated Euclidean three-space coordinate systems [''R'', ''R′'', ''etc.'']:&lt;ref name=Lyle &gt;{{cite book  |title=Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity |page= 9 |author1=Jean Salençon |author2=Stephen Lyle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3xIED8ctfUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=physical+%22frame+of+reference%22|isbn=3-540-41443-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Springer  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|We first introduce the notion of ''reference frame'', itself related to the idea of ''observer'': the reference frame is, in some sense, the "Euclidean space carried by the observer". Let us give a more mathematical definition:… the reference frame is... the set of all points in the Euclidean space with the rigid body motion of the observer. The frame, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, is said to move with the observer.… The spatial positions of particles are labelled relative to a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt; by establishing a ''coordinate system'' ''R'' with origin ''O''. The corresponding set of axes, sharing the rigid body motion of the frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, can be considered to give a physical realization of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;. In a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}&lt;/math&gt;, coordinates are changed from ''R'' to ''R′'' by carrying out, at each instant of time, the same coordinate transformation on the components of ''intrinsic'' objects (vectors and tensors) introduced to represent physical quantities ''in this frame''.| Jean Salençon, Stephen Lyle ''Handbook of Continuum Mechanics: General Concepts, Thermoelasticity'' p. 9}}

Although the term "coordinate system" is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense, the term "coordinate system" does have a precise meaning in mathematics, and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well.

where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''etc.'' are the ''n'' Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions,  '''coordinate surfaces''' are defined by the relations:

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

=== Simple example ===
[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

'''Goguryeo art''' is the art of [[Goguryeo]], an ancient [[Korea]]n kingdom (37 BCE &amp;ndash; 668 CE) which occupied large areas of present-day [[Northeast China]] and [[Korea]]. Its distinct style is marked by flowing lines and vivid colors.  The prime examples of this style are [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|tomb murals]] excavated in [[North Korea]] and [[Manchuria]], which were produced from the 3rd to 7th centuries.

[[File:Talis02.png|frame|This design for an [[amulet]] comes from the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' grimoire.]]
A '''grimoire''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ɪ|m|ˈ|w|ɑr}} {{respell|grim|WAHR}}) (also known as a “book of spells”) is a textbook of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like [[talismans]] and [[amulets]], how to perform magical [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] and [[divination]], and how to [[evocation|summon]] or [[invocation|invoke]] supernatural entities such as [[angel]]s, [[spirits]], [[Deity|deities]] and [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"&gt;Davies (2009:1)&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the [[Bible]]) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. In this manner, while all ''books on magic'' could be thought of as grimoires, not all ''magical books'' should be thought of as grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-3)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term ''grimoire'' is originally European and many Europeans throughout history, particularly [[ceremonial magic]]ians and [[cunning folk]], have used grimoires, the historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]] noted that similar books can be found all across the world, ranging from [[Jamaica]] to [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:2-5)&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that in this sense, the world's first grimoires were created in [[Europe]] and the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:6-7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
It is most commonly believed that the term ''grimoire'' originated from the [[Old French language|Old French]] word ''grammaire'', which had initially been used to refer to all books written in [[Latin]]. By the 18th century, the term had gained its now common usage in France, and had begun to be used to refer purely to books of magic. Owen Davies presumed this was because "many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscripts".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

However, the term ''grimoire'' later developed into a [[figure of speech]] amongst the French indicating something that was hard to understand. In the 19th century, with the increasing interest in [[occultism]] amongst the British following the publication of [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett's]] ''[[The Magus (handbook)|The Magus]]'' (1801), the term entered the English language in reference to books of magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:1"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient period ===

The earliest known written magical incantations come from ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), where they have been found inscribed on [[cuneiform]] clay tablets that [[archaeology|archaeologists]] excavated from the city of [[Uruk]] and dated to between the 5th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:8)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Egypt]]ians also employed magical incantations, which have been found inscribed on amulets and other items. The Egyptian magical system, known as [[heka (god)|heka]], was greatly altered and enhanced after the Macedonians, led by [[Alexander the Great]], invaded Egypt in 332 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"&gt;Davies (2009:8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next three centuries of [[Hellenistic Egypt]], the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] writing system evolved, and the [[Library of Alexandria]] was opened. This likely had an influence upon books of magic, with the trend on known incantations switching from simple health and protection charms to more specific things, such as financial success and sexual fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:8-9"/&gt; Around this time the legendary figure of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] developed as a conflation of the Egyptian god [[Thoth]] and the Greek [[Hermes]]; this figure was associated with writing and magic and, therefore, of books on magic.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"&gt;Davies (2009:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] believed that books on magic were invented by the [[Ancient Persia|Persians]]. The 1st-century AD writer [[Pliny the Elder]] stated that magic had been first discovered by the ancient philosopher [[Zoroaster]] around the year 647 BC but that it was only written down in the 5th century BC by the magician [[Osthanes]]. His claims are not, however, supported by modern historians.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"&gt;Davies (2009:7)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient [[Hebrews|Jewish]] people were often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic, which, according to legend, they had learned from [[Moses]], who had learned it in Egypt. Among many ancient writers, Moses was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew. Two manuscripts likely dating to the 4th century, both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses (the first five being the initial books in the Biblical [[Old Testament]]), present him as a [[polytheism|polytheist]] who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:10"/&gt;

Meanwhile, there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain, particularly [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], sects of [[early Christianity]]. In the ''[[Book of Enoch]]'' found within the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], for instance, there is information on [[astrology]] and the [[angels]]. In possible connection with the ''Book of Enoch'', the idea of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and his great-grandson [[Noah]] having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued through to the medieval period.&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:7"/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=246px|quote="Many of those [in [[Ephesus]]] who believed [in Christianity] now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power."|source=[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19, c. 1st century}}

Israelite King [[Solomon]] was a Biblical figure associated with magic and sorcery in the ancient world. The 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] mentioned a book circulating under the name of Solomon that contained incantations for summoning demons and described how a Jew called Eleazar used it to cure cases of [[demonic possession|possession]]. The book may have been the ''[[Testament of Solomon]]'' but was more probably a different work.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=E. M.|authorlink=Eliza Marian Butler |title=Ritual Magic |year=1979 |publisher=[[CUP Archive]] |isbn=0-521-29553-X |edition=Reprint |chapter=The Solomonic Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphic]] ''Testament of Solomon'' is one of the oldest magical texts. It is a Greek manuscript attributed to Solomon and likely written in either Babylonia or Egypt sometime in the first five centuries AD, over 1,000 years after Solomon's death.

The work tells of the building of [[The Temple]] and relates that construction was hampered by demons until the angel [[Michael]] gave the king a magical ring. The ring, engraved with the [[Seal of Solomon]], had the power to bind [[demons]] from doing harm. Solomon used it to lock demons in jars and commanded others to do his bidding, although eventually, according to the ''Testament'', he was tempted into worshiping "false gods", such as [[Moloch]], [[Baal]], and [[Rapha (god)|Rapha]]. Subsequently, after losing favour with God, King Solomon wrote the work as a warning and a guide to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Christianity became the dominant faith of the [[Roman Empire]], the early Church frowned upon the propagation of books on magic, connecting it with [[paganism]], and [[book burning|burned books of magic]]. The [[New Testament]] records that after the unsuccessful exorcism by the seven sons of [[Sceva]] became known, many converts decided to [[Book burning at Ephesus|burn their own magic and pagan books]] in the city of [[Ephesus]]; this advice was adopted on a large scale after the Christian ascent to power.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:18-20)&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Christianisation, the Imperial Roman government had suppressed many pagan, Christian, philosophical, and divinatory texts that it viewed as threats to Roman authority, including those of the Greek mystic and mathematician [[Pythagoras]].

=== Medieval period ===
In the [[Medieval]] period, the production of grimoires continued in [[Christendom]], as well as amongst [[Jews]] and the followers of the newly founded [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. As the historian Owen Davies noted, "while the [Christian] Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it never managed to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religious devotion and magic."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:21-22)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such books on magic continued. In Christianised Europe, the Church divided books of magic into two kinds: those that dealt with "natural magic" and those that dealt in "demonic magic".&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"&gt;Davies (2009:22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The former was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by [[God]]; for instance, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] leechbooks, which contained simple spells for medicinal purposes, were tolerated. Demonic magic was not acceptable, because it was believed that such magic did not come from God, but from the [[Devil]] and his [[demons]]. These grimoires dealt in such topics as [[necromancy]], [[divination]] and [[demonology]].&lt;ref name="Davies 2009:22"/&gt; Despite this, "there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners, transcribers, and circulators of grimoires,"&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:36)&lt;/ref&gt; while several grimoires were attributed to [[Popes]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34-35)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|250px|An excerpt from ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'', featuring magical [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] (or סגולות, ''seguloth'', in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).]]
One such Arabic grimoire devoted to astral magic, the 12th-century ''Ghâyat al-Hakîm fi'l-sihr'', was later translated into Latin and circulated in Europe during the 13th century under the name of the ''[[Picatrix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:25-26)&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all such grimoires of this era were based upon Arabic sources. The 13th-century [[The Sworn Book of Honorius|''Sworn Book of Honorius'']], for instance, was (like the ancient ''Testament of Solomon'' before it) largely based on the supposed teachings of the Biblical king [[Solomon]] and included ideas such as prayers and a [[ritual circle]], with the [[mysticism|mystical]] purpose of having visions of God, [[Hell]], and [[Purgatory]] and gaining much wisdom and knowledge as a result. Another was the Hebrew ''[[Sefer Raziel Ha-Malakh]]'', translated in Europe as the ''Liber Razielis Archangeli''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:34)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later book also claiming to have been written by Solomon was originally written in Greek during the 15th century, where it was known as the ''[[Magical Treatise of Solomon]]'' or the ''Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy, Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon''. In the 16th century, this work had been translated into Latin and Italian, being renamed the ''Clavicula Salomonis'', or the ''[[Key of Solomon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:15)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom during the medieval age, grimoires were written that were attributed to other ancient figures, thereby supposedly giving them a sense of authenticity because of their antiquity. The German abbot and occultist [[Trithemius]] (1462–1516) supposedly had a ''Book of Simon the Magician'', based upon the New Testament figure of [[Simon Magus]]. Simon Magus had been a contemporary of [[Jesus Christ]]'s and, like the Biblical Jesus, had supposedly performed miracles, but had been demonized by the Medieval Church as a [[satanism|devil worshiper]] and evil individual.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, it was commonly believed by medieval people that other ancient figures, such as the poet [[Virgil]], astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and philosopher [[Aristotle]], had been involved in magic, and grimoires claiming to have been written by them were circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:24)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were those who did not believe this; for instance, the [[Franciscan]] friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1214–94) stated that books falsely claiming to be by ancient authors "ought to be prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:37)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
As the [[early modern period]] commenced in the late 15th century, many changes began to shock Europe that would have an effect on the production of grimoires. Historian Owen Davies classed the most important of these as the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]], the [[witch-hunt]]s and the advent of printing. The [[Renaissance]] saw the continuation of interest in magic that had been found in the Mediaeval period, and in this period, there was an increased interest in [[Hermeticism]] among [[occult]]ists and [[ceremonial magic]]ians in Europe, largely fueled by the 1471 translation of the ancient ''Corpus hermeticum'' into Latin by [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–99).

Alongside this, there was a rise in interest in the Jewish [[mysticism]] known as the [[Kabbalah]], which was spread across the continent by [[Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:46)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important magician of the Renaissance was [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535), who widely studied occult topics and earlier grimoires and eventually published his own, the ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'', in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47-48)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar figure was the Swiss magician known as [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), who published ''Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature'', in which he emphasised the distinction between good and bad magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:48)&lt;/ref&gt; A third such individual was [[Johann Georg Faust]], upon whom several pieces of later literature were written, such as [[Christopher Marlow]]e's ''Doctor [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Faust]]us'', that portrayed him as consulting with demons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:49-50)&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of [[demonology]] had remained strong in the Renaissance, and several demonological grimoires were published, including ''The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy'', which falsely claimed to having been authored by Agrippa,&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', which listed 69 demons. To counter this, the Roman Catholic Church authorised the production of many works of [[exorcism]], the rituals of which were often very similar to those of demonic conjuration.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:59-60)&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside these demonological works, grimoires on natural magic continued to be produced, including ''Magia naturalis'', written by [[Giambattista Della Porta]] (1535–1615).&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:57)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pentagram and human body (Agrippa).jpg|thumb|A man inscribed in a [[pentagram]], from [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (Eng., ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). The signs on the perimeter are [[astrology|astrological]].]]

The advent of [[printing]] in Europe meant that books could be mass-produced for the first time and could reach an ever-growing literate audience. Among the earliest books to be printed were magical texts. The ''nóminas'' were one example, consisting of prayers to the saints used as talismans.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:45)&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly in [[Protestant]] countries, such as Switzerland and the German states, which were not under the domination of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], where such grimoires were published.

Despite the advent of print, however, handwritten grimoires remained highly valued, as they were believed to contain inherent magical powers, and they continued to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:53-54)&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing availability, people lower down the social scale and women began to have access to books on magic; this was often incorporated into the popular [[folk magic]] of the average people and, in particular, that of the [[cunning folk]], who were professionally involved in folk magic.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:66-67)&lt;/ref&gt; These works left Europe and were imported to the parts of Latin America controlled by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires and the parts of North America controlled by the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:84-90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, the [[Inquisition]], a Roman Catholic organisation, had organised the mass suppression of peoples and beliefs that they considered [[heresy|heretical]]. In many cases, grimoires were found in the heretics' possessions and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:54-55)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1599, the church published the ''Indexes of Prohibited Books'', in which many grimoires were listed as forbidden, including several mediaeval ones, such as the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'', which were still popular.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:74)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christendom, there also began to develop a widespread fear of [[witchcraft]], which was believed to be [[Satanism|Satanic]] in nature. The subsequent hysteria, known as the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|Witch Hunt]], caused the death of around 40,000 people, most of whom were women.&lt;ref name="Patrick 2007 p. 802"&gt;{{cite book | last=Patrick | first=J. | title=Renaissance and Reformation | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7614-7650-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JDOVMDi8d4C&amp;pg=PA802 | accessdate=2017-05-07 | page=802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, those found with grimoires, particularly demonological ones, were prosecuted and dealt with as witches but, in most cases, those accused had no access to such books. Highly literate [[Iceland]] proved an exception to this, where a third of the 134 witch trials held involved people who had owned grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:70-73)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of [[the Enlightenment]], many European governments brought in laws prohibiting many superstitious beliefs in an attempt to bring an end to the Witch Hunt; this would invariably affect the release of grimoires.

Meanwhile, Hermeticism and the Kabbalah would influence the creation of a mystical philosophy known as [[Rosicrucianism]], which first appeared in the early 17th century, when two pamphlets detailing the existence of the mysterious Rosicrucian group were published in Germany. These claimed that Rosicrucianism had originated with a Medieval figure known as [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], who had founded the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross; however, there was no evidence for the existence of Rosenkreuz or the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2009:47)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

The 18th century saw the rise of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a movement devoted to [[science]] and [[rationalism]], predominantly amongst the ruling classes. However, amongst much of Europe, belief in magic and witchcraft persisted,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} as did the witch trials in certain{{which|date=August 2012}} areas. Governments tried to crack down on magicians and fortune tellers, particularly in France, where the police viewed them as social pests who took money from the gullible, often in a search for [[treasure]]. In doing so, they confiscated many grimoires.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:95-96)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new form of printing developed in France, the ''[[Bibliothèque bleue]]''. Many grimoires published through this circulated among an ever-growing percentage{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} of the populace, in particular the ''Grand Albert'', the ''[[Petit Albert]]'' (1782), the ''Grimoire du Pape Honorius'' and the ''[[Grimoire of Pope Leo|Enchiridion Leonis Papae]]''. The ''Petit Albert'' contained a wide variety of forms of magic, for instance, dealing in simple charms for ailments along with more complex things such as the instructions for making a [[Hand of Glory]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:98-101)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, following the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, a hugely influential grimoire was published under the title of the ''[[Grand Grimoire]]'', which was considered{{by whom|date=August 2012}} particularly powerful, because it involved conjuring and making a pact with the devil's chief minister, [[Lucifuge Rofocale|Lucifugé Rofocale]], to gain wealth from him. A new version of this grimoire was later published under the title of the ''Dragon rouge'' and was available for sale in many Parisian bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:101-104)&lt;/ref&gt; Similar books published in France at the time included the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' and the ''[[Grimoirium Verum]]''. The ''Black Pullet'', probably authored in late-18th-century Rome or France, differs from the typical grimoires in that it does not claim to be a manuscript from antiquity but told by a man who was a member of [[Napoleon]]'s armed expeditionary forces in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy |author=[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] |title=grimoire |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | year=2006 |isbn= 1-4381-3000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread availability of printed grimoires in France—despite the opposition of both the rationalists and the church—soon{{when|date=August 2012}} spread to neighbouring countries such as Spain and Germany. In Switzerland, [[Geneva]] was commonly associated with the occult at the time, particularly by Catholics, because it had been a stronghold of Protestantism. Many of those interested in the esoteric traveled from Roman Catholic nations to Switzerland to purchase grimoires or to study with occultists.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:109-110)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, grimoires appeared that involved Catholic saints; one example that appeared during the 19th century that became relatively popular, particularly in Spain, was the ''Libro de San Cipriano'', or ''The Book of St. Ciprian'', which falsely claimed to date from c.&amp;nbsp;1000. Like most grimoires of this period, it dealt with (among other things) how to discover treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:114-115)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sixthandseventhbooks frontpiece 1880.png|thumb|The title page of the 1880 New York edition of ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses''.]]

In Germany, with the increased interest in [[folklore]] during the 19th century, many historians took an interest in magic and in grimoires. Several published extracts of such grimoires in their own books on the history of magic, thereby helping to further propagate them. Perhaps the most notable of these was the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst (1779–1832), who from 1821 to 1826, published a six-volume collection of magical texts in which he studied grimoires as a peculiarity of the Mediaeval mindset.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:121-122)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar of the time interested in grimoires, the antiquarian bookseller Johann Scheible, first published the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'', two influential magical texts that claimed to have been written by the ancient Jewish figure [[Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses'' were among the works that later spread to the countries of [[Scandinavia]], where, in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], grimoires were known as [[Cyprianus|black books]] and were commonly found among members of the army.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:134-136)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, new grimoires continued to be produced throughout the 18th century, such as [[Ebenezer Sibly]]'s ''A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology''. In the last decades of that century, London experienced a revival of interest in the occult that was further propagated when [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] published ''[[The Magus (book)|The Magus]]'' in 1801. ''The Magus'' contained many things taken from older grimoires, particularly those of Cornelius Agrippa, and while not achieving initial popularity upon release, gradually became an influential text.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:123-124)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Barrett's pupils, John Parkin, created his own handwritten grimoire, ''The Grand Oracle of Heaven, or, The Art of Divine Magic'', although it was never published, largely because Britain [[Napoleonic wars|was at war with France]], and grimoires were commonly associated with the French. The only writer to publish British grimoires widely in the early 19th century, Robert Cross Smith, released ''The Philosophical Merlin'' (1822) and ''The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century'' (1825), but neither sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2007:135-137)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, several of these texts (including ''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'' and the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'') were reclaimed by para-[[Masonic]] magical organisations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
''[[The Secret Grimoire of Turiel]]'' claims to have been written in the 16th century, but no copy older than 1927 has been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malchus |first= Marius |title= The Secret Grimoire of Turiel |publisher= Theophania Publishing |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-926842-80-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern grimoire, the ''[[Simon Necronomicon]]'', takes its name from a fictional book of magic in the stories of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]], inspired by [[Babylonian mythology]] and by the "[[Ars Goetia]]", a section in the ''Lesser Key of Solomon'' that concerns the summoning of demons. The ''Azoëtia'' of [[Andrew D. Chumbley]] has been described by Gavin Semple as a modern grimoire.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Gavin (1994) 'The Azoëtia - reviewed by Gavin Semple', ''Starfire'' Vol. I, No. 2, 1994, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] publicly appeared in the 1940s, and [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] introduced the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'' as a Wiccan grimoire.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite journal |title= Owen Davies's top 10 grimoires  |journal= [[The Guardian]]  |date= 4 April 2008|last= Davies |first= Owen |authorlink= Owen Davies (historian) |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/08/history |accessdate= 2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]], headmaster of the [[Grey School of Wizardry]], wrote and compiled the school's ''Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page, 2004) and the sequel ''Companion for the Apprentice Wizard'' (New Page 2006).&lt;ref name=Myash2011&gt;

The term grimoire commonly serves as an alternative name for a spell book or tome of magical knowledge in [[fantasy fiction]] and [[role-playing games]]. The most famous fictional grimoire is the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', a creation of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

[[File:Emblemata 1624.jpg|thumb|275px|Early depiction of a "Dutch telescope" from 1624.]]

The earliest known [[telescope]] appeared in 1608 in the [[Netherlands]] when an [[eyeglass]] maker named [[Hans Lippershey]] tried to obtain a patent on one. Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the new invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early [[refracting telescope]]s consisted of a convex [[Objective (optics)|objective]] lens and a concave [[eyepiece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, [[Johannes Kepler]] described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a convex objective lens and a convex eyepiece lens and by 1655 astronomers such as [[Christiaan Huygens]] were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of the telescope'' Henry C. King, Harold Spencer Jones Publisher Courier Dover Publications {{ISBN|0-486-43265-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] is credited with building the first reflector in 1668 with a design that incorporated a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect the light to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. [[Laurent Cassegrain]] in 1672 described the design of a reflector with a small convex secondary mirror to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

The [[achromatic lens]], which greatly reduced color aberrations in objective lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, first appeared in a 1733 telescope made by [[Chester Moore Hall]], who did not publicize it. [[John Dollond]] learned of Hall's invention&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, D. J.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=97m3IxXmT-oC&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Optical anecdotes]', pp.40-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ray N.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=PuN7l2A2uzQC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Reflecting Telescope Optics: Basic design theory and its historical development]', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.

Important developments in reflecting telescopes were [[John Hadley]]'s production of larger [[paraboloid]]al mirrors in 1721; the process of [[silvering]] glass mirrors introduced by [[Léon Foucault]] in 1857;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/inventorbios/39/Jean-Bernard-L-on-Foucault.html |title=Inventor Biographies – Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault Biography (1819–1868) |publisher=madehow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the adoption of long-lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/astronomy/features/amateur/files/p28-4.pdf |title=Bakich sample pages Chapter 2 |page=3 |quote=John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, was one of the first to coat a mirror with aluminum. He did it by thermal vacuum evaporation. The first mirror he aluminized, in 1932, is the earliest known example of a telescope mirror coated by this technique. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ritchey-Chretien]] variant of [[Cassegrain reflector]] was invented around 1910, but not widely adopted until after 1950; many modern telescopes including the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] use this design, which gives a wider field of view than a classic Cassegrain.

During the period 1850–1900, reflectors suffered from problems with speculum metal mirrors, and a considerable number of "Great Refractors" were built from 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 metre aperture, culminating in the [[Yerkes Observatory]] refractor in 1897; however, starting from the early 1900s a series of ever-larger reflectors with glass mirrors were built, including the Mount Wilson 60-inch (1.5 metre), the 100-inch (2.5 metre) [[Hooker Telescope]] (1917) and the 200-inch (5 metre) [[Hale telescope]] (1948); essentially all major research telescopes since 1900 have been reflectors. A number of 4-metre class (160 inch) telescopes were built on superior higher altitude sites including Hawaii and the Chilean desert in the 1975–1985 era. The development of the computer-controlled [[alt-azimuth mount]] in the 1970s and [[active optics]] in the 1980s enabled a new generation of even larger telescopes, starting with the 10-metre (400 inch) [[Keck telescopes]] in 1993/1996, and a number of 8-metre telescopes including the [[ESO]] [[Very Large Telescope]], [[Gemini Observatory]] and [[Subaru Telescope]].

The era of [[radio telescope]]s (along with [[radio astronomy]]) was born with [[Karl Guthe Jansky]]'s [[Serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery of an astronomical radio source in 1931. Many types of telescopes were developed in the 20th century for a wide range of wavelengths from radio to [[gamma-ray telescope|gamma-rays]].  The development of [[space observatories]] after 1960 allowed access
to several bands impossible to observe from the ground, including [[X-rays]] and longer wavelength [[infrared]] bands.

===Invention===
[[File:Lipperhey.jpg|thumb|left|Notes on Hans Lipperhey's unsuccessfully requested a patent on the telescope in 1608]]

The first record of a telescope comes from the Netherlands in 1608. It is in a patent filed by [[Middelburg]] spectacle-maker [[Hans Lippershey]] with the [[States General of the Netherlands]] on 2 October 1608 for his instrument "''for seeing things far away as if they were nearby''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES]&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later another Dutch instrument-maker, [[Jacob Metius]] also applied for a patent. The States General did not award a patent since the knowledge of the device already seemed to be ubiquitous&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES "''The request however was turned down, also because other spectacle-makers had made similar claims at the same time''."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg'' [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Dutch [[government]] awarded Lippershey with a contract for copies of his [[design]].

The original Dutch telescopes were composed of a [[Biconcave|convex]] and a [[Biconcave lens|concave lens]]—telescopes that are constructed this way do not invert the image. Lippershey's original design had only 3x [[magnification]]. Telescopes seem to have been made in the Netherlands in considerable numbers soon after this date of "invention", and rapidly found their way all over Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==== Claims of prior invention ====
[[File:Jaansen Microscope.jpg|thumbnail|right|Reproduction of one of the four optical devices that Zacharias Snijder in 1841 claimed were early telescopes built by [[Zacharias Janssen]]. Its actual function and creator has been disputed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch biologist and naturalist [[Pieter Harting]] claimed in 1858 that this shorter tube was an early microscope which he also attributed to Janssen, perpetuating the ''Janssen'' claim to both devices.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Telescope p.32-36"/&gt;]]

In 1655 Dutch diplomat [[Willem Boreel|William de Boreel]] tried to solve the mystery of who invented the telescope. He had a local magistrate in Middelburg follow up on Boreel's childhood and early adult recollections of a spectacle maker named "Hans" who he remembered as the inventor of the telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father, [[Zacharias Janssen]] invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias and his father, Hans Martens, must have been who he remembered.&lt;ref name="HeldenDupré2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of another spectacle maker, [[Hans Lippershey]], was adopted by [[Pierre Borel]] in his 1656 book ''De vero telescopii inventore''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Henry C.

In 1682,&lt;ref&gt;July 26, 1682&lt;/ref&gt; the minutes of the [[Royal Society]] in London [[Robert Hooke]] noted [[Thomas Digges]]' 1571 ''Pantometria'', (a book on measurement, partially based on his father [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]' notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to the invention of the telescope, describing Leonard as having a ''fare seeing glass'' in the mid 1500s based on an idea by [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter D.

Comments on the use of proportional or "perspective glass" are also made in the writings of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (1575) and  [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] (1585).&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. King, The History of the Telescope, Courier Corporation - 1955, page 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by [[Queen Elizabeth I]]'s chief advisor [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]].

A 1959 research paper by Simon de Guilleuma claimed that evidence he had uncovered pointed to the French born spectacle maker [[Juan Roget]] (died before 1624) as another possible builder of an early telescope that predated Hans Lipperhey's patent application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7617426.stm|title=Controversy over telescope origin|publisher=BBC News|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; inventing early telescope-like devices.

==== Spread through Europe ====
Lippershey's application for a patent was mentioned at the end of a diplomatic report on an embassy to Holland from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] sent by the Siamese king [[Ekathotsarot]]: ''Ambassades du Roy de Siam envoyé à l'Excellence du Prince Maurice, arrivé à La Haye le 10 Septemb. 1608'' (''Embassy of the King of Siam sent to his Excellency Prince Maurice, arrived at The Hague on 10 September 1608''). This report was issued in October 1608 and distributed across Europe, leading to experiments by other scientists, such as the Italian [[Paolo Sarpi]], who received the report in November, and the English mathematician and astronomer [[Thomas Harriot]], who used a six-powered telescope by the summer of 1609 to observe features on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |title=Old Moon Map Corrects History |publisher=News.aol.com |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119004546/http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo Donato.jpg|thumb|left|200px|19th-century painting depicting [[Galileo Galilei]] displaying his [[telescope]] to [[Leonardo Donato]] in 1609.]]

The Italian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] was in [[Venice]] in June 1609&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OwOlRPbrZeQC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=Galileo++happened+to+be+in+Venice+Dutch+telescope |title=Galileo at Work |author=Stillman Drake |page=137 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-02-20 |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-486-49542-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there heard of the "Dutch perspective glass" by means of which distant objects appeared nearer and larger. Galileo states that he solved the problem of the construction of a telescope the first night after his return to [[Padua]] from Venice and made his first telescope the next day by fitting a convex lens in one extremity of a leaden tube and a concave lens in the other one. A few days afterwards, having succeeded in making a better telescope than the first, he took it to Venice where he communicated the details of his invention to the public and presented the instrument itself to the [[Doge of Venice|doge]] [[Leonardo Donato]], who was sitting in full council. The [[senate]] in return settled him for life in his lectureship at Padua and doubled his salary.

[[File:Galileo-picture.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Galileo Galilei]].]]

Galileo spent his time to improving the telescope, producing telescopes of increased power. His first telescope had a 3x magnification, but he soon made instruments which magnified 8x and finally, one nearly a meter long with a 37mm objective (which he would stop down to 16mm or 12mm) and a 23x magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Quinn, Stargazing with Early Astronomer Galileo Galilei, Sky &amp; Telescope, July 31, 2008 [http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/stargazing-with-galileo/]&lt;/ref&gt; With this last instrument he began a series of astronomical observations in October or November 1609, discovering the [[Galilean moon|satellites]] of [[Jupiter]], hills and valleys on the [[Moon]], the phases of [[Venus]]&lt;ref name=palmieri&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmieri |first1=Paolo |title=Galileo and the discovery of the phases of Venus |journal=[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]] |date=2001 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=109–129 |bibcode=2001JHA....32..109P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observed [[sunspot|spots on the sun]] (using the projection method rather than direct observation). Galileo noted that the revolution of the satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, rotation of the [[Sun]] and the tilted path its spots followed for part of the year pointed to the validity of the sun-centered [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] over other [[Geocentric model|Earth-centered systems]] such as the one proposed by [[Ptolemy]]. Galileo's instrument was the first to be given the name "telescope". The name was invented by the Greek poet/theologian [[Giovanni Demisiani]] at a banquet held on April 14, 1611 by Prince [[Federico Cesi]] to make [[Galileo Galilei]] a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Edward, ''The Naming of the Telescope'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; The word was created from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tele'' = 'far' and ''skopein'' = 'to look or see'; ''teleskopos'' = 'far-seeing'.

These observations, together with Galileo's improvement of the instrument, led to the adoption of the name of the [[Galilean telescope]] for these early forms of telescope that employed a [[negative lens]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;This paragraph is adapted from the 1888 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further refinements ===
==== Refracting telescopes ====
[[Johannes Kepler]] first explained the theory and some of the practical advantages of a telescope constructed of two convex lenses in his ''Catoptrics'' (1611). The first person who actually constructed a telescope of this form was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Christoph Scheiner]] who gives a description of it in his ''Rosa Ursina'' (1630).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

[[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] was the first who commanded a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common [[focal plane]] of the objective and the eyepiece. This led to his invention of the [[micrometer]], and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not till about the middle of the 17th century that Kepler's telescope came into general use: not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its [[field of view]] was much larger than in the [[Galilean telescope]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The first powerful telescopes of Keplerian construction were made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] after much labor—in which his brother assisted him. With one of these: an objective diameter of {{convert|2.24|in|mm}} and a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/bigtel/LargestTelescope.html |title=Largest optical telescopes of the world |author=Paul Schlyter |publisher=Stjarnhimlen.se |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discovered the brightest of Saturn's satellites ([[Titan (moon)|Titan]]) in 1655; in 1659, he published his "''Systema Saturnium''" which, for the first time, gave a true explanation of Saturn's [[planetary ring|ring]]—founded on observations made with the same instrument.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===== Long focal length refractors =====
[[File:Houghton Typ 620.73.451 - Johannes Hevelius, Machinae coelestis, 1673.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut illustration of a {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} focal length Keplerian astronomical refracting telescope built by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. From his book, "''Machina coelestis''" (first part), published in 1673.]]

The [[sharpness (visual)|sharpness]] of the image in Kepler's telescope was limited by the [[chromatic aberration]] introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of the objective lens. The only way to overcome this limitation at high magnifying powers was to create objectives with very long focal lengths. [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] discovered [[Saturn's]] fifth satellite ([[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]]) in 1672 with a telescope {{convert|35|ft|m}} long. Astronomers such as [[Johannes Hevelius]] were constructing telescopes with focal lengths as long as {{convert|150|ft|m}}. Besides having really long tubes these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's frame "tube" flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.&lt;ref name="AIP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartage"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |publisher=Cartage |work=History of Telescopes |title=How Telescopes Improved |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311032203/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |archivedate=2009-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Aerial telescopes =====
{{Main|Aerial telescope}}
In some of the very long refracting telescopes constructed after 1675, no tube was employed at all. The objective was mounted on a swiveling ball-joint on top of a pole, tree, or any available tall structure and aimed by means of string or connecting rod. The eyepiece was handheld or mounted on a stand at the focus, and the image was found by trial and error. These were consequently termed [[aerial telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga/astronomyclubaugusta/History/telescope.html |title=The Telescope |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been attributed to [[Christiaan Huygens]] and his brother [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/tools/tools-first-telescopes.htm | work = Cosmic Journey: A History of Scientific Cosmology | title = The First Telescopes | publisher = Center for History of Physics, a Division of the American Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Christiaan+Huygens+Aerial+telescope | title = The history of the telescope | first = Henry C. | last = King | year = 2003 | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | isbn = 978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear that they invented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://archive.org/stream/christianhuygens029504mbp/christianhuygens029504mbp_djvu.txt | first = A.

Telescopes of such great length were naturally difficult to use and must have taxed to the utmost the skill and patience of the observers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Aerial telescopes were employed by several other astronomers. Cassini discovered Saturn's third and fourth satellites in 1684 with aerial telescope objectives made by [[Giuseppe Campani]] that were {{convert|100|and|136|ft|m|abbr=on}} in focal length.

==== Reflecting telescopes ====
{{See also|Reflecting telescope}}

The ability of a [[curved mirror]] to form an image may have been known since the time of [[Euclid]]&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Euclid'' by J. B. Calvert, 2000 [http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/classics/nugreek/contents.htm Duke U.] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and had been extensively studied by [[Alhazen]] in the 11th century. Galileo, [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]], and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins#PPA108,M1 |title=Stargazer |author=Fred Watson |page=108 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-1-74176-392-8 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Zucchi]], an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book ''Optica philosophia'' of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Niccol%C3%B2+Zucchi#PPA109,M1 |title=Stargazer |author=Fred Watson |page=109 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-1-74176-392-8 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope gregory.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Gregorian telescope]].]]

In 1636 [[Marin Mersenne]] proposed a telescope consisting of a paraboloidal primary mirror and a paraboloidal secondary mirror bouncing the image through a hole in the primary, solving the problem of viewing the image.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4-GErgSbU0C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Marin+Mersenne+reflecting+telescope&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GGocBEbf9P&amp;sig=Bmk8GLC46HdSoeYKq6wyz3jaoZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA88,M1] ''[[Mirror Mirror: A History of the Human Love Affair With Reflection]]'' by [[Mark Pendergrast]] Page 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] went into further detail in his book ''Optica Promota'' (1663), pointing out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was shaped like the part of a [[conic section]], would correct [[spherical aberration]] as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refractors. The design he came up with bears his name: the "[[Gregorian telescope]]"; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas and after some fruitless attempts, was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope into practical use.

[[File:LaNature1873 coupe telescope foucault.png|thumb|right|350px|Light path in a [[Newtonian telescope]].]]

[[File:NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg|thumb|A replica of Newton's second reflecting telescope which was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;dq=history+of+the+telescope&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA74,M1 |title=The History of the Telescope |author=Henry C.

In 1666 [[Isaac Newton]], based on his theories of refraction and color, perceived that the faults of the refracting telescope were due more to a lens's varying refraction of light of different colors than to a lens's imperfect shape. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations, although he incorrectly concluded from some rough experiments&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Optics'', bk. i. pt. ii. prop. 3&lt;/ref&gt; that ''all'' refracting substances would diverge the prismatic colors in a constant proportion to their mean refraction. From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on Optics'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's experiments with mirrors showed that they did not suffer from the chromatic errors of lenses, for all colors of light the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] reflected in a mirror was equal to the [[angle of reflection]], so as a proof to his theories Newton set out to build a reflecting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=Isaac+Newton+demonstration+reflecting+telescope+in#PPA168,M1 |title=Isaac Newton By Michael White |page=170 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-7382-0143-6 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton completed his [[Newton's Reflector|first telescope]] in 1668 and it is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.&lt;ref name="mymathdone.com"&gt;[http://www.mymathdone.com/isaac-newton-adventurer-in-thought/ '''Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought''', by Alfred Rupert Hall, page 67]&lt;/ref&gt;  After much experiment, he chose an [[alloy]] ([[speculum metal]]) of [[tin]] and [[copper]] as the most suitable material for his [[Objective (optics)|objective]]  mirror. He later devised means for grinding and polishing them, but chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a "''Newtonian telescope''", a secondary "diagonal" mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an [[eyepiece]] mounted on the side of the telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, [[Telescope mount|mount]], and fittings. Newton's first compact reflecting telescope had a mirror diameter of 1.3&amp;nbsp;inches and a [[F-number#Focal ratio in telescopes|focal ratio]] of f/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telescope-optics.net/reflecting.htm |title=Reflecting telescopes: Newtonian, two- and three-mirror systems |publisher=Telescope-optics.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With it he found that he could see the four [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] and the [[Venus#Observation|crescent phase of the planet Venus]]. Encouraged by this success, he made a second telescope with a magnifying power of 38x which he presented to the [[Royal Society of London]] in December 1672. This type of telescope is still called a [[Newtonian telescope]].

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope cassegrain.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Cassegrain telescope]].]]

A third form of reflecting telescope, the "[[Cassegrain reflector]]" was devised in 1672 by [[Laurent Cassegrain]]. The telescope had a small convex [[hyperboloid]]al secondary mirror placed near the prime focus to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

No further practical advance appears to have been made in the design or construction of the reflecting telescopes for another 50 years until [[John Hadley]] (best known as the inventor of the [[octant (instrument)|octant]]) developed ways to make precision aspheric and [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] speculum metal mirrors. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian reflector to the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/explorations//groundup/lesson/scopes/hadley/index.php |title=Hadley’s Reflector |publisher=amazing-space.stsci.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter, {{convert|62+3/4|in|cm|adj=on}} focal length speculum metal objective mirror. The instrument was examined by [[James Pound]] and [[James Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;Pound reported upon it in ''Phil. Trans.'', 1723, No. 378, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; After remarking that Newton's telescope had lain neglected for fifty years, they stated that Hadley had sufficiently shown that the invention did not consist in bare theory. They compared its performance with that of a {{convert|7.5|in|mm}} diameter aerial telescope originally presented to the Royal Society by Constantijn Huygens, Jr. and found that Hadley's reflector, "will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the latter with its due charge", and that it represents objects as distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright.

Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]], having been instructed by Hadley in his methods of polishing speculum metal, succeeded in producing large reflecting telescopes of their own, one of which had a focal length of {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}}. These methods of fabricating mirrors were passed on by Molyneux to two London opticians —Scarlet and Hearn— who started a business manufacturing telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert, ''Compleat system of opticks in four books'', bk, iii. ch. I. (Cambridge, 1738)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British mathematician, optician [[James Short (mathematician)|James Short]] began experimenting with building telescopes based on Gregory's designs in the 1730s. He first tried making his mirrors out of glass as suggested by Gregory, but he later switched to speculum metal mirrors creating Gregorian telescopes with original designers [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] and [[elliptic]] figures. Short then adopted telescope-making as his profession which he practised first in Edinburgh, and afterward in London. All Short's telescopes were of the Gregorian form. Short died in London in 1768, having made a considerable fortune selling telescopes.

Since speculum metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors greatly reduced the light that reached the eyepiece, several reflecting telescope designers tried to do away with them. In 1762 [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] presented a reflecting telescope before the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted at the front of the telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by [[William Herschel]].&lt;ref&gt;"On an optic pipe improvement" — Lomonosov M.V.

About the year 1774 William Herschel (then a teacher of music in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]]) began to occupy his leisure hours with the construction of reflector telescope mirrors, finally devoted himself entirely to their construction and use in astronomical research. In 1778, he selected a {{convert|6+1/4|in|cm|adj=on}} reflector mirror (the best of some 400 telescope mirrors which he had made) and with it, built a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} focal length telescope. Using this telescope, he made his early brilliant astronomical discoveries. In 1783, Herschel completed a reflector of approximately {{convert|18|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length. He observed the heavens with this telescope for some twenty years, replacing the mirror several times. In 1789 Herschel finished building his largest reflecting telescope with a mirror of {{convert|49|in|cm}} and a focal length of {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}, (commonly known as his [[40-foot telescope]]) at his new home, at [[Observatory House]] in [[Slough]], England. To cut down on the light loss from the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This design has come to be called the [[Reflecting telescope#Reflecting telescope designs|Herschelian telescope]]. He discovered Saturn's sixth known moon, [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], the first night he used it (August 28, 1789), and on September 17, its seventh known moon, Mimas. This telescope was world's largest telescope for over 50 years. However, this large scope was difficult to handle and thus less used than his favorite 18.7-inch reflector.

In 1845 [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] built his {{convert|72|in|cm|adj=on}} Newtonian reflector called the "[[Leviathan of Parsonstown]]" with which he discovered the spiral form of [[galaxies]].

All of these larger reflectors suffered from the poor reflectivity and fast tarnishing nature of their speculum metal mirrors. This meant they need more than one mirror per telescope since mirrors had to be frequently removed and re-polished. This was time consuming since the polishing process could change the curve of the mirror so it usually had to be "[[Figuring|re-figured]]" to the correct shape.

==== Achromatic refracting telescopes ====
{{See also|Achromatic lens}}
[[File:Achromat doublet en.svg|thumb|Light path through an [[achromatic lens]].]]

From the time of the invention of the first refracting telescopes it was generally supposed that chromatic errors seen in lenses simply arose from errors in the spherical figure of their surfaces. Opticians tried to construct lenses of varying forms of curvature to correct these errors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Isaac Newton discovered in 1666 that chromatic colors actually arose from the un-even refraction of light as it passed through the glass medium. This led opticians to experiment with lenses constructed of more than one type of glass in an attempt to canceling the errors produced by each type of glass. It was hoped that this would create an "[[achromatic lens]]"; a lens that would focus all colors to a single point, and produce instruments of much shorter focal length.

The first person who succeeded in making a practical achromatic refracting telescope was [[Chester Moore Hall]] from [[Essex, England]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He argued that the different humours of the human eye refract rays of light to produce an image on the [[retina]] which is free from color, and he reasonably argued that it might be possible to produce a like result by combining lenses composed of different refracting media. After devoting some time to the inquiry he found that by combining two lenses formed of different kinds of glass, he could make an achromatic lens where the effects of the unequal refractions of two colors of light (red and blue) was corrected. In 1733, he succeeded in constructing telescope lenses which exhibited much reduced [[chromatic aberration]]. One of his instruments had an objective measuring {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}} with a relatively short focal length of {{convert|20|in|cm}}.

Hall was a man of independent means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to [[John Dollond]] (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by [[Lord Mansfield]] that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.

In 1747, [[Leonhard Euler]] sent to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] a paper in which he tried to prove the possibility of correcting both the chromatic and the spherical aberration of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, it should be possible by suitable combinations of lenses of different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope [[Objective (optics)|objective]]. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic objective composed of lenses of glass and water.

All of Euler's efforts to produce an actual objective of this construction were fruitless—a failure which he attributed solely to the difficulty of procuring lenses that worked precisely to the requisite curves.&lt;ref&gt;''Mem. Acad. Berlin'', 1753.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dollond]] agreed with the accuracy of Euler's analysis, but disputed his hypothesis on the grounds that it was purely a theoretical assumption: that the theory was opposed to the results of Newton's [[Scientific method|experiments]] on the refraction of light, and that it was impossible to determine a [[physical law]] from analytical reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1753, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, Euler sent to the Berlin Academy a further paper in which starting from the hypothesis that light consists of vibrations excited in an elastic fluid by luminous bodies—and that the difference of color of light is due to the greater or lesser [[electromagnetic spectrum|frequency]] of these vibrations in a given time— he deduced his previous results. He did not doubt the accuracy of Newton's experiments quoted by Dollond.

Dollond did not reply to this, but soon afterwards he received an abstract of a paper by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] mathematician and astronomer, [[Samuel Klingenstierna]], which led him to doubt the accuracy of the results deduced by Newton on the dispersion of refracted light. Klingenstierna showed from purely geometrical considerations (fully appreciated by Dollond) that the results of Newton's experiments could not be brought into harmony with other universally accepted facts of refraction.

[[File:Göttingen-Dollond-Teleskop.JPG|thumb|right|Dollond telescope.]]

As a practical man, Dollond at once put his doubts to the test of experiment: he confirmed the conclusions of Klingenstierna, discovered a difference far beyond his hopes in the refractive qualities of different kinds of glass with respect to the [[refraction|divergence]] of colors, and was thus rapidly led to the construction of lenses in which first the chromatic aberration—and afterwards—the spherical aberration were corrected.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1758, p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

Dollond was aware of the conditions necessary for the attainment of achromatism in refracting telescopes, but relied on the accuracy of experiments made by Newton. His writings show that with the exception of his [[Courage|bravado]], he would have arrived sooner at a discovery for which his mind was fully prepared. Dollond's paper&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; recounts the successive steps by which he arrived at his discovery independently of Hall's earlier invention—and the logical processes by which these steps were suggested to his mind.

In 1765 Peter Dollond (son of John Dollond) introduced the triple objective, which consisted of a combination of two convex lenses of crown glass with a concave [[Flint glass|flint]] lens between them. He made many telescopes of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The difficulty of procuring disks of glass (especially of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the diameter and light gathering power of the lenses found in the achromatic telescope. It was in vain that the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered prizes for large perfect disks of optical flint glass.

The difficulties with the impractical metal mirrors of reflecting telescopes led to the construction of large refracting telescopes. By 1866 refracting telescopes had reached {{convert|18|in|cm}} in aperture with many larger "''[[Great refractor]]s''" being built in the mid to late 19th century. In 1897, the refractor reached its maximum practical limit in a research telescope with the construction of the [[Yerkes Observatory]]s' {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=on}} refractor (although a larger refractor [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]] with an objective of {{convert|49.2|in|m}} diameter was temporarily exhibited at the [[Paris 1900 Exposition]]). No larger refractors could be built because of [[gravity]]'s effect on the lens. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OJclbOHqrD0C&amp;pg=PT532&amp;lpg=PT532&amp;dq=the+largest+telescope+lens+sag |title=Physics Demystified |author=Stan Gibilisco |isbn=0-07-138201-1 |page=515 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2002-08-01|accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large reflecting telescopes ===
{{See also|List of largest optical telescopes historically}}
[[File:Palomar arp 600pix.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|200|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]]]]

In 1856–57, [[Karl August von Steinheil]] and [[Léon Foucault]] introduced a process of depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors, it had the advantage of being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built.

The beginning of the 20th century saw construction of the first of the "modern" large research reflectors, designed for precision photographic imaging and located at remote high altitude clear sky locations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |title=Building the 60-inch Telescope |author=Mike Simmons |origyear=Written in 1984 |date=2008&lt;!--Updated in--&gt; |publisher=Mtwilson.edu |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805001558/http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |archivedate=2013-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[60-inch Hale telescope]] of 1908, and the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] in 1917, both located at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=1956ASPL....7..249P |title=Pettit, E., Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets, Vol. 7 |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |volume=7 |page=249 |publisher=Articles.adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |author1=Pettit |first1=Edison |year=1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other telescopes of this size had to have provisions to allow for the removal of their main mirrors for re-silvering every few months. John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the [[California Institute of Technology]], developed a technique for coating a mirror with a much longer lasting aluminum coating using thermal [[vacuum evaporation]]. In 1932, he became the first person to "aluminize" a mirror; three years later the {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} telescopes became the first large astronomical telescopes to have their mirrors aluminized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |title=New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology - "Resurfacing the {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} Telescope" by George Zamora |publisher=nmt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013030537/http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1948 saw the completion of the {{convert|200|in|cm|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope|Hale reflector]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]] which was the largest telescope in the world up until the completion of the massive {{convert|605|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[BTA-6]] in Russia twenty-seven years later. The Hale reflector introduced several technical innovations used in future telescopes, including [[hydrostatic bearings]] for very low friction, the [[Serrurier truss]] for equal deflections of the two mirrors as the tube sags under gravity, and the use of [[Pyrex]] low-expansion glass for the mirrors. The arrival of substantially larger telescopes had to await the introduction of methods other than the rigidity of glass to maintain the proper shape of the mirror.

==== Active and adaptive optics ====
{{See also|Adaptive optics|List of largest optical reflecting telescopes}}

The 1980s saw the introduction of two new technologies for building larger telescopes and improving image quality,
known as [[active optics]] and [[adaptive optics]]. In active optics, an image analyser senses the aberrations of a star image
a few times per minute, and a computer adjusts many support forces on the primary mirror and the location of the secondary mirror
to maintain the optics in optimal shape and alignment. This is too slow to correct for atmospheric blurring effects, but enables the use of thin single mirrors up to 8&amp;nbsp;m diameter, or even larger segmented mirrors. This method was pioneered by the ESO [[New Technology Telescope]] in the late 1980s.

The 1990s saw a new generation of giant telescopes appear using active optics, beginning with the construction of the first of the two {{convert|10|m|in|abbr=on}} [[Keck telescope]]s in 1993. Other giant telescopes built since then include: the two [[Gemini telescope]]s, the four separate telescopes of the [[Very Large Telescope]], and the [[Large Binocular Telescope]].

[[File:ESO Very Large Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] boasts advanced [[adaptive optics]] systems, which counteract the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere.]]

Adaptive optics uses a similar principle, but applying corrections several hundred times per second to
compensate the effects of rapidly changing optical distortion due to the motion of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and then compensating for them by rapid changes of [[actuator]]s applied to a small deformable mirror or with a [[liquid crystal]] array filter. AO was first envisioned by [[Horace W. Babcock]] in 1953, but did not come into common usage in astronomical telescopes until advances in computer and detector technology during the 1990s made it possible to calculate the compensation needed in [[Real-time computing|real time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Telescopes Have Grown from Huge to Humongous [Slide Show]|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/telescopes-have-grown-from-huge-to-humongous-slide-show/|website = www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adaptive optics, the high-speed corrections needed mean that a fairly bright star is needed very close to the target of interest (or an artificial star is created by a laser). Also, with a single star or laser the corrections are only effective over a very narrow field (tens of arcsec), and current systems operating on several 8-10m telescopes work mainly in near-infrared wavelengths for single-object observations.

Developments of adaptive optics include systems with multiple lasers over a wider corrected field, and/or working above kiloHertz rates for good correction at visible wavelengths; these are currently in progress but not yet in routine operation as of 2015.

== Other wavelengths ==
The twentieth century saw the construction of telescopes which could produce images using wavelengths other than [[visible light]] starting in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered astronomical objects gave off radio emissions; this prompted a new era of observational astronomy after World War II, with telescopes being developed for other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from radio to [[gamma-rays]].

=== Radio telescopes ===
{{See also|Radio telescope|Radio astronomy}}
[[File:Lovell Telescope 2.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} Lovell radio telescope at [[Jodrell Bank]] Observatory.]]

Radio astronomy began in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered that the [[Milky Way]] was a source of radio emission while doing research on terrestrial static with a direction antenna. Building on Jansky's work, [[Grote Reber]] built a more sophisticated purpose-built radio telescope in 1937, with a {{convert|31.4|ft|m|adj=on}} dish; using this, he discovered various unexplained radio sources in the sky. Interest in radio astronomy grew after the Second World War when much larger dishes were built including: the {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Jodrell bank]] telescope (1957), the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Green Bank Telescope]] (1962), and the {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Effelsberg]] telescope (1971). The huge {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Arecibo telescope]] (1963) is so large that it is fixed into a natural depression in the ground; the central antenna can be steered to allow the telescope to study objects up to twenty degrees from the [[zenith]]. However, not every radio telescope is of the dish type. For example, the [[Mills Cross Telescope]] (1954) was an early example of an array which used two perpendicular lines of antennae {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in length to survey the sky.

High-energy radio waves are known as [[microwaves]] and this has been an important area of astronomy ever since the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964. Many ground-based [[radio telescopes]] can study microwaves. Short wavelength microwaves are best studied from space because water vapor (even at high altitudes) strongly weakens the signal. The [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (1989) revolutionized the study of the microwave background radiation.

Because radio telescopes have low resolution, they were the first instruments to use [[interferometry]] allowing two or more widely separated instruments to simultaneously observe the same source. [[Very long baseline interferometry]] extended the technique over thousands of kilometers and allowed resolutions down to a few [[arcseconds|milli-arcseconds]].

A telescope like the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (active since 2006) observes from {{convert|0.85|to|4|mm|um|abbr=on}}, bridging between the far-infrared/[[submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter telescopes]] and longer wavelength radio telescopes including the microwave band from about {{convert|1|mm|um|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|mm|m|abbr=on}} in wavelength.

=== Infrared telescopes (700 nm/ 0.7 µm – 1000 µm/1 mm) ===
{{See also|Infrared telescope|Infrared astronomy|Far-infrared astronomy}}
Although most [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, infrared astronomy at certain wavelengths can be conducted on high mountains where there is little absorption by atmospheric [[water vapor]]. Ever since suitable detectors became available, most optical telescopes at high-altitudes have been able to image at infrared wavelengths. Some telescopes such as the {{convert|3.8|m|in|adj=on}} [[UKIRT]], and the {{convert|3|m|in|adj=on}} [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility|IRTF]] — both on [[Mauna Kea]] — are dedicated infrared telescopes. The launch of the [[IRAS]] satellite in 1983 revolutionized infrared astronomy from space. This reflecting telescope which had a {{convert|60|cm|in|adj=on}} mirror, operated for nine months until its supply of coolant ([[liquid helium]]) ran out. It surveyed the entire sky detecting 245,000 infrared sources—more than 100 times the number previously known.

=== Ultra-violet telescopes (10 nm – 400 nm) ===
{{See also|Ultraviolet astronomy}}
Although optical telescopes can image the near ultraviolet, the [[ozone layer]] in the [[stratosphere]] absorbs [[ultraviolet]] radiation shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm so most ultra-violet astronomy is conducted with satellites. Ultraviolet telescopes resemble optical telescopes, but conventional [[aluminium]]-coated mirrors cannot be used and alternative coatings such as [[magnesium fluoride]] or [[lithium fluoride]] are used instead. The [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] satellite carried out observations in the ultra-violet as early as 1962. The [[International Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1978) systematically surveyed the sky for eighteen years, using a {{convert|45|cm|in|adj=on}} aperture telescope with two [[spectroscope]]s. Extreme-ultraviolet astronomy (10–100&amp;nbsp;nm) is a discipline in its own right and involves many of the techniques of X-ray astronomy; the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1992) was a satellite operating at these wavelengths.

=== X-ray telescopes (0.01 nm – 10 nm) ===
{{See also|X-ray telescope|X-ray astronomy}}
[[X-rays]] from space do not reach the Earth's surface so X-ray astronomy has to be conducted above the Earth's atmosphere. The first X-ray experiments were conducted on [[sub-orbital]] [[rocket]] flights which enabled the first detection of X-rays from the [[Sun]] (1948) and the first galactic X-ray sources: [[Scorpius X-1]] (June 1962) and the [[Crab Nebula]] (October 1962). Since then, X-ray telescopes ([[Wolter telescope]]s) have been built using nested grazing-incidence mirrors which deflect X-rays to a detector. Some of the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory|OAO satellites]] conducted X-ray astronomy in the late 1960s, but the first dedicated X-ray satellite was the [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] (1970) which discovered 300 sources. More recent X-ray satellites include: the [[EXOSAT]] (1983), [[ROSAT]] (1990), [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] (1999), and [[XMM-Newton|Newton]] (1999).

=== Gamma-ray telescopes (less than 0.01 nm) ===
{{See also|Gamma-ray astronomy}}
[[Gamma rays]] are absorbed high in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] so most gamma-ray astronomy is conducted with [[satellites]]. Gamma-ray telescopes use [[scintillation counters]], [[spark chamber]]s and more recently, [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] detectors. The angular resolution of these devices is typically very poor. There were [[balloon]]-borne experiments in the early 1960s, but gamma-ray astronomy really began with the launch of the [[OSO 3]] satellite in 1967; the first dedicated gamma-ray satellites were [[Second Small Astronomy Satellite|SAS B]] (1972) and [[Cos-B|Cos B]] (1975). The [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (1991) was a big improvement on previous surveys. Very high-energy gamma-rays (above 200&amp;nbsp;GeV) can be detected from the ground via the [[Cerenkov radiation]] produced by the passage of the gamma-rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Several Cerenkov imaging telescopes have been built around the world including: the [[HEGRA]] (1987), [[STACEE]] (2001), [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|HESS]] (2003), and [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] (2004).

== Interferometric telescopes ==
{{See also|Astronomical interferometry}}

In 1868, [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] noted that the purpose of the arrangement of mirrors or glass lenses in a conventional telescope was simply to provide an approximation to a [[Fourier transform]] of the optical wave field entering the telescope. As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as [[astronomical interferometry]]. It was not until 1891 that [[Albert A. Michelson]] successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter's satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct interferometric measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson &amp; [[Francis G. Pease]] (1921) which was applied by their 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the [[Hooker telescope|100 inch Hooker Telescope]] on Mount Wilson.

The next major development came in 1946 when [[Martin Ryle|Ryle]] and Vonberg (Ryle and Vonberg 1946) located a number of new cosmic radio sources by constructing a radio analogue of the [[Michelson interferometer]]. The signals from two radio antennas were added electronically to produce interference. Ryle and Vonberg's telescope used the rotation of the Earth to scan the sky in one dimension. With the development of larger arrays and of computers which could rapidly perform the necessary Fourier transforms, the first [[aperture synthesis]] imaging instruments were soon developed which could obtain high resolution images without the need of a giant parabolic reflector to perform the Fourier transform. This technique is now used in most radio astronomy observations. Radio astronomers soon developed the [[closure phase|mathematical methods]] to perform [[aperture synthesis]] Fourier imaging using much larger arrays of telescopes —often spread across more than one continent. In the 1980s, the [[aperture synthesis]] technique was extended to visible light as well as infrared astronomy, providing the first very high resolution optical and infrared images of nearby stars.

In 1995 this imaging technique was demonstrated on [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope (COAST)|an array of separate optical telescopes]] for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and also allowing even higher resolution [https://web.archive.org/web/19971021083400/http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/telescopes/coast/astronomy.html#supergiants02-04 imaging of stellar surfaces]. The same techniques have now been applied at a number of other astronomical telescope arrays including: the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]], the [[CHARA array]], and the [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array|IOTA]] array. A detailed description of the development of astronomical optical interferometry can be found here [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/2309/page1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:32:14].

In 2008, [[Max Tegmark]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga]] proposed a "[[Fast Fourier Transform Telescope]]" design in which the lenses and mirrors could be dispensed with altogether when computers become fast enough to perform all the necessary transforms.

'''Holus''' is a [[holographic]] product under development by H+Technology. The concept was first developed in 2013, before funding via [[Kickstarter]] meant the product could be taken to market. The purpose of Holus is to simulate [[holographic]] experiences and is technically different from typical hologram stickers found on credit cards and currency notes.

Holus has been criticized by some commentators as a revamping [[Pepper's ghost]], a 19th-century optical trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@sableraph/how-to-sell-a-19th-century-parlor-trick-as-a-3d-holographic-display-c12a861cb8bf|title=Did Holus scam 200.000$ of Kickstarter backers using a 19th century parlor trick?|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/07/10/why-is-kickstarter-letting-a-h.html|title=Why is Kickstarter letting a hologram "scam" raise $250k?|first=Wrecksdart|last=Says|date=10 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Holus was developed in late 2013 by a team in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Gorey|first1 = Colm|title = The Holus tabletop hologram generator is now a reality|url = https://www.siliconrepublic.com/gear/2015/06/11/the-holus-tabletop-hologram-generator-is-now-a-reality|publisher = Silicon Republic|date = June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Holus Creates a New 3D Experience|url = http://smartreality.co/holus-creates-a-new-3d-experience/|publisher = SmartReality|date = September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before H+ Tech began looking for funding for the device, Holus won a number of awards for its design. This included he Vancouver User Experience Award in the non-profit category for partnering up with Ronald McDonald House to build Magic Room and the Peoples Choice Award to achieve excellence in joy, elegance, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Vancouver User Experience Awards winners announced|url = http://habaneroconsulting.com/about/news/vancouver-user-experience-awards-winners-announced|publisher = Habanero Consulting|date = December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first major coverage came from a review by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in early 2015. At the time, the technology was demonstrated to bring animals to life within the 3D glass box. The product was referred to in the review as roughly the "size of a microwave".&lt;ref name="mit2"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Metz|first1 = Rachel|title = Virtual Creatures in a Box, Controlled by You|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/535456/virtual-creatures-in-a-box-controlled-by-you/|publisher = [[MIT Technology Review]]|date = February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept went on to win two awards at the NextBC awards in [[Canada]] in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = DigiBC - Digital Media &amp; Wireless in BC|url = http://www.digibc.org/cpages/blog|publisher = DigiBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to build mass versions of the product, a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched in order to take the idea to market. It used a similar technology to the [[optical illusion]] known as [[Pepper's ghost]]. This drew criticism from some during its [[Kickstarter]] campaign. It launched its [[Kickstarter]] campaign in June 2015 and generated twice its target of $40,000 within the first 48 hours.&lt;ref name="techcrunch2"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Tepper|first1 = Fitz|title = Holus Is A Tabletop Device That Turns Digital Media Into A 3D Hologram|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/holus-is-a-tabletop-device-that-turns-digital-media-into-a-3d-hologram/#.ry9hfw:AcpM|publisher = [[TechCrunch]]|date = June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is similar to the technology used to display the music artists [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Usmar|first1 = Jo|title = Dead rapper Tupac is lined up for a tour after his Coachella Festival comeback|url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/weird-celeb-news/after-a-hologram-of-tupac-performs-at-coachella-797345|publisher = [[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date = April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the technology has advanced, with a number of [[startup company|startups]] entering the market. One of these was H+ Technology, who first began working on the technology in early 2013. The aim of the product at the time has remained the same until today, to produce 3D technology that can be used in the home on a tabletop.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Other reviews likened it to the technology used in the [[Star Wars]] films when the character [[R2-D2]] projected a [[hologram]] call on a small platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Griffiths|first1 = Sarah|title = The force is strong with this one!

==Research and development==
Due to the technology being in its infancy, the media has covered the R&amp;D of the product and its potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive Holographic platform Holus, with 3D printing design options, successfully funded within hours |url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150611-interactive-holographic-platform-holus-with-3d-printing-design-options.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613192312/http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150611-interactive-holographic-platform-holus-with-3d-printing-design-options.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 13, 2015 |publisher=3ders |date=June 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spatial light modulator]]s have been mentioned as one potential development on future versions of Holus.

[[File:Hyperloop all cutaway.png|thumb|Concept art of Hyperloop inner workings|265x265px]]

A '''Hyperloop''' is a proposed mode of [[public transport|passenger]] and/or [[freight transport]]ation, first used to describe an open-source [[vactrain]] design released by a joint team from [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]].&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; Drawing heavily from [[Robert Goddard]]'s vactrain, a hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while being very efficient.

[[Elon Musk|Elon Musk's]] version of the concept, first publicly mentioned in 2012,&lt;ref name="PandoDaily Hyperloop"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pando Monthly presents a fireside chat with Elon Musk |url=https://pando.com/2012/07/12/pandomonthly-presents-a-fireside-chat-with-elon-musk/ |website=pando.com |publisher=PandoDaily |access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on [[air bearing]]s driven by [[linear induction motor]]s and [[axial compressor]]s.&lt;ref name=gm20130822/&gt;

The Hyperloop Alpha concept was first published in August 2013, proposing and examining a route running from the [[Los Angeles]] region to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], roughly following the [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] corridor. The paper conceived of a hyperloop system that would propel passengers along the {{convert|350|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=2}} route at a speed of {{convert|760|mph|km/h|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, allowing for a travel time of 35 minutes, which is considerably faster than current rail or air travel times. Preliminary cost estimates for this LA–SF suggested route were included in the white paper—{{US$|6 billion|link=yes}} for a passenger-only version, and {{US$|7.5 billion}} for a somewhat larger-diameter version transporting passengers and vehicles&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;—although transportation analysts had doubts that the system could be constructed on that budget; some analysts claimed that the Hyperloop would be several billion dollars overbudget, taking into consideration construction, development, and operation costs.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPoAstronomical"/&gt;

The Hyperloop concept has been explicitly "open-sourced" by Musk and SpaceX, and others have been encouraged to take the ideas and further develop them.

To that end, a few companies have been formed, and several interdisciplinary student-led teams are working to advance the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/18/11965354/hyperloop-pod-competition-elon-musk-spacex-team-design|title=Here are the Hyperloop pods competing in Elon Musk's big race later this year|last=Hawkins|first=Andrew J.|date=June 18, 2016 |website=The Verge|access-date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SpaceX built an approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|-long|adj=mid}} [[scale model|subscale]] track for its [[Hyperloop pod competition|pod design competition]] at its headquarters in [[Hawthorne, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Etherington|first1=Darrell|title=Here's a first look at the SpaceX Hyperloop test track|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/02/heres-a-first-look-at-the-spacex-hyperloop-test-track/|publisher=TechCrunch|date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts are skeptical, saying that the proposals ignore the expenses and risks of developing the technology and that the idea is "completely impractical".&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2013/08/13/wolverton-elon-musks-hyperloop-hype-ignores-practical-problems/ |title=Wolverton: Elon Musk's Hyperloop hype ignores practical problems |first=Troy |last=Wolverton |work=The Mercury News |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims have also been made that the Hyperloop is too susceptible to disruption from a power outage or terror attacks to be considered safe.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;&lt;!--alpha doc covers this on page 53--&gt;

==History==

The general idea of trains or other transportation traveling [[vactrain|through evacuated tubes]] dates back more than a century, although the [[atmospheric railway]] was never a commercial success. &lt;!--[[Elon Musk]]'s Hyperloop uses only partial vacuum, with a compressor to absorb the pressure wave and avoid the Kantrowitz limit, with air-bearing skis, and linear induction motors, very low energy use per passenger-mile or ton-mile, storing energy so as to power the technology from solar over a 24-hour diurnal cycle, etc; however, that technical summary is better left in another section of this article, not History.--&gt;

Musk first mentioned that he was thinking about a concept for a "fifth mode of transport", calling it the ''Hyperloop'', in July 2012 at a [[PandoDaily]] event in [[Santa Monica, California]]. This hypothetical high-speed mode of transportation would have the following characteristics: immunity to weather, collision free, twice the speed of a plane, low power consumption, and energy storage for 24-hour operations.&lt;ref name="pandovideo"/&gt;&lt;!-- approx. 43 minutes into the video recording --&gt; The name ''Hyperloop'' was chosen because it would go in a loop. Musk envisions the more advanced versions will be able to go at [[hypersonic speed]].&lt;ref name="youtube20160131"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab2VVp1GfmA |title=Elon Musk speaks at the Hyperloop Pod Award Ceremony |publisher=YouTube.com |date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, Musk likened the Hyperloop to a "cross between a [[Concorde]] and a [[railgun]] and an [[air hockey]] table".&lt;ref name="atd20130530"/&gt;

From late 2012 until August 2013, a group of engineers from both [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] and [[SpaceX]] worked on the conceptual modeling of Hyperloop.&lt;ref name="gm20130813"/&gt; An early system design was published in the Tesla and SpaceX blogs&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AlphaTesla"/&gt; which describes one potential design, function, pathway, and cost of a hyperloop system.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; According to the alpha design, pods would accelerate to cruising speed gradually using a linear electric motor and glide above their track on [[air bearings]] through tubes above ground on columns or below ground in tunnels to avoid the dangers of [[grade crossing]]s. An ideal hyperloop system will be more energy-efficient,&lt;ref name=EDS_power_consumption&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.pes-publications.ee.ethz.ch/uploads/tx_ethpublications/22_Scaling_laws_for_electrodynamic_suspension_Flankl_accepted-version.pdf |title= Scaling laws for electrodynamic suspension in high-speed transportation |last1=Flankl |first1=Michael |last2=Wellerdieck |first2=Tobias |last3=Tüysüz |first3=Arda |last4=Kolar |first4=Johann W. |journal= IET Electric Power Applications |date=November 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2018 |doi=10.1049/iet-epa.2017.0480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESC_Hyperloop"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://www.esc.ethz.ch/news/archive/2017/11/energy-efficiency-of-an-electrodynamically-levitated-hyperloop-pod.html |title=Energy Efficiency of an Electrodynamically Levitated Hyperloop Pod |publisher=Energy Science Center |date=November 29, 2017 |access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; quiet, and [[vehicular automation|autonomous]] than existing modes of mass transit. Musk has also invited feedback to "see if the people can find ways to improve it". The Hyperloop Alpha was released as an [[open source]] design.&lt;ref name="globemail20130812"/&gt; The word mark "''HYPERLOOP''", applicable to "high-speed transportation of goods in tubes" was issued to SpaceX on April 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Word Mark HYPERLOOP|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4810:6uwa73.2.7|publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muoio|first1=Danielle|title=Everything we know about Elon Musk's ambitious Hyperloop plan|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-hyperloop-plan-boring-company-2017-8|accessdate=September 10, 2017|publisher=Business Insider|date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would build a {{convert|1|mi|km|-long|adj=mid}} test track to be located next to SpaceX's [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]] facility. The track would be used to test pod designs supplied by third parties in the competition.&lt;ref name="CNNmoney-15-6-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFchronicle-6-15-15"/&gt;

By November 2015, with several commercial companies and dozens of student teams pursuing the development of Hyperloop technologies, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' asserted that "The Hyperloop Movement", as some of its unaffiliated members refer to themselves, is officially bigger than the man who started it."&lt;ref name=wsj20151130&gt;{{cite news |last=Chee |first=Alexander |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-race-to-create-elon-musks-hyperloop-heats-up-1448899356 |title=The Race to Create Elon Musk's Hyperloop Heats Up |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=November 30, 2015 |access-date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MIT Hyperloop team developed the first Hyperloop pod prototype, which they unveiled at the MIT Museum on May 13, 2016. Their design uses [[electrodynamic suspension]] for levitating and [[eddy current brake|eddy current braking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Dave|title=Magnetic Hyperloop pod unveiled at MIT|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36292467|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=BBC|date=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2017, approximately one year after phase one of the [[Hyperloop pod competition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Leda|title=MIT students win first round of SpaceX Hyperloop contest|url=http://news.mit.edu/2016/mit-students-win-first-round-spacex-hyperloop-contest-0201|accessdate=February 1, 2017|date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MIT Hyperloop pod demonstrated the first ever low-pressure Hyperloop run in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hyperloop|first1=MIT|title=MIT Hyperloop Flight Jan 29th 2017 - First Ever Low Pressure Hyperloop Run|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JEZkczlTFk|website=Youtube |date= January 30, 2017 |accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this first competition the [[TU Delft|Delft University]] team from the Netherlands achieved the highest overall competition score.&lt;ref name=Delft-NLTimes-2017-01-30/&gt; The awards for the "fastest pod" and the "best performance in flight" were won by the team [http://hyperloop.warr.de/ WARR Hyperloop] from the [[Technical University of Munich|Technical University of Munich (TUM)]], Germany.

The second [[Hyperloop pod competition]] took place from August 25–27, 2017. The only judging criteria being top speed provided it is followed by successful deceleration. [http://hyperloop.warr.de/ WARR Hyperloop] from the [https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/ Technical University of Munich] won the competition by reaching a top speed of 324&amp;nbsp;km/h (201&amp;nbsp;mph) and therefore breaking the previous record of 310&amp;nbsp;km/h for hyperloop prototypes set by [[Hyperloop One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperloop-one.com/hyperloop-one-goes-farther-and-faster-achieving-historic-speeds|title=Hyperloop One Goes Farther and Faster Achieving Historic Speeds|website=Hyperloop One|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hyperloop-competition-spacex-elon-musk-warr-winners-2017-8?IR=T|title=Here are the big winners from Elon Musk's Hyperloop competition|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and operation==
[[File:Hyperloop capsule.svg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Hyperloop capsule: [[Axial compressor]] on the front, passenger compartment in the middle, battery compartment at the back, and [[air caster]] skis at the bottom]]
[[File:Hyperloop.jpg|thumb|A 3D sketch of the Hyperloop infrastructure. The steel tubes are rendered transparent in this image.]]

Developments in [[high-speed rail]] have historically been impeded by the difficulties in managing [[friction]] and [[air resistance]],{{Citation needed|reason=The needed power to overcome drag per person on a long train shouldn't be that much that it eclipses the significance of the suspension, the real problem. Long vehicles have low skin drag coefficients because of the thicker boundary layer.|date=February 2018}} both of which become substantial when vehicles approach high speeds. The [[vactrain]] concept theoretically eliminates these obstacles by employing [[maglev|magnetically levitating]] trains in [[vacuum|evacuated]] (airless) or partly evacuated tubes, allowing for speeds of thousands of miles per hour. However, the high cost of [[maglev]] and the difficulty of maintaining a vacuum over large distances has prevented this type of system from ever being built. The Hyperloop resembles a vactrain system but operates at approximately {{convert|1|mbar|Pa|spell=in|lk=on}} of pressure.&lt;ref name="nova20130813"/&gt;

===Initial design concept===

The Hyperloop concept operates by sending specially designed "capsules" or "pods" through a steel tube maintained at a partial vacuum. In Musk's original concept, each capsule floats on a {{convert|0.5-1.3|mm|in|2|order=flip|abbr=on}} layer of air provided under pressure to [[air caster|air-caster]] "skis", similar to how pucks are levitated above an [[air hockey]] table, while still allowing faster speeds than wheels can sustain. [[Hyperloop One]]'s technology uses passive [[maglev]] for the same purpose. [[Linear induction motor]]s located along the tube would accelerate and decelerate the capsule to the appropriate speed for each section of the tube route. With [[rolling resistance]] eliminated and air resistance greatly reduced, the capsules can [[gliding flight|glide]] for the bulk of the journey. In Musk's original Hyperloop concept, an electrically driven [[ducted fan|inlet fan]] and [[axial compressor]] would be placed at the nose of the capsule to "actively transfer high-pressure air from the front to the rear of the vessel", resolving the problem of air pressure building in front of the vehicle, slowing it down.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; A fraction of the air is shunted to the skis for additional pressure, augmenting that gain passively from lift due to their shape. Hyperloop One's system does away with the compressor.

In the alpha-level concept, passenger-only pods are to be {{convert|2.23|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; and projected to reach a top speed of {{convert|760|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to maintain aerodynamic efficiency.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt; (Section 4.4)&lt;/sup&gt; The design proposes passengers experience a maximum inertial [[g-force|acceleration]] of 0.5&amp;nbsp;g, about 2 or 3 times that of a commercial airliner on takeoff and landing.

===Proposed routes===
[[File:Interstate5 map.png|thumb|206x206px|Interstate 5]]

A number of routes have been proposed for Hyperloop systems that meet the approximate distance conditions for which a Hyperloop is hypothesized to provide improved transport times. Route ''proposals'' range from speculation described in company releases to [[business case]]s to signed agreements.

====United States====

The route suggested in the 2013 alpha-level design document was from the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. That conceptual system would begin around [[Sylmar, California|Sylmar]], just south of the [[Tejon Pass]], follow [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] to the north, and arrive near [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] on the east side of San Francisco Bay. Several proposed branches were also shown in the design document, including [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[San Diego]], and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt;

No work has been done on the route proposed in Musk's alpha-design; one cited reason is that it would terminate on the fringes of the two major metropolitan areas (Los Angeles and San Francisco), resulting in significant cost savings in construction, but requiring that passengers traveling to and from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and San Francisco, and any other community beyond Sylmar and Hayward, to transfer to another transportation mode in order to reach their final destination. This would significantly lengthen the total travel time to those destinations.&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;

A similar problem already affects present-day air travel, where on short routes (like LAX-SFO) the flight time is only a rather small part of door to door travel time. Critics have argued that this would significantly reduce the proposed cost and/or time savings of Hyperloop as compared to the [[California High-Speed Rail]] project that will serve downtown stations in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2013/08/13/loopy-ideas-are-fine-if-youre-an-entrepreneur |title=Loopy Ideas Are Fine, If You're an Entrepreneur |work=Pedestrian Observations |first=Alon |last=Levy |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stopandmove.blogspot.de/2013/08/hyperloop-proposal-bad-joke-or-attempt.html |title=Hyperloop proposal: Bad joke or attempt to sabotage California HSR project? |work=Stop and Move |first=James |last=Sinclair |date=August 12, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/19848/musks-hyperloop-math-doesnt-add-up |title=Musk's Hyperloop math doesn't add up |work=Greater Greater Washington |first=Matt |last=Johnson |date=August 14, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers travelling financial centre to financial centre are estimated to save about two hours by taking the Hyperloop instead of driving the whole distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://transportandtravel.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/pipedreams |title=Pipedreams |work=Transport and Travel |first=Pat |last=Humphreys |date=March 23, 2016 |access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others questioned the cost projections for the suggested California route. Some transportation engineers argued in 2013 that they found the alpha-level design cost estimates unrealistically low given the scale of construction and reliance on unproven technology. The technological and [[economic feasibility]] of the idea is unproven and a subject of significant debate.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPoAstronomical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;

===Open-source design evolution===
In September 2013, [[Ansys]] Corporation ran [[computational fluid dynamics]] simulations to model the aerodynamics of the capsule and [[shear stress]] forces that the capsule would be subjected to. The simulation showed that the capsule design would need to be significantly reshaped to avoid creating [[supersonic]] airflow, and that the gap between the tube wall and capsule would need to be larger. Ansys employee Sandeep Sovani said the simulation showed that Hyperloop has challenges but that he is convinced it is feasible.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNet"/&gt;

In October 2013, the development team of the [[OpenMDAO]] software framework released an unfinished, conceptual open-source model of parts of the Hyperloop's propulsion system. The team asserted that the model demonstrated the concept's feasibility, although the tube would need to be {{convert|4|m|order=flip}} in diameter,&lt;ref name="openmdao"/&gt; significantly larger than originally projected. However, the team's model is not a true working model of the propulsion system, as it did not account for a wide range of technological factors required to physically construct a Hyperloop based on Musk's concept, and in particular had no significant estimations of component weight.&lt;ref name="github-mdao"/&gt;

In November 2013, [[MathWorks]] analyzed the proposal's suggested route and concluded that the route was mainly feasible. The analysis focused on the [[g-force|acceleration]] experienced by passengers and the necessary deviations from public roads in order to keep the accelerations reasonable; it did highlight that maintaining a trajectory along I-580 east of San Francisco at the planned speeds was not possible without significant deviation into heavily populated areas.&lt;ref name="mathworks20131122"/&gt;

In January 2015, a paper based on the NASA [[OpenMDAO]] open-source model reiterated the need for a larger diameter tube and a reduced cruise speed closer to Mach 0.85. It recommended removing on-board heat exchangers based on thermal models of the interactions between the compressor cycle, tube, and ambient environment. The compression cycle would only contribute 5% of the heat added to the tube, with 95% of the heat attributed to radiation and convection into the tube. The weight and volume penalty of on-board heat exchangers would not be worth the minor benefit, and regardless the steady-state temperature in the tube would only reach {{convert|30|-|40|F-change|C-change}} above ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="Chin2015"/&gt;

According to Musk, various aspects of the Hyperloop have technology applications to other Musk interests, including [[surface transportation on Mars]] and [[Musk electric jet|electric jet propulsion]].&lt;ref name=fortune20160131&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=David Z. |url=http://fortune.com/2016/01/31/mit-wins-hyperloop-competition-and-elon-musk-drops-in |title=MIT Wins Hyperloop Competition, And Elon Musk Drops In |work=Fortune |date=January 31, 2016 |access-date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=musk20160130&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab2VVp1GfmA|title=Elon Musk speaks at the Hyperloop Pod Award Ceremony|publisher=YouTube.com|first=Elon|last=Musk|date=January 30, 2016|access-date=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2016, Hyperloop One conducted the first live trial of Hyperloop technology, demonstrating that its custom linear electric motor could propel a sled from 0 to 110 miles an hour in just over one second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://digg.com/2016/hyperloop-one-test-video-elon-musk |title=Watch The First Real-World Test Of Hyperloop Technology |first=Dan |last=Fallon |work=Digg |location=US |date=May 11, 2016 |access-date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[g-force|acceleration]] exerted approximately 2.5 g on the sled. The sled was stopped at the end of the test by hitting a pile of sand at the end of the track, because the test was not intended to test braking components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3585662/It-works-Elon-Musk-s-super-fast-Hyperloop-successfully-demonstrated-Las-Vegas.html |title=Elon Musk's Hyperloop is successfully demonstrated in Las Vegas |first1=Ellie |last1=Zolfagharifard |first2=Richard |last2=Gray |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=Australia |date=May 12, 2016 |access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Hyperloop One released a preliminary study that suggested a Hyperloop connection between [[Helsinki]] and [[Stockholm]] would be feasible, reducing the travel time between the cities to half an hour. The construction costs were estimated by Hyperloop One to be around {{euro|19 billion}} ({{US$|21 billion}} at 2016 exchange rates).&lt;ref name=helsinki-verge&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/5/12099612/hyperloop-one-helsinki-stockholm-30-minutes-study |title=Hyperloop One says it can connect Helsinki to Stockholm in under 30 minutes |last1=Hawkins |first1=Andrew J. |work=The Verge |location=US |access-date=July 6, 2016 |date=July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Hyperloop One announced a deal with the world's third largest ports operator, DP World, to develop a cargo offloader system at DP World's flagship port of Jebel Ali in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyperloop-one-dp-world-sign-agreement-to-pursue-a-hyperloop-route-in-dubai-300313889.html |title=Hyperloop One, DP World Sign Agreement To Pursue A Hyperloop Route In Dubai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperloop One also broke ground on DevLoop, its full-scale Hyperloop test track.

In November 2016, Hyperloop One disclosed that it has established a high-level working group relationship with the governments of Finland and the Netherlands to study the viability of building Hyperloop proof of operations centers in those countries. Hyperloop One also has a feasibility study underway with Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority for passenger systems in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kharpal |first1=Arjun |title=Hyperloop One explores setting up high-speed transport system in Finland, Netherlands, Dubai |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/10/hyperloop-one-finland-netherlands-dubai-setting-up-high-speed-transport-system.html |work=CNBC |access-date=November 11, 2016 |date=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feasibility studies are underway in Russia, Los Angeles, and the Netherlands.

In May 12, 2017, Hyperloop One performed its first full-scale Hyperloop test, becoming the first company in the world to test a full-scale Hyperloop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/hyperloop-one-test-success/|work=Wired |date=July 12, 2017 |title=Hyperloop's first real test is a whooshing success}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system-wide test integrated Hyperloop components including vacuum, propulsion, levitation, sled, control systems, tube, and structures.

On July 12, 2017, the company revealed images of its first generation pod prototype, which will be used at the DevLoop test site in Nevada to test aerodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/7/12/15960522/hyperloop-one-pod-design-test |first=Alissa |last=Walker |work=Curbed |date=July 12, 2017 |title=Hyperloop One reveals full-size prototype of its shiny new pod design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2017, the company received a "significant investment" from the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, leading to a rebrand of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/introducing-virgin-hyperloop-one-worlds-most-revolutionary-train-service |title=Introducing Virgin Hyperloop One – the world's most revolutionary train service |last=Branson |first=Richard |date=October 12, 2017 |publisher=Virgin |access-date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Richard Branson of Virgin Hyperloop One announced that he had a preliminary agreement with the [[Maharashtra]] State government to build the Mumbai-Pune Hyperloop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/indyventure/virgin-hyperloop-india-pune-mumbai-fast-shuttle-train-maharashtra-richard-branson-narendra-modi-a8217511.html |title=Virgin to build super-fast Hyperloop shuttle between Pune and Mumbai as India ramps up infrastructure spending |first=Joe |last=Sommerlad |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=February 19, 2018 |access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hyperloop Transportation Technologies]] (HTT) was a group of more than 800 engineers{{when|date=July 2018}} and professionals located around the world. Some collaborate part-time; others are full-time employees and contributors. Some members are full-time paid employees; others work in exchange for salary and [[stock option]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

HTT announced in May 2015 that a deal had been finalized with landowners to build a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on}} test track along a stretch of road near [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] between Los Angeles and San Francisco.&lt;ref name="fortune20150520"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2015/05/20/elon-musk-hyperloop-test-track-california/ |title=Elon Musk's craziest project is coming closer to reality |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |first=Daniel |last=Roberts |date=May 20, 2015 |access-date=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and the government of [[Abu Dhabi]] announced plans to conduct a feasibility study on a Hyperloop link between the [[UAE]] capital and [[Al Ain]], reducing travel time between Abu Dhabi and Al Ain to just under 10-minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abu Dhabi explores Hyperloop link with Al Ain, potentially transforming cruise tourism in the city|url=http://www.cruisearabiaonline.com/middle-east-cruise-news/2016/12/12/Abu-Dhabi-explores-Hyperloop-link-with-Al-Ain--potentially-transforming-cruise-tourism-in-city|publisher=Cruise Arabia &amp; Africa|date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2017, HTT announced and signed an agreement with the [[Andhra Pradesh]] government to build a track from [[Amaravathi]] to [[Vijayawada]] in a [[public-private partnership]], and suggested that the more than one hour trip could be reduced to 5 minutes through the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/first-hyperloop-in-india-to-be-launched-between-amravati-and-vijayawada/articleshow/60395340.cms |title=First Hyperloop in India to be launched between Amravati and Vijayawada |work=The Times of India |author=Satyanarayan Iyer |date=September 6, 2017 |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/htt-to-build-indias-first-hyperloop-connecting-amaravati-vijayawada/articleshow/60395268.cms |title=Amaravati to Vijayawada in 5 minutes!

==Hyperloop pod competition==

[[File:Hyperloop pod competition tube.jpg|thumb|Hyperloop pod competition]]

A number of student and non-student teams were participating in a [[Hyperloop pod competition]] in 2015–16, and at least 22 of them built hardware to compete on a sponsored hyperloop test track in mid-2016.&lt;ref name=verge20160130&gt;{{cite news |last=Hawkins |first=Andrew J. |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/30/10877442/elon-musk-spacex-hyperloop-competition-awards |title=MIT wins SpaceX's Hyperloop competition, and Elon Musk made a cameo |work=The Verge |date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, [[SpaceX]] announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop pod design competition, and would build a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters in [[Hawthorne, California]] for the competitive event in 2016.&lt;ref name="NBChyperloop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hyper-pod-competition"/&gt; SpaceX stated in their announcement, "Neither SpaceX nor Elon Musk is affiliated with any Hyperloop companies. While we are not developing a commercial Hyperloop ourselves, we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional Hyperloop prototype."&lt;ref name="spacexhyperloop"/&gt;

More than 700 teams had submitted preliminary applications by July,&lt;ref name="binsider20150623"/&gt; and detailed competition rules were released in August.&lt;ref name=rules_v20/&gt; ''Intent to Compete'' submissions were due in September 2015 with more detailed tube and technical specification released by SpaceX in October. A preliminary design briefing was held in November 2015, where more than 120 student engineering teams were selected to submit ''Final Design Packages'' due by January 13, 2016.&lt;ref name=gw20151215&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2015/124-teams-sign-up-for-spacex-founder-elon-musks-hyperloop-pod-race |title=More than 120 teams picked for SpaceX founder Elon Musk's Hyperloop contest |work=Geekwire.com |first=Alan |last=Boyle |date=December 15, 2015 |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Design Weekend'' was held at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] January 29–30, 2016, for all invited entrants.&lt;ref name="tamu201510"/&gt; Engineers from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] were named the winners of the competition.

==Criticism and human factor considerations==
Some critics of Hyperloop focus on the experience—possibly unpleasant and frightening—of riding in a narrow, sealed, windowless capsule inside a sealed steel tunnel, that is subjected to significant [[g-force|acceleration forces]]; high noise levels due to air being compressed and ducted around the capsule at near-sonic speeds; and the vibration and jostling.&lt;ref name="insider20130820"/&gt; Even if the tube is initially smooth, ground may shift with seismic activity. At high speeds, even minor deviations from a straight path may add considerable buffeting.&lt;ref name="verge20130816"/&gt; This is in addition to practical and logistical questions regarding how to best deal with safety issues such as equipment malfunction, accidents, and emergency evacuations.

Other [[maglev]] trains are already in use, which avoid much of the added costs of Hyperloop. The [[SCMaglev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/japans-maglev-train-notches-up-new-world-speed-record-in-test-run|title=Japan's maglev train breaks world speed record with 600km/h test run|first=Justin|last=McCurry|date=April 21, 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan has demonstrated {{convert|603|km/h|mph|abbr=on|0}} without a vacuum tube, by using an extremely aerodynamic train design. It also avoids the cost and time required to pressurize and depressurize the exit and entry points of a Hyperloop tube.

There is also the criticism of design technicalities in the tube system. Prof. John Hansman has stated problems, such as how a slight misalignment in the tube would be compensated for and the potential interplay between the air cushion and the low-pressure air. He has also questioned what would happen if the power were to go out when the pod was miles away from a city. Prof. Richard Muller has also expressed concern regarding "[the Hyperloop's] novelty and the vulnerability of its tubes, [which] would be a tempting target for terrorists", and that the system could be disrupted by everyday dirt and grime.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;

==Political and economic considerations==
The alpha proposal projected that cost savings compared with conventional rail would come from a combination of several factors. The small profile and elevated nature of the alpha route would enable Hyperloop to be constructed primarily in the median of [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]]. However, whether this would be truly feasible is a matter of debate. The low profile would reduce tunnel boring requirements and the light weight of the capsules is projected to reduce construction costs over conventional passenger rail. It was asserted that there would be less [[right-of-way]] opposition and environmental impact as well due to its small, sealed, elevated profile versus that of a rail easement;&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; however, other commentators contend that a smaller footprint does not guarantee less opposition.&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt; In criticizing this assumption, [[mass transportation]] writer Alon Levy said, "In reality, an all-elevated system (which is what Musk proposes with the Hyperloop) is a bug rather than a feature. Central Valley land is cheap; pylons are expensive, as can be readily seen by the costs of elevated highways and trains all over the world".&lt;ref name="NationalReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoWonkBlog"/&gt; Michael Anderson, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at [[UC Berkeley]], predicted that costs would amount to around {{US$|100 billion}}.&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;

The Hyperloop white paper suggests that {{US$|20}} of each one-way passenger ticket between Los Angeles and San Francisco would be sufficient to cover initial [[capital (economics)|capital costs]], based on amortizing the cost of Hyperloop over 20 years with ridership projections of 7.4 million per year in each direction and does not include operating costs (although the proposal asserts that electric costs would be covered by solar panels). No total [[fare|ticket price]] was suggested in the alpha design.&lt;ref name="AlphaSpaceX"/&gt; The projected ticket price has been questioned by Dan Sperling, director of the [[Institute of Transportation Studies]] at [[UC Davis]], who stated that "there's no way the economics on that would ever work out."&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;

The early cost estimates of the Hyperloop are a subject of debate. A number of economists and transportation experts have expressed the belief that the {{US$|6 billion}} price tag dramatically understates the cost of designing, developing, constructing, and testing an all-new form of transportation.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AJE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoWonkBlog"/&gt; ''The Economist'' said that the estimates are unlikely to "be immune to the [[cost overrun|hypertrophication of cost]] that every other grand infrastructure project seems doomed to suffer."&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

Political impediments to the construction of such a project in California will be very large. There is a great deal of "political and [[reputation capital]]" invested in the existing mega-project of [[California High-Speed Rail]].&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt; Replacing that with a different design would not be straightforward given California's political economy. Texas has been suggested as an alternate for its more amenable political and economic environment.&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

Building a successful Hyperloop sub-scale demonstration project could reduce the political impediments and improve cost estimates. Musk has suggested that he may be personally involved in building a demonstration prototype of the Hyperloop concept, including funding the development effort.&lt;ref name="gm20130813"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist20130817"/&gt;

The solar panels Musk plans to install along the length of the Hyperloop system have been criticized by Prof. Roger Goodall, as not being feasible enough to return enough energy to power the Hyperloop system, arguing that the air pumps and propulsion would require much more power than the solar panels could generate.&lt;ref name="Mercury-2016-09-16"/&gt;

===Historical===

The concept of transportation of passengers in pneumatic tubes is not new. The first patent to transport goods in tubes was taken out in 1799 by the British mechanical engineer and inventor [[George Medhurst]]. In 1812, Medhurst wrote a book detailing his idea of transporting passengers and goods through air-tight tubes using air propulsion.&lt;ref name="business20130715"/&gt;

In the early 1800s, there were other similar systems proposed or experimented with and were generally known as an [[atmospheric railway]] although this term is also used for systems where the propulsion is provided by a separate pneumatic tube to the train tunnel itself.

One of the earliest was the [[Dalkey Atmospheric Railway]] which operated near Dublin between 1844 and 1854.

The [[Crystal Palace pneumatic railway]] operated in London around 1864 and used large fans, some {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, that were powered by a steam engine. The tunnels are now lost but the line operated successfully for over a year.

Operated from 1870 to 1873, the [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] was a one-block-long prototype of an underground tube transport public transit system in [[New York City]]. The system worked at near-atmospheric pressure, and the passenger car moved by means of higher-pressure air applied to the back of the car while somewhat lower pressure was maintained on the front of the car.&lt;ref name="sa18700305"/&gt;

In the 1910s, vacuum trains were first described by American rocket pioneer [[Robert Goddard]].&lt;ref name=economist20130817/&gt; While the Hyperloop has significant innovations over early proposals for reduced pressure or vacuum-tube transportation apparatus, the work of Goddard "appears to have the greatest overlap with the Hyperloop".&lt;ref name="gm20130822"/&gt;

Princeton Physicist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] wrote about transcontinental trains using magnetic propulsion in his book "2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future". While a work of fiction, this book was an attempt to predict future technologies in everyday life. In his prediction, he envisioned these trains which used magnetic levitation running in underground tunnels which had much of the air evacuated to increase speed and reduce friction. He also demonstrated a scale prototype device that accelerated a mass using magnetic propulsion to high speeds. It was called a mass driver and was a central theme in his non-fiction book on space colonization "The High Frontier".

[[Swissmetro]] was a proposal to run a maglev train in a low-pressure environment. Concessions were granted to Swissmetro in the early 2000s to connect the Swiss cities of St. Gallen, Zurich, Basel, and Geneva. Studies of commercial feasibility reached differing conclusions and the vactrain was never built.&lt;ref name="swissmetro"/&gt;

China was reported to be building a vacuum based {{convert|1000|km/h|mph|abbr=on|order=flip|round=50}} maglev train in August 2010 according to a laboratory at Jiaotong University. It was expected to cost {{CNY|10–20 million|link=yes}} ({{US$|2.95 million}} at the August 2010 exchange rate) more per kilometer than regular high-speed rail.&lt;ref name="engadgetsumohurd20100804"/&gt; {{As of|2017|5}}, it has not been built.

===Current===
The [[ET3 Global Alliance]] (ET3) was founded by Daryl Oster in 1997 with the goal of establishing a global transportation system using passenger capsules in frictionless [[magnetic levitation|maglev]] full-vacuum tubes. Oster and his team met with Elon Musk on September 18, 2013, to discuss the technology,&lt;ref name="futurist20131030"/&gt; resulting in Musk promising an investment in a {{convert|3|mi|km|0|adj=on}} prototype of ET3's proposed design.&lt;ref name="denver20130809"/&gt;{{update after|2015|6|17}}&lt;!-- so what is the status of this? are ET3 building anything? --&gt;

==In popular culture==
There are multiple examples of depressurized tubes in literature and media going back to the 19th century. [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1972 book ''[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]'' is an early [[steampunk]] book that give explicit details about how such a system would work both on land and at sea – including the use of underwater bridges to float the tubes across the depths beyond the continental shelf. [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s follow-on to ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'', used a very similar concept – called a "subshuttle" in the program – to quickly move characters from place to place.

The '''IC2MP''' (Institute of Chemistry of Poitiers : Materials and Natural Resources) is a multidisciplinary research institute of the [[University of Poitiers]] ([[France]]) and the [[CNRS]].

== Présentation ==

The '''IC2MP''' is a research laboratory mainly in chemistry and geology. It was created on January 1, 2012, which fields of expertise include the study of materials (clay, catalysts,..), natural environments (waters, soils,..) and the reactions (natural or caused). The major application fields relate to catalysis, synthesis, decontamination, use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gecat.fr/spip.php?site5 Gecat official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IC2MP was born from the merger of four laboratories of Poitiers University (SFA and [[École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Poitiers|ENSI Poitiers]])&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.univ-poitiers.fr/recherche/laboratoires/institut-de-chimie-des-milieux-et-des-materiaux-de-poitiers-ic2mp-umr-7285-9826.kjsp?RH=1328803971990], description of the laboratory, University of Poitiers&lt;/ref&gt; and CNRS&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.cnrs.fr/inc/laboratoires/dr8.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002050341/http://www.cnrs.fr/inc/laboratoires/dr8.php |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}, description of IC2MP by CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; located on the university campus of Poitiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://carteau.onema.fr/contenu/actualites/hydrasa_et_lcme_poitiers_fusionnent_et_deviennent_ic2mp HYDRASA et LCME-Poitiers fusionnent et deviennent IC2MP] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708064255/http://carteau.onema.fr/contenu/actualites/hydrasa_et_lcme_poitiers_fusionnent_et_deviennent_ic2mp |date=2012-07-08 }}, CARTEAU - Office national de l'eau et des milieux aquatiques&lt;/ref&gt;
* HydrASA : Hydrogeology, Clays, Soils, Alteration, situated in the South of the campus;
* LACCO: Laboratory Catalysis in Organic Chemistry.
* LCME: Laboratory Chemistry and Microbiology of Water. Created in 1974 under the name of Laboratory of Chemistry of Water and Nuisances, then changed in 1996 to become the Laboratory of Water and Environment Chemistry; it has then become LCME in 2008.
* SRSN : Synthesis and Reactivity of Natural Substances.

The institute IC2MP includes five research teams:
* Water, organic geochemistry, health ;
* HydrASA - Hydrogeology, clay soils and alterations ; 
* SAMCat - From the active site to the catalysis material ;
* Calalysis and unconventional media ;
* Organic synthesis. 
The scientific team « Water, organic geochemistry, health », with the [[École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Poitiers|ENSIP]] and the [http://apten.asso.univ-poitiers.fr APTEN], are the initiators of the ‘Water Information Day’ (the [[Journées Information Eaux]]), a bi-annual event which occurs around the opening of the academic year.

== Some research works ==

* In 2008, the discovery of more than 250 well-preserved fossils in Gabon brought, for the first time, the proof of the existence of pluricellular organisms which lived 2.1 billion years ago, a crucial advance in the understanding of the origin of life. So far, the first forms of complex life (with multiple cells) previously found were dated back 600 million years.  These works were published in 2010 in the magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100630/full/news.2010.323.html Ancient macrofossils unearthed in West Africa], ''Nature'', June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This major and unexpected discovery, conducted by the team of Professor [[Abderrazak El Albani]] gave birth to a cross-disciplinary research project within the IC2MP Institute aiming at studying organic and primitive materials and Paleo-environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1753.htm CNRS Article 30 June 2010 Discovery of a complex, multicellular life from over two billion years ago]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cancer: a new therapeutic molecule which attacks only the tumourous cells. In 2012, a study led by the researchers of the IC2MP, supported by the Cancéropôle Grand Ouest, resulted in the finalization of the therapeutic targeting  system, which is programmed to transport a powerful anti-cancer agent through the tumorous cells, without affecting the healthy tissue usually damaged by classical therapies. The validity of this concept was demonstrated on mouses, in the context of the treatment of a solid tumor. This study, which represents a new hope in the fight against cancer, has been published in the international edition of  [[Angewandte Chemie]] as a “Very Important Paper” (VIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.201204935 | volume=51 | title=The First Generation of β-Galactosidase-Responsive Prodrugs Designed for the Selective Treatment of Solid Tumors in Prodrug Monotherapy | year=2012 | journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition | pages=11606–11610 | last1 = Legigan | first1 = Thibaut}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was directed by Sébastien Papot, lecturer at University of Poitiers and leader of the Research Group “[http://smp.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/ Programmed Molecular Systems]”, part of the research team Organic Synthesis.

The '''Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics''' (ITEP; [[Russian language|Russian]] Институт теоретической и экспериментальной физики) is a multi-disciplinary research center located in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. ITEP carries out research in the fields of theoretical and mathematical physics, astrophysics, high energy particle physics, nuclear physics, plasma physics, solid state physics, nanotechnology, reactor and accelerator physics, medical physics, and computer science. ITEP also maintains an extensive educational program and organizes physics schools for scholars and undergraduates. The institute occupies part of the former estate "Cheryomushki-Znamenskoye" - a monument of architecture and landscape art of the 18th-19th centuries.

== History ==
ITEP was established on December 1, 1945, initially carrying the name "Laboratory №3", with the purpose of conceiving a heavy water nuclear reactor and cosmic ray studies. Developed of the theoretical part [[KS 150]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itepnew.itep.ru/index.php/ob-institute/istoriya/item/66-kratkaya-istoricheskaya-spravka |title=Краткая историческая справка |accessdate=2018-09-26 |website=НИЦ «Курчатовский институт» — ИТЭФ }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the years the institute expanded its research programme into high energy particle physics, astrophysics, medical physics and other related fields.

== Research ==
The school conducts original scientific research in several fields of physics and technology. Research areas in theoretical physics concentrate around [[quantum field theory]] including the [[string theory]]. Experimental research includes active participation in large international projects, such as the [[CERN]]'s [[LHC]] experiments, as well as smaller, national and locally managed projects.

== 2012 controversy ==
A large group of scientists at the ITEP are protesting about the Russian government's plan to merge ITEP with the [[Kurchatov Institute]]. According to them, the real purpose of the move is to effectively "kill" ITEP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/russian-physicists-protest-government-consolidation-1.9921 ''Russian physicists protest government consolidation. Restrictive policies are affecting international collaboration''], Nature, 27 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4784">'''Intelligent control''' is a class of [[Control theory|control]] techniques that use various [[artificial intelligence]] computing approaches like [[artificial neural networks|neural networks]], [[Bayesian probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[machine learning]], [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://engineering.purdue.edu/ManLab/control/intell_control.htm|title= Intelligent control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Intelligent control can be divided into the following major sub-domains:
* [[Neural network]] control
* [[Machine learning control]]
* [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] control
* [[Fuzzy control]]
* [[Neuro-fuzzy]] control
* [[Expert System]]s
* [[Genetic algorithm|Genetic control]]
* [[Intelligent agent]]s (Cognitive/Conscious control)

New control techniques are created continuously as new models of intelligent behavior are created and computational methods developed to support them.

=== Neural network controllers ===
[[Neural networks]] have been used to solve problems in almost all spheres of science and technology. Neural network control basically involves two steps:

* System identification
* Control

It has been shown that a [[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]] network with nonlinear, continuous and differentiable activation functions have [[universal approximation theorem|universal approximation]] capability. [[recurrent neural network|Recurrent]] networks have also been used for system identification. Given, a set of input-output data pairs, system identification aims to form a mapping among these data pairs. Such a network is supposed to capture the dynamics of a system.

=== Bayesian controllers ===
[[Bayesian probability]] has produced a number of algorithms that are in common use in many advanced control systems, serving as [[State space (controls)|state space]]  [[estimator]]s of some variables that are used in the controller.

The [[Kalman filter]] and the [[Particle filter]] are two examples of popular Bayesian control components. The Bayesian approach to controller design often requires an important effort in deriving the so-called system model and measurement model, which are the mathematical relationships linking the state variables to the sensor measurements available in the controlled system. In this respect, it is very closely linked to the
[[Systems theory|system-theoretic approach]] to [[Control engineering|control design]].

Jacquard.jpg|thumb|This portrait of [[Joseph Marie Jacquard|Jacquard]] was woven in [[silk]] on a Jacquard loom and required 24,000 punched cards to create (1839). It was only produced to order.

The '''Jacquard machine''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒakaʁ|lang}}) is a device fitted to a [[power loom]] that simplifies the process of manufacturing [[textiles]] with such complex patterns as [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], [[damask]] and [[matelassé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |title=Fabric Glossary |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170019/http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "The Age of Revolution", (London 1962; repr. 2008), p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The loom was controlled by a "chain of cards"; a number of [[punched card]]s laced together into a continuous sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
  |title= The London journal of arts and sciences (and repertory of patent inventions) |date= June 1, 1866 |page= 334

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. Several such paper cards, generally white in color, can be seen in the images below. Chains, like Bouchon's earlier use of [[paper tape]], allowed sequences of any length to be constructed, not limited by the size of a card.

It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen [[Basile Bouchon]] (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and [[Jacques Vaucanson]] (1740).&lt;ref&gt;[[#RAZY|C. Razy]] p.120 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; A static display of a Jacquard loom is the centrepiece of the [[Musée des Tissus et des Arts décoratifs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museedestissus.com |title=Musée des Tissus et des Arts Décoratifs |publisher=Museedestissus.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lyon.  Live displays of a Jacquard loom are available at a few private museums around Lyon and also twice a day at La Maison des Canuts, as well as at other locations around the world.

Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving inventions as Jacquard [[shedding (loom)|shedding]] made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving. The term "Jacquard" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles, such as [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrillo Chapman|first=Lisa|title=Textile Design Engineering Within the Product Shape|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=1109003986|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaHxO8qgZFYC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=jacquard+knitting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1K8YUbyEJ4yo0AXOkoDgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jacquard%20knitting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].

==History==
[[File:Telaio Jacquard 1849.jpg|thumb|19th century Jacquard loom]]
In former times, if figured designs were required, this was done on a [[drawloom]]. The [[heddle]]s with warp ends to be pulled up were manually selected by a second operator (draw boy), apart from the weaver. It was slow and labour-intensive, with practical limitations on the complexity of the pattern.

The first important improvement of the draw loom took place in 1725, when [[Basile Bouchon]] introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, and the length of the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine subsequently evolved from this.

Joseph Marie Jacquard recognized that although weaving was intricate, it was repetitive, and saw that a [[mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] could be developed for the production of sophisticated patterns just as it had been done for the production of simple patterns.

It is difficult to determine what part of the 'Jacquard' machine was designed by Jacquard himself. He may have combined the best mechanical elements of other inventors, but - at any rate - the machine he made must have differed from its predecessors in arrangement and minor working details. It was similar in most general principles to [[Vaucanson]]'s arrangement, except that he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual paste board cards and his square prism (or card 'cylinder'), which he is credited with having fully perforated on each of its four sides in lieu of [[Vaucanson]]'s perforated 'barrel'. Jacquard's machine also contained eight rows of needles and uprights as compared with [[Vaucanson]]'s double row, of which modifications enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.

One of the chief advantages claimed for the Jacquard machine was that unlike previous damask-weaving machines, in which the figuring shed was usually drawn once for every four shots, with the new apparatus, it could be drawn on every shot, thus producing a fabric with greater definition of outline.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Fred (1912). ''Jacquard Mechanisms and Harness Mounting''. John Heywood Ltd., Technical Book Depot, Halifax, Yorks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacquard's invention had a deep influence on [[Charles Babbage]]. In that respect, he is viewed by some authors as a precursor of modern [[computing]] science.&lt;ref&gt;Essinger, James (2004). ''Jacquard's web''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280578-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation==
[[File:Jacquard 2.jpg|thumb|Jacquard 2]]
On the diagram to the right, the cards are fastened into a continuous chain(1) which passes over a square box.  At each quarter rotation a new card is presented to the Jacquard head which represents one row.  The box swings from the right to the position shown and presses against the control rods(2).  Where there is a hole the rod passes through the card and is unmoved whereas if the hole is not punched the rod is pushed to the left.  Each rod acts upon a hook(3).  When the rod is pushed in the hook moves out of position to the left, a rod that is not pushed in leaves its hook in place.  A beam(4) then rises under the hooks and those hooks in the rest location are raised; the hooks that have been displaced are not moved by the beam.  Each hook can have multiple cords(5).  The cords pass through a guide(6) and are attached to their [[heddle]](7) and a return weight(8).  The heddles raise the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] to create the [[shed (weaving)|shed]] through which the [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] carrying the [[weft]] will pass.  A loom with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.

The term "Jacquard loom" is somewhat inaccurate.  It is the "Jacquard head" that adapts to a great many [[dobby loom]]s that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in [[Jacquard weaving]].

Jacquard looms, although relatively common in the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, unlike jacquard looms, they are not capable of producing so many different weaves from one [[Warp (weaving)|warp]].  Modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers in place of the original punched cards, and can have thousands of hooks.

The threading of a Jacquard loom is so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once. Subsequent [[Warp (weaving)|warp]]s are then tied into the existing warp with the help of a knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually.  Even for a small loom with only a few thousand [[Warp (weaving)|warp ends]] the process of re-threading can take days.

==Mechanical Jacquard looms==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.cards.jpg|right|thumb|Punched cards in use in a Jacquard loom.]]
[[File:Masson Mills WTM 10 Jacquard Card Cutter 5890.JPG|thumb|A punch for Jacquard cards]]
Originally the Jacquard machines were [[machine|mechanical]], and the fabric design was stored in a series of [[punched card]]s which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the loom width.

A [[factory]] must choose looms and shedding mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule the more warp control required the greater the expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a [[Dobby loom|dobby mechanism]]. As well as the capital expense, the Jacquard machines are more costly to maintain, as they are complex and require higher skilled personnel; an expensive design system is required to prepare the designs for the loom, and possibly a card-cutting machine. Weaving is more costly since Jacquard mechanisms are more likely to produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. For these reasons it is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.

==Electronic Jacquard looms==
It is recorded that in 1855 a Frenchman &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/irishlinentrade00smitgoog#page/n110/mode/2up/ The Irish Linen Trade Hand-Book and Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; adapted the Jacquard mechanism to a system by which it could be worked by electro-magnets. There was significant interest, however trials were not successful, and the development was soon lost in history.

Bonas Machine Company Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonas.co.uk/ Bonas.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; launched the first successful electronic Jacquard at ITMA,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cematex.org/ Cematex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milan]] in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly and may not be required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single end warp control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.

[[Linen]] products associated with Jacquard weaving are linen damask napery, Jacquard apparel fabrics and damask bed linen.

Jacquard weaving of course uses all sorts of fibers and blends of fibers, and it is used in the production of fabrics for many end uses. Research is under way to develop layered and shaped items as reinforcing components for structures made from [[composite material]]s.

==Importance in computing==
The Jacquard head used replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations.  It is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to change the pattern of the loom's weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of [[computer programming]] and data entry. [[Charles Babbage]] knew of Jacquard looms and planned to use cards to store programs in his [[Analytical Engine]]. In the late 19th century, [[Herman Hollerith]] took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the [[1890 U.S. Census]]. A large data processing industry using punched-card technology, developed in the first half of the twentieth century{{mdash}}dominated initially by the [[International Business Machine]] corporation (IBM), with its line of [[unit record equipment]]. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by [[plugboard]]s.

Some early computers, such as the 1944 [[IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator]] (Harvard Mark I) received program instructions from a paper tape punched with holes, similar to Jacquard's string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid 1980s.

'''John Ruskin''' (8 February 1819&amp;nbsp;– 20 January 1900) was the leading English [[art critic]] of the [[Victorian era]], as well as an art patron, [[Drawing|draughtsman]], [[watercolor|watercolourist]], a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as [[geology]], [[architecture]], myth, [[ornithology]], [[literature]], [[education]], [[botany]] and [[political economy]].

His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.

He was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability and craft.

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J.M.W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is "truth to nature". From the 1850s, he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;{{cite ODNB|first=Robert |last=Hewison| id=24291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John James Ruskin, (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer,&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]). John James was born and brought up in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to a mother from [[Glenluce]] and a father originally from [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage: A Prelude'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Margaret Cox, née Cock (1781–1871), was the daughter of an aunt on the English side of the family and a publican in [[Croydon]].&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; She had joined the Ruskin household when she became companion to John James's mother, Catherine.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;

John James had hoped to practice law, and was articled as a clerk in London.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; His father, John Thomas Ruskin, described as a grocer (but apparently an ambitious wholesale merchant), was an incompetent businessman. To save the family from bankruptcy, John James, whose prudence and success were in stark contrast to his father, took on all debts, settling the last of them in 1832.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; John James and Margaret were engaged in 1809, but opposition to the union from John Thomas, and the issuance of the debt, delayed their wedding which was finally conducted without celebration in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gill Viljoen, ''Ruskin's Scottish Heritage'' (University of Illinois Press, 1956) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; John James died on 3 March 1864 and is buried in the churchyard of St John the Evangelist, Shirley, Croydon.

===Childhood and education===
[[File:John Ruskin by James Northcote.jpg|thumb|Ruskin as a young child, painted by [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]].]]
Ruskin was born at 54 Hunter Street, [[Brunswick Square]], London (demolished 1969), south of [[St Pancras railway station]].&lt;ref name="Childhood"&gt;''ODNB''  (2004) "Childhood and education"&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was characterised by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son's [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]], in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/] {{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Ruskin, an [[Low church|Evangelical]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}} Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[King James Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.

Ruskin's childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished c. 1912), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Dearden, John Ruskin's Camberwell (Brentham Press for Guild of St George, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not the friendless and toyless experience he later claimed in his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89).&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, and from 1834 to 1835 attended the school in [[Peckham]] run by the progressive Evangelical, Thomas Dale (1797–1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm |title=UCL Bloomsbury Project |website=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at [[King's College London|King's College, London]], where Dale was the first Professor of English Literature.&lt;ref name="Childhood"/&gt; Ruskin went on to enroll and complete his studies at [[King's College London|King's College]], where he prepared for [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] under Dale's tutelage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/history/famouspeople/johnkeats.aspx |title=King's College London - John Keats |website=Kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pookpress.co.uk/project/john-ruskin-biography/ |title=John Ruskin Biography &gt;&gt; Classic Stories |website=Pookpress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|upright|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives]]
Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. Travel helped establish his taste and augmented his education. His father visited business clients in Britain's country houses, exposing him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his 1830 tour)&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to relations in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope, so that in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], Milan, [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed his lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 he first visited [[Venice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 'Paradise of cities' that formed both the symbolism and subject of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.453n2}}

The tours provided Ruskin with the opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship's Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of [[Samuel Rogers]]'s poem, ''Italy'' (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and [[Samuel Prout]] whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding]].

===First publications of Ruskin===
Ruskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem "On Skiddaw and Derwent Water" (originally entitled "Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater" and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=2.265-8}} In 1834, three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close "scientific" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.191-6}}

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin's ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name "Kata Physin" (Greek for "According to Nature").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings which centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials, and anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin's 'Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science' was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.206-10}}

===Oxford===
In [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017013829/http://artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&amp;name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford |archivedate=17 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolled as a [[gentleman-commoner]], he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers.  Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].

His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).&lt;ref&gt;For his winning poem, "Salsette and Elephanata", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Dearden, "The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===
[[File:Portrait of John Ruskin (4671937).jpg|thumb|Engraving of John Ruskin by Henry Sigismund Uhlrich]]
Much of the period, from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev [[John Eagles]], in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and, from 1839, Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]] under the anonymous but authoritative title, "A Graduate of Oxford," was Ruskin's response to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]'s critics. An electronic edition is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm |title=the electronic edition of John Ruskin's "Modern Painters" Volume I |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=28 June 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called "[[Old Masters]]" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]], unlike Turner, favoured pictorial convention, and not "truth to nature". He explained that he meant "moral as well as material truth".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio—to render what he has seen and understood imaginatively on canvas, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the "truths" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin's relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent again with his parents in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]] but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on [[Venice]]: "Venice is lost to me," he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–01.&lt;/ref&gt; It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only true course was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated more on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: "the Beautiful as a gift of God".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}}  In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively through symbols. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to take.&lt;ref&gt;See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]] just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==
[[File:Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais by Thomas Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Effie Gray painted by [[Thomas Richmond]]. She thought the portrait made her look like "a graceful Doll".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?LinkID=mp07473&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=art |title=NPG 5160; Effie Gray (Lady Millais) – Portrait |publisher= National Portrait Gallery |website=Npg.org.uk |date=26 December 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for Effie that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html |title=May 7th 1828 |publisher=Perthshire Diary |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Largely owing to this association, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds' earliest travelling together was limited, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]] (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill) secured for them by Ruskin's father. Effie was too ill to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring the social conscience that became increasingly sensitive.

The marriage, not consummated, later dissolved under discord and eventual annulment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Phyllis |year=2010 |title=Parallel lives five Victorian marriages |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0307761509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
Ruskin's developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his work.

''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of [[A. W. N. Pugin]].

In August 1850 Ruskin and Effie were at [[Wenlock Abbey]] where Ruskin sketched some of the arcading in the Norman [[Chapter House]], which was used in ''The Stones of Venice''.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, October 2013, Ruskin Lost in Shades of Gray, Shropshire Magazine, pp. 74–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Stones of Venice''===
In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html |title=Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks 1849–50 |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=20 March 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' also reflected Ruskin's view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, 'The Nature of Gothic' appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan's joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, not machinery.

{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and socialist, [[William Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pre-Raphaelites===
[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pp. 228–34, April 1996. (Accessed via [[JSTOR]], UK.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had established the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to 'naturalism'&amp;nbsp;– "paint[ing] from nature only",{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.357n}} depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin came into contact with Millais after the artists approached him through their mutual friend [[Coventry Patmore]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to ''[[The Times]]'' in May 1851.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=12.319–335}} Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at [[Glenfinlas]], he painted the closely observed landscape background of [[gneiss]] rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin's [[John Ruskin (painting)|portrait]].

Millais had painted Effie for ''[[The Order of Release|The Order of Release, 1746]]'', exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

In April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of "non-consummation" owing to his "incurable [[impotence|impotency]],"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; a charge Ruskin later disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wrote, "I can prove my virility at once."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of continued speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''ODNB'': "Critic of Contemporary Art".&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who became a good friend (he called him "Brother Ned").&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making and breaking reputations. The satirical magazine, ''[[punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', for example, published the lines (24 May 1856), "I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I'm dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=udKymsQhKMEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20paints%20and%20paints%2C%2Fhears%20no%20complaints%2FAnd%20sells%20before%20I%E2%80%99m%20dry%2C%2FTill%20savage%20Ruskin%20sticks%20his%20tusk%20in%2FThen%20nobody%20will%20buy ] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] drawings to the [[Ashmolean]] in [[Oxford]], and a further 25 to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |title=Fitzwilliam Museum Collections Explorer |website=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903031532/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/turner/info.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.&lt;ref&gt;The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000), curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]]. The [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in the ''Little Church of St Francis'' Funtley, [[Fareham, Hampshire]] is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the ''St. Peter's Church'' Duntisbourne Abbots near [[Cirencester]], the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Low &amp; Julie Graham, ''The stained glass window of the Little Church of St. Francis'', private publication August 2002 &amp; April 2006, for viewing Fareham Library reference Section or the [[Westbury Manor Museum]] Ref: section Fareham, hants; [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.low1/funtley/funtleychurch.htm The stained glass window of the Church of St. Francis.

Ruskin's theories also inspired some architects to adapt the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive "Ruskinian Gothic".&lt;ref&gt;J. Mordaunt Crook, "Ruskinian Gothic" in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'' ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Through his friendship with [[Sir Henry Acland]], from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]]) which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum's development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities' less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin and education===
The [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin's first direct involvement in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm |title=John Ruskin on education |website=Infed.org |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805231329/http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin's ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.&lt;ref&gt;''ODNB''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing embraced by its principal, Miss Bell.&lt;ref&gt;''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin's correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association led to Ruskin's sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (published December 1865, imprinted 1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington girls in which he cast himself as the "Old Lecturer".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cole, ''"Be Like Daisies": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon [[Somerville College]], one of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s first two [[women's college]]s, which he visited regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Anne|title=Breaking New Ground: A History of Somerville College as seen through its Buildings|page=12|date=2013|publisher=Somerville College|location=Oxford|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated many of his books to the [[Somerville College Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108093838/http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/4054/History%20of%20the%20library.html |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===
Both volumes III and IV of ''Modern Painters'' were published in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is "the expression of the spirits of great men".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. ''MP'' IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and its moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, "The Mountain Glory" and "The Mountain Gloom"&lt;ref&gt;Francis O'Gorman, "Ruskin's Mountain Gloom" in Rachel Dickinson and Keith Hanley (eds), ''Ruskin's Struggle for Coherence: Self-Representation through Art, Place and Society'' (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), pp. 76–89.&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early example of Ruskin's social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.385–417, 418–68}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Ruskin‟s Dialectic: Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory" in ''Ruskin Programme Bulletin'', no. 25 (January 2001), pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public lecturer===
In addition to his more formal teaching classes, Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer in the 1850s. His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], Manchester in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]'s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.9-174}} He spoke about how to acquire, and how to use art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation's well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin's intervention outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|"Manchester School" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''[[Manchester Examiner and Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–05.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L. Spates. [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/vanburd1.html An Introduction to Helen Gill Viljoen's Unpublished Biography of Ruskin by Van Akin Burd]; [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/spates/spates1.html Editor's Introductory Comments on Viljoen's Chapter by James L.

Spates].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day [[Anglia Ruskin University]] has grown.&lt;ref&gt;For the address itself, see Cook and Wedderburn 16.177–206, and for the wider context: Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and Cambridge" in ''The Companion'' (Newsletter of The Guild of St. George) no.7 (2007), pp.8–10. [Revised version of inaugural Ruskin Lecture, Anglia Ruskin University, 11 October 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Two Paths'' (1859), five lectures given in London, [[Manchester]], [[Bradford]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge]]{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251–426}} Ruskin argued that a 'vital law' underpins art and architecture, drawing on the [[labour theory of value]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.251}} (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp.&amp;nbsp;427–87.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, to Germany and [[Switzerland]].

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner's]] death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner's will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. In 1856, Ruskin's book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner's drawings, was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858: cataloguing, framing and conserving.&lt;ref&gt;For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin's design.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner's erotic drawings,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1 (Spring 2003), pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt; but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davis, "Misinterpreting Ruskin: New light on the "dark clue‟ in the basement of the National Gallery, 1857–58" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 35–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below, [[John Ruskin#Turner's erotic drawings|Controversies: Turner's Erotic Drawings]])

===Religious "unconversion"===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]] where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the Queen of Sheba''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his "unconversion" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.89}} But in reality he had doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, threatened by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "those dreadful hammers!" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], "I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.115}} This "loss of faith" precipitated a considerable crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.2.html |title=Chapter Four, Section II. Loss of Belief |website=Victorianweb.org |date=25 July 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to Christianity.&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"&gt;http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social critic and reformer: ''Unto This Last''===
{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=Whenever I look or travel in England or abroad, I see that men, wherever they can reach, destroy all beauty. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 7.V.422–3 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

Although Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, "I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life" the break was not so dramatic or final.&lt;ref&gt;E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin's emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end of the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'', ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.&lt;ref&gt;On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn  18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
|quote=There is no wealth but life. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration.

|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.105&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider wider issues of citizenship, and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays, ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the "science" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.&lt;ref&gt;For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by a politics of [[social justice]]. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the "[[social economy]]" characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.15–118}} However, its editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, "reprobated in a violent manner".&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin's friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, "I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;Q. in James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's political ideas, and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' in particular, later proved highly influential, praised and paraphrased in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], a wide range of autodidacts, the economist [[John A. Hobson]] and many of the founders of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour party]].&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of Ruskin's social and political thought: Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (I.B. Tauris, 2007) and Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote "I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn  27.167 and 35.13.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in duties and responsibilities to, and under, God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

{{Quote|text=If there be any one point insisted on throughout my works more frequently than another, that one point is the impossibility of Equality. My continual aim has been to show the eternal superiority of some men to others, sometimes even of one man to all others; and to show also the advisability of appointing such persons or person to guide, to lead, or on occasion even to compel and subdue, their inferiors, according to their own better knowledge and wiser will. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 17.34&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of  ''[[Modern Painters]]'' focused on [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Titian]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest art are held together, like human communities, in quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive. Uniting ''[[Modern Painters]]'' V and ''[[Unto This Last]]'' is Ruskin's "Law of Help":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/galib64.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date=6 July 2002 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Government and cooperation are in all things and eternally the laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all things, the laws of death. |source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 7.207 and 17.25.&lt;/small&gt;}}

Ruskin's next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', under the editorship of [[James Anthony Froude]], cut short his ''Essays on Political Economy'' (1862–63) (later collected as ''Munera Pulveris'' (1872)).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.129–298}}  Ruskin explored further political themes in ''Time and Tide'' (1867),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.309–484}} his letters to Thomas Dixon, the cork-cutter in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]] with a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin's sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father's death in 1864, Ruskin inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison's ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: "A Mid-Life Crisis").&lt;/ref&gt; This considerable inheritance from the father he described on his tombstone as "an entirely honest merchant"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils), by buying property in [[Marylebone]] for her philanthropic housing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Ruskin's endeavours extended to a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men's Institute, [[Camberwell]] on "Work" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War'. Ruskin's widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html |title=Moral Taste in Ruskin's "Traffic" |website=Victorianweb.org |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I do not care about this Exchange," Ruskin told his audience, "because ''you'' don't!"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.383–533}}

[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]
The lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. "Of Kings' Treasuries" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. "Of Queens' Gardens" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin's most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.19-187}} The book's reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at "Of Queens' Gardens" particularly as an effort to "subvert the new heresy" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millett, Sexual Politics.  New York: Doubleday and Co., 1970, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford's first Slade Professor of Fine Art===
[[File:Vanity Fair Caricature of Ruskin.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1872]]
Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University]] in August 1869, largely through the offices of his friend, [[Henry Acland]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 165–68.&lt;/ref&gt; He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, "The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues.". Thus, its effect on each man should be visible and moving.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann (1988:121)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil Rhodes]] cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Symonds, 'Oxford and the Empire', in [[M. G. Brock]] and M. C. Curthoys (eds.), ''The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VII: Nineteenth-Century Oxford, part 2'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 689–716, specifically p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at [[Oxford]], [[The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/holdings/Ruskin%20School%20of%20Art%20RS.pdf |title=Oxford University Archives &amp;#124; Home |website=Oua.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally accommodated within the [[Ashmolean Museum]] but now occupies premises on "the High" (High Street). Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) with which to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government schools (the "South Kensington System").&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"&gt;See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Bibliography). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of "Art" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle's Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. "The teaching of Art...," Ruskin wrote, "is the teaching of all things."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist's work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis O' Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 |title=John Ruskin green plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, which included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin's future secretary and biographer, [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably [[Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.&lt;/ref&gt; and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, "Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, resigning again in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Latter Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],&lt;ref&gt;Jed Mayer, "Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–22.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].&lt;ref name="See Robert Hewison 1996"/&gt; He was also suffering increasingly poor health.

===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler Libel Case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his (originally) monthly "letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his [[Work of art|oeuvre]], and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]).

In the July 1877 letter of ''Fors Clavigera'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.160}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v. Ruskin''. – book review, ''Art in America'', January 1993, by Wendy Steiner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827175109/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 |date=27 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin. Whistler won the case, which went to trial in Ruskin's absence in 1878 (he was ill), but the jury awarded damages of only one [[British farthing coin|farthing]] to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin's were paid by public subscription, but Whistler was bankrupted within six months. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, however, and may have accelerated his mental decline.&lt;ref&gt;For an exploration of Ruskin's rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, "Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin's consistently exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in "blood-red".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Guild of St George===
Ruskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George's Fund, and then St George's Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27–29}} A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called "Companions" whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally.&lt;ref&gt;For the Guild's constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn  30.3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal mechanical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235259/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1940&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired some land and a remarkable collection of books, art and other precious and beautiful objects.&lt;ref&gt;On the origins of the Guild: Edith Hope Scott, ''Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Methuen, 1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin purchased land initially in [[Totley]], near [[Sheffield]], but the agricultural element of his scheme met with only moderate success after many difficulties. Donations of land from wealthy and committed Companions eventually placed land and properties in the Guild's care: [[Wyre Forest]], near [[Bewdley]], Worcestershire;&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Wardle and Cedric Quayle, ''Ruskin and Bewdley'' (Brentham Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barmouth]], in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]]; [[Cloughton]], in [[North Yorkshire]]; and [[Westmill]] in Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ruskinland.htm |title=Ruskinland |website=Utopia-britannica.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of "Companion", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild's own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George's Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd's Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]], publishing some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable organisation, has only ever operated on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin's Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George's Mill was established at [[Laxey]], on the [[Isle of Man]] producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent, but allied, efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press Ltd., 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sheffield]], in 1875, Ruskin established a museum for the working men of that city, and surrounding areas. Originally situated in [[Walkley]] and curated by Henry Swan, St. George's Museum housed a large collection of art works (original pencil sketches, architectural drawings, watercolours, copies of Old Masters and so on), minerals, geological specimens, manuscripts (many of them medieval in origin) and a multitude of other beautiful and precious items.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Sheffield City Council, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, "the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise confined to the wealthy who could afford to travel through Europe. The original Museum has been virtually recreated online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ |title=Ruskin at Walkley |publisher=Ruskin at Walkley |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]]. The collection is currently (2011) on display at [[Sheffield]]'s [[Millennium Galleries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/collections/ruskin-collection |title=eMuseum |website=Museums-sheffield.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose La Touche===
[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rose La Touche'', as sketched by Ruskin]]
Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten, Ruskin nearly 39. Ruskin gradually fell in love with her. Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin's own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildar''e [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; "Ruskin‟s "Wild Rose of Kildare", pp. 29–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him, and always a source of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;See Van Akin Burd, ''John Ruskin and Rose La Touche: Her unpublished Diaries of 1861 and 1867'' (Clarendon Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867, but she asked him to wait three years for an answer, until she was 21. A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter. She finally rejected him in 1872, but they still occasionally met, for the final time on 15 February 1875. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature. Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]] and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones "to give," he said, "what guidance I may to travallers..."&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new "Travellers' Edition" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark's Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).

===Return to belief===
In December 1875, Ruskin's desire for a meaningful universe and a life after death, both for himself and his loved ones, brought him back to Christianity. He never publicly related the date and cause of his return to belief, but his letters demonstrate that on 20 December 1875, a spiritualist seance at Broadlands convinced him that the ghost of Rose La Touche had appeared at his side.

While the direct link between Ruskin's faith and this event cannot be made, his subsequent writings demonstrate a return to Christianity. In ''Praeterita'' he affirms that [[Christ]] will return "and judge every man according to his work". These beliefs were often unquestioning, and even anti-intellectual. An example of this is a letter of 1876, in which he did "not think the question of the Trinity or Unity is one for Man to discuss."&lt;ref name="victorianweb.org"/&gt;

===Final writings===
[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]
In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.265–397}} and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin's ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, 'Of Past Things'), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the "l'art pour l'art" or "art for art's sake" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.

===Brantwood===
[[File:John Ruskin's grave, and family plot - geograph.org.uk - 1231315.jpg|thumb|Grave of John Ruskin, in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] churchyard]]
In August 1871, Ruskin purchased from [[W. J. Linton]] the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]], on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ |title=Museum, Arts Centre &amp; Self Catering Accommodation Coniston |website=Brantwood.org.uk |date=14 April 2017 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.&lt;ref&gt;For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ruskin's 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with a congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324235342/https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw%3A1m1674&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Brantwood]] from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], according to his wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/M076100/John-Ruskins-Grave-at-Coniston?img=163&amp;search=RANDOM&amp;cat=&amp;bool=and |title= Look and Learn History Picture Library |website=Lookandlearn.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness (thought in retrospect to have been [[CADASIL syndrome]]), he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly "companion" to Ruskin's mother) and she inherited his estate. "Joanna's Care" was the eloquent final chapter of his memoir which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.&lt;ref&gt;For Ruskin's relationship with Joan Severn, see ''John Ruskin's Correspondence with Joan Severn: Sense and Nonsense Letters'' ed. Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin's secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his Will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin's ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to articulate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin's thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin's public and personal reputation.&lt;ref&gt;James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, 'John Ruskin‟s Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no. 1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centenary of Ruskin's birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of Ruskin's home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;See James S. Dearden, ''Ruskin, Bembridge and Brantwood: the Growth of the Whitehouse Collection'' (Ryburn, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, it was opened to the public as a permanent memorial to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brantwood.org.uk/temp.../History%20of%20Brantwood%202pp.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal appearance===
In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander MacEwen, who attended Ruskin's lectures at Oxford, reported that the papers described him thus. See David Smith Cairns, ''Life and times of Alexander Robertson MacEwen, D.D'' (Hodder and Stoughton, 1925), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth.&lt;ref&gt;See [[H. W. Nevinson]], ''Changes and Chances'' (James Nisbet, 1923), pp. 53–55 and [[J. A. Spender]], ''Life, Journalism and Politics'' (Cassell &amp; Co., 1927), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an "Old Testament" prophet.

In 1884, the 17-year-old [[Beatrix Potter]] spotted Ruskin at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] exhibition. She wrote in her journal, "Mr Ruskin was one of the most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not particularly clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Linder, ed. (1966) ''The Journal of Beatrix Potter''. London: Frederick Warne &amp; Co. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===International===
Ruskin's influence reached across the world. [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] described him as "one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times" and quoted extensively from him, rendering his words into Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''Ruskin and Tolstoy'' (Guild of St George, 2010) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia J. Gamble,  ''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin. The Seven Lamps of Translation'' (Summa Publications, 2002) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] wrote of the "magic spell" cast on him by ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it ''[[Sarvodaya]]'', "The Advancement of All".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin's translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.&lt;ref&gt;Masami Kimura, "Japanese Interest in Ruskin: Some Historical Trends" in Robert E.

[[File:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
A number of [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] [[Ruskin Colonies]] attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included [[Ruskin, Florida]], [[Ruskin, British Columbia]] and the [[Ruskin Colony|Ruskin Commonwealth Association]], a colony which existed in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1899.

Ruskin's work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Chinese, Welsh and even [[Esperanto]] and [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including [[Le Corbusier]], [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]] incorporated Ruskin's ideas in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Daniels and Geoff Brandwood (ed.), ''Ruskin and Architecture'' (Spire Books, 2003) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers as diverse as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Ezra Pound]] felt Ruskin's influence.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Collingwood, Life and Work of John Ruskin (Methuen, 1900) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The American poet [[Marianne Moore]] was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them [[Herbert Read]], [[Roger Fry]] and [[Wilhelm Worringer]] knew Ruskin's work well.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Cianci and Peter Nicholls (eds.)  ''Ruskin and Modernism'' (Palgrave, 2001) and Toni Cerutti (ed.) ''Ruskin and the Twentieth Century: the modernity of Ruskinism'' (Edizioni Mercurio, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver, [[John William Hill]] to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist, [[Eric Gill]]. Aside from [[E. T. Cook]], Ruskin's editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include [[J. A. Spender]], and the war correspondent, [[H. W. Nevinson]].

===Craft and conservation===
[[William Morris]] and [[C. R. Ashbee]] (the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin's legacy can be traced in the [[arts and crafts movement]]. Ruskin's ideas on preservation of open spaces and conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends, [[Octavia Hill]] and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], to help found the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill Download Samuel Jones (ed.), ''The Enduring Relevance of Octavia Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618093500/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/octaviahill |date=18 June 2012 }} and see specifically, Robert Hewison, "'You are doing some of the work that I ought to do': Octavia Hill and Ruskinian values", pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and education===
Pioneers of [[urban planning|town planning]], such as [[Thomas Coglan Horsfall]] and [[Patrick Geddes]] called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in their writings. The same is true for the founders of the [[garden city movement]], [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Lang ''Designing Utopia: John Ruskin's Urban Vision for Britain and America'' (Black Rose Books Ltd., 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Carpenter]]'s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy's colony at [[Purleigh]], briefly a refuge for the [[Doukhobor]]s, combined Ruskin's ideas and Tolstoy's.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was [[John Howard Whitehouse]], who saved Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established [[Bembridge School]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to [[Michael Ernest Sadler]] wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of Ruskin and education, see Sara Atwood,  ''Ruskin's Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruskin College]], an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and [[Charles A. Beard]].

Ruskin's innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time [[Working Men's College]] pupil, George Allen, whose business was eventually merged to become [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], anticipated the establishment of the [[Net Book Agreement]].

[[Pierre de Coubertin]], the innovator of the modern [[Olympic Games]], used Ruskin's principles of beautification, asserting that the games should be "Ruskinized" to create an aesthetic identity that transcended mere championship competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. 'The masses are much more sensitive to the perfection of the whole than to any separate details': The Influence of John Ruskin's Political Economy on Pierre de Coubertin, in: Olympika, 1996 Vol. V, pp. 25–44. www.library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1996/olympika0501c.pdf;[[Arnd Krüger]].

Ruskin's Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art which he gathered as learning aids for the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]] which he founded at Oxford, is still in the possession of the school, now the Ashmolean Museum. The Museum has promoted Ruskin's art teaching methods using the collection, using them as the basis for in-person and online drawing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ruskin.ashmolean.org/collection/8994/ |title=The Elements of Drawing |access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and economics===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many [[Christian socialism|Christian socialists]], and his ideas informed the work of economists such as [[William Smart (economist)|William Smart]] and [[J. A. Hobson]], and the positivist, [[Frederic Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill Cockram, ''Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age'' (Tauris, 2007) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the [[settlement movement]] in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at [[Toynbee Hall]] such as the later civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and [[William Beveridge]] (author of the [[Beveridge Report|Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services]]), and the future Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British [[welfare state]]. More of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]'s earliest members acknowledged his significance than mentioned [[Karl Marx]] or the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: the social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Oxford University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Ruskin's works have also influenced [[Phillip Blond]] and the [[Red Tory]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Tory intrigues and infuriates|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/30/phillip-blond-red-tory-respublica | work=The Guardian | first=Madeleine|last=Bunting|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruskin in the 21st-century===
Admirers and scholars of Ruskin can visit the [[Ruskin Library]] at [[Lancaster University]], also Ruskin's home, [[Brantwood]], and the [[Ruskin Museum]], both in [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] in the English [[Lake District]].

[[File:John Ruskin Street in London.JPG|thumb|right|John Ruskin Street in [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], London]]
Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name. [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Cambridge]] traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. [[John Ruskin College]], South Croydon, is named after him. The Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today. The Ruskin Art Club is the oldest ladies club in Los Angeles. In addition, there is the [[Ruskin Pottery]], [[Ruskin House]], Croydon and [[Ruskin Hall]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].

[[Ruskin, Florida]], United States—site of one of the short-lived American [[Ruskin Colleges]]—is named for John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled, "Head, Heart And Hands" on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5RcPIY4KU0 |title=Ruskin Community Mural |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] and [[Oliver Lodge]] admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and [[cultural tourism]] (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with [[Thomas Cook]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Newey and Jeffrey Richards ''John Ruskin and the Victorian Theatre'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]], argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout [[Web 2.0]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gauntlett]] ''Making Is Connecting: the social meaning of creativity from DIY and knitting to YouTube and Web 2.0'' (Polity, 2011), pp. 25–36, 217–19; specifically on YouTube, see pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, architectural theorist [[Lars Spuybroek]] has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Spuybroek, ''The Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design'' (V2_NAI Publishers, 2011), pp. 65–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable modern-day Ruskin enthusiasts include the writers [[Geoffrey Hill]] and [[Charles Tomlinson]], and the politicians, [[Patrick Cormack]], [[Frank Judd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012145610/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/frank-judd/26799 |archivedate=12 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] spoke at the [[Art Workers Guild]] on Ruskin, 6 February 2010. Stuart Eagles, '' The Economic Symposium. John Ruskin and the Modern World: Art and Economics, 1860–2010'' in ''The Companion'' no. 10 (2010), pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Benn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/659657 ''Omnibus.

BBC1, 13 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury]], Raficq Abdulla, [[Jonathon Porritt]] and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]] were among those to contribute to the symposium, ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hewison]] (ed.) ''There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century'' (Ruskin To-Day, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Glancey]] at ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Andrew Hill at the ''[[Financial Times]]'' have both written about Ruskin,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hill, ''Introduction'' in John Ruskin, ''Unto This Last'' (Pallas Athene, 2010), pp. 9–16.&lt;/ref&gt; as has the broadcaster [[Melvyn Bragg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Melvyn Bragg]], ''Foreword'' in John Ruskin, ''On Genius'' (Hesperus, 2011), pp. vii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, [[literary criticism]], the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume "Library Edition", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm |title=Ruskin MP I Notes |website=Lancs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, "the spell of his eloquence is broken".&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet &amp; Co., 1898), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that "the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts" is "something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985; and Kindle), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: "go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing."{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites whose members, he said, had formed "a new and noble school" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites |title=Ruskin, Turner and The Pre-Raphaelites |website=Tate.org.uk |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ruskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: "Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv, §35;  Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century, to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts which he had helped to inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and "savage" aspects were proof of "the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure."&lt;ref&gt;John Unrau, Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic, in New Approaches to Ruskin, ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 12.417–32. Cynthia J. Gamble, "John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L‟Harmattan et l‟Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay "The Nature of Gothic" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative "freedom of thought" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works attacking ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' capitalism which he considered to be at the root of it. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].

Ruskin's views on art, wrote [[Kenneth Clark]], "cannot be made to form a [[logical system]], and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value."  Ruskin's accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind's eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin's writing on art and architecture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.'
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, "A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture," in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historic preservation===
Ruskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. Ruskin was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]],'' (1849) Ruskin wrote:

{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=&lt;small&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.&lt;/small&gt;}}

This abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a "means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time."&lt;ref&gt;Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. p. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ruskin, the "age" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: "For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Seven Lamps'' ("The Lamp of Memory") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social theory===
Ruskin attacked orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, "social affections"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy For Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.

The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=&lt;small&gt;Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).&lt;/small&gt; }}

At the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See section, "Stones of Venice", above.)

He argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and 'gentleness and justice'; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Jose Harris, "Ruskin and Social Reform" in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Turner's erotic drawings===
Until 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the [[National Gallery]], was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at [[Tate Britain]], were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] Also see Warrell "Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica", ''British Art Journal'', vol. IV, no. 1, Spring 2003, pp. 15–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DB1738F930A25752C0A9639C8B63 |title=A Censorship Story Goes Up in Smoke – No Bonfire Devoured J.M.W. Turner's Erotica  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 January 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Ruskin's sexuality has led to much speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years because of non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that he found her "person" repugnant.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause of Ruskin's "disgust" has led to much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, [[Mary Lutyens]], suggested that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking.&lt;ref&gt;Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Peter Fuller]] in his book ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' writes, "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto &amp; Windus, 1988, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter, Mary, "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".&lt;ref&gt;Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1950), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he was a [[paedophile]], on the grounds that he stated that he fell in love with her when he met her at the age of nine.&lt;ref&gt;Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Hewison, R, John Ruskin, ''The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,132930,00.html#article_continue The Guardian, review of Batchelor, J., John Ruskin: ''No Wealth but Life'', 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T. ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, "absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her "girlies" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will you – (it's all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills?  And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lurie |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Lurie |title=Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3WROewAACAAJ |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |date=20 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they're not in love with anybody but me.—I've got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_4_86/ai_n31641126/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Philological Quarterly'', Fall, 2007 by Van Akin Burd&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pigwiggina is a nickname Ruskin used for the girl as she looked after (lambs and) piglets; c.f. {{cite book |title=Letters to M. G. and H. G. |url=https://archive.org/stream/letterstomgandhg00rusk/letterstomgandhg00rusk_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruskin's biographers disagree about the allegation of "paedophilia". Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, boldly asserts that Ruskin "was a paedophile" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not "fit the profile".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, T., ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–54; Batchelor, J, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Abse concluded that "the older girls became, the more their attractions diminished in his eyes. He liked them best, as he was to tell his friend Lady Naesmith two years later, when they were 'just in the very rose of dawn'".&lt;ref&gt;Joan Abse, ''John Ruskin – The Passionate Moralist'', Quarter Books, London, 1980, pp. 177–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also point to a definite pattern of "[[Nympholepsy|nympholeptic]]" behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a [[Winnington Hall|Winnington school]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kemp and Jan Van Heurck, ''The Desire of My Eyes: The Life &amp; Work of John Ruskin '', p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was (supposedly in common with his contemporary, [[Lewis Carroll]]) their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.&lt;ref&gt;''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the "[[common law of business balance]]"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as:  "The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot." This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin's authorship is disputed among Ruskin scholars. Shapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin's works,&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fred R. Shapiro]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA657 |title=The Yale Book of Quotations|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=657 |isbn=9780300107982 |accessdate = 7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Landow is likewise sceptical of the claim of Ruskin's authorship.&lt;ref name=Landow2007&gt;{{cite web |last=Landow |first=George P. |title=A Ruskin Quotation? |publisher=VictorianWeb.org |date=27 July 2007 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/quotation.html |accessdate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a posting of the ''Ruskin Library News'', a blog associated with the [[Ruskin Library]] (a major collection of Ruskiniana located at [[Lancaster University]]), an anonymous library staff member briefly mentions the statement and its widespread use, saying that, "This is one of many quotations ascribed to Ruskin, without there being any trace of them in his writings – although someone, somewhere, thought they sounded like Ruskin."&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ruskinlibrary.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/on-the-present-economic-situation/|title=On the present economic situation:|last=Ruskin Library|publisher=Ruskin Library|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruskin Library"/&gt; The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, spoken, or published the statement. Due to the statement's widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin's authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.

==Definitions==
[[File:John Ruskin 1850s 2.jpg|thumb|upright|John Ruskin in the 1850s, photo from the [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]].]]
* [[Pathetic fallacy]]: Ruskin coined this term in ''Modern Painters'' III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in "Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy" (Charlotte Brontë, ''Jane Eyre'').&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Painter''s III (see Part VI, "Of Many Things", c. XII, "Of the Paethetic Fallacy") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''Force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, "Introduction", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ |title=The Fortnightly Review › Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria |website=Fortnightlyreview.co.uk |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to ''the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.''
* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is 'well-being', illth is "ill-being".
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an "excrescence" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival]] features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10333">[[Image:NorthSouth-Expressway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]] in [[Malaysia]]. A roadway can be a line source of [[air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]] and need not be a straight line.]]

A '''line source''', as opposed to a [[point source]], [[area source]], or  [[Volume source (pollution)|volume source]],  is a source of air, noise, water contamination or electromagnetic radiation that emanates from a linear (one-dimensional) geometry.  The most prominent linear sources are [[roadway air dispersion modeling|roadway air pollution]], [[aircraft]] air [[emission standard|emissions]], [[roadway noise]], certain types of water pollution sources that emanate over a range of river extent rather than from a discrete point, elongated light tubes, certain dose models in [[medical physics]] and electromagnetic [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]]. While [[Point source (pollution)|point sources]] of [[pollution]] were studied since the late nineteenth century, linear sources did not receive much attention from scientists until the late 1960s, when environmental regulations for [[highway]]s and [[airport]]s began to emerge. At the same time, computers with the processing power to accommodate the data processing needs of the [[computer model]]s required to tackle these one-dimensional sources became more available.

In addition, this era of the 1960s saw the first emergence of [[environmental scientist]]s who spanned the disciplines required to accomplish these studies. For example, meteorologists, chemists, and computer scientists in the air pollution field were required to build complex models to address [[roadway air dispersion modeling]].  Prior to the 1960s, these specialities tended to work within their own disciplines, but with the advent of [[NEPA]], the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Noise Control Act]] in the United States, and other seminal legislation, the era of multidisciplinary environmental science had begun.

For electromagnetic linear sources, the principal early advances in computer modeling arose in the [[Soviet Union]] and USA when the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]] were fought partially by progress in [[electronic warfare]], including the technologies of active antenna arrays.

==Linear air pollution source==

{{main article|Roadway air dispersion modeling}}

Air pollution levels near major highways and urban [[arterial]]s are in violation of U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards where millions of Americans live or work.  Even the interior of a building does not really protect inhabitants from adverse exterior air quality, since the exterior air is the intake supply, and it is well known that [[indoor air quality]] is typically worse than exterior air.

A roadway travelled by motor vehicles can be idealized by a line source emitting air pollutants.  This mathematical problem was first solved in 1970 by a collaboration of [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hogan, ''Theoretical basis for atmospheric diffusion from a linear source'', ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication IR-29, Sunnyvale, Ca.,  May 4, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Venti, ''Atmospheric diffusion models for roadway sources'', ESL Inc., Environmental Systems Laboratory,  Publication ET-22, Sunnyvale, Ca., October 5, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original theory assumed steady-state traffic conditions and meteorology on a perfectly straight roadway.  Currently the models have evolved to treat variable meteorology, time-variant traffic operations and complex roadbed geometries. Current technology allows highway designers and city planners to analyze alternative roadway development plans and assess air quality impacts.  The same basic model theory can be applied to airport operations, since the linear source is merely an inclined line.  In the early 1970s these ESL models were refined into [[area source]] models to account for the finite width of the roadway.

==Linear noise source==

{{main article|Roadway noise}}

[[Image:Njturnpike.JPG|thumb|300px|left|The [[New Jersey Turnpike]] was one of the earliest line sources analyzed for [[roadway noise|noise]]]]

Roadway noise is the most important example of a linear noise source, since it comprises about 80 percent of the environmental noise exposure for humans worldwide.  In the 1960s, when computer modeling of this phenomenon was perfected, the first applications of linear source noise modeling became systematic.  After passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and Noise Control Act,&lt;ref&gt;''Public Law No. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234 (1972) Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972'',  codification amended at 42 U.S.C. 4901-4918 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the demand for detailed analysis soared, and decision makers began to look to acoustical scientists for answers regarding the planning of new roadways and the design of [[noise mitigation]].  The intensity of roadway noise is governed by the following variables: [[traffic]] operations (speed, [[truck]] mix, age of [[vehicle]] fleet), roadway surface type, tire types, roadway geometrics, terrain, micrometeorology and the  geometry of area structures.

Due to  the complexity of the variables, a line source acoustic model must be a computer model that can analyze sound levels in the vicinity of roadways.  The first meaningful models arose in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Two of the leading research teams were [[BBN Technologies|BBN]] in [[Boston]] and [[ESL Inc.]] of Sunnyvale, California.  Both of these groups developed complex [[mathematical model]]s to allow the study of alternate roadway designs, traffic operations and [[noise mitigation]] strategies in an arbitrary setting.&lt;ref&gt;John Shadely, ''Acoustical analysis of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick'', Bolt Beranek and Newman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Later model alterations have come into widespread use among state [[Department of Transportation|Departments of Transportation]] and city planners, but the accuracy of early models has had little change in 40 years.

Generally line source acoustic models trace sound ray bundles and calculate spreading loss along with ray bundle divergence (or convergence} from refractive phenomena. [[Diffraction]] is usually addressed by establishing [[secondary emitters]] at any points of [[topographic]] or [[anthropomorphic]] “sharpness” (such as [[noise barrier]]s or building surfaces. [[Meteorology]] can be addressed in a statistical manner allowing for actual [[wind rose]] and [[wind speed]] statistics (along with [[thermocline]] data).

==Water pollution line source==

[[Image:Canyon midday.jpg|thumb|right|230px| [[Colorado River]], receiving effectively a linear source of silt from the sides of the [[Grand Canyon]].]]

Less common are line source applications in the field of water pollutant dispersal.  This phenomenon generally arises when [[surface runoff]] scours [[soil contaminants]] from upper soil layers and transports these pollutants to a linear receiving water, such as a river.  The underlying land management practices which lead to such sources of water pollution are [[logging]], [[pesticide]] application, [[construction]] grading, [[slash-and-burn]] activity and urban [[stormwater]] runoff.

Again computer models are needed to address the complexity of such an extended linear discharge into a dynamic medium such as flowing water.  The resulting surface runoff water carrying pollutants may be considered a line source discharging into a river or stream.  The chemical composition of this surface runoff may be characterized by a surface runoff model such as the USGS runoff precipitation algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eco.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/prms.html United States Geological Survey runoff precipitation algorithm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610235807/http://eco.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/mdb/prms.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the instream transport may be analyzed by a dynamic river pollutant model such as [[DSSAM]].

==Light emission line source==

[[Image:FluorescentT8razorback.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Common T8 [[fluorescent]] [[lighting]] tubes used in office environments]]

In the study of illumination, a variety of sources are linear in nature, most commonly the [[fluorescent tube]], During the process of interior lighting design it is important to calculate the light intensity at work stations or other user areas, not only to ensure sufficient light is present, but more importantly to avoid [[over-illumination]] and its attendant [[energy conservation|energy wastage]] as well as adverse health effects.  Thus the scientists involved in light transmission calculations employ computer models that recognize linear sources when fluorescent fixtures are used.  In a typical setting there may be hundreds of finite length light sources that comprise the light output in an office environment. A related concept are the [[ultraviolet]] tubes used in [[phototherapy]], where output radiation from the tube can be accurately modeled by treating the tube as a line source.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Robert Grimes]], Chris Robbins, Neil John O'Hare. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21089759 ''Dose Modeling in Ultraviolet phototherapy'', Medical Physics,  '''37(10)''' October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; On a larger scale, an illuminated [[roadway]] may act as a line source of [[light pollution]].

A '''magic pipe''' is a surreptitious change to a ship's [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]], or other waste-handing equipment, which allows waste liquids to be discharged in contravention of maritime [[pollution]] regulations.&lt;ref name=CLM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clm.com/docs/smi02-2007.pdf|title=Beware of the 'Magic Pipe'|accessdate=2010-12-13|date=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pipe may be improvised, aboard ship, from available hoses and pumps, to discharge untreated waste water directly into the sea. As ships are often required to keep records of waste and its treatment, magic pipe cases often involve falsification of these records too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/government/environmental-regulations/862836-1.html |accessdate=2010-12-13 |title=Magic pipe incident draws huge fine |work=All Business |date=2010-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211101541/http://www.allbusiness.com/government/environmental-regulations/862836-1.html |archivedate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bimco.org/Members/News/2010/2010/06/02_Magic_pipe_cases_continue_in_US.aspx |accessdate=2010-12-13|title="Magic pipe" cases continue in US – so do severe fines and banning of vessels - BIMCO |date=2010-12-13}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, magic pipe cases often attract large fines for shipping lines, and prison sentences for crew.&lt;ref name=CLM/&gt; Cases are often brought to light by [[whistle blower]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/regulation/article171820.ece |accessdate=2010-12-13|title=Lloyd's List - Regulation - Lemissoler magic pipe case collapses |date=2010-12-13}}{{pay}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a 2016 case involving Princess Cruise Lines which resulted in a record US $40 million fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/the-40m-magic-pipe-princess-cruises-given-record-fine-for-dumping-oil-at-sea|accessdate=2016-12-04|title=The $40m 'magic pipe': Princess Cruises given record fine for dumping oil at sea|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem is worsened by a lack of facilities in developing countries; some [[Port Reception Facilities|port reception facilities]] do not allow for oily water to be discharged easily and cost effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A corrupt corporate culture|url=http://www.motorship.com/news101/ships-equipment/a-corrupt-corporate-culture|accessdate=29 September 2013|newspaper=The Motorship|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pipe is known as magic because it bypasses the ship's oily water separator and goes right overboard.  Therefore it can make untreated bilge water magically disappear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Magic Pipe: The Mystery of the Illegal Activity Still Continues on Ships|url = http://www.marineinsight.com/misc/maritime-law/magic-pipe-the-mystery-of-the-illegal-activity-still-continues-on-ships/|accessdate = 2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the pipe can be easily disconnected and stored away into a different spot of the ship so state and regulatory officers would not be able to detect its usage.  The use of magic pipes continues to this day, and efforts to improve bilge water treatment to make the use of magic pipes unnecessary also continue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Crew members, engineers, and ship owners can receive huge fines and even imprisonment if they continue to use a magic pipe to pollute the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, many engineers still use the magic pipe because of lack of shore side assistance with regard to bilge water treatment, lack of training or simple individual disregard of the ocean environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On older OWS systems bypass pipes were fitted with regulatory approval. These approved pipes are no longer fitted on newer vessels. In serious emergencies ship's crews are allowed to discharge untreated bilge water overboard, but need to declare those emergencies in the ship's records and [[oil record book]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">'''Martin Anstey''' was a [[Chronology of the Bible|Bible Chronologer]] significant for his contribution to [[Biblical Literalism]] for successfully resolving the apparent time gaps contained within the Bible's internal chronology. In 1913 Anstey's thesis, 'The Romance of Bible Chronology' was published, explaining how subtle pieces of information within the Bible text resolve these apparent chronological gaps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/1913_anstey_romance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the brother of [[John Anstey]] and also a keen 'Anstey' genealogist, mapping many of the early branches of the Devon Ansteys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ANSTEY: Our True Surname Origin and Shared Medieval Ancestry|last=Anstey|first=G.M. and T.J.|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The Romance of Bible Chronology ==
Anstey identified five apparent chronological gaps within the Bible text, that had been attempted to be resolved with varying degrees of success by previous Bible chronologers.

The five apparent chronological gaps that Anstey identified were:

1. The Noah-Shem connection, which determines the exact age of [[Noah]] at the birth of Shem, (which Anstey calculated to be 502 years).

2. The Terah-Abraham connection, which determines the exact age of Terah at the birth of [[Abraham]], (which Anstey calculated to be 130 years).

3. The Joseph-Moses connection, which determines the exact number of years which elapsed between the death of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], with which the Chronology of the book of Genesis ends (Gen. 50:26), and the birth of [[Moses]], with which the Chronology of the book of Exodus begins (Exodus 7:7), (which Anstey calculated to be 64 years).

4. The Joshua-Judges connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed during the administration of [[Joshua]] and the Elders that survived him, between the division of the land at the end of the Seven Years' War of Conquest, with which the Chronology of the Book of Joshua ends (Joshua 14:7,10 with Numbers 10:11,12; 13:17,20), and the oppression of Cushan-Rishathaim of Mesopotamia, with which the Chronology of the Book of Judges begins (Judges 3:8), (which Anstey calculated to be 13 years).

5. The Eli-Saul connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed between the death of Eli and the beginning of the reign of Saul, (which Anstey calculated to be 20 years). This is given in the summary of I Samuel 7:2.

== Contribution to Biblical Literalism ==
Having resolved the apparent chronological gaps in the Bible text, Anstey was able to argue that the Bible provided a coherent yet select historical record of human civilization. Anstey's thesis also critiqued other chronological records for their chronological errors compared to the Bible text. While archaeological discoveries during the twentieth and twenty-first century have in some instances dated the arguments and data presented in Anstey's thesis, his original chronological calculations and observations remain accurate.

'''''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies''''' is a 1984 book by Yale sociologist [[Charles Perrow]], which provides a detailed analysis of complex systems  from a sociological perspective. It was the first to "propose a framework for characterizing complex technological systems such as air traffic, marine traffic, chemical plants, dams, and especially [[nuclear power plant]]s according to their riskiness". Perrow argues that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly coupled systems. Such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

Perrow's argument, based on systemic features and human error, is that big accidents tend to escalate, and technology is not the problem, the organizations are. Each of these principles is still relevant today.&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esd.mit.edu/WPS/wplit-2003-01.pdf |title=Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow |author=Daniel E Whitney  |year=2003 |work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meltdown: Why Our Systems Fail and What We Can Do About It|last=Clearfield|first=Chris|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2018|isbn=9780735222632|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System accidents==
{{details|System accident}}
"Normal" accidents, or system accidents, are so-called by Perrow because such accidents are inevitable in extremely complex systems. Given the characteristic of the system involved, multiple failures which interact with each other will occur, despite efforts to avoid them. Perrow said that [[operator error]] is a very common problem, many failures relate to organizations rather than technology, and big accidents almost always have very small beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, Charles. ''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies'' New York: Basic Books, 1984. p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Such events appear trivial to begin with before unpredictably cascading through the system to create a large event with severe consequences.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Normal Accidents'' contributed key concepts to a set of intellectual developments in the 1980s that revolutionized the conception of safety and risk. It made the case for examining technological failures as the product of highly interacting systems, and highlighted organizational and management factors as the main causes of failures. Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.&lt;ref name=nature477/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perrow identifies three conditions that make a system likely to be susceptible to Normal Accidents. These are:
* The system is '''complex'''
* The system is '''tightly coupled'''
* The system has '''catastrophic potential'''

==Three Mile Island==
The inspiration for Perrow's books was the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]], where a [[nuclear accident]] resulted from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The event was an example of a normal accident because it was "unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable".&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1982), "The President’s Commission and the Normal Accident", in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), ''Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions'', Westview, Boulder, pp.173–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.&lt;ref name=nature477&gt;{{cite web |title=In retrospect:Normal accidents |author=Nick Pidgeon |date=22 September 2011 Vol 477 |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New reactor designs==
One disadvantage of any new nuclear reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design.  Nuclear engineer [[David Lochbaum]] has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. He argues that "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes".&lt;ref name=safe/&gt; As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, "fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, but people are not".&lt;ref name=safe&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. ''A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia, ''Journal of Contemporary Asia'', Vol. 40, No. 3, August 2010, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, [[Redundancy (engineering)|engineering redundancies]] which are put in place to help ensure safety, may backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D.

==Readership==
''Normal Accidents'' is a very widely cited book, with more than 1,000 citations in the [[Social Science Citation Index]] and [[Science Citation Index]] to 2003.&lt;ref name=perr2004/&gt; A German translation of the book was published in 1987 with a second edition in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;see data of the book in the German National Library http://d-nb.info/920805043&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Observational astronomy''' is a division of [[astronomy]] that is concerned with recording [[data]] about the [[observable universe]], in contrast with [[theoretical astronomy]], which is mainly concerned with calculating the measurable implications of [[physical model]]s. It is the practice and study of [[observation|observing]] [[celestial object]]s with the use of [[telescope]]s and other astronomical instruments.

As a [[space science|science]], the study of astronomy is somewhat hindered in that direct [[experiment]]s with the properties of the distant [[universe]] are not possible. However, this is partly compensated by the fact that astronomers have a vast number of visible examples of stellar phenomena that can be examined. This allows for observational data to be plotted on graphs, and general trends recorded. Nearby examples of specific phenomena, such as [[variable star]]s, can then be used to infer the behavior of more distant representatives. Those distant yardsticks can then be employed to measure other phenomena in that neighborhood, including the distance to a [[galaxy]].

[[Galileo Galilei]] turned a [[telescope]] to the heavens and recorded what he saw. Since that time, observational astronomy has made steady advances with each improvement in telescope technology.

==Subdivisions==
A traditional division of observational astronomy is based on the region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] observed:

* [[Optical astronomy]] is the part of astronomy that uses [[optical instrument]]s (mirrors, lenses, and solid-state detectors) to observe [[light]] from near-[[infrared]] to near-[[ultraviolet]] wavelengths. [[Visible-light astronomy]], using [[wavelength]]s detectable with the human eyes (about 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm), falls in the middle of [[visible spectrum|this spectrum]].
* [[Infrared astronomy]] deals with the detection and analysis of [[infrared radiation]] (this typically refers to wavelengths longer than the detection limit of silicon solid-state detectors, about 1&amp;nbsp;μm wavelength). The most common tool is the [[reflecting telescope]], but with a detector sensitive to infrared wavelengths. Space telescopes are used at certain wavelengths where the atmosphere is opaque, or to eliminate noise (thermal radiation from the atmosphere).
* [[Radio astronomy]] detects [[radiation]] of millimetre to decametre wavelength. The receivers are similar to those used in [[radio]] broadcast transmission but much more sensitive. See also [[Radio telescope]]s.
* [[High-energy astronomy]] includes [[X-ray astronomy]], [[gamma-ray astronomy]], and extreme [[UV astronomy]].
*[[Occultation]] astronomy is the observation of the instant one celestial object occults or eclipses another.  Multi-[[Chord (astronomy)|chord]] asteroid occultation observations measure the profile of the asteroid to the kilometre level.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02798&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
In addition to using electromagnetic radiation, modern astrophysicists can also make observations using [[neutrino]]s, [[cosmic ray]]s or [[gravitational wave]]s. Observing a source using multiple methods is known as [[multi-messenger astronomy]].

[[File:La Silla Poses for an Ultra HD Shoot.jpg|thumb|250px|Ultra HD photography taken at [[La Silla Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Silla Poses for an Ultra HD Shoot|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1415a/|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Optical and radio astronomy can be performed with ground-based observatories, because the atmosphere is relatively transparent at the wavelengths being detected. Observatories are usually located at high altitudes so as to minimise the absorption and distortion caused by the Earth's atmosphere. Some wavelengths of infrared light are heavily absorbed by [[water vapor]], so many infrared observatories are located in dry places at high altitude, or in space.

The atmosphere is opaque at the wavelengths used by X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, UV astronomy and (except for a few wavelength "windows") [[far infrared astronomy]], so observations must be carried out mostly from [[balloon]]s or space observatories. Powerful gamma rays can, however be detected by the large [[air shower (physics)|air shower]]s they produce, and the study of cosmic rays is a rapidly expanding branch of astronomy.

=== Important factors ===
For much of the history of observational astronomy, almost all observation was performed in the visual spectrum with [[optical telescope]]s. While the Earth's atmosphere is relatively transparent in this portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], most telescope work is still dependent on [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions and air transparency, and is generally restricted to the night time. The seeing conditions depend on the turbulence and thermal variations in the air. Locations that are frequently cloudy or suffer from atmospheric turbulence limit the resolution of observations. Likewise the presence of the full [[Moon]] can brighten up the sky with scattered light, hindering observation of faint objects.
[[Image:MaunaKeaSunset.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Sunset over Mauna Kea Observatories.]]
For observation purposes, the optimal location for an optical telescope is undoubtedly in [[outer space]]. There the telescope can make observations without being affected by the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. However, at present it remains costly to lift telescopes into [[orbit]]. Thus the next best locations are certain mountain peaks that have a high number of cloudless days and generally possess good atmospheric conditions (with good [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions). The peaks of the islands of [[Mauna Kea Observatory|Mauna Kea, Hawaii]] and [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory|La Palma]] possess these properties, as to a lesser extent do inland sites such as [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory|Llano de Chajnantor]], [[Paranal Observatory|Paranal]], [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory|Cerro Tololo]] and [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]] in [[Chile]]. These observatory locations have attracted an assemblage of powerful telescopes, totalling many billion US dollars of investment.

The darkness of the night sky is an important factor in optical astronomy. With the size of cities and human populated areas ever expanding, the amount of artificial light at night has also increased. These artificial lights produce a diffuse background illumination that makes observation of faint astronomical features very difficult without special filters. In a few locations such as the state of [[Arizona]] and in the [[United Kingdom]], this has led to campaigns for the reduction of [[light pollution]]. The use of hoods around street lights not only improves the amount of light directed toward the ground, but also helps reduce the light directed toward the sky.

Atmospheric effects ([[astronomical seeing]]) can severely hinder the [[Angular resolution|resolution]] of a telescope. Without some means of correcting for the blurring effect of the shifting atmosphere, telescopes larger than about 15–20&amp;nbsp;cm in [[aperture]] can not achieve their theoretical resolution at visible wavelengths. As a result, the primary benefit of using very large telescopes has been the improved light-gathering capability, allowing very faint magnitudes to be observed. However the resolution handicap has begun to be overcome by [[adaptive optics]], [[speckle imaging]] and [[aperture synthesis|interferometric imaging]], as well as the use of [[space telescope]]s.

=== Measuring results ===
Astronomers have a number of observational tools that they can use to make measurements of the heavens. For objects that are relatively close to the Sun and Earth, direct and very precise [[astrometric|position measurements]] can be made against a more distant (and thereby nearly stationary) background. Early observations of this nature were used to develop very precise orbital models of the various planets, and to determine their respective masses and gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s. Such measurements led to the discovery of the planets [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and (indirectly) [[Pluto]]. They also resulted in an erroneous assumption of a fictional planet [[Vulcan (planet)|Vulcan]] within the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (but the explanation of the [[precession]] of Mercury's orbit by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] is considered one of the triumphs of his [[general relativity]] theory).

== Developments and diversity ==
[[File:Under the Spell of the Magellanic Clouds.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] is the world’s most powerful telescope for studying the Universe at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Under the Spell of the Magellanic Clouds|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1315a/|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

In addition to examination of the universe in the optical spectrum, astronomers have increasingly been able to acquire information in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The earliest such non-optical measurements were made of the thermal properties of the [[Sun]]. Instruments employed during a solar eclipse could be used to measure the radiation from the [[corona]].

[[Image:Green Bank Telescope.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Green Bank Telescope|Fully-steerable radio telescope]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]].]]

=== Radio astronomy ===
With the discovery of [[radio]] waves, [[radio astronomy]] began to emerge as a new discipline in astronomy. The long wavelengths of radio waves required much larger collecting dishes in order to make images with good resolution, and later led to the development of the multi-dish [[interferometer]] for making high-resolution [[aperture synthesis]] radio images (or "radio maps"). The development of the microwave horn receiver led to the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] associated with the [[big bang]].

Radio astronomy has continued to expand its capabilities, even using [[HALCA|radio astronomy satellites]] to produce interferometers with baselines much larger than the size of the Earth. However, the ever-expanding use of the radio spectrum for other uses is gradually drowning out the faint radio signals from the stars. For this reason, in the future radio astronomy might be performed from shielded locations, such as the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the [[Moon]].

=== Late 20th century developments ===
The last part of the twentieth century saw rapid technological advances in astronomical instrumentation. Optical telescopes were growing ever larger, and employing [[adaptive optics]] to partly negate atmospheric blurring. New telescopes were launched into space, and began observing the universe in the [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], [[x-ray]], and [[gamma ray]] parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as observing [[cosmic ray]]s. Interferometer arrays produced the first extremely high-resolution images using [[aperture synthesis]] at radio, infrared and optical wavelengths. Orbiting instruments such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] produced rapid advances in astronomical knowledge, acting as the workhorse for visible-light observations of faint objects. New space instruments under development are expected to directly observe planets around other stars, perhaps even some Earth-like worlds.

In addition to telescopes, astronomers have begun using other instruments to make observations.

=== Other instruments ===
[[Neutrino astronomy]] is the branch of astronomy that observes astronomical objects with [[neutrino detector]]s in special observatories, usually huge underground tanks. [[Nuclear reaction]]s in stars and [[supernova]] explosions produce very large numbers of [[neutrino]]s, a very few of which may be detected by a [[neutrino telescope]]. Neutrino astronomy is motivated by the possibility of observing processes that are inaccessible to [[telescope|optical telescope]]s, such as the [[Solar core|Sun's core]].

[[Gravitational wave]] detectors are being designed that may capture events such as collisions of massive objects such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning for a bright tomorrow: Prospects for gravitational-wave astronomy with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo|url=http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-ObservingScenario/index.php|publisher=[[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robot]]ic [[spacecraft]] are also being increasingly used to make highly detailed observations of [[planet]]s within the [[solar system]], so that the field of [[planetary science]] now has significant cross-over with the disciplines of [[geology]] and [[meteorology]].

== Observation tools ==
[[Image:Observatórium Skalnaté pleso 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Skalnaté pleso observatory]], [[Slovakia]].]]

[[File:Quito Observatory 04.JPG|thumb|One of the Oldest Observatories in [[South America]] is the [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]], founded in 1873 and located 12 minutes south of the [[Equator]] in Quito, Ecuador.  The Quito Astronomical Observatory is the National Observatory of Ecuador and is located in the Historic Center of Quito and is managed by the [[National Polytechnic School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaq.epn.edu.ec/   The [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] is managed by [[National Polytechnic School]], EPN, official web site.   ]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Telescopes ===
[[File:Starwatching.jpg|thumb|200px|An amateur astrophotography setup with an automated guide system connected to a laptop.]]
The key instrument of nearly all modern observational astronomy is the [[telescope]]. This serves the dual purposes of gathering more light so that very faint objects can be observed, and magnifying the image so that small and distant objects can be observed. Optical astronomy requires telescopes that use optical components of great precision. Typical requirements for grinding and polishing a curved mirror, for example, require the surface to be within a fraction of a wavelength of light of a particular [[cone (geometry)|conic]] shape. Many modern "telescopes" actually consist of arrays of telescopes working together to provide higher resolution through [[aperture synthesis]].

Large telescopes are housed in domes, both to protect them from the weather and to stabilize the environmental conditions.  For example, if the temperature is different from one side of the telescope to the other, the shape of the structure changes, due to [[thermal expansion]] pushing optical elements out of position. This can affect the image.  For this reason, the domes are usually bright white ([[titanium dioxide]]) or unpainted metal.  Domes are often opened around sunset, long before observing can begin, so that air can circulate and bring the entire telescope to the same temperature as the surroundings.  To prevent wind-buffet or other vibrations affecting observations, it is standard practice to mount the telescope on a concrete pier whose foundations are entirely separate from those of the surrounding dome and building.

To do almost any scientific work requires that telescopes track objects as they wheel across the visible sky.  In other words, they must smoothly compensate for the rotation of the Earth.  Until the advent of [[computer]] controlled drive mechanisms, the standard solution was some form of [[equatorial mount]], and for small telescopes this is still the norm.   However, this is a structurally poor design and becomes more and more cumbersome as the diameter and weight of the telescope increases.  The world's largest equatorial mounted telescope is the 200 inch (5.1 m) [[Hale Telescope]], whereas recent 8–10 m telescopes use the structurally better [[altazimuth mount]], and are actually physically ''smaller'' than the Hale, despite the larger mirrors.  As of 2006, there are design projects underway for gigantic alt-az telescopes: the Thirty Metre Telescope [https://web.archive.org/web/20150130044644/http://lot.astro.utoronto.ca/], and the 100 m diameter [[Overwhelmingly Large Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eso.org/projects/owl The ESO 100-m OWL optical telescope concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur astronomers use such instruments as the [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]], the [[Refracting telescope|Refractor]] and the increasingly popular  [[Maksutov telescope]].

=== Photography ===
The [[photograph]] has served a critical role in observational astronomy for over a century, but in the last 30 years it has been largely replaced for imaging applications by digital sensors such as [[charge-coupled device|CCD]]s and [[CMOS]] chips. Specialist areas of astronomy such as photometry and interferometry have utilised electronic detectors for a much longer period of time. [[Astrophotography]] uses specialised [[photographic film]] (or usually a glass plate coated with photographic [[emulsion]]), but there are a number of drawbacks, particularly a low [[quantum efficiency]], of the order of 3%, whereas CCDs can be tuned for a QE &gt;90% in a narrow band.  Almost all modern telescope instruments are electronic arrays, and older telescopes have been either been retrofitted with these instruments or closed down.  Glass plates are still used in some applications, such as surveying,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} because the resolution possible with a chemical film is much higher than any electronic detector yet constructed.

==== Advantages ====
Prior to the invention of photography, all astronomy was done with the naked eye.  However, even before films became sensitive enough, scientific astronomy moved entirely to film, because of the overwhelming advantages:
* The human eye discards what it sees from split-second to split-second, but photographic film gathers more and more light for as long as the shutter is open.
* The resulting image is permanent, so many astronomers can use the same data.
* It is possible to see objects as they change over time ([[SN 1987A]] is a spectacular example).

==== Blink comparator ====
The [[blink comparator]] is an instrument that is used to compare two nearly identical photographs made of the same section of sky at different points in time. The comparator alternates illumination of the two plates, and any changes are revealed by blinking points or streaks. This instrument has been used to find [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[variable star]]s.
[[File:Telescope.jpg|thumb|right|160px|50 cm refracting telescope at [[Nice Observatory]].]]

=== Micrometer ===
The position or cross-wire [[micrometer]] is an implement that has been used to measure [[double star]]s. This consists of a pair of fine, movable lines that can be moved together or apart. The telescope lens is lined up on the pair and oriented using position wires that lie at right angles to the star separation. The movable wires are then adjusted to match the two star positions. The separation of the stars is then read off the instrument, and their true separation determined based on the magnification of the instrument.

=== Spectrograph ===
A vital instrument of observational astronomy is the [[spectroscope|spectrograph]]. The absorption of specific wavelengths of light by elements allows specific properties of distant bodies to be observed. This capability has resulted in the discovery of the element of [[helium]] in the Sun's [[emission spectrum]], and has allowed astronomers to determine a great deal of information concerning distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. [[Doppler shift]] (particularly "[[redshift]]") of spectra can also be used to determine the radial motion or distance with respect to the [[Earth]].

Early spectrographs employed banks of [[prism (optics)|prism]]s that split light into a broad spectrum. Later the [[diffraction grating|grating spectrograph]] was developed, which reduced the amount of light loss compared to prisms and provided higher spectral resolution. The spectrum can be photographed in a long exposure, allowing the spectrum of faint objects (such as distant galaxies) to be measured.

Stellar photometry came into use in 1861 as a means of measuring [[color index|stellar colors]]. This technique measured the magnitude of a star at specific frequency ranges, allowing a determination of the overall color, and therefore [[temperature]] of a star. By 1951 an internationally standardized system of UBV-[[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] (''U''ltraviolet-''B''lue-''V''isual) was adopted.

=== Photoelectric photometry ===
[[Photoelectric effect|Photoelectric]] [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] using the [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] is now frequently used to make observations through a telescope. These sensitive instruments can record the image nearly down to the level of individual [[photon]]s, and can be designed to view in parts of the spectrum that are invisible to the eye. The ability to record the arrival of small numbers of photons over a period of time can allow a degree of computer correction for atmospheric effects, sharpening up the image. Multiple digital images can also be combined to further enhance the image. When combined with the [[adaptive optics]] technology, image quality can approach the theoretical resolution capability of the telescope.

[[Filter (optics)|Filter]]s are used to view an object at particular frequencies or frequency ranges. [[Optical coating|Multilayer film]] filters can provide very precise control of the frequencies transmitted and blocked, so that, for example, objects can be viewed at a particular frequency emitted only by excited [[hydrogen]] atoms. Filters can also be used to partially compensate for the effects of [[light pollution]] by blocking out unwanted light. [[Polarization in astronomy|Polarization filters]] can also be used to determine if a source is emitting polarized light, and the orientation of the polarization.

== Observing ==
[[File:The Martian-like Landscape of La Silla.jpg|thumb|The main platform at [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]] hosts a huge range of telescopes with which astronomers can explore the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Martian-like Landscape of La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1546a/|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Astronomers observe a wide range of astronomical sources, including high-redshift galaxies, [[active galaxy|AGNs]], the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|afterglow from the Big Bang]] and many different types of stars and protostars.

A variety of data can be observed for each object. The position [[coordinate]]s locate the object on the sky using the techniques of [[spherical astronomy]], and the [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] determines its brightness as seen from the [[Earth]]. The relative brightness in different parts of the spectrum yields information about the [[temperature]] and physics of the object. Photographs of the spectra allow the chemistry of the object to be examined.

[[Parallax]] shifts of a star against the background can be used to determine the distance, out to a limit imposed by the resolution of the instrument. The [[radial velocity]] of the star and changes in its position over time ([[proper motion]]) can be used to measure its velocity relative to the Sun. Variations in the brightness of the star give evidence of instabilities in the star's atmosphere, or else the presence of an occulting companion. The orbits of binary stars can be used to measure the relative masses of each companion, or the total mass of the system. Spectroscopic binaries can be found by observing [[doppler shift]]s in the spectrum of the star and its close companion.

Stars of identical masses that formed at the same time and under similar conditions typically have nearly identical observed properties. Observing a mass of closely associated stars, such as in a [[globular cluster]], allows data to be assembled about the distribution of stellar types. These tables can then be used to infer the age of the association.

For distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[active galaxy|AGNs]] observations are made of the overall shape and properties of the galaxy, as well as the [[groups and clusters of galaxies|groupings]] where they are found. Observations of certain types of [[Cepheid variable|variable star]]s and [[supernova#Type 1a|supernova]]e of known [[luminosity]], called [[standard candle]]s, in other galaxies allows the inference of the distance to the host galaxy. The expansion of space causes the spectra of these galaxies to be shifted, depending on the distance, and modified by the [[Doppler effect]] of the galaxy's radial velocity. Both the size of the galaxy and its [[redshift]] can be used to infer something about the distance of the galaxy. Observations of large numbers of galaxies are referred to as [[redshift survey]]s, and are used to model the evolution of galaxy forms.

'''Structural steel pipe racks''' typically support pipes, power cables and instrument cable trays in petrochemical, chemical and power plants. Occasionally, pipe racks may also support mechanical equipment, vessels and valve access platforms. Main pipe racks generally transfer material between equipment and storage or utility areas. Storage racks found in warehouses are not pipe racks, even if they store lengths of pipe.&lt;ref name=drakewalter&gt;Drake, Richard M., P.E., S.E., SECB and Walter, Robert J., P.E., S.E. {{cite web|url=http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1388 |title=Seismic Design of Structural Steel Pipe Racks |publisher=Structure Magazine |date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pipe rack is the main artery of a process unit. Pipe racks carry process and utility piping and may also include instrument and cable trays as well as equipment mounted over all of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bausbacher|first=Ed|title=Process Plant Layout and Piping Design|year=1993|publisher=PTR Prentice-Hall,inc|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-138629-8|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipe racks consist of a series of transverse bents that run along the length of the pipe system, spaced at uniform intervals typically around 20&amp;nbsp;ft.  To allow maintenance access under the pipe rack, the transverse bents are typically moment frames.  Transverse bents are typically connected with longitudinal struts.&lt;ref name="drakewalter"/&gt;

'''Privacy by design''' is an approach to [[systems engineering]] initially developed by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and formalized in a joint report on [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] by a joint team of the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] (Canada), the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hes|first=R|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/10000/184530.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hustinx|first=Peter|title=Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12394-010-0061-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy by design framework was published in 2009&lt;ref name=7principles/&gt; and adopted by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities in 2010.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt; Privacy by design calls for [[privacy]] to be taken into account throughout the whole engineering process. The concept is an example of [[value sensitive design]], i.e., to take human values into account in a well-defined manner throughout the whole process and may have been derived from this.

Cavoukian's approach to privacy has been criticized as being vague&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to enforce its adoption&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to apply to certain disciplines&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as prioritizing corporate interests over consumers' interests&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; and placing insufficient emphasis on minimizing data collection&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;.

The European [[GDPR]] regulation incorporates privacy by design.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==History and background==
The privacy by design framework was developed by Dr. [[Ann Cavoukian]], [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]], following her joint work with the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;
In 2009, the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] co-hosted an event, ''Privacy by Design: The Definitive Workshop'', with the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the 31st International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioner (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Conference 2009 Fifth Plenary Session – Privacy by Design|url=http://www.privacyconference2009.org/program/Programa_detallado/index-iden-idweb.html#sesion5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the State of PbD to the 33rd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/PbDReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the framework achieved international acceptance when the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities unanimously passed a resolution on privacy by design&lt;ref name=foreword&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: the definitive workshop. A foreword by Ann Cavoukian, Ph.D|url=https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12394-010-0062-y.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognising it as an international standard at their annual conference.&lt;ref name=report2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Privacy by Design’ approach gains international recognition |url=https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/video-rewind-privacy-by-design-approach-gains-international-recognition/15626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Landmark Resolution passed to preserve the Future of Privacy|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108031015/http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/Resources/News-Releases/News-Releases-Summary/?id=992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resolution&gt;{{cite web|title=32nd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners Jerusalem, Israel 27-29 October, 2010 Resolution on Privacy by Design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/10-10-27_jerusalem_resolutionon_privacybydesign_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other commitments, the commissioners resolved to promote privacy by design as widely as possible and foster the incorporation of the principle into policy and legislation.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt;

== Foundational principles ==
Privacy by design is based on seven "foundational principles":&lt;ref name=7principles&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf|title=7 Foundational Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

The principles have been cited in over five hundred articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10949576998236199397|title=Citations for ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice''|publisher=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice'' white paper by [[Ann Cavoukian]].&lt;ref name=pbdLawPolicyPracitice&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/25008/312239.pdf|title="Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice – A White Paper for Regulators, Decision-makers and Policy-makers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundational principles in detail ===
====Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial==== 
The privacy by design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. Privacy by design does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred — it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, privacy by design comes before-the-fact, not after.
&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-implement-7found-principles.pdf|title=The 7 Foundational Principles Implementation and Mapping of Fair Information Practices|date=January 2011|publisher=Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-primer.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – Primer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/seven-foundational-principles/The-7-Foundational-Principles.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – The 7 Foundational Principles|publisher=Privacy and Big Data Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy as the default====
Privacy by design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy — it is built into the system, by default.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Privacy embedded into design====
Privacy by design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems as well as business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum====
Privacy by design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy versus security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection====
Privacy by design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, privacy by design ensures cradle-to-grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Visibility and transparency – keep it open====
Privacy by design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible and transparent, to users and providers alike. Remember, trust but verify.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric====
Above all, privacy by design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

==Design and standards==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the Committee on Consumer Policy (COPOLCO) proposal for a new ISO standard: ''Consumer Protection: Privacy by Design for Consumer Goods and Services'' (ISO/PC317).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard will aim to specify the design process to provide consumer goods and services that meet consumers’ domestic processing privacy needs as well as the personal privacy requirements of data protection. The standard has the UK as secretariat with thirteen participating members&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Participating Members|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html?view=participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty observing members.&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members/&gt;

The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) is one of the participating members, and has established a mirror Canadian committee to ISO/PC317.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCC ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/committees/iso-pc-317-consumer-protection-privacy-design-for-consumer-goods-and-services}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE) TC|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=pbd-ses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical Committee provides a specification to operationalize privacy by design in the context of software engineering. Privacy by design, like security by design, is a normal part of the software development process and a risk reduction strategy for software engineers. The PbD-SE specification translates the PbD principles to conformance requirements within software engineering tasks, and helps software development teams to produce [[artifact (software development)|artifact]]s as evidence of PbD principle adherence. Following the specification facilitates the documentation of privacy requirements from software conception to retirement, thereby providing a plan around adherence to privacy by design principles, and other guidance to privacy best practices, such as NIST’s 800-53 Appendix J (NIST SP 800-53) and the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) (PMRM-1.0).&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt;

==Relationship to privacy-enhancing technologies == 
Privacy by design originated from [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] (PETs) in a joint 1995 report by Ann Cavoukian and John Borking.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; In 2007 the [[European Commission]] provided a memo on PETs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-07-159_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the British Information Commissioner's Office commissioned a report titled ''Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies|url=http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/projects/surveillance/docs/pbd_pets_paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many facets to privacy by design, including software and systems engineering as well as administrative elements (e.g. legal, policy, procedural), other organizational controls and operating contexts. Privacy by design evolved from early efforts to express fair information practice principles directly into the design and operation of information and communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|title=Privacy by Design : Origins, Meaning, and Prospects for Assuring Privacy and Trust in the Information Era)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289769458_Privacy_by_Design_Origins_meaning_and_prospects_for_assuring_privacy_and_trust_in_the_information_era}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publication ''Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises''&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"/&gt; [[Peter Hustinx]] acknowledges the key role played by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and [[John Borking]], then Deputy Privacy Commissioners, in the joint 1995 publication ''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: The Path to Anonymity''.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; This 1995 report focussed on exploring technologies that permit transactions to be conducted anonymously.

Privacy-enhancing technologies allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to (and handled by) services or applications. Privacy by design evolved to consider the broader systems and processes in which PETs were embedded and operated. The U.S. Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) in ''The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy''&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy|url=https://cdt.org/insight/the-role-of-privacy-by-design-in-protecting-consumer-privacy-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes PET from privacy by design noting that “PETs are most useful for users who already understand online privacy risks. They are essential user empowerment tools, but they form only a single piece of a broader framework that should be considered when discussing how technology can be used in the service of protecting privacy.”&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers/&gt;

== Criticism and recommendations==
The privacy by design framework attracted academic debate, particularly following the 2010 International Data Commissioners resolution, these provide criticism of privacy by design with suggestions by legal and engineering experts to better understand how to apply the framework into various contexts.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Privacy by design has been critiqued as "vague"&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|last=van Rest|first=Jeroen|title=Designing Privacy by Design|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54069-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving "many open questions about their application when engineering systems".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Privacy by Design|url=http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1542.pdf|work=Seda Gurses, Carmela Troncoso, and Claudia Diaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, researchers at K.U. Leuven published ''Engineering Privacy by Design'' noting that “The design and implementation of privacy requirements in systems is a difficult problem and requires translation of complex social, legal and ethical concerns into systems requirements”. The authors claim that their statement regarding that the principles of privacy by design "remain vague and leave many open questions about their application when engineering systems", may be viewed as criticism. However, the purpose of the paper is to propose that "starting from data minimization is a necessary and foundational first step to engineer systems in line with the principles of privacy by design". The objective of their paper is to provide an "initial inquiry into the practice of privacy by design from an engineering perspective in order to contribute to the closing of the gap between policy makers’ and engineers’ understanding of privacy by design".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt; 

It has also been pointed out that privacy by design is similar to [[voluntary compliance]] schemes in industries impacting the environment, and thus lacks the teeth necessary to be effective, and may differ per company. In addition, the evolutionary approach currently taken to the development of the concept will come at the cost of privacy infringements because evolution implies also letting unfit phenotypes (privacy-invading products) live until they are proven unfit.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; Some critics have pointed out that certain business models are built around customer surveillance and data manipulation and therefore voluntary compliance is unlikely.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: A Counterfactual Analysis of Google and Facebook Privacy Incidents|ssrn=2128146|work=Ira Rubinstein and Nathan Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Danish National It and Telecom Agency published as discussion paper on "New Digital Security Models" the publication references "Privacy by Design" as a key goal in creating a security model that is compliant with "Privacy by Design". This is done by extending the concept to "Security by Design" with an objective of balancing anonymity and surveillance by eliminating identification as much as possible.&lt;ref name="New Digital Security Models"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Digital Security Models|url=https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/896495/artefact/NewDigitalSecurityModels.pdf?artefact=true&amp;PID=1792137|work=Danish National It and Telecom Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Rubenstein and Good used [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] privacy incidents to conduct a counterfactual analysis in order to identify lessons learned of value for regulators when recommending privacy by design. The first was that “more detailed principles and specific examples” would be more helpful to companies. The second is that “usability is just as important as engineering principles and practices”. The third is that there needs to be more work on “refining and elaborating on design principles–both in privacy engineering and usability design”. including efforts to define international privacy standards. The final lesson learned is that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Another criticism is that current definitions of privacy by design do not address the methodological aspect of systems engineering, such as using decent system engineering methods, e.g. those which cover the complete system and data life cycle. The concept also does not focus on the role of the actual data holder but on that of the system designer. This role is not known in privacy law, so the concept of privacy by design is not based in law. This, in turn, undermines the trust by data subjects, data holders and policy-makers.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;

The advent of [[GDPR]] with its maximum fine of 4% of global turnover now provides a balance between business benefit and turnover, and addresses the [[voluntary compliance]] criticism and requirement from Rubenstein and Good that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt; Rubenstein and Good also highlighted that privacy by design could result in applications that exemplified Privacy by Design and their work was well received.&lt;ref name=CorporateHotness&gt;{{cite web|title=Why 'Privacy By Design' Is The New Corporate Hotness|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/28/why-privacy-by-design-is-the-new-corporate-hotness|work=Kashmir Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

The May 2018 [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]]'s paper ''Preliminary Opinion on Privacy by Design'' states, "While privacy by design has made significant progress in legal, technological and conceptual development, it is still far from unfolding its full potential for the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals. The following sections of this opinion provide an overview of relevant developments and recommend further efforts".&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Opinion on privacy by design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-05-31_preliminary_opinion_on_privacy_by_design_en_0.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The executive summary makes the following recommendations to EU institutions:
* To ensure strong privacy protection, including privacy by design, in the ePrivacy Regulation.
* To support privacy in all legal frameworks which influence the design of technology, increasing incentives and substantiating obligations, including appropriate liability rules,
* To foster the roll-out and adoption of privacy by design approaches and PETs in the EU and at the member states’ level through appropriate implementing measures and policy initiatives,
* To ensure competence and resources for research and analysis on privacy engineering and privacy enhancing technologies at EU level, by ENISA or other entities,
* To support the development of new practices and business models through the research and technology development instruments of the EU,
* To support EU and national public administrations to integrate appropriate privacy by design requirements in public procurement,
* To support an inventory and observatory of the “state of the art” of privacy engineering and PETs and their advancement.

The EDPS will:
* Continue to promote privacy by design, where appropriate in cooperation with other data protection authorities in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB),
* Support coordinated and effective enforcement of Article 25 of the GDPR and related provisions,
* Provide guidance to controllers on the appropriate implementation of the principle laid down in the legal base, and
* Together with the DPAs of Austria, Ireland and Schleswig-Holstein, award privacy friendly apps in the mobile health domain.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==Implementing privacy by design==
The [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]] set out the requirement to implement privacy by design in his article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design - Privacy Engineering|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-01-25_privacy_by_design_privacy_engineering_cpdp_en_3.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA) provided a detailed report ''Privacy and Data Protection by Design – From Policy to Engineering'' on implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – from policy to engineering|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design/at_download/fullReport|work=ENISA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer School on real-world crypto and privacy provided a tutorial on "Engineering Privacy by Design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering privacy by design|url=https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2017/slides/Engineering%20privacy%20by%20design.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project] for web applications that gives hints on how to implement privacy by design in practice. The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt; offers a privacy extension/complement to OMG’s Unified Modeling Language (UML) and serves as a complement to OASIS’ eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language (XACML) and Privacy Management Reference Model (PMRM).

{{Refimprove|lead|date=December 2011}}
A '''prologue''' or '''prolog''' from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πρόλογος ''prologos'', from πρό ''pro'', "before" and λόγος ''logos'', "word" is an opening to a story that establishes the context and gives background details, often some earlier story that ties into the main one, and other miscellaneous information. The Ancient Greek ''prólogos'' included the modern meaning of ''prologue'', but was of wider significance, more like the meaning of [[preface]]. The importance, therefore, of the prologue in [[Greek tragedy#Structure|Greek drama]] was very great; it sometimes almost took the place of a romance, to which, or to an episode in which, the play itself succeeded.

It is believed that the prologue in this form was practically the invention of [[Euripides]], and with him, as has been said, it takes the place of an explanatory first act. This may help to modify the objection which criticism has often brought against the Greek prologue, as an impertinence, a useless growth prefixed to the play, and standing as a barrier between us and our enjoyment of it. The point precisely is that, to an Athenian audience, it was useful and pertinent, as supplying just what they needed to make the succeeding scenes intelligible. But it is difficult to accept the view that Euripides invented the plan of [[Deus ex machina|producing a god out of a machine]] to justify the action of deity upon man, because it is plain that he himself disliked this interference of the supernatural and did not believe in it. He seems, in such a typical prologue as that to the ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', to be accepting a conventional formula, and employing it, almost perversely, as a medium for his ironic rationalism.

==Latin==
[[File:Prologue I.jpg|thumb|Artwork by Gustave Doré.]]
[[Image:Every Man in his Humour title page 1616.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Title page of 1616 printing of ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'', a 1598 play by the English playwright [[Ben Jonson]]. The play belongs to the subgenre of the "[[humours comedy]]"]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Many of the existing Greek prologues may be later in date than the plays they illustrate, or may contain large interpolations. On the Latin stage the prologue was often more elaborate than it was in Athens, and in the careful composition of the poems which [[Plautus]] prefixes to his plays we see what importance he gave to this portion of the entertainment; sometimes, as in the preface to the ''[[Rudens]]'', Plautus rises to the height of his genius in his adroit and romantic prologues, usually placed in the mouths of persons who make no appearance in the play itself.

[[Molière]] revived the Plautian prologue in the introduction to his ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]''. [[Jean Racine|Racine]] introduced Piety as the speaker of a prologue which opened his choral tragedy of [[Esther]].

The tradition of the ancients vividly affected our own early dramatists. Not only were the [[mystery play]]s and miracles of the [[Middle Ages]] begun by a [[homily]], but when the drama in its modern sense was inaugurated in the reign of Elizabeth, the prologue came with it, directly adapted from the practice of Euripides and [[Terence]]. [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Sackville, Lord Buckhurst]], prepared a sort of prologue in dumb show for his ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' of 1562; and he also wrote a famous [[Induction (play)|Induction]], which is, practically, a prologue, to a [[miscellany]] of short romantic epics by diverse hands.

==Elizabethan==

Prologues of Renaissance drama often served a specific function of transition and clarification for the audience. A direct address made by one actor, the prologue acted as an appeal to the audience's attention and sympathy, providing historical context, a guide to themes of the play, and occasionally, a disclaimer &lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 17&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this mode, a prologue, like any scripted performance, would exist as the text, the actor who speaks that text, and the presentation of the language as it is spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  In ushering the audience from the reality into the world of the play, the prologue straddles boundaries between audience, actors, characters, playwrights--basically, it creates a distinction between the imaginary space within the play and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Jonson]] has often been noted as using the prologue to remind the audience of the complexities between themselves and all aspects of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Richard, Elizabeth Schafer and Brian Wooland, Ben Jonson and Theatre, 1999. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The actor reciting the prologue would appear dressed in black, a stark contrast to the elaborate costumes used during the play.&lt;ref&gt;White, Martin, Renaissance Drama in Action, 1998. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  The prologue removed his hat and wore no makeup.  He may have carried a book, scroll, or a placard displaying the title of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  He was introduced by three short trumpet calls, on the third of which he entered and took a position downstage.  He made three bows in the current fashion of the court, and then addressed the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elizabethan prologue was unique in incorporating aspects of both classical and medieval traditions.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas"&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In the classical tradition, the prologue conformed to one of four subgenres: the ''sustatikos'', which recommends either the play or the poet; the ''epitimetikos'', in which a curse is given against a rival, or thanks given to the audience; ''dramatikos'', in which the plot of the play is explained; and mixtos, which contains all of these things.&lt;ref name="BrusterDouglas" /&gt;  In the medieval tradition, expressions of morality and modesty are seen,&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2004. 14&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a meta-theatrical self-consciousness, and an unabashed awareness of the financial contract engaged upon by paid actors and playwrights, and a paying audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bruster, Douglas, and Robert Weimann, Prologues to Shakespeare's Theatre, 2009. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in fiction==
Prologues have long been used in non-dramatic fiction, since at least the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hXCi_DViuqwC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=prologue&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although Chaucer had prologues to many of the tales, rather than one at the front of the book.

'''Proof-of-space''' ('''PoSpace'''), also called '''Proof-of-capacity''' ('''PoC'''), is a means of showing that one has a legitimate interest in a service (such as sending an email) by allocating a non-trivial amount of memory or disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider.
The concept was formulated by Dziembowski ''et al.''&lt;ref name="DziembowskiFaust2015"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1=Dziembowski | first1=Stefan
 | last2=Faust       | first2=Sebastian
 | last3=Kolmogorov  | first3=Vladimir
 | last4=Pietrzak    | first4=Krzysztof
 | title=Proofs of Space
 | volume=9216 |year=2015 | pages=585–605
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015.

Proofs of space are very similar to [[proof-of-work system|proofs of work]], except that instead of computation, storage is used. Proof-of-space is related to, but also considerably different from, memory-hard functions and proofs of retrievability.

After the release of Bitcoin, alternatives to its PoW mining mechanism were researched and PoSpace was studied in the context of [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]]. Proofs of space are seen as a fairer and greener alternative due to the general-purpose nature of storage and the lower energy cost required by storage. Several theoretical and practical implementations of PoSpace have been released and discussed, such as SpaceMint and Burstcoin.

== Concept description ==
A proof-of-space is a piece of data that a prover sends to a verifier to prove that the prover has reserved a certain amount of space. For practicality, the verification process needs to be efficient, namely, consumes a small amount of space and time. For soundness, it should be hard for the prover to pass the verification if it does not actually reserve the claimed amount of space. One way of implementing PoSpace is by using [[Graph pebbling|hard-to-pebble graphs]].&lt;ref name="DziembowskiFaust2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ren2016"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1=Ren      | first1=Ling
 | last2=Srinivas | first2=Devadas
 | title=Proof of Space from Stacked Expanders
 | year=2016
 | url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/333.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verifier asks the prover to build a labeling of a hard-to-pebble graph. The prover commits to the labeling. The verifier then asks the prover to open several random locations in the commitment.

== Uses ==
Proofs of space could be used as an alternative to proofs of work in the traditional [[Client Puzzle Protocol|client puzzle]] applications such as anti-spam measures and denial of service attack prevention. Proof-of-Space has also been used for malware detection, by determining whether the L1 cache of a processor is empty (e.g., has enough space to evaluate the PoSpace routine without cache misses) or contains a routine that resisted being evicted.&lt;ref name="JakobssonStewart13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakobsson|first1=Markus|title=Mobile Malware: Why the Traditional AV Paradigm is Doomed, and How to Use Physics to Detect Undesirable Routines, BlackHat|last2=Stewart|first2=Guy|year=2013|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4194/e4f5fccaac653f00ebb80f51f01e6c7fd80a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Jakobsson [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/031.pdf Secure Remote Attestation] ''Cryptology ePrint Archive.'' Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs of space have been developed further in several concept papers and in one live cryptocurrency implementation.

=== Implementations ===

==== Burstcoin ====
Proof of space or Proof of capacity is used in the Burstcoin cryptocurrency founded in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.newsbtc.com/burstcoin-celebrates-birthday-with-release-of-new-energy-efficient-hdd-mining-wallet/|title=BURSTCOIN Celebrates Birthday With Release Of New Energy Efficient HDD Mining Wallet|accessdate=1 November 2016|publisher=NewsBTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proof of capacity consumes disk space rather than computing resources to mine a block. Unlike PoW, where the miners keep changing the block header and hash to find the solution, the Proof of capacity implementation in Burstcoin generates random solutions, also called plots, using the Shabal cryptographic algorithm in advance and stores it on hard drives. This stage is called plotting and it may take days or even weeks depending on the storage capacity of the drive. In the next stage - mining, miners match their solutions to the most recent puzzle and the node with the fastest solution gets to mine the next block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wahab|first=Abdul|last2=Waqas|first2=Memood|date=October 2018|title=Survey of Consensus Protocols|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.03357.pdf|journal=Survey of Consensus Protocols|volume=|pages= 6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-capacity-cryptocurrency.asp|title=BREAKING DOWN 'Proof of Capacity (Cryptocurrency)'|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salimitari|first=Mehrdad|last2=Chatterjee|first2=Mainak|date=September 2018|title=An Overview of Blockchain and Consensus Protocols for IoT Networks|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05613|journal=An Overview of Blockchain and Consensus Protocols for IoT Networks|pages=III-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concepts ===

==== SpaceMint ====
In 2015, a paper proposed a cryptocurrency called SpaceMint.&lt;ref name="SpaceMint"&gt;Park et al. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/528 SpaceMint: A Cryptocurrency Based on Proofs of Space.] ''Cryptology ePrint Archive.'' Retrieved 31 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to solve some of the practical design problems associated with the pebbling-based PoSpace schemes. In using PoSpace for decentralized cryptocurrency, the protocol has to be adapted to work in a non-interactive protocol since each individual in the network has to behave as a verifier.&lt;ref name="SpaceMint" /&gt;

==== Chia ====
In 2018, a proposed cryptocurrency Chia presented two papers presenting a new protocol based on proof of space&lt;ref name="Abusalah2017"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6191">'''Query by Example''' ('''QBE''') is a [[database]] [[query language]] for [[relational database]]s. It was devised by [[Moshé M. Zloof]] at [[IBM Research]] during the mid-1970s, in parallel to the development of [[SQL]]. It is the first graphical query language, using visual tables where the user would enter commands, example elements and conditions. Many graphical front-ends for databases use the ideas from QBE today. Originally limited only for the purpose of [[data retrieval|retrieving data]], QBE was later extended to allow other operations, such as inserts, deletes and updates, as well as creation of temporary tables.

The motivation behind QBE is that a [[parser]] can convert the user's actions into statements expressed in a database manipulation language, such as [[SQL]].  Behind the scenes, it is this statement that is actually executed. A suitably comprehensive front-end can minimize the burden on the user to remember the finer details of SQL, and it is easier and more productive for end-users (and even programmers) to select tables and columns by selecting them rather than typing in their names,

In the context of [[information retrieval]], QBE has a somewhat different meaning. The user can submit a document, or several documents, and ask for "similar" documents to be retrieved from a document database [see search by multiple examples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Mingzhu|last2=Wu|first2=Yi-Fang Brook|date=2014-02-24|title=Search by multiple examples|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556195.2556206|publisher=ACM|pages=667–672|doi=10.1145/2556195.2556206|isbn=9781450323512}}&lt;/ref&gt;]. Similarity search is based comparing document vectors (see [[Vector Space Model]]).

QBE is a seminal work in [[end-user development]], frequently cited in research papers as an early example of this topic.

Currently, QBE is supported in several relational database front ends, notably Microsoft Access, which implements "Visual Query by Example", as well as Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager. It is also implemented in several [[object database|object-oriented databases]] (e.g. in [[db4o]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-db4o2.html | contribution = QBE | title = db4o | publisher = IBM | series = Developer works Java library}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

QBE is based on the logical formalism called [[tableau query]], although QBE adds some extensions to that, much like SQL is based on the [[relational algebra]].

== Example ==
An example using the [[Suppliers and Parts database]] is given here to illustrate how QBE works.

|+ Simple QBE example

|}

== As a general technique ==
The term also refers to a general technique influenced by Zloof's work whereby only items with search values are used to "filter" the results. It provides a way for a software user to perform queries without having to know a query language (such as [[SQL]]). The software can automatically generate the queries for the user (usually behind the scenes). Here are some examples:

Example Form '''B''':
 .....Name: Bob
 ..Address:
 .....City:
 ....State: TX
 ..Zipcode:

Resulting [[SQL]]:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE Name='Bob' AND State='TX';
&lt;/source&gt;
Note how blank  items do not generate [[SQL]] terms. Since "Address" is blank, there is no clause generated for it.
For
Example Form '''C''':
 .....Name: 
 ..Address:
 .....City: Sampleton
 ....State: 
 ..Zipcode: 12345

Resulting [[SQL]]:
&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE City='Sampleton' AND Zipcode='12345';
&lt;/source&gt;
More advanced versions of QBE have other comparison operator options, often via a pull-down menu, such as "Contains", "Not Contains", "Starts With", "Greater-Than", and so forth.

Another approach to text comparisons is to allow one or more [[wildcard character]] characters. For example, if an asterisk is designated as a wild wildcard character in a particular system, then searching for last names using "Rob'''*'''" would return (match) last names such as "Rob", "Robert", "Robertson", "Roberto", etc.

The '''source''' or '''headwaters''' of a [[river]] or [[stream]] is the furthest place in that river or stream from its [[estuary]] or [[confluence]] with another river, as measured along the course of the river.

==Definition==
[[File:SorgentePo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The marker indicating the source of the [[Po River]], near [[Crissolo]]. "Here is born the Po"]]
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) states that a river's "length may be considered to be the distance from the mouth to the most distant headwater source (irrespective of stream name), or from the mouth to the headwaters of the stream commonly known as the source stream".  As an example of the second definition above, the USGS at times considers the [[Missouri River]] as a tributary of the [[Mississippi River]].  But it also follows the first definition above (along with virtually all other geographic authorities and publications) in using the combined Missouri - lower Mississippi length figure in lists of lengths of rivers around the world.&lt;ref name=usgs-largest&gt;{{cite web |title= Largest Rivers in the United States |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/pdf/ofr87242.pdf |accessdate= 24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rivers have numerous tributaries and change names often; it is customary to regard the longest tributary or stem as the source, regardless of what name that watercourse may carry on local maps and in local usage.

This most commonly identified definition of a river source specifically uses the most distant point (along watercourses from the [[river mouth]]) in the [[drainage basin]] from which water runs year-around ([[Perennial stream|perennially]]), or, alternatively, as the furthest point from which water could possibly flow [[Ephemerality#Geographical features|ephemerally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2000/12/1221amazon.html|title=National Geographic News @ nationalgeographic.com|website=news.nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter definition includes sometimes-dry channels and removes any possible definitions that would have the river source "move around" from month to month depending on precipitation or ground water levels. This definition, from geographer Andrew Johnston of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], is also used by the [[National Geographic Society]] when pinpointing the source of rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] or [[Nile River|Nile]]. A definition given by the state of [[Montana]] agrees, stating that a river source is never a [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] but is "in a location that is the farthest, along water miles, from where that river ends."&lt;ref name="fwp.mt.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/2005/MissouriSource.htm|title=The True Utmost Reaches of the Missouri|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition neither a lake (excepting lakes with no inflows) nor a confluence of tributaries can be a true river source, though both often provide the starting point for the portion of a river carrying a single name. For example, National Geographic and virtually every other geographic authority and atlas define the source of the Nile River not as [[Lake Victoria]]'s outlet where the name "Nile" first appears, which would reduce the Nile's length by over 900&amp;nbsp;km (dropping it to fourth or fifth on the list of world's rivers), but instead use the source of the largest river flowing ''into'' the lake, the [[Kagera River]]. Likewise, the source of the Amazon River has been determined this way, even though the river changes names numerous times along its course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=885&amp;id_pagina=1/|title=IBGE - Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615121345/http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=885&amp;id_pagina=1%2F|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the source of [[River Thames|Thames]] in England is traditionally reckoned according to the named river Thames rather than its longer tributary, the [[River Churn|Churn]] &amp;mdash; although not without contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-17858944|title=Could the River Thames be longer than the River Severn?|first=David|last=Bailey|date=15 May 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not listing river lengths, however, alternative definitions may be used. The Missouri River's source is named by some USGS and other federal and state agency sources, following Lewis and Clark's naming convention, as the confluence of the [[Madison River|Madison]] and [[Jefferson River]]s, rather than the source of its longest tributary (the Jefferson).&lt;ref name="fwp.mt.gov"/&gt;  This is contradicted by a US Army Corps of Engineers official on a USGS site &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolink.cr.usgs.gov/events/Conferences/mrc04/04Program.pdf|title=CERC Science Topic: Missouri River|website=infolink.cr.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; who states the most common definition: "Geographers generally follow the longest tributary to identify the source of rivers and streams. In the case of the Missouri River, Lewis
and Clark would have had to travel to the east...to reach the source"... He states that the Missouri River source is well upstream from Lewis and Clark's confluence, "following the Jefferson River to the Beaverhead River to Red Rock River, then Red Rock Creek to Hell Roaring Creek."

==Characteristics of sources==
[[File:Rhumequelle Rhumspringe.jpg|thumb|[[Rhume Spring]], source of the Rhume river in Germany.]]
Sometimes the source of the most remote tributary may be in an area that is more [[marsh]]-like, in which the "uppermost" or most remote section of the marsh would be the true source.  For example, the source of the [[River Tees]] is [[marsh]]land.

The furthest stream is also often called the '''headstream'''. Headwaters are often small streams with cool waters because of shade and recently melted ice or snow.  They may also be '''glacial headwaters''', waters formed by the melting of [[Glacier|glacial]] [[ice]].

Headwater areas are the upstream areas of a [[drainage basin|watershed]], as opposed to the outflow or discharge of a watershed.   The river source is often but not always on or quite near the edge of the watershed, or watershed divide. For example, the source of the [[Colorado River]] is at the [[Continental Divide]] separating the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]] watersheds of [[North America]].

===Example===
A ''river'' is considered a ''linear'' geographic feature, with only one mouth and one source.
For an example, note how the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Missouri River]] sources are officially defined:
*{{cite web | title = Largest Rivers in the United States | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]] | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/ }}

==Related usages==

The verb "rise" can be used to express the general region of a river's source, and is often qualified with an adverbial expression of place. For example:
*''The River Thames rises in Gloucestershire.''
*''The White Nile rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.''

The word "source", when applied to [[lake]]s rather than rivers or streams, refers to the lake's [[inflow (hydrology)|inflow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/owens/qa.html|title=Owens Valley Particulate Matter Plan: Q &amp; A|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=2008-05-30|quote=...the Owens River, the source of the lake...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edocs.tu-berlin.de/diss/2004/casallas_jorge.pdf|format=PDF|title=Limnological investigations in Lake San Pablo|author=Jorge Enrique Casallas Guzmán|date=2004-02-11|accessdate=2008-05-30|quote=...source of the lake is the River Itambi... |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030350/http://edocs.tu-berlin.de/diss/2004/casallas_jorge.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salt marsh die-off''' is a term that has been used in the US and UK to describe the death of [[salt marsh]] [[cordgrass]] leading to subsequent degradation of habitat, specifically in the [[low marsh]] zones of salt marshes on the coasts of the Western Atlantic. Cordgrass normally anchors sediment in salt marshes; its loss leads to decreased substrate hardness, increased erosion, and collapse of creek banks into the water, ultimately resulting in decreased marsh health and productivity.

Die-off can affect several [[species]] of [[cordgrass]] (genus ''[[Spartina]]''), including ''[[Spartina alterniflora|S. alterniflora]]'', ''[[Spartina densiflora|S. densiflora]]'', and ''S. townsendii''. There are several competing hypotheses predicting the causes and mechanisms of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. These hypotheses place different emphasis on the effects of top-down or bottom-up processes for salt marsh die-off. Combined with [[salt marsh dieback]] of the [[high marsh]], salt marsh die-off is a serious threat to the [[ecosystem services]] that marshes provide to local coastal communities.

==History of top-down vs. bottom-up==

In light of their effect on community processes, behaviors, and ecological interactions, [[Consumption (ecology)|consumptive interactions]] are some of the most widely studied concepts in [[ecology]]. Because of this, scientists use food webs to depict all of the food chains and trophic relationships in an ecological [[Community (ecology)|community]].
 
[[File:Food web diagram.svg|thumb|Example of a food web]] [[Food web]]s can be controlled by bottom-up or top-down forces, which dictate whether a food web’s structure and population dynamics are regulated by [[nutrient]]s (a supply of fixed [[carbon]]) and [[primary production]] or by [[Apex predators|top predators]], respectively. 
 
Much energy is lost from one [[trophic level]] to the next (about 90%); therefore, the success of higher levels is linked to lower ones and their supply of resources (Lindeman 1942).&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R.L. 1942. The trophic dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23: 399-418.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the abundance and distribution of organisms in an [[ecosystem]] is also affected by densities of consumers, which limit the success of organisms at lower trophic levels and thereby influence the abundance of these organisms (Hairston et al. 1960).&lt;ref name=hairstonetal1960&gt;Hairston, N.G., E.D. Frederick, and B.S. Lawrence. 1960. Community structure, population control, and competition. The American Naturalist, 94(879): 421-425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ecologists argue that bottom-up and top-down control do not play equally critical roles in the structure and dynamics of populations in an ecosystem; however, data suggests that both bottom-up and top-down forces impact the structure of food webs and the spatial and temporal [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and [[Distribution (ecology)|distribution]] of [[organism]]s (Bertness 2007),&lt;ref name=bertness2007&gt;Bertness, M.D. 2007. Atlantic Shorelines: Natural History and Ecology. Princeton, Jew Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although to what extent each plays a role is not fully understood.

Historically, an emphasis on bottom-up control in many ecosystems has prevailed in ecological thought, often to the exclusion of consumer control (Strong 1992).&lt;ref name=strong1992&gt;Strong D.R. 1992. Are trophic cascades all wet-differentiation and donor control in speciose ecosystems. Ecology 73(3): 747-754.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ecosystems in which consumer control has classically been considered trivial are dominated by plants (e.g., forests, grasslands, and salt marshes) and are usually green in appearance. Hairston and colleagues proposed an opposing view in 1960 that emphasized consumer control. They argued that the “world is green” because higher trophic levels regulate [[herbivore]] abundance (Hairston et al. 1960).&lt;ref name=hairstonetal1960/&gt;
 
Critics pointed out that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not necessarily play an important role in structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and L.C. Birch. 1967. The “balance of nature” and “population control.” The American Naturalist, 101: 97-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966).&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, A.F.F. 1966. The effect of population density and nutritive status of the host on the summer reproductive activity of the sycamore aphid, Drepanosiphum platanoides. J. Anim. Ecol. 35 105-112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, W.W. 1966. Community structure, population control, and competition: a critique. The American Naturalist, 100: 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top-down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.
 
More recently, however, examples of conspicuous consumer control of entire ecosystems have emerged in a variety of [[habitat]]s including [[lake]]s (Carpenter et al. 1985),&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S. R., J. F. Kitchell, and J. R. Hodgson. Cascading trophic interactions and lake productivity. BioScience 35, 634-639 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; [[river]]s (Power 1992),&lt;ref&gt;Power, M.E. 1992. Habitat heterogeneity and the functional significance of fish in river food webs. Ecology, 73: 1675-1688.&lt;/ref&gt; and marine (Estes and Duggins 1995)&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995&gt;Estes, J. A. and D.O. Duggins. 1995. Sea otters and kelp forests in Alaska: Generality and variation in a community ecological paradigm. Ecological Monographs 65, 75-100.&lt;/ref&gt; habitats. [[Foundation species|Foundation]] plant species can be replaced with other species or [[Substrate (biology)|substratum]] completely lacking [[vegetation]] and [[insect]]s can defoliate whole [[mangrove]]s (Feller 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Feller, I. C. 2002. The role of herbivory by wood-boring insects in mangrove ecosystems in Belize. Oikos 97, 167-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A classic example of top-down interactions dictating community structure and function comes from [[Robert Paine (zoologist)|Bob Paine’s]] work in Washington, which established that removal of the [[starfish]] ''[[Pisaster]]'' triggered a trophic cascade in which the blue mussel (''[[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]]'') populations exploded due to release from [[predation]] pressure (Paine 1966)&lt;ref&gt;Paine, R.T. 1966. Web complexity and species diversity. The American Naturalist, 100(910): 65-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another influential example of top-down control emerged from Jane Lubchenco’s experiments on New England [[rocky shore]]s, which demonstrated that the herbivorous [[snail]] ''[[Littorina littorea|L. littorea]]'' exerts control on the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and [[Succession (ecology)|succession]] of [[tide pool]] [[Algae|algal]] communities (Lubchenco and Menge 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Lubchenco, J. and B.A. Menge. 1978. Community development and persistence in a low rocky intertidal zone. Ecological Monographs 48: 67-94.&lt;/ref&gt; One [[hypothesis]] that arose from Lubchenco’s work (Little and Kitching 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Little, C. and J.A. Kitching. 1996. The Biology of Rocky Shores. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was that predation by the [[green crab]] (''[[Carcinus maenas]]'') influences rocky shore algal communities by regulating ''L. littorea'' abundances.
 
Ecologists cite these examples as [[evidence]] that consumer regulation is more potent and predominant than previously recognized.

==Historical paradigms of salt marsh theory==

[[File:Healthy salt marsh.jpg|thumb|border|right|Healthy salt marsh]]
In salt marshes, early ecologists like [[Eugene Odum]] and John Teal sparked the current bottom-up [[paradigm]] in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like [[temperature]], [[salinity]], and [[nutrients]] in regulating plant primary productivity and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971).&lt;ref name=teal1962&gt;Teal, J.M. 1962. Energy flow in the salt marsh ecosystem of Georgia. Ecology 43: 614–624.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P. 1971. Fundamentals of Ecology. Philadelphia: Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed and appeared to be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as [[detritus]] (Teal 1962).&lt;ref name=teal1962/&gt; A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962).&lt;ref name=teal1962/&gt;&lt;ref name=smalley1960&gt;Smalley A.E. 1960. Energy flow of a salt marsh grasshopper population. Ecology 41:672–77.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007),&lt;ref name=bertness2007/&gt; and has thus “become entrenched in the conceptual understanding of coastal ecosystems” (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).&lt;ref name=smalley1960/&gt;&lt;ref name=bertnessandsilliman2008&gt;Bertness, M.D. and B.R.

Strong top-down control on marshes has been demonstrated in various marsh systems. Consumer control is driven by the [[Grapsidae|grapsid crab]] ([[Chasmagnathus granulata]]) in the salt marshes of Argentina and Brazil on the Atlantic coast of South America (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt; Other experiments in Argentina have contributed to the growing body of work evidencing consumer control in salt marshes (Alberti et al. 2007),&lt;ref name=albertietal2007&gt;Alberti J, M. Escapa, P. Daleo, O. Iribarne, B.R. Silliman, M.D. Bertness. 2007. Local and geographic variation in grazing intensity by herbivorous crabs in SW Atlantic salt marshes. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 349: 235–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and herbivory has also been suggested to play an important role in southwestern Atlantic marshes (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=albertietal2007/&gt; Not only are consumers important on a small scale as demonstrated by cage experiments in various locations (Silliman and Zieman 2001, Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005),&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001&gt;Silliman B.R., Zieman JC. 2001.

Science 310:1803–6.&lt;/ref&gt; but they also affect primary productivity across large geographic areas (Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;

Bertness and Silliman have also suggested that while salt marshes may have historically been nutrient limited and bottom up controlled, human disturbances such as eutrophication and predator depletion has shifted these systems to top down control in recent decades (Bertness and Silliman 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessandsilliman2008/&gt;

==Regional causes of salt marsh die-off==

[[File:Calving marsh creek bank.jpg|thumb|right|Calving creek bank of a marsh experiencing die-off in Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] Both top-down and bottom-up forces have been proposed as primary drivers of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. The relative importance of these factors depends on the abiotic and biotic conditions of each local or regional marsh system and its environment.
 
===Top-down interactions===

Human activities can trigger trophic cascades (Jefferies 1997),&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt; which occur when the predators that limit abundance of [[prey]] and thereby enhance survival of the next lower [[trophic level]] are depleted (Strong 1992).&lt;ref name=strong1992/&gt; Depletion of [[top predators]] releases their prey from consumer control and leads to population declines of the next lower trophic level, often the [[primary producers]]. [[Trophic cascade]]s occur across a minimum of three trophic levels and can impact [[Community (ecology)|community]] dynamics in a variety of systems (Estes et al. 1998).&lt;ref name=estesetal1998&gt;Estes, J.A., M.T. Tinker, T.M. Williams, and D.F. Doak. 1998. Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems. Science 282: 473–476.&lt;/ref&gt; Trophic cascades can induce salt marsh die-off and transform green landscapes into [[Urchin barren|barrens]] (Estes and Duggins 1995, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Primary triggers of trophic cascades through human action include introduction of [[invasive species]], [[overexploitation]], and [[climate change]] (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 2006, Gedan et al. 2009, Gedan and Bertness 2011).&lt;ref name=jacksonetal2001&gt;Jackson, J.B.C., et al. 2001. Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems. Science 293: 629–638.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006&gt;Lotze, H.K., Lenihan H.S., Bourque B.J., Bradbury R.H. and others. 2006. Depletion, degradation, and recovery potential of estuaries and coastal seas. Science 312: 1806-1809.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Invasive Species====

[[File:Myocastor Coypus Nutria Biberratte.jpg|thumb|right|The invasive rodent, nutria, ''[[Coypu|Myocastor coypus]]'']] Human introduction of non-native species can also contribute to top-down control of marsh systems (Furbish and Albano 1994, Gough and Grace 1998).&lt;ref name=furbishandalbano1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998&gt;Gough L. and J.B. Grace. 1998. Effects of flooding, salinity and herbivory on coastal plant communities, Louisiana, United States. Oecologia 117:527–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced feral horses on the barrier islands of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas have entirely denuded marsh ecosystems (Furbish and Albano 1994),&lt;ref name=furbishandalbano1994/&gt; and the introduced rodent [[Coypu|nutria]] on Gulf Coast marshes of Louisiana can decrease marsh plant primary production (Gough and Grace 1998).&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998/&gt;

The invasive green crab, ''[[Carcinus maenas]]'', can turn off top down control by facilitating the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems. In marshes that have experienced die-off via the trophic cascade initiated by recreational overfishing, purple marsh crabs, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'', can be evicted by the larger green crabs, which prey upon the purple crab. In this way, green crabs can indirectly reduce purple crab herbivory and promotes cordgrass recovery. These results are encouraging because they suggest that invasive species, which are classically considered to have mostly negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade, can sometimes actually contribute to restoring degraded ecosystems.
&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M. D. and T. C. Coverdale. 2013. An invasive species facilitates the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems on Cape Cod. Ecology 94:1937–1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fungal====

Die-off could potentially be explained by [[pathogens]] of salt marsh plants in some areas - fungal species have been identified at die-off sites in the UK as well as US Atlantic and Gulf coast sites (Elmer 2013).&lt;ref name="Elmer, W.H. 2013"&gt;Elmer, W.H. et al. 2013. Sudden Vegetation Dieback in Atlantic and Gulf Coast Salt Marshes. Plant Disease, 436-445.&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal-facilitated marsh degradation is a documented concern in the Southeast Atlantic in particular. Marsh snails [[Littoraria irrorata]] make minor cuts in the cordgrass during grazing. These cuts facilitate growth of fungus, and at high snail densities, can lead to mass [[infection]]s, increased grazing and consequent die-off (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silliman B.R. 2003"&gt;Silliman B.R., Newell SY. 2003. Fungal-farming in a snail. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100:15643–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In coastal New England, this evidence is weaker. Certain fungal pathogens of S. alterniflora were found more frequently in sites of die-off. These pathogens have varying degrees of [[virulence]], and there is some evidence of association with species of [[Fusarium]] and areas of die-off. However, although the association suggests a partial causal link, particularly in stress-predisposed plants, strong [[evidence]] is lacking to suggest that such fungal pathogens are a major cause of die-off in New England (Elmer 2013).&lt;ref name="Elmer, W.H. 2013"/&gt;

====Overexploitation====

Overharvesting has led to the collapse of various shallow-water marine [[ecosystems]] around the globe (Jackson et al. 2001),&lt;ref name=jacksonetal2001/&gt; including [[coral reef]]s (Hughes et al. 2003),&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T. P., et al. 2003. Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs. Science 301:929–933.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seagrass|sea grass beds]], and [[kelp forest]]s (Estes et al. 1998).&lt;ref name=estesetal1998/&gt;

=====Commercial fishing=====

[[File:Snails eating fungus on cordgrass.png|thumb|border|Marsh snail (''L. irrorata'') eats fungus on cordgrass, killing the plants]]
Research on the salt marsh snail ''[[Littoraria irrorata]]'' and its effects on marsh plant productivity, have provided strong evidence of consumer control in marshes triggered by overexploitation. This snail is capable of turning strands of cordgrass ''(Spartina alterniflora'') (&gt;2.5m tall) into [[mudflat]]s within 8 months, which is less than one growing season (Silliman and Bertness 2002).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt; As previously referenced, marsh snails inflict cuts on cordgrass leaves when they graze, providing substratum and nutrients for [[fungus]]. At high snail densities, cordgrass can succumb to fungal [[infection]]s and marsh die-off can ensue (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silliman B.R. 2003"/&gt; Natural predators of the marsh snail are blue crabs (''Callinectes sapidus'') and terrapin turtles (''Malaclemys terrapin''), which historically regulated snail abundances. However, these predators have been commercially overexploited, and now suffer from diseases due to small population size, releasing the snails from consumer pressure, and allowing the snails to wreak havoc on salt marsh cordgrass populations (Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name="sillimanandbertness2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;

[[File:Enhydra lutris asleep 3.jpg|thumb|border|[[Sea otter]]]]
A classic example of a [[trophic cascade]] was caused by the overexploitation of [[sea otters]] in the 1980s (Estes &amp; Duggins 1995).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt; Sea otters eat [[Sea urchins|urchins]], which in turn graze on [[macroalgae]] in a food chain that, when altered, can lead to [[urchin barrens]]. Sea otters in Alaska were hunted to near [[extinction]] for their [[fur|pelts]]. Where sea otter populations have persisted, they suppress the abundance of urchins and thus have an indirect positive effect on the density of macroalgae. In contrast, in sites where sea otters are absent, sea urchin populations have surged and caused urchin barrens to develop. Wherever sea otters have been reinstated, sea urchin populations have been reduced, and kelp densities have increased, returning the habitat to its original healthy state. This example demonstrates the potential for whole-ecosystem recovery with the reestablishment of consumers (Estes and Duggins 1995).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt;
 
Other trophic cascades, such as those caused by crabs such as ''[[Chasmagnathus granulata]]'' in South America, are at least in part due to overfishing of top predators (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=albertietal2007/&gt;

=====Recreational fishing=====
[[File:Sesarma reticulatum.png|thumb|right|The purple marsh crab, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'']]
In New England, predator depletion has triggered extensive marsh die-off salt marsh creek banks. Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of creek banks in more than 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, die-off has recently spread into [[Narragansett Bay]], Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of creek banks. The [[nocturnal]] purple marsh crab, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'', is playing a major role in this die-off through increased [[burrowing]] and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top-down control caused by [[Human impact on the environment|human disturbances]] as the primary agent driving die-off.
 
Altieri and colleagues performed a series of experiments (Altieri et al. 2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012&gt;Altieri, A.H., M.D. Bertness, T.C. Coverdale, N.C. Herrmann, C. Angelini. 2012. A trophic cascade triggers collapse of a salt-marsh ecosystem with intensive recreational fishing. Ecology 93(6): 1402-1410.&lt;/ref&gt; designed to elucidate the mechanisms driving marsh die-off more specifically. ''Sesarma'' crabs are normally preyed upon by blue crabs (''[[Callinectes sapidus]]''), and [[fish]] including [[striped bass]] (''[[Morone saxatilis]]'') and [[smooth dogfish]] (''[[Mustelus canis]]''). Although the cascading effects of overfishing have been demonstrated across various ecosystems (Myers and Worm 2003), research on predator depletion has focused almost exclusively on the impact of large-scale commercial overfishing (Worm et al. 2009). However, Altieri and colleagues (2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt; demonstrated that the predators of ''Sesarma'' were, and continue to be, overexploited by recreational [[Angler (fishing)|anglers]]. Their results show that die-off and vegetated marshes differed dramatically in recreational fishing pressure, as anglers were observed only at die-off sites.

Die-off marshes had half the biomass of top-level predators found at vegetated sites, while the biomass of nonharvested consumers did not differ between die-off and vegetated sites. Additionally, the predation rate on ''Sesarma'' at vegetated sites was triple that of die-off sites, and crabs consumed four times more grass at die-off sites than at vegetated sites. Historical reconstructions showed that little net marsh loss (&lt;5%) from 1939-2005 occurred at currently vegetated sites. In contrast, die-off marshes exhibited the onset of die-off in the mid-70s, with consistently increasing vegetation loss through 2005, at which time &gt;20% of the total marsh area was lost to die-off and &gt;80% of the cordgrass zone was unvegetated. This divergence between die-off and vegetated marshes in vegetation loss coincides with a period of rapid increase in the number of docks and boat slips before the mid-70s that resulted in the establishment of &gt;70% of that fishing [[infrastructure]] currently present at die-off marshes. These results provide evidence that ''Sesarma'' release from predation pressure by crabs and fish due to recreational overfishing by anglers is driving a trophic cascade that is responsible for extensive marsh die-off throughout southern New England (Altieri et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt;
 
[[File:Marsh erosion.png|right|500px|Denuded, eroding salt marsh creek bank]]Altieri and colleagues (2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt; further hypothesized that historic, large-scale, industrialized overexploitation of fish in the northwest Atlantic (Lotze et al. 2006)&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006/&gt; increased marsh [[vulnerability]] to the effects of localized recreational fishing to the point that large-scale die off ensued, and that resultant localized die-offs could coalesce into complete, region-wide marsh die-off if overexploitation of top consumers continues (Altieri et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt;

Most recently, Bertness and colleagues (Bertness et al. 2014b)&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M.D., C. P. Brisson* T. C. Coverdale, M. C. Bevil, S. M. Crotty and E. R. Suglia. 2014 Experimental predator removal causes rapid salt marsh die-off. Ecology Letters 17(7):830–835. doi: 10.1111/ele.12287.&lt;/ref&gt; performed a field experiment excluding predators from plots on the grazing border of the marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered die-off by increasing the abundances of ''Sesarma'' crabs and the intensity of herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of die-off into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of die-off, including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant collapse, 2) boat wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect plant health, 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in die-off. (Bertness et al. 2014a)&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M. D., C. Brisson, M. Bevil, and S. Crotty. 2014. Herbivory drives the spread of salt marsh die-off. PLoS ONE 9(3): e92916.&lt;/ref&gt; This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change.

===Bottom-up interactions===

====Hypersaline and anoxic soils====

One theory of bottom-up control lies with differential [[soil]] [[chemistry]] between vegetated and die-off areas. Drought-associated changes in soil chemistry have been proposed to be associated with areas of die-off. Droughts are often associated with increased [[salinity]] and [[acidity]] [[Stress (biology)|stress]] - soils [[oxidize]] under [[freshwater]] or [[tidal]] [[moisture]] limitation, leading to increased acidity. [[Hypersaline|Hypersalinity]] has been linked to reduced S. alterniflora survival (Brown et al. 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C.E., S.R. Pezeshki, R.D. DeLaune. The effects of salinity and soil drying on nutrient uptake and growth of ''S. alterniflora'' in a simulated tidal system. Environmental and Experimental Botany 58(1-3): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; However, salt marsh plants are generally tolerant of a broad range of salinity levels, and increased salinity has not consistently been observed in die-off sites (Alber et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alber M., E. Swenson, S. Adamowicz, I. Mendelssohn 2008. Salt marsh dieback: an overview of recent events in the US. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]], 8(1):1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is uncertainty attributed to the link between different soil conditions and sites of die-off for several reasons. First, measurements may not be taken in frequent enough intervals to capture brief fluctuations in soil conditions associated with die-off. Second, attributing [[Causation and correlation|causation]] with changing soil conditions and die-off is potentially dubious. [[Reverse causation|Reverse causality]] is a potential explanation; that is, soil chemistry differences may be a result rather than an agent of die-off. For instance, one study noted higher salinity levels in die-off areas in some months, but this was possibly attributable to altered [[root]] or [[evaporation]] dynamics due to die-off (Marsh 2007). 
 
====Eutrophication====

Nutrient enrichment is a pervasive global threat to both marine and terrestrial ecosystems (Galloway et al. 2008, Verhoeven et al. 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, J. et al. Transformation of the nitrogen cycle: recent trends, questions and potential solutions. Science 320, 889–892 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verhoeven, J. T. et al. Regional and global concerns over wetlands and water quality. Trends Ecol. Evol. 21, 96–103 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In marine ecosystems, increased flow of nitrogen can trigger severe algal blooms, anoxic conditions, and widespread fisheries losses (Diaz &amp; Rosenberg 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Diaz, R. J. and R. Rosenberg. Spreading dead zones and consequences for marine ecosystems. Science 321, 926–929 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In salt marshes, an important interface ecosystem between land and sea, nutrient addition has been hypothesized to contribute to widespread creek die-offs (Deegan et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=deeganetal2012&gt;Deegan, L.A., Bowen, J.L., Drake, D., Fleeger, J.W., Friedrichs, C.T., Hobbie, J.E., Hopkinson, C., Johnson, D.S., Johnson, J.M., LeMay, L.E., Miller, E., Peterson, B.J., Picard, C., Sheldon, S., Sutherland, M., Vallino, J. and S. Warren. 2012. Coastal eutrophication as a driver of salt marsh loss. Nature 490:388-392.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To test this hypothesis, Linda Deegan and colleagues performed a nine-year study at one site in Massachusetts. The researchers found that tidal creek enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus led to decreased investment in belowground nutrient gathering roots and rhizomes, increased microbial decomposition of organic matter, and eventual creek collapse and salt marsh loss (Deegan et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=deeganetal2012/&gt;
 
Similar studies in Connecticut, however, have been unable to replicate these findings. Shimon Anisfeld and Troy Hill performed a 5-year fertilization experiment of a salt marsh in Long Island Sound and found that neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss, reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production. They suggest that high nutrient levels can significantly alter marsh processes and increase gross carbon loss from sediment but that other processes may compensate for these impacts. No net deleterious effects of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability are anticipated from this study (Anisfeld and Hill 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Anisfeld, S. and T. Hill. 2012. Fertilization effects on elevation change and belowground carbon balance in a Long Island Sound tidal marsh. Estuaries and Coasts 35: 201–211.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other eutrophication studies performed in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes to look at the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. This study suggests that eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt;

====Potential for Synergistic effects====

[[Coastal]] ecosystems suffer from a variety of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impacts]], such as large-scale [[eutrophication]], [[food web]] alteration, runaway consumer effects, [[climate change]], [[habitat destruction]], and [[disease]]. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or [[synergistic]] interactions between impacts compounding the amount of ecosystem [[habitat degradation|degradation]]. One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail [[overgrazing]] of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent die-off (as explained above). However, this die-off has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Drought stress that raises soil salinities and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Cases such as these highlight how [[abiotic]] and biotic interactions can interact to affect [[ecosystem health]].

Anthropogenic actions also can cause eutrophication, or increase the nutrient load, of marine ecosystems, through [[Runoff (water)|runoff]] into the system containing [[fertilizer]], [[sewage]], dishwasher soap, and other [[nitrogen]]- and phosphorus-rich substances. Eutrophication is pervasive in coastal marine ecosystems (Lotze et al. 2006)&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006/&gt; and can indirectly initiate trophic cascades and increase consumer control of plants. For example, insect herbivory in marshes has been positively [[correlated]] with nutrient availability in Atlantic salt marshes (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008&gt;Bertness, M.D., C.M. Crain, C. Holdredge and N. Sala. 2008. Eutrophication and consumer control of New England salt marsh primary production. Conservation Biology 22: 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt; In Narragansett Bay, insect herbivory suppresses primary production of human disturbed salt marshes by almost 40%. Nitrogen additions through human activity can increase insect herbivory so much that primary production is suppressed by nearly 60%, while marshes without human [[shoreline]] development remain solely under bottom-up control (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; Increased nutrient supply can lead to runaway herbivory in other systems as well (Gough and Grace 1998, Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998/&gt;
 
For example, eutrophication initiates top-down control via the impact of [[snow geese]] on the [[arctic]] marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997).&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt; By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in [[temperate]] [[wetlands]] to feeding in heavily fertilized [[agricultural]] fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to [[oxygenate]] the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] for marsh plants disallows [[Recruitment (biology)|sexual recruitment]] to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by [[Ramet|clonal]] runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of [[artificial fertilizer]]s on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt;

A major goal of ecology over the next century will be to understand how ecosystems will respond to current and future human impacts and the additive or synergistic interactions between them.

==Management implications and conservation==

[[File:Spartina foliosa.jpg|thumb|Cordgrass binds sediment, attenuates waves and prevents shoreline erosion]] [[Ecosystem services]] are the benefits that humans derive from ecological systems. Today, one of the arguments for protecting salt marshes is to increase the quality and quantity of these services. Salt marshes sequester nitrogen, filtering runoff water and reducing nitrogen input to [[estuaries]] (Valiela and Cole 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Valiela I. and M.L. Cole. 2002. Comparative evidence that salt marshes and mangroves may protect seagrass meadows from land-derived nitrogen loads. Ecosystems 5: 92–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marshes also provide essential refuge habitat for young fish and [[crustaceans]], provisioning coastal fisheries (Boesch and Turner 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Boesch D.F. and R.E. Turner. 1984. Dependence of fishery species on salt marshes: the role of food and refuge. Estuaries 7: 460–468.&lt;/ref&gt; that account for 90% of the world’s fish catch (UNEP 2006).&lt;ref&gt;UNEP. 2006. Marine and coastal ecosystems and human well-being: a synthesis report based on the findings of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. UNEP.&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marshes also [[sequester carbon]], which will be an important ecosystem service as climate change intensifies (Chmura et al. 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Chmura G.L., S.C. Anisfeld, D.R. Cahoon, and J.C. Lynch. 2003. Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 17: 1111–1133.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the most important ecosystem service salt marshes provide is to act as natural sea barriers because grasses bind soils, prevent shoreline [[erosion]], attenuate waves, and reduce coastal [[flooding]] (Costanza et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R., O. Perez-Maqueo, M.L. Martinez, P. Sutton, S.J. Anderson, and K. Mulder. 2008. The value of coastal wetlands for hurricane protection. Ambio 37: 241–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the marsh’s natural ability to [[Buffer zone|buffer]] against erosion and flooding may be reduced by creek bank die-off. Since Spartina alterniflora is responsible for sediment binding and [[peat]] deposition (Redfield 1965),&lt;ref&gt;Redfield, A.C. 1965 Ontogeny of a salt marsh estuary. Science 147: 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt; cordgrass die-off may compromise the ability of salt marshes to keep pace with [[Sea level rise|sea-level rise]]. Also, the concentration of Sesarma burrows in New England salt marsh peat may directly trigger the erosion and collapse of the peat foundation of marshes.

On Cape Cod, marsh creek banks are often so riddled with ''Sesarma'' burrows that they collapse, exposing fresh peat to further burrowing and erosion (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; Feedbacks between crab herbivory and cordgrass die-off may thus lead to the retreat of marsh edges. For example, Coverdale and colleagues found that 20 years of die-off on Cape Cod have resulted in the loss of over 200 years of marsh accretion and hundreds of acres of marsh loss.&lt;ref&gt;Coverdale, T. C., E. W. Young, S.F. Yin, C. P. Brisson, J. P. Donnelly and M. D. Bertness. 2014. Indirect human impacts reverse centuries of carbon sequestration and salt marsh accretion. PLoS One, 9(3): e93296.&lt;/ref&gt; The detrimental effects trophic cascades have had on marshes not only reduce the [[biodiversity]], health, and aesthetic appeal of these ecosystems, but also compromise the ability of marshes to provide key ecosystem services to human populations.

==Conclusions==

Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, bottom-up control remains the central dogma determining marsh [[Management science|management]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Ecosystem restoration|restoration]] efforts. Salt marshes are currently managed as if they are exclusively regulated by physical factors. However, global and near shore top predator depletion leading to the release of cryptic or unappreciated herbivores may be the biggest current threat to salt marshes. Theory dependency (subconscious favoring of identifying and/or examining natural phenomena that tend to confirm rather than refute the current paradigm of a study system [Kuhn 1962]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T. 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;) and demonstration, rather than falsifying science, have been the leading culprits in this oversight. Consequently, threats to salt marshes that are governed by top down control are being overlooked, with potentially devastating consequences.

Trophic cascades are powerful interactions that strongly regulate [[biodiversity]], community structure, and ecosystem function. Trophic cascades were originally thought to be rare, but it has become clear that they occur across diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems at both small and large spatial and temporal scales. Trophic cascades are common and pervasive aspects of many communities long thought to be controlled by bottom-up forces and/or resistant to consumer control.
 
Conservation of ecosystems affected by trophic cascades has thus not adequately incorporated top-down control into their management and restoration plans and efforts, but emerging research has emphasized that this is necessary to protect the services provided by these ecosystems and to restore these ecosystems to their original conditions. Failure to do so could lead to trophic cascades transforming highly diverse and productive plant communities to barren flats. 
 
Additionally, failure to reevaluate the current paradigm and recognize that both bottom-up and top-down forces affect many features of ecosystem structure and function, and that these forces are complementary rather than contradictory, could bar any incorporation of both mechanisms into any management plan and reduce the success of conservation efforts before they even begin.

[[File:AB Keeled Scales.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Keeled scales of a [[colubrid]] snake (buff-striped keelback; ''[[Amphiesma stolatum]]'')]]
In most [[biology|biological]] nomenclature, a '''scale''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:λεπίς|λεπίς]] ''lepis'', [[Latin language|Latin]] ''squama'') is a small rigid [[Plate (animal anatomy)|plate]] that grows out of an [[animal]]'s [[skin]] to provide protection.  In [[lepidoptera]]n ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, scales are plates on the surface of the [[insect wing]], and provide coloration.  Scales are quite common and have evolved multiple times through [[convergent evolution]], with varying structure and function.

Scales are generally classified as part of an organism's [[integumentary system]].  There are various types of scales according to shape and to [[class (biology)|class]] of animal.

==Fish scales==
[[File:Scale Common Roach.JPG|thumb|Cycloid scales on a [[common roach]] (''Rutilus rutilus'')]]
{{main|Fish scale}}
Fish scales are [[skin|dermally]] derived, specifically in the [[mesoderm]]. This fact distinguishes them from reptile scales paleontologically.
Genetically, the same genes involved in tooth and hair development in mammals are also involved in scale development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. T.| title = Fish scale development: Hair today, teeth and scales yesterday?| journal = Current Biology| volume = 11| last1 = Sharpe| issue = 18| pages = R751–R752| year = 2001| pmid = 11566120| doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00438-9    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmoid scales===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Coelacanth]] --&gt;
True cosmoid scales can only be found on the [[Sarcopterygian]]s. The inner layer of the scale is made of [[lamellar]] bone. On top of this lies a layer of spongy or [[Blood vessel|vascular]] bone and then a layer of [[dentine]]-like material called [[cosmine]]. The upper surface is [[keratin]]. The [[coelacanth]] has modified cosmoid scales that lack cosmine and are thinner than true cosmoid scales.

===Ganoid scales===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gar]] --&gt;
Ganoid scales can be found on [[gar]]s (family [[Lepisosteidae]]), [[bichir]]s, and reedfishes (family [[Polypteridae]]). Ganoid scales are similar to cosmoid scales, but a layer of [[ganoin]] lies over the cosmine layer and under the enamel{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}. Ganoin scales are diamond shaped, shiny, and hard. &lt;!-- Which is it, enamel or dentine?  Only dentine mentioned previously. --&gt; 
Within the ganoin are [[guanine]] compounds, iridescent derivatives of guanine found in a DNA molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 =Levy-Lior | first1 =A. | last2 =Pokroy | first2= B. | last3 =Levavi-Sivan | first3 =B. | last4 =Leiserowitz |first4 = L.| last5 =Weiner | first5 =S. |last6 =Addadi | first6 =L. | title =Biogenic guanine crystals from the skin of fish may be designed to enhance light reflectance | journal = Crystal growth and design | year =2008 | volume =8 | issue =2 | pages = 507–511 |doi=10.1021/cg0704753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iridescent property of these chemicals provide the ganoin its shine.

===Placoid scales===
[[Placoid scale]]s are found on [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] including [[shark]]s. These scales, also called denticles, are similar in structure to [[tooth|teeth]], and have one median spine and two lateral spines.

===Leptoid scales===
Leptoid scales are found on higher-order bony fish.  As they grow they add concentric layers. They are arranged so as to overlap in a head-to-tail direction, like roof tiles, allowing a smoother flow of water over the body and therefore reducing [[Drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn = 978-1-118-92421-1| last1 = Ballard| first1 = Bonnie| last2 = Cheek| first2 = Ryan | title = Exotic Animal Medicine for the Veterinary Technician | date = 2 July 2016 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1_NDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT786&amp;dq=leptoid%20scale&amp;pg=PT786#v=onepage&amp;q=leptoid%20scale&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They come in two forms:

*'''Cycloid scales''' have a smooth outer edge, and are most common on fish with soft fin rays, such as [[salmon]] and [[carp]].
*'''Ctenoid scales''' have a toothed outer edge, and are usually found on fish with spiny fin rays, such as [[Bass (fish)|bass]] and [[crappie]].

==Reptilian scales==
[[File:Gold Dust Day Gecko closeup hawaii edit 1.jpg|thumb|Brightly colored scales on a [[gold dust day gecko]]]]
{{main|Reptile scales}}

[[Reptile]] scale types include: cycloid, granular (which appear bumpy), and keeled (which have a center ridge). Scales usually vary in size, the stouter, larger scales cover parts that are often exposed to physical stress (usually the feet, tail and head), while scales are small around the joints for flexibility. Most snakes have extra broad scales on the belly, each scale covering the belly from side to side.

The scales of all reptiles have an epidermal component (what one sees on the surface), but many reptiles, such as [[crocodilian]]s and turtles, have [[osteoderm]]s underlying the epidermal scale. Such scales are more properly termed [[scute]]s. Snakes, [[tuatara]]s and many lizards lack osteoderms. All reptilian scales have a dermal papilla underlying the epidermal part, and it is there that the osteoderms, if present, would be formed.

==Avian scales==
[[File:Riesenseeadler Fang.JPG|thumb|Scales on talons of a [[Steller's sea eagle]] (''Haliaeetus pelagicus'')]] 
{{main|Bird anatomy#Scales}}
Birds' scales are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. The scales and scutes of birds were thought to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to those of reptiles,&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Alfred M. |year=1972 |title=Avian Anatomy - integument |location=East Lansing, Michigan, USA |publisher=USDA Avian Anatomy Project, Michigan State University |pages=67, 344, 394–601}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now agreed to have evolved independently, being degenerate feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, X., Zhou, Z., Wang, X., Zhang, F., Zhang, X., Wang, Y., ... &amp; Xu, X. (2013). Hind wings in basal birds and the evolution of leg feathers. Science,339(6125), 1309-1312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, R. H., &amp; Knapp, L. W. (2003). Avian skin development and the evolutionary origin of feathers. Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution, 298(1), 57-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mammalian scales==
An example of a scaled mammal is the [[pangolin]]. Its scales are made of keratin and are used for protection, similar to an [[armadillo]]'s armor. They have been convergently evolved, being unrelated to the animal's distant reptile ancestors, except that they use a similar gene.

On the other hand, the [[musky rat-kangaroo]], has scales on its feet and tail&lt;ref&gt;Rainforest-Australia.com&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rainforest-australia.com/rkangaroo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030065952/http://rainforest-australia.com/rkangaroo.htm |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The precise nature of its purported scales has not been studied in detail, but they appear to be structurally different from pangolin scales.

[[Anomalure]]s also have scales on their tail undersides.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Theodore (1984). Macdonald, D., ed. The Encyclopedia of Mammals. New York: Facts on File. p. 632. {{ISBN|0-87196-871-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foot pad epidermal tissues in most mammal species have been compared to the scales of other vertebrates. They are likely derived from cornification processes or stunted fur much like avian reticulae are derived from stunted feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ian Campbell Spearman, The Integument, CUP Archive, 28/06/1973 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthropod scales==
[[Butterflies]] and [[moth]]s - the order [[Lepidoptera]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] "scale-winged") - have membranous wings covered in delicate, powdery scales, which are modified [[setae]].  Each scale consists of a series of tiny stacked platelets of organic material, and butterflies tend to have the scales broad and flattened, while moths tend to have the scales narrower and more hair like.  Scales are usually [[pigment]]ed, but some types of scales are metallic, or iridescent, without pigments; because the thickness of the platelets is on the same order as the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] the plates lead to structural coloration and [[iridescence]] through the physical phenomenon described as [[thin-film optics]]. The most common color produced in this fashion is [[blue]], such as in the ''[[Morpho]]'' butterflies. Other colors can be seen on the [[Chrysiridia rhipheus|sunset moth]].

The '''sliding filament theory''' explains the mechanism of [[muscle contraction]] based on muscle proteins that slide past each other to generate movement.&lt;ref name = "Silverthorn 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Silverthorn | first = Dee Unglaub | authorlink = | chapter = Muscles | title = Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach | publisher = Pearson | series = | volume = | edition = 7th | date = 2016 | location = San Francisco, CA | pages = 377–416 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-321-98122-7 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was independently introduced in 1954 by two research teams, one consisting of [[Andrew Huxley|Andrew F.

Andrew Huxley and Niedergerke introduced it as a "very attractive" hypothesis.&lt;ref name=andrew54&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=A.F.|author2=Niedergerke, R.|title=Interference microscopy of living muscle fibres|journal=Nature|year=1954|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=971–973|pmid=13165697|doi=10.1038/173971a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the sliding filament theory, the myosin (thick) filaments of [[Skeletal muscle|muscle fibers]] slide past the actin (thin) filaments during muscle contraction, while the two groups of filaments remain at relatively constant length. Before the 1950s there were several competing theories on muscle contraction, including electrical attraction, protein folding, and protein modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rall|first1=Jack A.|title=Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4939-2006-8|pages=21–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gz8BBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-2007-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel theory directly introduced a new concept called cross-bridge theory (classically swinging cross-bridge, now mostly referred to as cross-bridge cycle) which explains the molecular mechanism of sliding filament. Cross-bridge theory states that actin and myosin form a protein complex (classically called [[Myofibril|actomyosin]]) by attachment of myosin head on the actin filament, thereby forming a sort of cross-bridge between the two filaments. These two complementary hypotheses turned out to be the correct description, and became a universally accepted explanation of the mechanism of muscle movement.&lt;ref name=wood&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=A.W.|title=Physiology, Biophysics, and Biomedical Engineering|year=2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-46-655279-1|pages=158–162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0fSBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early works===
The first muscle protein discovered was myosin by a German scientist [[Willy Kuhne|Willy Kühne]],  who extracted and named it in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hartman|first1=M. A.|last2=Spudich|first2=J. A.|title=The myosin superfamily at a glance|journal=Journal of Cell Science|year=2012|volume=125|issue=7|pages=1627–1632|doi=10.1242/jcs.094300|pmid=22566666|pmc=3346823}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 a Russian husband and wife team Vladimir Alexandrovich Engelhardt and Militsa Nikolaevna Lyubimova discovered that myosin had an enzymatic (called [[ATPase]]) property that can breakdown [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to release energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelhartd|first1=W. A.|last2=Ljubimowa|first2=M. N.|title=Myosine and Adenosinetriphosphatase|journal=Nature|year=1939|volume=144|issue=3650|pages=668–669|doi=10.1038/144668b0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], a Hungarian physiologist, turned his focus on muscle physiology after winning the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1937 for his works on [[vitamin C]] and [[fumaric acid]]. He demonstrated in 1942 that ATP was the source of energy for muscle contraction. He actually observed that muscle fibres containing myosin B shortened in the presence of ATP, but not with myosin A, the experience which he later described as "perhaps the most thrilling moment of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szent-Györgyi|first1=Albert|title=Lost in the twentieth century|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|year=1963|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.32.070163.000245|pmid=14140702}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Brunó Ferenc Straub|Brunó Ferenc'' ''Straub]], he soon found that myosin B was associated with another protein, which they called actin, while myosin A was not. Straub purified actin in 1942, and Szent-Györgyi purified myosin A in 1943. It became apparent that myosin B was a combination of myosin A and actin, so that myosin A retained the original name, whereas they renamed myosin B as actomyosin. By the end of the 1940s Szent-Györgyi's team had postulated with evidence that contraction of actomyosin was equivalent to muscle contraction as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szent-Gyorgyi|first1=A. G.|title=The early history of the biochemistry of muscle contraction|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|year=2004|volume=123|issue=6|pages=631–641|doi=10.1085/jgp.200409091|pmid=15173217|pmc=2234565}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the notion was generally opposed, even from the likes of Nobel laureates such as [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof]] and [[Archibald Hill]], who adhered to the prevailing dogma that myosin was a structural protein and not a functional enzyme.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt; However, in one of his last contributions to muscle research, Szent-Györgyi demonstrated that actomyosin driven by ATP was the basic principle of muscle contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szent-Györgyi|first1=A|title=Free-energy relations and contraction of actomyosin|journal=The Biological Bulletin|year=1949|volume=96|issue=2|pages=140–161|pmid=18120626|doi=10.2307/1538196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the sliding filament theory===
[[File:Sarcomere.gif|300px|thumb|right| Structure of muscle fibre (sarcomere) under electron microscope with schematic explanation]]
By the time [[Hugh Huxley]] earned his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1952 on his research on the structure of muscle, Szent-Györgyi had turned his career into cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rall|first1=Jack A.|title=Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|year=2014|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley went to [[Francis O. Schmitt]]'s laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with a post-doctoral fellowship in September 1952, where he was joined by another English post-doctoral fellow [[Jean Hanson]] in January 1953. Hanson had a PhD in muscle structure from [[King's College London|King's College, London]] in 1951. Huxley had used [[X-ray diffraction]] to speculate that muscle proteins, particularly myosin, form structured filaments giving rise to [[sarcomere]] (a segment of muscle fibre). Their main aim was to use [[electron microscopy]] to study the details of those filaments as never done before. They soon discovered and confirmed the filament nature of muscle proteins. Myosin and actin form overlapping filaments, myosin filaments mainly constituting the A band (the dark region of a sarcomere), while actin filaments traverse both the A and I (light region) bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=Jean|last2=Huxley|first2=Hugh E.|title=Structural basis of the cross-striations in muscle|journal=Nature|year=1953|volume=172|issue=4377|pages=530–532|doi=10.1038/172530b0|pmid=13099257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley was the first to suggest the sliding filament theory in 1953, stating:

{{quote|text="… [I]f it is postulated that stretching of the muscle takes place, not by an extension of the filaments, but by a process in which the two sets of ''filaments slide'' [emphasis added] past each other; extensibility will then be inhibited if the myosin and actin are linked together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=HE|title=Electron microscope studies of the organisation of the filaments in striated muscle|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|year=1953|volume=12|issue=3|pages=387–394|pmid=13115446|doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90156-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later, in 1996, Huxley regretted that he should have included Hanson in the formulation of his theory because it was based on their collaborative work.&lt;ref name=huxley96&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=H. E.|title=A personal view of muscle and motility mechanisms|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|year=1996|volume=58|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.58.030196.000245|pmid=8815787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Huxley]], whom [[Alan Hodgkin]] described as "wizard with scientific apparatus", had just discovered the mechanism of the nerve impulse ([[action potential]]) transmission (for which he and Hodgkin later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963) in 1949 using his own design of [[voltage clamp]], and was looking for an associate who could properly dissect out muscle fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Yale E.|author2=Franzini-Armstrong, Clara |author3=Armstrong, Clay M. |title=Andrew Fielding Huxley (1917–2012)|journal=Nature|year=2012|volume=486|issue=7404|pages=474–474|doi=10.1038/486474a|bibcode = 2012Natur.486..474G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon recommendation of a close friend Robert Stämpfli, a German physician [[Rolf Niedergerke]] joined him at the University of Cambridge in 1952. By then he realised that the conventionally used [[phase contrast microscope]] was not suitable for fine structures of muscle fibres, and thus developed his own [[interference microscopy|interference microscope]]. Between March 1953 and January 1954 they executed their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rall|first1=Jack A.|title=Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|year=2014|pages=30–33, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley recollected that at the time the only person who ever thought of sliding filaments before 1953 was [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] (later winner of the 1964  [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=AF|title=Discoveries on muscle: observation, theory, and experiment|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1986|volume=293|issue=6539|pages=115–117|pmid=3089413|pmc=1340847|doi=10.1136/bmj.293.6539.115}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the summer of 1953 at [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to use electron microscope there. There he met Hugh Huxley and Hanson with whom he shared data and information on their works. They parted with an agreement that they would keep in touch, and when their aim is achieved, they would publish together, if they ever "reached similar conclusions".&lt;ref name=hugh2004/&gt;

==The sliding filament theory==
[[Image:Sarcomere.svg|300px|thumb|right|Diagrammatic explanation of sliding filament hypothesis]]
The sliding filament theory was born from two consecutive papers published on the 22 May 1954 issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' under the common theme "Structural Changes in Muscle During Contraction". Though their conclusions were fundamentally similar, their underlying experimental data and propositions were different.

===Huxley-Niedergerke hypothesis===

The first paper, written by Andrew Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke, is titled "Interference microscopy of living muscle fibres". It was based on their study of frog muscle using interference microscope, which Andrew Huxley developed for the purpose. According to them:&lt;ref name=andrew54/&gt;
#the I bands are composed of actin filaments, and the A bands principally of myosin filaments; and
#during contraction, the actin filaments move into the A bands between the myosin filaments.

===Huxley-Hanson hypothesis===

The second paper, by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson, is titled "Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation". It is more elaborate and was based on their study of rabbit muscle using phase contrast and electron microscopes. According to them:&lt;ref name=huxley54&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huxley|first=H.|author2=Hanson, J. |title=Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation|journal=Nature|year=1954|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=973–976|pmid=13165698|doi=10.1038/173973a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the backbone of a muscle fibre is actin filaments which extend from Z line up to one end of H zone, where they are attached to an elastic component which they named S filament;
#myosin filaments extend from one end of the A band through the H zone up to the other end of the A band;
#myosin filaments remain in relatively constant length during muscle stretch or contraction;
#if myosin filaments contract beyond the length of A band, their ends fold up to form contraction bands;
#myosin and actin filaments lie side-by-side in the A band and in the absence of ATP they do not form cross-linkages;
#during stretching, only the I bands and H zone increase in length, while A bands remain the same;
#during contraction, actin filaments move into the A bands and the H zone is filled up, the I bands shorten, the Z line comes in contact with the A bands; and
#the possible driving force of contraction is the actin-myosin linkages which depend on [[ATP hydrolysis]] by the myosin.

==Reception and consequences==

In spite of strong evidences, the sliding filament theory did not gain any support for several years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spudich|first1=J.|title=Memories of Hugh E. Huxley (1924-2013)|journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell|year=2013|volume=24|issue=18|pages=2769–2771|doi=10.1091/mbc.E13-08-0454|pmid=24030511|pmc=3771940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szent-Györgyi himself refused to believe that myosin filaments were confined to the thick filament (A band).&lt;ref name=huxley96/&gt; F.O. Schmitt, whose electron microscope provided the best data, also remained sceptical of the original images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=Hugh E.|title=Memories of early work on muscle contraction and regulation in the 1950’s and 1960’s|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|year=2008|volume=369|issue=1|pages=34–42|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.11.130|pmid=18070595}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also immediate arguments as to the organisation of the filaments, whether the two sets (myosin and actin) of filaments were merely overlapping or continuous. It was only with the new electron microscope that Hugh Huxley confirmed the overlapping nature of the filaments in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=HE|title=The double array of filaments in cross-striated muscle|journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology|year=1957|volume=3|issue=5|pages=631–648|pmid=13475381|pmc=2224118|doi=10.1083/jcb.3.5.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also from this publication that the existence of actin-myosin linkage (now called cross-bridge) was clearly shown. But he took another five years to provide evidence that the cross-bridge was a dynamic interaction between actin and myosin filaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=HE|title=Electron microscope studies on the structure of natural and synthetic protein filaments from striated muscle|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|year=1963|volume=7|pages=281–308|pmid=14064165|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(63)80008-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained the actual molecular arrangement of the filaments using X-ray crystallography by teaming up with [[Kenneth Holmes]], who was trained by [[Rosalind Franklin]], in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=H.

===Cross-bridge mechanism===

With substantial evidence, Hugh Huxley formally proposed the mechanism for sliding filament and is variously called swinging cross-bridge model, cross-bridge theory or cross-bridge model.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duke|first1=T. A. J.|title=Molecular model of muscle contraction|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=1999|volume=96|issue=6|pages=2770–2775|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.6.2770|pmid=10077586|pmc=15844}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He himself preferred the name "swinging crossbridge model", because, as he recalled, "it [the discovery] was, after all, the 1960s".&lt;ref name=hugh2004/&gt;) He published his theory in the 20 June 1969 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' under the title "The Mechanism of Muscular Contraction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=H. E.|title=The Mechanism of Muscular Contraction|journal=Science|year=1969|volume=164|issue=3886|pages=1356–1366|doi=10.1126/science.164.3886.1356|pmid=4181952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to his theory, filament sliding occurs by cyclic attachment and detachment of myosin on actin filaments. Contraction occurs when the myosin pulls the actin filament towards the centre of the A band, detaches from actin and creates a force (stroke) to bind to the next actin molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spudich|first1=James A.|title=The myosin swinging cross-bridge model|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|year=2001|volume=2|issue=5|pages=387–392|doi=10.1038/35073086|pmid=11331913}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was subsequently proven in detail, and is more appropriately known as the cross-bridge cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitts|first1=R. H.|title=The cross-bridge cycle and skeletal muscle fatigue|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|year=2007|volume=104|issue=2|pages=551–558|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01200.2007|pmid=18162480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">A '''sphaeroblast''' is a woody extrusion from the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[branch]] of a [[tree]], usually taking the form of a rounded spherical shape, as if the tree had a boil or mole.&lt;ref&gt;Strouts R G and Winter T G (1994) Diagnosis of ill-health in trees, TSO: London&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Sphaeroblast on weeping beech 02.jpg|thumb|Photograph of a sphaeroblast on the trunk of a weeping beech tree (''Fagus sylvatica'' 'Pendula')]]  

[[File:Sphaeroblast on Fagus 01.jpg|thumb|An image of a sphaeroblast formed on a mature beech tree (''Fagus sylvatica'')]]

Sphaeroblasts originate from a bud initial or a cluster of buds (especially adventitious buds) on the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[branch]] that have abnormally generated a rounded layer of [[cambium]] and then subsequently secondary thickened to produce wood ([[xylem]]), rather than growing shoots or foliage &lt;ref&gt;Watson B (2013) Trees: Their use, management, cultivation &amp; biology, Crowood Press Ltd., England&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is possible that sphaeroblasts are formed in the presence of [[Microorganism|microbes]], as is the case with a [[witch's broom]] formed in a [[tree]], but there has been little scientific research on what causes sphaeroblasts to form and it may be the case that there are a number of different causes of this anomalous growth form, pathogenic or physiological.

Sphaeroblasts are quite common on species of beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]''), holly (''[[Ilex]]''), horse chestnut (''[[Aesculus]]'') and southern beeches (''[[Lophozonia]]''), and also occasionally appear on quite a wide range of other tree species, including [[Pinophyta|conifers]].  They can be of interest to wood carvers, to create unique wooden ornaments.  Their removal from the tree typically causes only a small wound to the trunk or branch, as they are often only superficially attached &lt;ref&gt;Ruhland W ed. (1965) Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology vol. XV: Differentiation and Development, Springer-Verlag: Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sphaeroblasts formed at the base of a southern beech (Lophozonia alpina).jpg|thumb|Sphaeroblasts formed at the base of a southern beech (''Lophozonia alpina'')]] 

There is no known case where the presence of sphaeroblasts has resulted in dieback or structural failure in a living tree.  Sphaeroblasts represent only a very minor distortion of tree growth and are not considered to be a sign of ill-health in a tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">'''Stichomythia''' (Greek: Στιχομυθία) is a technique in [[verse drama]] in which sequences of single alternating lines, or half-lines (hemistichomythia&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;[http://roberthogan.net/books/antilabe-rebuilt.pdf], Antilabe Rebuilt by Robert Hogan.&lt;/ref&gt;) or two-line speeches (distichomythia&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], Die stichomythie in der griechischen tragödie und komödie:
ihre anwendung und ihr ursprung by Adolf Gross (German).&lt;/ref&gt;) are given to alternating [[Character (arts)|characters]]. It typically features repetition and [[antithesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Lesley, ed. | title = New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 3056 | isbn = 0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated in the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]], though many dramatists since have used the technique. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] it derives from the Greek ''stikhos'' ("row, line of verse") + ''muthos'' ("speech, talk").&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford"&gt;Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition Revised&lt;/ref&gt;

Stichomythia is particularly well suited to sections of [[Dialogue (fiction)|dramatic dialogue]] where two characters are in violent dispute. The rhythmic intensity of the alternating lines combined with quick, biting ripostes in the dialogue can create a powerful effect.

==In Ancient Greek drama==
Stichomythia originated in Greek drama.&lt;ref name="Concise Oxford" /&gt; Adolf Gross concludes that stichomythia developed from choral response.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; J. Leonard Hancock differs in this regard, not finding overwhelming evidence for any particular origin theory, but admitting that the role of musical symmetry must have been significant. Instead he finds that the trends, within Ancient Greek aesthetics, toward agonistic expression, subtly in language, and love of symmetry, helped to give rise to stichomythia as a popular dialogue device.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1zkMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:bwNarlyOkSgC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MgIQT8LiNobqtgfDn9T5AQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=editions%3AbwNarlyOkSgC&amp;f=false], Studies in stichomythia by J. Leonard Hancock&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca==
Senecan stichomythia, while ultimately derived from Athenian stichomythia (as Roman theatre is derived from Greek theatre generally&lt;ref name="usu.edu"&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/131romtheatre.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) differs in several respects. First, Seneca uses the technique less than all but the earliest extant pieces of classical Greek tragedy. Secondly, the stichomythic form found in Seneca is less rigid. Finally, and most substantially, Seneca's tragedies are much more prone to revolve around literary quibbles, even leaving aside the plot of the play for entire sections while the characters engage in an essentially linguistic tangent.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==In more recent theatre==
Renaissance Italian and French drama developed in many respects as an imitation of the classic drama of the Greeks and Romans.&lt;ref name="selu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/cfrederic/TheatreHistoryThruRenaissance.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Stichomythic elements, however, were often absent. Where they did occur, they tended to follow the lead of Seneca in using “catchwords” as launching points for each subsequent line.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

Modern theatre rarely uses verse,&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/nov/11/plays-verse-missing-stage | work=The Guardian | first=Raymond | last=Blankenhorn | title=Plays in verse were all the rage, but why are they missing from the stage? | date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; so any construct that depends on verse, such as stichomythia, is also rare. Where a form of stichomythia has been used, the characters involved are typically building subsequent lines on the ideas or metaphors of previous lines, rather than words.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==General trends==
In terms of character relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments.&lt;ref name="Gross" /&gt; While the equal line lengths can create a sense of equality of voice between the characters, stichomythia can also feature one character silencing another with a vociferous rebuff, especially where one character's line interrupts the other's.&lt;ref name="Hogan" /&gt;

In terms of how stichomythia moves forward as a section of dialogue, the Ancient Greeks tended to favor subtle flavorings and reflavorings of grammatical particles, whereas Senecan (and by extension Renaissance) stichomythic passages often turned on verbal minutiae or “catchwords”. Modern theatre, on the other hand, uses the technique in such a manner that the characters use each line to add depth to a shared idea or metaphor.&lt;ref name="Hancock" /&gt;

==Examples==

===Sophocles===
A short example from [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb|R. C. Jebb]]'s translation of ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'': the scene is an argument between [[Ismene]] and her sister [[Antigone]].
For further examples from ''Antigone'', consult the text at the Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Sophocles/antigone.html].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
ISMENE:  And what life is dear to me, bereft of thee? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Ask Creon; all thy care is for him. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Indeed, if I mock, 'tis with pain that I mock thee. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Tell me,—how can I serve thee, even now? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Save thyself: I grudge not thy escape. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   Ah, woe is me! And shall I have no share in thy fate? &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: Thy choice was to live; mine, to die. &lt;br&gt;
ISMENE:   At least thy choice was not made without my protest. &lt;br&gt;
ANTIGONE: One world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Shakespeare ===
''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Act I, scene ii.  [[Richard III of England|Richard Plantagenet]], [[Earl of Gloucester]] (later [[Richard III of England]]) threatens to kill himself unless Lady Anne, widow of Prince Edward (of Lancaster), agrees to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 31)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LADY ANNE:  I would I knew thy heart.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  'Tis figured in my tongue.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   I fear me both are false.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Then never man was true.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   Well, well, put up your sword.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Say, then, my peace is made.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   That shall you know hereafter.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  But shall I live in hope?&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   All men, I hope, live so.&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Vouchsafe to wear this ring.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:   To take is not to give. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
GLOUCESTER:  Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.&lt;br&gt;
LADY ANNE:     Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act III, Scene iv (the Closet scene), [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] is confronted by his mother, the queen, about the play (III, ii) which Hamlet rigged to expose his murderous step-uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Kermode (2000, p 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
QUEEN:   Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Mother, you have my father much offended.&lt;br&gt;
QUEEN:   Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.&lt;br&gt;
HAMLET:  Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "The Merchant of Venice", Shylock and Bassanio enter into an argument using stichomythia at 4.1.65-9, which "catches the dramatic tension of a quasi-forensic interrogation":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SHYLOCK:  I am not bound to please thee with my answers.&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Do all men kill the things they do not love?&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  Hates any man the thing he would not kill?&lt;br&gt;
BASSANIO: Every offence is not a hate at first.&lt;br&gt;
SHYLOCK:  What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further intensification is often achieved by [[antilabe]], in which a single verse line is distributed on alternating speakers.

===Corneille===
An exchange  in ''[[Le Cid]]'' (1.3.215–226), by [[Pierre Corneille]], has been called "an excellent instance of Corneille's skilful handling of 'stichomythia'".&lt;ref&gt;Marks (1918, p. 103)&lt;/ref&gt;  Don Diègue (an old man, the hero's father) has been appointed the prince's tutor, a post that the Count (''le Comte'') wanted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
LE COMTE: Ce que je méritois, vous avez emporté.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Que l'a gagné sur vous l'avoit mieux merité.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Qui peut mieux l'exercer en est bien le plus digne.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: En être refusė n'est pas un bon signe.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Vous l'avez eu par brigue, ėtant vieux courtisan.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: L'éclat de mes hauts faits fut mon seul partisan.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Parlons-en mieux, le Roi fait honneur a votre âge.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Le Roi, quand il en fait, le mesure au courage.&lt;br&gt;
LE COMTE: Et par là cet honneur n'était dû qu'à mon bras.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIÈGUE: Qui n'a pu l'obtenir ne le méritoit pas.&lt;br&gt;

COUNT: He who can exercise it best is the most worthy.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: To be refused it is not a good sign.&lt;br&gt;

COUNT: Let's speak better, the King does honor to your age.&lt;br&gt;
DON DIEGO: The King, when he does it, measures it according to courage.&lt;br&gt;

===Musical drama===
In the scene in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', [[libretto]] by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], where Susanna learns that Marcellina is Figaro's mother, she repeats her disbelief (''Sua madre?'', that is, "his mother?") to each character and is reassured in the same words.  A critic has called that "the merriest and most congenial form imaginable" of stichomythia.&lt;ref&gt;Knepler (1997, p. 192)&lt;/ref&gt;  For another example from opera, the following passage from the libretto by [[Andrea Maffei]] for [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[I masnadieri]]'' has been called "musical stichomythia",&lt;ref&gt;Budden (1992, p. 330)&lt;/ref&gt; though it does not contain repetition or antithesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
AMALIA: Qual mare, qual terra da me t'ha diviso?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Deh! cessa, infelice, l'inchiesta crudel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Mendaci novelle ti dissero ucciso.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Beato se chiuso m'avesse l'avel!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Tu pure, o mio Carlo, provasti gli affanni?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Li possa il tuo core per sempre ignorar!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Anch'io, derelitta, ti piansi lung'anni.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: E un angelo osava per me lagrimar?&lt;ref&gt;AMALIA: Which sea, which land divided you from me?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Oh, unhappy woman, end the cruel inquiry!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: False news said you were dead.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Happy were I if shut in the tomb!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: Did you, O my Carlo, feel the torment?&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: May your heart never know it!&lt;br&gt;
AMALIA: I too, lonely, cried for you many years.&lt;br&gt;
CARLO: Then for me an angel dared weep?
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|translation}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples from [[Musical theatre|musical]]s are "I Remember it Well" (lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], first version in the Broadway musical ''[[Love Life (musical)|Love Life]]'', second in the film ''[[Gigi]]'') and "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]" (by [[Irving Berlin]], from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'').  Another is from "The Last Supper" in ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. When Judas says Jesus knows who will betray him, a passage of stichomythia (with a two-line interruption) follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesus: Why don't you go do it?&lt;br&gt;
Judas: You want me to do it!&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: Hurry, they're waiting&lt;br&gt;
Judas: If you knew why I do it...&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: I don't care why you do it&lt;br&gt;
Judas: To think I admired you,&lt;br&gt;
for now I despise you&lt;br&gt;
Jesus: You liar—you Judas&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Film===
In the prose context of most film, stichomythia has been defined as a "witty exchange of one-liners" and associated with the [[film noir]] characters  Jeff Bailey in ''[[Out of the Past]]'', [[Sam Spade]], and [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;Flory (2008, p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; Another film-noir example is in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (dialog by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Raymond Chandler]]). Walter Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson; she resists him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dietrichson: You were anxious to talk to [my husband] weren't you?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of getting over the idea,
      if you know what I mean.&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff, 45 miles an hour.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: How fast was I going officer?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: I'd say around 90.&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I let you off with a warning this time?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose it doesn't take?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Dietrichson: Suppose you try putting it on my husband's shoulder?&lt;br&gt;
Neff: That tears it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Te-Tzu Chang''' or '''T. T. Chang''' ({{zh|s=张德慈|t=張德慈|p=Zhāng Décí}}; 1927—2006) was a prominent [[Chinese people|Chinese]] agricultural and environmental scientist.

== Biography ==
Chang was born in Shanghai on April 3, 1927 to a "scholar-gentry" family. Chang's father graduated from the [[Saint John's University, Shanghai|Saint John's University]] in Shanghai and won the [[Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program]] and completed his study in the [[United States]]. Chang had three (older) sisters and one (younger) brother.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seed.agron.ntu.edu.tw/cropsci/rice/TT%20Chang.htm |title=張德慈院士生平簡介(Brief Introduction to T.T. Chang's Life) |author=謝兆樞 |publisher=[[National Taiwan University]] |accessdate=May 17, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang finished his secondary education at the Saint John's School (a [[middle school]] afflicted to the Saint John's University) in Shanghai. Chang at beginning studied agricultural science at the Saint John's University in Shanghai, which was his father's [[alma mater]]. After about one year, Chang transferred to the [[University of Nanking]] in [[Nanjing]] and majored in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]]. Chang graduated from University of Nanking with BSA in 1949.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

After graduation, Chang worked for the [[Council of Agriculture (Republic of China)|Council of Agriculture]] in [[Guangzhou]], the capital city of [[Guangdong Province]]. During this period of time [[Shen Tsung-han]] (1895–1980, [[:zh:沈宗瀚|沈宗瀚]], born [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]]; death [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]) was one of his mentors. Shen was the second and former [[Director-general]] of the Council of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

In 1950, Chang moved to [[Taiwan]] and served as a technician in the Ministry of Agriculture. Recommended by Shen, in 1952 Chang went to study plant genetics at [[Cornell University]] which was also the alma mater of Shen (Shen received his [[PhD]] from Cornell). Chang obtained his MSc from Cornell in 1954 and continued his study at the [[University of Minnesota]] where he earned PhD in 1959.&lt;ref name="Chang bio"/&gt;

Chang went back to Taiwan in 1959. However, after two years of staying in Taiwan, Chang moved to [[Philippines]] and worked for the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. From 1962 to 1991, Chang managed the International Rice Germplasm Center.

The ''T. T. Chang Genetic Resources Center'' is named after him.&lt;ref name="Chang pdf bio"/&gt;

The '''Test of Economic Literacy''' or '''TEL''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use in upper-grade levels of high schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Knowledge]] (TEK) and [[Test of Understanding in College Economics]] (TUCE) ) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TEL is in its third edition and is available, along with an examiner’s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] (NCREE) and included norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from over 100 high schools across the United States.  The TEL has two parallel forms, each composed of forty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items with [[content validity]] based on the [[Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1775">'''The Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings''' of the [[United Kingdom]] was founded initially as a pressure group to counter the demolition of [[Historic site|historic buildings]] and it resolved later to acquire historically significant properties in order to maintain and protect them itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphb.org.uk/ Organization homepage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104238/http://www.sphb.org.uk/ |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 merger, the goodwill of the Society was acquired by a registered [[Nonprofit organization|Nonprofit organisation]], Ruins on the Roam Limited, which adopted the Society's name and assets, with the intention to continue its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.initialresearch.com/sphb/id51.html|title=Organization news web page|accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society is noted in an [[Architectural conservation|architectural journal]] of 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, K. H. 1969. The Architectural Student in Architectural Society, ''Journal of Architectural Education'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (May, 1969), pp. 24-29&lt;/ref&gt; The Society was dissolved in 2011 after folding due to the dwindling of financial support during the most recent [[global recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/259e0ea246a0b5747b2c66084ad9fdc7/compdetails|title=Companies House's records|accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11848">'''Wing-shape optimization''' is a software implementation of [[shape optimization]] primarily used for aircraft design.  This allows for engineers to produce more efficient and cheaper aircraft designs.

==History==
Shape optimization, as a software process and tool, first appeared as an [[algorithm]] in 1995 and as commercial software for the [[automotive industry]] by 1998, as noted by F. Muyl.&lt;ref&gt;F. Muyl, L. Dumas, V. Herbert.  [http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~dumas/Lisbon02.pdf “Hybrid Method for Aerodynamic Shape Optimization in Automotive Industry.”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018235247/http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~dumas/Lisbon02.pdf |date=October 18, 2005 }}  Universite Pierre et Marie Curie.  1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the age of the automotive and aeronautical companies, this software is very new.  The difficulty was not with the science behind the process, but rather the capabilities of computer hardware.  In 1998, F. Muyl developed a compromise between exact accuracy and computational time to reduce drag of an automotive.  GA phases are the standard [[genetic algorithm]] iterations and the BFGS phases are the approximated calculations designed to save time.  However, he acknowledged that the [[computational time]] required on existing hardware, nearly two weeks for a moderate improvement on an oversimplified proof of concept model, made it unattractive for commercial purposes.  He also recognized that improving the modeling implementation to use automatic partial derivatives might improve the computational time, particularly with specialized hardware.
In 2000, after a couple years of computer hardware development, K. Maute &lt;ref&gt;Joaquim R. R. A. Martins and Juan J. Alonso. [http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/ceas2001.pdf “AERO-STRUCTURAL WING DESIGN OPTIMIZATION USING HIGH-FIDELITY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS.”] Confederation of European Aerospace Societies. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a more accurate system that could optimize an aircraft wing quickly enough for commercial use. 

==Method==
Wing-shape optimization is by nature an [[iterative]] process.  First, a baseline wing design is chosen to begin the process with; this is usually the wing created by [[aerospace engineer]]s.  This wing is assumed to be reasonably close to a best-fit design from the engineers.  The next step is to model the wing shape and structure.  Once those are mapped out, the software flies the model in a simulated air tunnel using well-developed [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) equations.  The results of the test give the various [[performance characteristics]] of that design.  Once that completes, the software makes incremental changes to the structure and shape details, recreates the model, and flies the new model through a [[wind tunnel]].  If the changes result in a better performing wing, then the software commits the changes.  If not, the changes are thrown out and different changes are made.  The changes are then saved as the new working model and the cycle will loop.  This entire process is run until the changes observed appear to converge on a design&amp;nbsp;– such as when the changes are under 1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"&gt;Jameson, A., Leoviriyakit, K., and Shankaran, S., [http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/jameson.aiaa.07-764.pdf "Multi-point Aero-Structural Optimization of Wings Including Planform Variations"]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, 45th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, AIAA-2007-764, Reno, NV, 8–11 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the resulting wing design can only be as good as the computational model.

==Examples==
===Traditional===
An example of an optimization proof of concept was done in 2003 by Leoviriyakit using the Boeing 747–200.&lt;ref&gt;K. Leoviriyakit and A. Jameson. [http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/leoviriyakit.aiaa.03-0210.pdf “Aerodynamic shape optimization of wings including planform variations.”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030804171702/http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/leoviriyakit.aiaa.03-0210.pdf |date=2003-08-04 }} AIAA paper 2003-0210, 41 Aerospace Sciences Meeting &amp; Exhibit, Reno, Nevada, January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using the variable list above, he optimized for only a single point – a lift coefficient of 0.42 and a speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.87, just above cruising.  With just those few variables, he was able to realize a 12% decrease in [[drag (physics)|drag]] and a 0.1% decrease in wing weight.  The code that was run produced a longer span but less sweep-back than the original wing planform.  While the reduction in sweep-back actually increases drag it also increases lift allowing a lower AoA and the extended wing span  decreases the induced drag (wing tip vortex) resulting in a net reduction of drag.  Unfortunately, his optimized design uses too simple of a model; he realized that had more variables, such as [[viscous]] effects, been taken into consideration, the resulting model would have been far different.  The other major limitation of the [[single point]] approach is that it only optimizes the wing for one speed and lift condition.  While the drag may have been reduced at cruising speed, it might have been drastically increased for take-off and landing, resulting in a net fuel loss for the airline.

===Wing-body===
This process can also be extended to explore single wing-body aircraft designs.  Wing-body styled aircraft can scale up their cargo much easier than the traditional ‘tube and plank’ design.  Airbus utilized this approach to explore design choices in future large aircraft in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mialon, T. Fol, and C. Bonnand. [http://www.onera.fr/daap-en/flying-wings/aerodynamic-optimization-of-subsonic-flying-wing-configurations.pdf “AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION OF SUBSONIC FLYING WING CONFIGURATIONS.”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206105003/http://www.onera.fr/daap-en/flying-wings/aerodynamic-optimization-of-subsonic-flying-wing-configurations.pdf |date=2006-12-06 }} AIAA paper 2002–2931.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their objectives, however, were slightly more complex than the original design of the software: the aircraft needs a maximized [[lift to drag ratio]], to be longitudinally neutral (not wanting to pitch up or down while without a tail), to have a maximum [[angle of attack]], to have a minimum [[cabin (aircraft)|cabin]] volume and shape, and have a maximum thickness on the outboard wings.  Using three different components, they expanded their computational model to incorporate as many constraints as possible, including viscous effects.  This method involves significantly more computational power.
Their initial findings saved a lot of money in building and testing – since it causes supersonic flow of air, a [[shock wave]] forms on the aft part of the wing, drastically increasing drag and reducing lift.  After modifying their goals to only keep the lift to drag ratio high and even out the pressure, the simulation provided a better design – showing that this tool is very adaptable to the situation at hand. 
The end result of this study was that Airbus had a set of airfoil designs that are suited to a very large wing-body aircraft.  This also proved that these methods are successful at adapting to any task that they would require.

===Post-manufacturing changes===
This method of [[process optimization|optimization]] can also be used to develop a post-manufacture modification to an existing wing.  In 2006, Antony Jameson modified the code to increase the speed of a race [[P-51 Mustang]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jameson. [http://www.stanford.edu/~kasidit/publications/jameson.aiaa.06-0048.pdf “Aerodynamic Shape Optimization for the World's Fastest P-51.”]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 44th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 9–12, 2006, AIAA-0048, Reno, Nevada.&lt;/ref&gt;  This goal is different still – the [[Reno Air Race]] is a straight drag from one point to another at a relatively low altitude.  The goal is to improve the top speed to reach a [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]-driven record.  Since the change must be glued onto the wing, this severely limits the changes possible.  The problem is similar to the previous example – shock wave buildup.  To accomplish this, the software was restricted to find a solution that could only distort the wing planform outwards, away from the control surfaces.  Using a [[lift coefficient]] of 0.1 and a speed of Mach 0.78, the software produced a bump near the front of the top of the wing.  The interruptions of air flow at that particular speed travel back the right distance to break up the shock, reducing the drag.  While the aircraft’s drag was increased below Mach 0.73, that was thrown out as being less important than a top speed. If these modifications perform as expected, then this validates the use of the software tool to improve on an existing production wing without remanufacture.

==Multi-point optimization==
Still, all of these methods have a weakness – they are tuned for one particular set of conditions and speed.  In 2007, Jameson introduced both an additional step and a new method of calculations.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt;  To account for additional conditions, such as take-off, landing, climbing, and cruising, the modeler calculates all of these simultaneously, rather than only one at a time.  Each gradient calculation g is assigned a weight β.  Higher priority items, such as cruising drag, are given more weight.  The gradient to determine an overall ‘loss’ or a ‘gain’ for the design is created by summing all the gradients times each respective weight.  What this allows for is if a change drastically improves takeoff performance but results in a slight hit on cruising performance, the cruising hit can override the takeoff gain due to weighting.  Setting the simulation up in this manner can significantly improve the designs produced by the software.  This version of the modeler, however, adds yet another complexity to the initial conditions, and a slight error on the designer’s behalf can have a significantly larger effect on the resulting design.  The calculation efficiency improvement takes advantage of the multiple variables.
This time, two different points were used for the [[Boeing 747-200]] – Mach 0.85 and 0.87.  Unfortunately, optimizing for the two points resulted in less than a 3% improvement over drag and almost no weight improvement on the base design.  To check his work, he used the same simulation on another aircraft wing and received similar results.  The problem observed is that changes that boosted one point of interest directly conflicted with the other, and the resulting compromise severely hampers the improvement gained.  His current research involves a better way to resolve the differences and achieve an improvement similar to the single-point optimizations.

&lt;!--[[WP:CRYSTAL BALL]]
==Future==
The future of this technology lies in the accuracy of the models.  Computer hardware has followed [[Moore’s Law]] in computational power still to this day, and so the current limitation is the attention to detail on behalf of the programmers and engineers.  As more accurate models are produced, better aircraft wings can be produced.
Much farther in the future, when more advanced hardware structures are developed, it will be possible to have dynamically adapting wings based on current flight conditions.  As shown, the software portion of this problem is already solved: single-point calculations can be done on the fly for the particular speed and conditions, giving the possibility of achieving significant drag reduction throughout the entire flight.--&gt;
