It was founded in 2002 by Professor [[Nikolas Rose]], a prominent [[British people|British]] [[sociologist]].

==About BIOS==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:LSEmag2.jpg|thumb|200px|left]] --&gt;

BIOS is a multidisciplinary centre at LSE for research into contemporary developments in the life sciences, biomedicine and biotechnology. It is a joint initiative between the Department of Sociology and the Institute of Social Psychology, with the support of the Departments of Government and Law and the Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Sciences.

BIOS supports post-doctoral researchers, visiting fellows and professors, and post graduate students. It has an infrastructure which encourages and hosts research supported by funding bodies such as the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC), the [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] and other major funding bodies.

BIOS's ethos is one of empirically grounded and conceptually sophisticated research, conducted in close relation with life scientists, clinicians and policy makers. Among the issues addressed are justice, power and inequality, geopolitics, social and individual identity. 

Current major research projects focus on regenerative medicine, social aspects of the neurosciences and psychopharmacology, biosecurity, biopolitics, bioeconomics, translational biology and bioethics. BIOS runs an innovative Masters programme in Biomedicine and Society attracting students from backgrounds in many disciplines in the social and life sciences. 

The BIOS community of over 40 researchers includes a large number of doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, research staff, visiting fellows and professors and associated faculty.

The Director of BIOS is Martin White Professor of Sociology at LSE, Professor [[Nikolas Rose]], who has been recently awarded an ESRC Professorial Research Fellowship for a three-year project entitled 'Brain, Self and Society in the 21st Century'.

== In rotordynamics ==
[[File:Campbelldiagram.png|thumb|300px|Analytical Campbell Diagram for a Simple Rotor]]
In [[Rotordynamics|rotordynamical]] systems, the eigenfrequencies often depend on the rotation rates due to the induced [[gyroscopic]] effects or variable hydrodynamic conditions in [[fluid bearing]]s. It might represent the following cases:

1. ''Analytically'' computed values of [[eigenfrequency|eigenfrequencies]] as a function of the shaft's rotation speed. This case is also called "whirl speed map".&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;

| date = 2003-05-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such chart can be used in turbine design as shown in the numerically calculated Campbell diagram example illustrated by the image: analysis shows that there are well-damped critical speed at lower speed range. Another critical speed at mode 4 is observed at 7810 rpm (130&amp;nbsp;Hz) in dangerous vicinity of nominal shaft speed, but it has 30% damping - enough to safely ignore it.

[[File:Campbell Diagram.png|thumb|300px|Campbell Diagram of a steam turbine]]

2. ''Experimentally'' measured vibration response spectrum as a function of the shaft's rotation speed ([[waterfall plot]]), the peak locations for each slice usually corresponding to the [[eigenfrequency|eigenfrequencies]].

== In acoustical engineering ==

In [[acoustical engineering]], the Campbell diagram would represent the pressure spectrum [[waterfall plot]] vs the machine's shaft rotation speed (sometimes also called ''3D noise map'').

'''Classical music''' is [[art music]] produced or rooted in the traditions of [[Western culture]], including both [[Religious music|liturgical]] (religious) and [[secular music|secular]] music. While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the [[common practice period|common-practice period]]. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:
* the [[ancient music]] period, before 500 AD
* the [[early music]] period, which includes
** the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) including
*** the [[ars antiqua]] (1170–1310)
*** the [[ars nova]] (1310–1377)
*** the [[ars subtilior]] (1360–1420)
** the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (1400–1600) eras.

** [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras (c.1780–1910)
* the [[20th-century classical music|20th]] and [[21st-century classical music|21st centuries]] (1901–present) which includes:
** the [[modernism (music)|modern]] (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late-19th century,
** [[Impressionism in music|impressionism]] (1875 or 1890–1925) that also overlaps from the late-19th century
** [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]] (1920–1950), predominantly in the inter-war period

European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European classical and some [[popular music]]al forms by its system of [[musical notation|staff notation]], in use since about the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §III, 1(vi): Plainchant: Pitch-specific notations, 13th–16th centuries|author1=Geoffrey Chew|author2=Richard Rastall|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Says absolutely nothing at all about European art music, let alone what may or may not distinguish it from other types of music. Moreover, III, 1(vi) is specifically addressed to developments in the 13th-to-16th centuries, saying nothing about the origins of staff notation.--&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] (which form the [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[Chord (music)|chords]]), [[tempo]], [[Metre (music)|metre]] and [[rhythm]]s for a piece of music.{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Staff notation merely indicates pitches and durations. It does not by itself indicate whether these result in melody, bassline, chords}} This can leave less room for practices such as [[musical improvisation|improvisation]] and ''[[ad libitum]]'' [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]], which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Japan, §III, 1: Notation systems: Introduction|author=Malm, W.P.|author2=Hughes, David W.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=The article states that improvisation "hardly exists in Japanese music."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §I: General|author=Ian D. Bent|author2=David W. Hughes|author3=Robert C. Provine|author4=Richard Rastall|author5=Anne Kilmer|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017|reason=The article says that notation "may provide a framework for improvisation", not that it leaves less room for it}}&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Popular music, §I, 4: Europe &amp; North America: Genre, form, style|author=[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]]|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; styles such as [[jazz]] and [[blues]]. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song ([[strophic]]) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[fugue]], [[sonata]], and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as [[opera]], [[cantata]], and [[Mass (music)|mass]].&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"&gt;Julian Johnson (2002) ''Who Needs Classical Music?: Cultural Choice and Musical Value'': p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1829.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED_Online_Classical"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=The OED Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50040930?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=classical&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|accessdate=May 10, 2007|title=classical, a.|year=2007|quote=1829   V.

Novello Mozart Pilgrimage (1955) 181   This is the place I should come to every Sunday when I wished to hear classical music correctly and judiciously performed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
Given the wide range of styles in European classical music, from Medieval [[plainchant]] sung by monks to Classical and Romantic symphonies for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avant-garde [[atonal]] compositions for solo piano from the 1900s, it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type. However, there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; such as the use of [[music notation]]{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=If "classical music" began in 500, then at least five centuries of it were without notation.}} and the performance of complex forms of solo instrumental works (e.g., the [[fugue]]). Furthermore, while the symphony did not exist prior to the late 18th century, the [[Orchestra|symphony ensemble]]—and the [[Symphony|works written for it]]—have become a defining feature of classical music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Literature===
The key characteristic of European classical music that distinguishes it from [[popular music]] and [[folk music]] is that the repertoire tends to be written down in [[musical notation]], creating a musical part or [[Sheet music|score]]. This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: [[fugue]]s, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in [[counterpoint]] yet creating a coherent [[Diatonic function|harmonic logic]] that would be difficult to achieve in the heat of live improvisation.&lt;ref name="Knud Jeppesen 2007"&gt;[[Knud Jeppesen]]: "Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking." Quoted from Adele Katz (1946; reprinted 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Jeppesen says this as a comparison between Palestrina's contrapuntal writing and Bach's harmonic conception, but this has nothing to do with improvisation, nor with notation.}} The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music (the melodies, lyrics, forms, and rhythms) being reproduced.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

That said, the score does allow the interpreter to make choices on how to perform a historical work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), it is not known exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for [[basso continuo]] accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=Does this uncertainty determine whether the music is "classical" or not?}} (only a [[figured bass]] symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).

Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for [[musical improvisation]], from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque era, organ performers would improvise [[prelude (music)|preludes]], keyboard performers playing [[harpsichord]] would improvise [[chord (music)|chords]] from the [[figured bass]] symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise [[musical ornament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Solis, Bruno Nettl. ''Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society.'' University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Sebastian Bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/MusicPapers/baroque.html |title=On Baroque Improvisation |publisher=Community.middlebury.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, the composer-performer Mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.&lt;ref&gt;David Grayson. Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos. 20 and 21. Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, some virtuoso soloists would improvise the [[cadenza]] sections of a concerto. During the Romantic era, Beethoven would improvise at the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Skowroneck. ''Beethoven the Pianist''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[#Improvisation|Improvisation]].

===Instrumentation and vocal practices===
{{See also|Woodwind section|Brass section|String section|Percussion section|Keyboard section}}
The instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century (often much earlier) and systematised in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an [[orchestra]] or in a [[concert band]], together with several other solo instruments (such as the [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and [[organ (music)|organ]]). The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music&lt;ref name="Kirgiss" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--There is no mention of orchestras at all on this page.--&gt; and includes members of the [[string instrument|string]], [[woodwind]], [[brass instrument|brass]], and [[percussion]] families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a [[double bass]]. The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic [[Gregorian chant]] done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, [[polyphonic]] choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.

====Medieval music====
Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms. Medieval instruments included the [[flute]], the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]]. As well, early versions of the [[Organ (music)|organ]] and [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]) existed. Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a [[drone (music)|drone]] note, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into ''haut'' (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and ''bas'' (quieter, more intimate instruments).{{sfn|Bowles|1954|loc=119 et passim}} During the [[Early Middle Ages|earlier medieval period]], the vocal music from the [[liturgy|liturgical]] genre, predominantly [[Gregorian chant]], was [[Monophony|monophonic]], using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line.&lt;ref name="Hoppin57"&gt;Hoppin (1978) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval era]], becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century.

====Renaissance music====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of [[Guild]]s and they included the [[slide trumpet]], the wooden [[cornet]], the valveless [[trumpet]] and the [[sackbut]]. Stringed instruments included the [[viol]], the [[rebec]], the harp-like [[lyre]], the [[hurdy-gurdy]], the [[lute]], the [[guitar]], the [[cittern]], the [[Bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and the [[orpharion]]. Keyboard instruments with strings included the [[harpsichord]] and the [[virginal]]s.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Isn't the virginals a type of harpichord? If not, then the dedicated article linked here needs to be corrected.--&gt; Percussion instruments include the [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], the [[Jew's harp]], the [[tambourine]], the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double reed [[shawm]], the [[reed pipe]], the [[bagpipe]], the [[transverse flute]], the [[Recorder (instrument)|recorder]], the [[dulcian]], and the [[crumhorn]]. Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the [[madrigal comedy]], and the [[intermedio]] are seen. Around 1597, Italian composer [[Jacopo Peri]] wrote ''[[Dafne]]'', the first work to be called an [[opera]] today. He also composed [[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]], the first opera to have survived to the present day.

====Baroque music====
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
Baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) and a number of new instruments (e.g, the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the [[Baroque violin|violin]], [[viol]], [[viola]], [[viola d'amore]], [[cello]], [[contrabass]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]] (which often played the [[basso continuo]] parts), [[mandolin]], [[cittern]], [[Baroque guitar]], [[harp]] and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the [[Baroque flute]], [[Baroque oboe]], [[rackett]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the [[bassoon]]. Brass instruments included the [[cornett]], [[natural horn]], [[Baroque trumpet]], [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[trombone]]. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]]&lt;!--the [[tangent piano]] --&gt;, the [[harpsichord]], the [[Organ (music)|pipe organ]], and, later in the period, the [[fortepiano]] (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[tambourine]] and the [[castanets]].

One major difference between Baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. Whereas a classical era [[string quartet]] consists almost exclusively of two violins, a viola and a cello, a Baroque or Classical-era group accompanying a soloist or opera{{non sequitur |date=June 2018 |reason=comparing a Classical-era string quartet with an orchestra from the same period makes nonsense of the comparison of Baroque and Classical usage of instruments}} could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ, harpsichord, or clavichord),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Who claims that clavichords could be used to accompany soloists or operas?--&gt; additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute) and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo, including bowed strings, woodwinds and brass instruments (e.g., a cello, contrabass, viol, bassoon, serpent, etc.).

Vocal developments in the Baroque era included the development of [[opera]] types such as [[opera seria]] and [[opéra comique]], and related forms such as [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s.&lt;ref name="BritannicaCantata"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cantata|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/cantata-music|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaOratorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oratorio|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/oratorio|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical music====
{{or-section|date=April 2017}}
The term "classical music" has two meanings: the broader meaning includes all Western art music from the Medieval era to the 2000s, and the specific meaning refers to the [[art music]] from the 1750s to the early 1820s—the period of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. This section is about the more specific meaning. Classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the Baroque era, such as the cello, contrabass, recorder, trombone, timpani, fortepiano (the precursor to the modern [[piano]]) and organ. While some Baroque instruments fell into disuse (e.g., the theorbo and rackett), many Baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today, such as the Baroque violin (which became the [[violin]]), the Baroque oboe (which became the [[oboe]]) and the Baroque trumpet, which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet. During the Classical era, the stringed instruments used in orchestra and [[chamber music]] such as [[string quartet]]s were standardized as the four instruments which form the [[string section]] of the [[orchestra]]: the violin, viola, cello and double bass. Baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted, bowed [[viol]]s were phased out. Woodwinds included the [[basset clarinet]], [[basset horn]], [[clarinette d'amour]], the Classical [[clarinet]], the [[chalumeau]], the flute, oboe and bassoon. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]] and the [[fortepiano]]. While the [[harpsichord]] was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use in the end of the century. Brass instruments included the [[buccin]], the [[ophicleide]] (a replacement for the bass [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], which was the precursor of the [[tuba]]) and the [[natural horn]].

====Romantic music====
In the Romantic era, the modern [[piano]], with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano. In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained ([[string section]], woodwinds, brass and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound. For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. "As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers." &lt;ref name="classicfm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/romantic/romantic-music-beginners-guide/#FaXJhIVlfVSph9bq.97 |title=Romantic music: a beginner's guide – Music Periods |publisher=Classic FM |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; New woodwind instruments were added, such as the [[contrabassoon]], [[bass clarinet]] and [[piccolo]] and new percussion instruments were added, including [[xylophone]]s, [[snare drum]]s, [[celesta]]s (a bell-like keyboard instrument), [[bell]]s, and [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]],&lt;ref name="classicfm.com"/&gt; large [[orchestral harp]]s, and even [[wind machine]]s for [[sound effect]]s. [[Saxophone]]s appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]] and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''.

The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Why single out these composers in particular? Cornets appear regularly in 19th-century scores, alongside trumpets which were regarded as less agile, at least until the end of the century.--&gt; Unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium for a certain passage), orchestras will use [[freelance]] musicians to augment their regular rosters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Modernist music====

[[Modernism (music)|Modernism in music]] is a philosophical and aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred from 1890 to 1930, a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of [[modernism]] in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is "innovation".{{sfn|Metzer|2009|loc=3}} Its leading feature is a "linguistic plurality", which is to say that no single [[music genre]] ever assumed a dominant position.{{sfn|Morgan|1984|loc=443}}

==== Contemporary classical music ====
[[Contemporary classical music]] is the period that came into prominence in the mid-1970s.  It includes different variations of [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Postmodern music ====
&lt;!--Everything in this sections is at odds with the linked article on Postmodern music.--&gt;
[[Postmodern music]] is a period of music that began around 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvnb|Karolyi|1994|loc=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]] – that is, art that comes after and reacts against [[modernism]].

==== Post-postmodern instrumentation ====
Many instruments that in the 2010s are associated with popular music filled important roles in early music, such as [[bagpipes]], [[theorbo]]s, [[vihuela]]s, [[hurdy-gurdy|hurdy-gurdies]] (hand-cranked string instruments), [[accordion]]s, [[alphorn]]s, [[Water organ#Hydraulis|hydraulises]], [[Calliope (music)|calliopes]], [[sistrum]]s, and some woodwind instruments such as [[tin whistle]]s, [[panpipes]], [[shawms]] and [[crumhorn]]s. On the other hand, instruments such as the [[acoustic guitar]], once associated mainly with popular music, gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries in the form of the [[classical guitar]] and [[banjo]]. While [[equal temperament]] gradually became accepted as the dominant [[musical temperament]] during the 19th century, different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods. For instance, music of the [[English Renaissance]] is often performed in [[meantone temperament]]. As well, while professional [[orchestra]]s and pop bands all around the world have tuned to an A fixed at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz since the late 19th century, there was historically a great variety in the tuning pitch, as attested to in historical pipe organs that still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of "A:" More about Baroque pitch|url=http://pbosf.blogspot.ca/2010/01/story-of-more-about-baroque-pitch.html|website=Philadelphia Baroque Orchestra|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=November 2017}}

===Performance===
[[File:Concertband.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Youth [[concert band]] in performance]]

Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be "classically trained". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] or [[Master of Music]] degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, "...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level" is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inputyouth.co.uk/jobguides/job-classicalmusician.html |title=Job Guide – Classical Musician |publisher=Inputyouth.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in [[sight-reading]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] playing, [[Harmony|harmonic]] principles, strong [[ear training]] (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of [[performance practice]] (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some "popular" genre musicians have had significant classical training, such as [[Billy Joel]], [[Elton John]], the [[Van Halen]] brothers, [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], and [[Dream Theater]] members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moreover, formal training is not unique to the classical genre. Many rock and pop musicians have completed degrees in [[Pop music|commercial music]] programs such as those offered by the [[Berklee College of Music]] and many [[jazz]] musicians have completed degrees in music from universities with jazz programs, such as the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[McGill University]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Gender of performers====
{{Main article|Women in music}}
Historically, major professional [[orchestra]]s have been mostly or entirely composed of musicians who are men. Some of the earliest cases of [[women in music|women being hired in professional orchestras]] was in the position of [[harp]]ist. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As late as February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] would be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=1996-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[International Alliance for Women in Music]]. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria&amp;navi= Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[France 24]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists", the [[double bass]], brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|'blind' auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture – Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===
Works of classical repertoire often exhibit complexity in their use of [[orchestration]], [[counterpoint]], [[harmony]], [[musical development]], [[rhythm]], [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[Texture (music)|texture]], and [[musical form|form]]. Whereas most popular styles are usually written in [[Ternary form|song form]], classical music is noted for its development of highly sophisticated instrumental musical forms,&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"/&gt; like the [[concerto]], [[symphony]] and [[sonata]]. Classical music is also noted for its use of sophisticated vocal/instrumental forms, such as [[opera]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--Who claims opera is a "sophisticated" form?--&gt; In opera, vocal soloists and choirs perform staged dramatic works with an orchestra providing accompaniment. Longer instrumental works are often divided into self-contained pieces, called [[movement (music)|movements]], often with contrasting characters or moods. For instance, symphonies written during the Classical period are usually divided into four movements: (1) an opening Allegro in [[sonata form]], (2) a slow movement, (3) a minuet or scherzo (in a [[triple metre]], such as 3/4), and (4) a final Allegro. These movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units: first [[Section (music)|sections]], then [[Period (music)|periods]], and finally [[Phrase (music)|phrases]].

{{History of Western art music}}
{{Main article|History of music}}
The major time divisions of classical music up to 1900 are the [[Early music]] period, which includes [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (1400–1600) eras, and the [[Common practice period]], which includes the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (1600–1750), [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] (1750–1820) and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] (1810–1910) eras.} The current period encompasses the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] (1901–2000) and includes most of the Early [[modernism (music)|modern]] musical era (1890–1930), the entire [[high modernism|High modern]] (mid 20th-century), and the first part of the [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary]] (1945 or 1975–current) or [[postmodern music|Postmodern]] musical era (1930–current). The [[21st-century classical music|21st century]] has so far been a continuation of the same period and the same Contemporary/Postmodern musical era which both began mostly in the 20th-century.

The dates are [[Dates of classical music eras|generalizations]], since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary, to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice "era" comprising baroque, classical, and romantic "periods".&lt;ref name="Mode and tempo"&gt;{{cite web |author= Vladimir J. Konecni|title= Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era |year=2009 |url= https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36604/1/EMR000064b_Konecni.pdf|accessdate= 17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the use of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]], which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era (or period), was continued by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], who is classified as typical of the Classical era. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who is often described as a founder of the Romantic era, and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], who is classified as Romantic, also used counterpoint and fugue, but the romantic and sometimes yearning qualities of their music define their era.

The prefix ''neo-'' is used to describe a 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century composition written in the style of an earlier era, such as Classical or Romantic. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'', for example, is a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] composition because it is stylistically similar to works of the Baroque era.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--So a "Neo-medieval" work might be so-called because it resembles Renaissance music??--&gt;

===Roots===
{{Main article|Ancient music}}

Burgh (2006), suggests that the roots of Western classical music ultimately lie in ancient Egyptian art music via [[cheironomy]] and the ancient Egyptian orchestra, which dates to 2695 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Listening to Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Israel/Palestine|first=Theodore W.|last=Burgh|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark Ltd.|year=2006|isbn=978-0567025524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as [[Aristoxenus]] and [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p28"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify [[musical notation]]. Ancient Greek instruments such as the [[aulos]] (a [[reed instrument]]) and the [[lyre]] (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grout88|Grout (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The antecedent to the early period was the era of [[ancient music]] before the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] (476 AD).

[[File:Vielle.jpg|thumb|Musician playing the [[vielle]] (fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]])]]

The Medieval period includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400. [[Monophony|Monophonic]] chant, also called plainsong or [[Gregorian chant]], was the dominant form until about 1100.&lt;ref name="Grout73p75"/&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church.{{sfn|Hall, Neitz, and Battani|2003|p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=3fExcE3ouRYC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;vq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;dq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;pg=PA173#v=snippet&amp;q=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;f=false |title = Making Music and Having a Blast!: A Guide for All Music Students|first1= Bonnie |last1= Blanchard |first2= Cynthia |last2=Blanchard Acree |publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2009|isbn = 9780-253003355 |page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fnu0BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=catholic+monks+classical+music#v=onepage&amp;q=catholic+monks+classical+music&amp;f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Classical Music|first=Rough|last=Guides|date=May 3, 2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|accessdate=June 21, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1848366770}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], including the more complex voicings of [[motet]]s. The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of the first [[Bass (sound)|bass instruments]]. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a [[staff (music)|staff]] and other elements of [[musical notation]] began to take shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p61"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This invention made possible the separation of the [[Musical composition|composition]] of a piece of music from its ''transmission''; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted.

[[File:white mensural notation.gif|thumb|left|[[Johannes Ockeghem]], Kyrie "Au travail suis" excerpt]]

Typical stringed instruments of the early period include the harp, [[lute]], [[vielle]], and [[psaltery]], while wind instruments included the [[flute]] family (including [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]), [[shawm]] (an early member of the [[oboe]] family), trumpet, and the [[bagpipes]]. Simple [[pipe organ]]s existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties.&lt;ref name="Grout73p72"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the period, early versions of [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] instruments like the [[clavichord]] and [[harpsichord]] began to appear. Stringed instruments such as the [[viol]] had emerged by the 16th century, as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments. Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use.&lt;ref name="Grout73p222"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Medieval composers include [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Francesco Landini]], and [[Johannes Ciconia]].

The [[common practice period]] is usually defined as the era between the formation and the dissolution of the hegemony{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} of common-practice [[tonality]].&lt;!-- sentence copied in part from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_practice_period&amp;oldid=799911529--&gt;  The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.

{{See also|List of Baroque composers}}

[[File:Baschenis - Musical Instruments.jpg|thumb|Baroque instruments including [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[harpsichord]], [[bass viol]], [[lute]], [[baroque violin|violin]], and [[baroque guitar]]]]

Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal [[counterpoint]] and the use of a [[basso continuo]], a continuous bass line. Music became more complex in comparison with the simple songs of all previous periods.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirgiss|first=Crystal|title=Classical Music|year=2004|page=6|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1583406748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of the [[sonata form]] took shape in the [[canzona]], as did a more formalized notion of [[theme and variations]]. The tonalities of [[major and minor]] as means for managing dissonance and [[chromaticism]] in music took full shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p300"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 300–32&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Baroque era, keyboard music played on the [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] became increasingly popular, and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today. Opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] became more common.&lt;ref name="Grout73p341"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 341–55&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalists for the first time began adding extra notes to the music.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss/&gt; Instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by size{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=as far as I know, instrumental ensembles were far from being standardized in size by Bach's time}}, giving rise to the early orchestra for larger ensembles, with [[chamber music]] being written for smaller groups of instruments where parts are played by individual (instead of massed) instruments. The [[concerto]] as a vehicle for solo performance{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=and what of the concerto grosso?}} accompanied by an orchestra became widespread.

The theories surrounding [[equal temperament]] began to be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the [[meantone|meantone system]], common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible Bach's ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.&lt;ref name="Grout73p378"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

Important composers of this era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], and [[Heinrich Schütz]].

====Classical-era (or -period) music====
{{Main article|Classical period (music)}}
{{See also|List of Classical-era composers}}

[[File:Haydnportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) c.&amp;nbsp;1770]]

The Classical era, from about 1750 to 1820, established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The ''basic'' forces required for an [[orchestra]] became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for [[serenade#Classical and Romantic eras|serenades]]. [[Opera]] continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The ''[[opera buffa]]'', a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The [[symphony]] came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a [[harpsichord]] (which had been part of the traditional ''continuo'' in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the [[concertmaster]]).&lt;ref name="Grout73p463"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical era. While [[double reed|double-reed]] instruments like the [[oboe]] and [[bassoon]] became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the [[clarinet]] family of [[single reed]]s was not widely used until [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward Kingdon|first1=Martha|title=Mozart and the clarinet|issue=2|pages=126–153|url=https://academic.oup.com/ml/article-abstract/XXVIII/2/126/1375956?redirectedFrom=PDF|journal=Music and Letters|volume=XXVIII|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|doi=10.1093/ml/XXVIII.2.126|date=1 April 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major composers of this period include [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]].

====Romantic-era music====
{{Main article|Romantic music}}
{{See also|List of Romantic-era composers}}

The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling [[romanticism]] in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like [[nocturne]]s, [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]], and [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized.&lt;ref name="Swafford200"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art song]] (or ''Lied'') came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of [[grand opera]], ultimately transcended by [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring cycle]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p595"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 595–612&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in [[metallurgy]]) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders. Many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Niccolò Paganini]], fulfilled both roles.&lt;ref name="Grout73p543"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of [[rotary valve]]s made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; [[Gustav Mahler]]'s 1906 [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]], for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitcher|first=John|date=January 2013|title=Nashville Symphony|url=|journal=American Record Guide|volume=76, no. 1|pages=8–10|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise, especially toward the end of the era, of [[nationalism in music]] (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]] echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions.&lt;ref name="Grout73p634"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 634, 641–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent composers of this era include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Johann Strauss II]].

Prominent composers of the early 20th century include [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Edvard Grieg]], and [[Béla Bartók]]. Although composers of this time can be considered Romantic, usually their works are not in the style of the period.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}

{{Main article| Modernism (music)|Postmodern music|Contemporary classical music}}
{{See also| High modernism|List of 20th-century classical composers|List of 21st-century classical composers}}

Encompassing a wide variety of [[Post-romanticism|post-Romantic]] styles composed through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. [[Modernism (music)|Modernism]] (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and [[serial music]]. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of [[postmodern music]] from about 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Karolyi says nothing at all about high modernism, let along equate it with the postmodern era, the beginning of which he plants firmly in 1930.--&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Meyer does not equate high modernism with post-modernism.--&gt; Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the "contemporary music" composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 1995, 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in classical music===
{{see also|Women in classical music}}
Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the [[Western canon|standard concert repertoire]] are male composers, even though there has been a [[List of female composers|large number of women composers]] throughout the classical music period. Musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is [[Women in music|music composed by women]] so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Marcia J. "Gender and the Musical Canon." CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; In the "...''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann|Clara S[c]humann]] is one of the only{{sic}} female composers mentioned."&lt;ref name=rvanews&gt;{{cite web|author=Abbey Philips|url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992|title=The history of women and gender roles in music|publisher=Rvanews.com|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbey Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name=rvanews /&gt;

==Significance of written notation==

===Literalist view of the significance of the score===
While there are differences between particular performances of a classical work, a piece of classical music is generally held to transcend any interpretation of it. The use of musical notation is an effective method for transmitting classical music, since the written music contains the technical instructions for performing the work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The written [[sheet music|score]], however, does not usually contain explicit instructions as to how to interpret the piece in terms of production or performance, apart from directions for [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[tempo]] and expression (to a certain extent). This is left to the discretion of the performers, who are guided by their personal experience and musical education, their knowledge of the work's idiom, their personal artistic tastes, and the accumulated body of historic performance practices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Criticism of the literalist view===
All critics express the opinion that it is only from the mid-19th century, and especially in the 20th century, that the score began to hold such a high significance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Previously, improvisation (in preludes, cadenzas and ornaments), rhythmic flexibility (e.g., [[tempo rubato]]), improvisatory deviation from the score and [[oral tradition]] of playing was integral to the style.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Which "style"? The "Neoromanticism" of Berlioz? The Romanticism of Schubert? Notre Dame organum?--&gt; Classical musicians tend to use scores and the parts extracted from them to play music. Yet, even with notation providing the key elements of the music, there is considerable latitude in the performance of the works. Some of this latitude results from the inherent limitations of musical notation, though attempts to supplement traditional notation with signs and annotations indicating more subtle nuances tend to overwhelm and paralyse the performer.

Some quotes that highlight a criticism of overvaluing of the score:
* "... one of the most stubborn modern misconceptions concerning baroque music is that a metronomic regularity was intended" (Baroque Interpretation in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|''Grove'' 5th edition]] by [[Robert Donington]])
* "Too many teachers, conditioned to 20th century ideas, teach Bach and other Baroque music exactly the wrong way. This leads to what musicologist [[Sol Babitz]] calls 'sewing machine Bach'."{{clarify|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--What has this quote to do with over-valuing scores?--&gt;&lt;ref name=conservatories_kill_expression /&gt;
* "... tendency to look alike, sound alike and think alike. The conservatories are at fault and they have been at fault for many years now. Any sensitive musician going around the World has noted the same thing. The conservatories, from Moscow and Leningrad to Juilliard, Curtis and Indiana, are producing a standardized product.&lt;br /&gt;[...] clarity, undeviating rhythm, easy technique, 'musicianship'. I put the word musicianship in quotes, because as often as not, it is a false kind of musicianship—a musicianship that sees the tree and not the forest, that takes care of the detail but ignores the big picture; a musicianship that is tied to the printed note rather than to emotional meaning of a piece.&lt;br /&gt;The fact remains that there is a dreadful uniformity today and also an appalling lack of knowledge about the culture and performance traditions of the past."

===Improvisation===
{{Essay|section|date=July 2016}}
[[musical improvisation|Improvisation]] once played an important role in classical music. A remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the [[cadenza]], a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works, designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument. Traditionally this was improvised by the performer; however, it is often written for (or occasionally by) the performer beforehand. Improvisation is also an important aspect in authentic performances of operas of Baroque era and of bel canto (especially operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]), and is best exemplified by the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section ('B section' / the 'da capo' part). An example is [[Beverly Sills]]' complex, albeit pre-written, variation of "Da tempeste il legno infranto" from Händel's ''[[Giulio Cesare]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Its{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--This seems to be referring to improvisation, but that seems contradictory.--&gt; written transmission, along with the veneration bestowed on certain classical works, has led to the expectation that performers will play a work in a way that realizes in detail the original intentions of the composer. During the 19th century the details that composers put in their scores generally increased. Yet the opposite trend—admiration of performers for new "interpretations" of the composer's work—can be seen, and it is not unknown for a composer to praise a performer for achieving a better realization of the original intent than the composer was able to imagine. Thus, classical performers often achieve high reputations for their musicianship, even if they do not compose themselves. Generally however, it is the composers who are remembered more than the performers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The primacy of the composer's written score has also led, today, to a relatively minor role played by improvisation in classical music, in sharp contrast to the practice of musicians who lived during the medieval, renaissance, baroque and early romantic eras. Improvisation in classical music performance was common during both the Baroque and early romantic eras, yet lessened strongly during the second half of the 20th century. During the classical era, Mozart and Beethoven often improvised the cadenzas to their [[piano concerto]]s (and thereby encouraged others to do so), but for violin concertos they provided written cadenzas for use by other soloists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--The quotation from Maria Callas does not support this claim.--&gt; In opera, the practice of singing strictly by the score, i.e. ''come scritto'', was famously propagated by soprano [[Maria Callas]], who called this practice 'straitjacketing' and implied that it allows the intention of the composer to be understood better, especially during studying the music for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;"In other words, exactly as it's written, nothing more and nothing less, which is what I call straitjacketing." quoted in [[Arianna Huffington|Huffington, Arianna]] (2002). ''Maria Callas: The Woman behind the Legend'', p. 76. Cooper Square. {{ISBN|978-1461624295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other music traditions==

===Popular music===
Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composer's time. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'', genres exemplified by [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', and the influence of jazz on early and mid-20th-century composers including [[Maurice Ravel]], exemplified by the movement entitled "Blues" in his sonata for violin and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Ravel, Maurice, §3: 1918–37|author=Kelly, Barbara L.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] and [[Postminimalism|postminimalist]] classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{GroveOnline|title=Nyman, Michael|author=Siôn, Pwyll Ap|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--A single instance cannot verify a broader claim.--&gt;

Numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which ''[[Pachelbel's Canon#Pachelbel's canon in popular culture|Pachelbel's Canon]]'' has been put since the 1970s, and the musical [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena.&lt;ref&gt;Notable examples are the ''[[Hooked on Classics]]'' series of recordings made by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] in the early 1980s and the classical crossover violinists [[Vanessa Mae]] and [[Catya Maré]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], a number of [[lead guitarist]]s (playing [[electric guitar]]), including [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[Randy Rhoads]], modeled their playing styles on Baroque or Classical-era instrumental music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Folk music===
Composers of classical music have often made use of [[folk music]] (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] and [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]],&lt;ref name="Yeomans2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeomans|first=David|title=Piano Music of the Czech Romantics: A Performer's Guide|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0253218452|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins.&lt;ref name="Stevens129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Haley|author2=Gillies, Malcolm|title=The Life and Music of Béla Bartók|year=1993|isbn=978-0198163497|page=129|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization==
Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become [[cliché]]d, particularly the opening of [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and the opening section "[[O Fortuna]]" of [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''; other examples include the "[[Dies irae]]" from the [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]], [[Edvard Grieg]]'s "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" from ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]]'', the opening bars of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]" from ''[[Die Walküre]]'', [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]", and excerpts of [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Several works from the [[Golden age of American animation|Golden Age of Animation]] matched the action to classical music. Notable examples are [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', [[Tom and Jerry]]'s ''[[Johann Mouse]]'', and [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Rabbit of Seville]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''

Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clichéd excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]´s [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite No. 1]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s "[[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' Overture]]". The same passages are often used by telephone call centres to induce a sense of calm in customers waiting in a queue.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century may have harmed the music industry through inadequate representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vancour|first=Shawn|title=Popularizing the Classics: Radio's Role in the Music Appreciation Movement 1922–34.|journal=Media, Culture and Society|date=March 2009|volume=31|issue=2|page=19|doi=10.1177/0163443708100319|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=15&amp;sid=44993088-138c-40ef-9fd0-95f42cce6fce%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=37178702|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the range of production of classical music is from the 14th century to 21st century, most of this music (14th to early 20th century) belongs to the [[public domain]], mainly [[sheet music]] and [[tablature]]s. Some projects like [[Musopen]] and [[Open Goldberg Variations]] were created to produce musical audio files of high quality and release them into the public domain, most of them are available at the [[Internet Archive]] website.

The Open Goldberg Variations project released a [[braille]] format into the public domain that can be used to produce paper or electronic scores, [[Braille e-book]]s, for blind people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/braille-edition-open-goldberg-variations Braille edition of the Open Goldberg Variations] ny robertDouglass, Open Goldberg Variations, 23 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the "[[Mozart effect]]": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart's works. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' [[IQ]] by 8 to 9 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6747/abs/400827a0.html Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'?] ''Nature'' '''400''' (August 26, 1999): 827.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]: "researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Ross, Alex]]. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDF1239F93BA1575BC0A962958260 "Classical View; Listening To Prozac... Er, Mozart"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 28, 1994. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on [[music education]] programs."&lt;ref&gt;Goode, Erica. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D81131F930A3575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3 "Mozart for Baby?

In 1996/97, a research study was conducted on a population of preschool through college students in the [[Cherry Creek School District]] in Denver, Colorado, US. The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to [[rock-and-roll]] or [[Country music]] had moderately lower scores. The study further indicated that students who used classical music during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through the [[University of Colorado]]. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; etc.) and others{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}} who had significant results through the [[discourse]] of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |title=The Impact of Music Education on Academic Achievement |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916075557/http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9949">The '''Columbia School of Linguistics''' is a group of linguists with a radically functional and empirical conception of language.  According to their school of thought, the main function of language is communication.  Columbia School linguistic analyses typically are based on observable data, such as corpora (texts or recorded speech), not on introspective ad hoc sentence examples.  Rather than a single theory of language, the Columbia School is set of orientations in which scholars analyze actual speech acts in an attempt to explain why they take the forms they do.  This was the methodology of its founder, the late [[William Diver]], who taught linguistics at Columbia University until his retirement in 1989.

== Orientations ==

On the one hand, this methodology is more modest in its goals than most other schools.  On the other hand, the results produced are more reliable, because they are based on objective data, rather than on [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] or philosophical entities{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective?|date=May 2018}}.  The assumption is that modest goals are more appropriate for a linguistic science still in its infancy, a science that hasn’t yet freed itself entirely from traditional philological parts of speech, self-standing sentence examples, and logico-philosophical entities such as subject and predicate{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective?|date=May 2018}}. Conclusions about how the mind functions, based on the structure of language, should wait until a new, more reliable linguistics emerges, as did astronomy from its origins in astrology{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective? The author has not even cited someone who claimed this as a fundamental principle of the Columbia school.|date=May 2018}}.

A useful illustration of the differences between the Columbia School of Linguistics (CSL) and other linguistic approaches is the way each regards the field of mathematics.  Rather than considering human language to be itself a kind of logic or mathematics, CSL uses mathematics as a tool to analyze and draw conclusions about languages.  Instead of trying to produce rules to generate all possible “grammatical” sentences, CSL scholars count and compare numbers of occurrences of various phenomena and then apply statistical criteria to draw conclusions about the reasons for this usage.  These conclusions, although not earth-shattering,  are based on the CSL orientations of communication, physiology or psychology. CSL researchers typically search the gray areas for an explanation of why one form appears more often than another, and are not satisfied with a black-and-white mapping of the frontiers of grammaticality.  Whereas most linguists talk of '''constraints''' and combinations of entities that are not permitted, CSL linguists discuss the '''choices''' that speakers of language have and how they make use of those choices.

CSL’s basic unit of language is the morpheme, the smallest meaningful unit of language.  This is the [[linguistic sign]], the unit shared by all other subdisciplines of [[semiotics]].  By taking the sign as the basic unit—as opposed to the sentence—CSL linguists can reasonably compare either spoken or sign language to all other forms of communication through signs, from ideograms to musical notation to bee dancing.  It is not a goal of CSL to search for entities of human language that distinguish it from other forms of animal communication.  As with all posited entities, CSL will accept them after they have been shown to have a function.

== Semantics ==

One radical approach of CSL is in its treatment of meaning.  Rather than assuming that there exist semantic universals—much less that we know what they are—CSL assumes that every linguistic sign has a meaning different from all other signs in any language.  Although meanings may be similar, they are never exactly the same. And until it can be objectively shown that a particular sign has multiple meanings, the assumption is that it has only one meaning (elsewhere known as a [[Gesamtbedeutung]]), capable of carrying diverse messages. This derives from Ferdinand de Saussure's structuralist perspective on language, whose perspective relies heavily on the dictum "one form - one meaning". For example, many linguists believe that the word ''with'' has several meanings, such as ''instrumental'': “cut with a knife,” ''adversarial'': “struggle with your enemies”, and even ''partitive'': “split with the organization,” among others.   However, CSL linguists observe that what varies among these uses is not the meaning of ''with'' but the message of the phrase, due to the accompanying verbs and nouns.   ''Struggle'' undoubtedly contributes to the adversarial message, but so does the word ''enemies'';  “struggle with your comrades” would likely eliminate the adversarial relationship.  The little word ''with'' contributes the same weak meaning (something like: “at some time accompanied by”) throughout.   Not only do words in the same sentence affect the message conveyed by ''with'', but the surrounding context and the non-linguistic circumstances do so as well.   In “don’t struggle with him,” the sense is radically affected by the antecedent of ''him,'' whether ''him'' was identified in the previous sentence or whether the speaker is pointing to someone likely to be the listener’s comrade or enemy.

== Syntax ==

Another distinguishing characteristic of the Columbia school is its approach to syntax.  CSL does not attempt to create an algorithm that can generate all possible sentences, because there is no clear dividing line between “grammatical” and “ungrammatical” sentences.   Many apparently ungrammatical sentences can find a useful application, given the proper context.

== Phonology ==

CSL differs from other schools in the other major aspect of language, phonology, as well.  Here again, CSL does not posit entities, such as binary features, unless they can be shown to have a function.  There is nothing in information theory that requires every message to consist ultimately of a binary code.   Any linguistic message can be represented by a binary code, just as our decimal number system can be represented binarily. Therefore, the bit can be used as convenient but arbitrary measure of information for speech or for numerical information. But nobody seriously proposes that people fundamentally use binary digits in counting, as some linguists do for speech.

Unlike most other schools, CSL concentrates on articulation, rather than sound, as its object of study (but see also [[articulatory phonology]]).  For example, CSL attributes the relative rarity in most languages of words beginning with /g/ to its relative difficulty of articulation, not to auditory causes.  In the production of a (voiced) /g/, air must pass through the vocal cords while the back of the tongue stops up the vocal tract, blocking that air.  Since the resulting chamber of air for /g/ is smaller than for /b/ or /d/, there is less time for air to build up, making it harder to produce a vocal vibration when starting to speak.  Thus, through its physiological theoretical orientation, CSL gives an articulatory explanation of the low frequency of initial /g/ in human language.  CSL does not neglect sound as the means through which spoken language is transmitted and whose perceptible differences serve to distinguish linguistic signs.  However, it considers [[articulatory gestures]], not binary acoustic features, to be the physical units of which any utterance is made up.

== Summary ==

The Columbia School of Linguistics traces its origins through [[André Martinet]] and others back to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the founder of modern linguistics.  Like Saussure, CSL considers a language to be a kind of system “où tout se tient” (where everything depends on or influences everything else).  But CSL differs from Saussure and his followers in its interest in substance as well as in form.   Saussure emphatically denied the relevance of the physical media (vocal tract, sound) through which language functions, claiming that language consists of nothing but differences, which are phonetically achieved through the use of physical media.  But CSL linguists make a practice of explaining the arrangement of various forms (/g/, red barn vs. barn red) through their related substances (air chambers, difference in meaning).  CSL researchers set as their goal what other linguists postulate—but do not explain how—children do as they acquire their first language, that is, they analyze the undifferentiated mass of linguistic input actually produced by people.   Rather than marveling at the infinitude of possible sentences that could be produced by an algorithm, CSL linguists wonder at the remarkable skill that humans have in employing a limited number of physical resources and meanings to produce a myriad of messages appropriate for a myriad of situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">With respect to [[cultural heritage]], '''conservation science''' is the interdisciplinary study of conservation of art, architecture, technical art history and other cultural works through the use of scientific inquiry.  General areas of research include the technology and structure of artistic and historic works; the materials and techniques from which cultural, artist and historic objects are made.

[[Conservation scientist (museums)|Conservation scientists]] use [[scientific methods]] and [[Scientific law|principles]] to support work in the fields of [[art conservation]] and [[architectural conservation]], and care of cultural objects in museums and other collections.  Cultural conservation science work includes identifying the materials that make up a structure or piece of art including their chemical makeup, identifying and cataloging changes that cause deterioration and developing methods to mitigate deterioration of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=aic&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Italy]], conservation science is considered part of the broader field called '[[Heritage Science]]' which also encompasses scientific aspects less directly related to cultural heritage [[Art conservation|conservation]], as well its management and interpretation. 
&lt;!-- need history section when sources become available --&gt;

There are four broad categories of conservation science with respect to cultural heritage:  1) understanding the materials and techniques used by artists, 2) thorough examination and analysis, 3) study of the causes of deterioration, and 4) improving materials and techniques.  Conservation science includes aspects of [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]] as well as [[engineering]].&lt;ref name=race&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Phillip|title=The Nature of Conservation: A Race Against Time|year=1986|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Marina del Rey, CA|isbn=0-941103-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Contemporary Religious Satanism: A Critical Anthology''''' is an academic anthology published by [[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]] in 2009 and edited by the Norwegian [[religious studies]] scholar Jesper Aa. Petersen. Containing eight separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Satanism studies, the book examines different forms of [[Satanism]] as practiced in Europe and North America. ''Contemporary Religious Satanism'' was a part of Ashgate's series of books on "Controversial New Religions" alongside tomes devoted to religious movements like [[Wicca]] and the [[Order of the Solar Temple]].

Edited by Petersen, then a lecturer at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]], the book was divided into three sections.

Academic reviews were mixed, being printed in peer reviewed journals such as ''[[Nova Religio]]'', ''[[Aries (journal)|Aries]]'' and ''[[Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft]]''. It was recognised as a pioneering publication in the field of Satanism studies.

==Reception==
The volume was reviewed by French anthropologist Jean La Fontaine for the ''[[Nova Religio]]'' journal.

Erik Davis of [[Rice University]] reviewed the anthology for the ''[[Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft]]'' journal, noting that the book was primarily sociological in basis but that it opened up "an underresearched and underreported topic". Describing Petersen's "thorough introduction", he then discusses the various papers within the anthology. He opines that Lowney had "beautifully" described her encounters, but that it was "unfortunate" that she spent so much of the text reflecting on her logistical challenges, subsequently describing Søderlind and Dyrendal's contribution as "one of the most lively and entertaining" parts of the volume. He remarks positively of Granholm's criticism of the term "Satanism", describing his chapter as a "crucial contribution", and believing that he has made a "good case" for the term "Left Hand Path". Moving on to review the inclusion of primary documents at the end of the volume, he believes that the works presented appear "minor in context", and that it is unfortunate that texts from LaVey and Aquino were not included. As such, he believes that ''Contemporary Religious Satanism'' is not "the perfect reader." Wishing that philosophical and symbolic analyses of Satanism had been included alongside the sociological studies, he also felt that "much more can be made" regarding the differences between LaVeyan-influenced secular Satanists and the mystical Left-Hand Path followers. He believed that the volume would be of great interest to scholars of magic, contemporary Paganism and new religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dav11|Davis 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[zoology]], '''copulation''' is [[animal sexual behavior]] in which a male introduces [[sperm]] into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{Cite book| author =Michael Kent|title = Advanced biology| isbn = 0199141959| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2000 |pages =250–253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aw4ZWLABQkC&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Copulation1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Copulation|publisher=''[[Dorland's medical reference works|Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers]]'', 2007/[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] for various dictionary definitions|accessdate=September 6, 2012|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/copulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an aspect of [[mating]]. Many animals that live in water use [[external fertilization]], whereas [[internal fertilization]] may have developed from a need to maintain [[gamete]]s in a liquid medium in the [[Late Ordovician]] epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) occur via [[cloaca]]l copulation, known as cloacal kiss (see also [[hemipenis]]), while [[mammal]]s copulate [[vagina]]lly, and many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s reproduce sexually with external fertilization.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book| author =Cecie Starr| author2 =Christine Evers| author3 =Lisa Starr|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Biology: A Human Emphasis|publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2010 | pages = 630–631| accessdate = December 9, 2010 |isbn =1133170056| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denecke"&gt;{{cite book| author =Edward J.

In non-primate mammals ([[rodent]]s, [[canidae|canines]], [[felidae|felines]], [[bovine]]s, and [[equine]]s), the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation.&lt;ref name="Knobil"&gt;Knobil E., Neill J.D.

==In spiders and insects==
[[Spider]]s are often confused with [[insect]]s, but they are not insects; instead, they are [[arachnid]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donna M.

Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on to it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large [[pedipalp]]s, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. The females can [[female sperm storage|store sperm indefinitely]].&lt;ref name="RFB2004Spiders"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E. | author2=Fox, R.S. | author3=Barnes, R.D. | last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th|isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004|pages=571–584 | chapter=Chelicerata: Araneae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For primitive insects, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; [[courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation.&lt;ref name="Yadav"&gt;{{cite book| author =M.

Particularly in the female, copulation is controlled by several innate neurobiological processes, including the motor sexual reflex of [[lordosis behaviour|lordosis]]&lt;ref name="pfaff1994"/&gt; (see diagram below).

By simplifying, the female can not have any other sexual activity than [[lordosis behaviour|lordosis]].

In the male, the realization of copulation is more complex, because some learning is necessary. Nevertheless, the innate processes (retrocontrol of penis intromission in the vagina, rhythmic movement of the pelvis, detection of female pheromones ...) are specific to copulation. These innate processes direct learning to heterosexual copulation.&lt;ref name="meisel"&gt;MEISEL Robert L. , SACHS Benjamin D. : The physiology of male sexual behavior. in KNOBIL Ernest, NEILL Jimmy D. The physiology of reproduction, Raven Press, 2nd edition, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, through the coordination of [[hormone]]s, [[pheromone]]s and sexual reflexes, there is a true reproductive behavior in non-primate mammals.

=== Evolution of copulation control in hominids ===

In the case of mammals with a highly developed [[brain]] ([[chimpanzee]], [[bonobo]], [[Orangutan]]s, and [[dolphin]]s), the cerebral structure has evolved. As a result of these evolved differences, the human intercourse depends on another type of neurobiological control:&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt;
* Female [[lordosis behaviour]] became secondary in [[hominidae]] and is apparently non-functional in humans.&lt;ref name="Dixson2012"/&gt; Sexual stimuli no longer trigger immobilization or reflex arching of the back. If a woman gets onto all fours, curves her back and remains still, it is no longer a reflex movement triggered by sexual stimuli, but a voluntary movement.&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;
* [[Pheromone]]s become secondary. 90% of [[sex pheromone]] receptor genes become pseudogens,&lt;ref name="nei2008"&gt;Nei M., Niimura Y., Nozawa M. (2008) [http://www.niimura.sakura.ne.jp/papers/Nei_et_al_2008.pdf The evolution of animal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires: roles of chance and necessity]. ''Nat. Rev. Genet.'', 9(12):951-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the vomeronasal organ is altered.&lt;ref name="Zhang2003"&gt;Zhang J., Webb D.M.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100(14):8337-8341, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The sexual activities are gradually dissociated from the hormonal cycles,&lt;ref name="Dixson2012"&gt;Dixson A.F. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9N_BokMAMkC Primate sexuality: Comparative studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Human Beings].

* Sexual learning, induced by sexual rewards and the [[reward system]], become a major factor in hominids.&lt;ref name="agmo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="georgiadis2012"&gt;Georgiadis J.R., Kringelbach M.L., Pfaus J.G.

* The major development of the cortex in hominids leads to the gradual emergence of complex cognitive abilities, which have enabled the human species to develop culture.&lt;ref name="Gazzaniga2002"&gt;Gazzaniga M.S., Ivry R.B., Mangun G.R. Cognitive neuroscience. The biology of the mind. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2e edition, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the functional dynamics of the copulation behavior has been modified in hominids: the reproductive behavior becomes an erotic behavior.&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"&gt;Wunsch S.

Sexologies 26(1):e1-e10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal coitus is still practiced in humans, but it is no longer a reflex motor activity, guided by pheromones and controlled by hormones. It is rather an erotic activity, among others, carried out voluntarily to obtain [[reward system|cerebral reward]] (sexual pleasure &lt;ref name="georgiadis2012"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="wunsch2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7790">'''Cue validity''' is the [[conditional probability]] that an object falls in a particular category given a particular feature or ''cue''. The term was popularized by {{Harvtxt|Beach|1964}}, {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}} and especially by [[Eleanor Rosch]] in her investigations of the acquisition of so-called [[Prototype_theory#Basic_level_categories | ''basic categories'']] ({{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|1978}}). 

==Definition of cue validity==
Formally, the cue validity of a feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt; has been defined in the following ways:
* As the conditional probability &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|Mervis|1975}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|1978}}.
* As the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate, &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)-p(c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Edgell|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Kruschke|Johansen|1999}}.
* As a function of the linear correlation; see {{Harvtxt|Smedslund|1955}}, {{Harvtxt|Castellan|1973}}, {{Harvtxt|Sawyer|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Busemeyer|Myung|McDaniel|1993}}.
* Other definitions; see {{Harvtxt|Restle|1957}}, {{Harvtxt|Martignon|Vitouch|Takezawa|Forster|2003}}.

For the definitions based on probability, a high cue validity for a given feature means that the feature or attribute is more diagnostic of the class membership than a feature with low cue validity. Thus, a high-cue validity feature is one which conveys more information about the category or class variable, and may thus be considered as more useful for identifying objects as belonging to that category. Thus, high cue validity expresses high feature ''informativeness''. For the definitions based on linear correlation, the expression of "informativeness" captured by the cue validity measure is not the full expression of the feature's informativeness (as in [[mutual information]], for example), but only that portion of its informativeness that is expressed in a linear relationship. For some purposes, a bilateral measure such as the [[mutual information]] or [[category utility]] is more appropriate than the cue validity.

==Examples==
As an example, let us consider the domain of "numbers" and allow that every number has an attribute (i.e., a ''cue'') named "&lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt;", which we call &lt;math&gt;f_{p\mbox{-}int}\ &lt;/math&gt;, and which adopts the value 1 if the number is actually a positive [[integer]]. Then we can inquire what the validity of this cue is with regard to the following classes: {&lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;}:
* If we know that a number is a positive integer we know that it is a [[rational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{rational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 1\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt; is 1.
* If we know that a number is a positive integer then we know that it is ''not'' an [[irrational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{irrational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt; is 0.
* If we know only that a number is a positive integer, then its chances of being even or odd are 50-50 (there being the same number of even and odd integers). Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{even}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0.5\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt; is 0.5, meaning that the attribute &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; is entirely uninformative about the number's membership in the class &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[perception]], "cue validity" is often short for ''[[ecological validity (perception)|ecological validity]]'' of a perceptual cue, and is defined as a correlation rather than a probability (see above). In this definition, an uninformative perceptual cue has an ecological validity of 0 rather than 0.5.

==Use of the cue validity==
In much of the work on modeling human category learning, there has been the assumption made (and sometimes validated) that attentional weighting tracks the cue validity, or tracks some related measure of feature informativeness. This would imply that attributes are differently weighted by the perceptual system; informative or high-cue validity attributes being weighted more heavily, while uninformative or low-cue validity attributes are weighted more lightly or ignored altogether (see, e.g., Navarro 1998).

== Definitions &amp; significance ==

=== Definitions ===

The exact definition of cultural keystone species remains under debate and is considered to be more abstract than the related ecological concept.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davic|first=Robert D.|date=2004|title=Epistemology, Culture, and Keystone Species|jstor=26267687|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=9|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garibaldi and Turner emphasize that the cultural keystone species concept is not an extension of ecological keystone species, but rather a parallel concept that bridges social and physical sciences, as well as [[Traditional ecological knowledge|indigenous knowledge]] and [[Western Science|western knowledge]], to offer a more holistic approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garibaldi|first=Ann|last2=Turner|first2=Nancy|date=2004|title=The Nature of Culture and Keystones|jstor=26267688|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=9|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers debate whether or not cultural keystone species are different from economically important species.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platten|first=Simon|last2=Henfrey|first2=Thomas|date=2009-08-01|title=The Cultural Keystone Concept: Insights from Ecological Anthropology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10745-009-9237-2|journal=Human Ecology|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=491|doi=10.1007/s10745-009-9237-2|issn=0300-7839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is argued that the concept will be reduced to a biological term if it only focuses on specific species, but this may be solved by considering cultural keystone species as a "complex" that develops based on the ways that the species is used and its impacts on cultural practices over time, through conscious social practices, decision-making processes, and changes to societal needs and practices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Garibaldi and Turner outline six elements that should be considered when identifying a cultural keystone species:
* The magnitude and variety of ways the species is used
* The species' influence on language
* The species' role in cultural practices (e.g. traditional practices, ceremonies)
* The continuation of the species' importance even as cultural identity changes over time
* The irreplaceability of the species by another species accessible to the group
* The species' role in activities outside its own territory (e.g. trade)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Not all cultural keystone species are beneficial to a community or an ecosystem, particularly when the species is considered [[Invasive species|invasive]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One example of this is the Australian ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' tree that is now widespread in [[California]] and is considered to be culturally important because of its aesthetic value and dietary uses. However, the tree is a threat to [[Endemism|native species]] and has drastically impacted the ecosystems it is found in.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Significance ===

The cultural keystone species concept may have important applications for conservation and ecological restoration initiatives because these species may serve as a starting point from which to identify the needs of both the community and the ecosystem. Cultural keystone species reinforce the close relationships between communities and their surrounding environments, particularly for [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]] currently facing environmental and economic challenges. These species may offer information about an ecosystem or a community's resilience, and their identification can support the survival of communities who depend on a cultural keystone species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is argued that these species should play a role in environmental policy, for example in the Cultural Impact Assessment of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], to connect cultural and ecological conservation for indigenous peoples. Legal recognition of cultural keystone species can also improve social justice, ensure continuation of indigenous practices, and promote inclusive social-ecological management practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cristancho|first=Sergio|last2=Vining|first2=Joanne|date=2004|title=Culturally Defined Keystone Species|jstor=24707675|journal=Human Ecology Review|volume=11|issue=2|pages=153–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also found that identification of cultural keystone species supports the integration of indigenous perspectives on [[environmental stewardship]] and improved natural resource management practices. The application of the concept can support the development of innovative methods to conserve natural resources as a result of this integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble|first=Mae|last2=Duncan|first2=Phil|last3=Perry|first3=Darren|last4=Prosper|first4=Kerry|last5=Rose|first5=Denis|last6=Schnierer|first6=Stephan|last7=Tipa|first7=Gail|last8=Williams|first8=Erica|last9=Woods|first9=Rene|date=2016-05-09|title=Culturally significant fisheries: keystones for management of freshwater social-ecological systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-08353-210222|journal=Ecology and Society|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|doi=10.5751/es-08353-210222|issn=1708-3087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garibaldi|first=Ann|date=2009-09-01|title=Moving From Model to Application: Cultural Keystone Species and Reclamation in Fort McKay, Alberta|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2993/0278-0771-29.2.323|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=323–338|doi=10.2993/0278-0771-29.2.323|issn=0278-0771}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "invisible losses" can be avoided because the identification of these species includes consideration of the cultural and social importance of a species.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uprety|first=Yadav|last2=Asselin|first2=Hugo|last3=Bergeron|first3=Yves|date=2013-03-26|title=Cultural importance of white pine (Pinus strobus L.) to the Kitcisakik Algonquin community of western Quebec, Canada|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfr-2012-0514|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=43|issue=6|pages=544–551|doi=10.1139/cjfr-2012-0514|issn=0045-5067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern white pine, a cultural keystone species
]]
The white pine ([[Pinus strobus|''Pinus strobus'' L.]]), found across northeastern North America, is a cultural keystone species for the [[Kitcisakik|Kitcisakik Algonquin]] community in Quebec. The tree is prevalent in legends and myths that are central to the culture, history, and identity of the Kitcisakik. The tree is said to offer protection to the people because of its large size when mature, and provides a home to bald eagles, a sacred species for Algonquin societies. Parts of the tree are also used in material goods and medicines, and the species is considered to be irreplaceable by the Kitcisakik, who rely on the services the white pine offers to both humans and the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The white pine is currently threatened by logging and environmental changes and the Kitcisakik are central in efforts to modify practices so that the species will survive. The researchers that identified the white pine as the cultural keystone species of the Kitcisakik using Garibaldi and Turner's methodology and community interviews note that the tree is not only culturally significant, but ecologically as well - it provides services to animals such as birds, moose, and marten. The identification of this tree as a cultural keystone species offers insight into how and why culturally important components of the environment should be considered when developing natural resource management and restoration strategies. The inclusion of the white pine's cultural significance in these strategies may ensure that cultural needs are considered alongside environmental and economic priorities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7171">'''Defensive computing''' is a form of practice for computer users to help reduce the risk of computing problems, by avoiding dangerous computing practices. The primary goal of this method of computing is to be able to anticipate and prepare for potentially problematic situations prior to their occurrence, despite any adverse conditions of a computer system or any mistakes made by other users. This can be achieved through adherence to a variety of general guidelines, as well as the practice of specific computing techniques.

Strategies for defensive computing could be divided into two categories, [[network security]] and the [[backup]] and restoration of data.

== Network security ==
Users put their computers at risk when accessing the [[Internet]] and other [[Computer network|networks]]. The use of either of these allows others to gain access to a user's system and important information. By implementing certain strategies, defensive users aim to reduce the risk associated with network access.

=== Firewall ===
A [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a collection of security measures that protects a computer from harmful inbound and outbound traffic on the Internet and prevents the unauthorized access of computer systems.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/02-12/firewall.pdf http://www.cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/02-12/firewall.pdf], A History and Survey of Network Firewalls&lt;/ref&gt; These security measures are integrated into the form of special software that runs autonomously either on individual computer systems, or externally through built in software within [[Router (computing)|routers]] and [[modems]].

Not all firewall software will protect computers from sending unauthorized or harmful outbound traffic.
An important defensive computing strategy is to seek and implement quality firewall software that filters both inbound and outbound traffic.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-9923976-33.html http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-9923976-33.html], The Pillars of Defensive Computing&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-malware software ===
A basic strategy for all defensive computer users is to install and use anti-[[malware]] software.
Firewalls may not completely protect a computer. Malicious software may be able to get through a firewall and onto a system. Anti-Malware such as anti-virus, anti-phishing and email filtering software offer some protection against harmful software that reside within a computer. The amount of  malicious software available over the Internet is steadily increasing.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031901439.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031901439.html], Antivirus Firms Scrambling to Keep Up&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for defensive users to use to anti-malware that is both effective and easily updated in order to combat new strains of malicious software that are developed.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

=== Skepticism ===
	An important aspect of defensive computing is for users to be skeptical of the data to which they have access via the Internet.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2206/2206article6.htm http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2206/2206article6.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724025722/http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2206/2206article6.htm |date=2006-07-24 }}, How To Protect Yourself From Virus Infection&lt;/ref&gt; Malicious software can exist in a multitude of different forms and many are misleading to general computer users and even some anti-malware software. Defensive users think critically about the information they can access, to reduce their chances of downloading and spreading malicious software. Strategies include scanning [[email attachments]] prior to opening them and manually filtering suspicious emails from inboxes. Users should be aware of persuasive subject lines and headings in emails from any address, as they may actually contain malicious software or spam, which can mislead users into false advertisement resulting in identity theft.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;
Defensive users can scan files they download prior to opening them and can also configure their computers to show [[file extensions]], revealing potentially dangerous files that appear harmless.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;
Skepticism can also be applied to the websites visited by users. As with emails, users can be led to false advertisements. Also, malicious software can unknowingly be downloaded and infect a computer, just by visiting a certain website.

== Backup and recovery procedures ==
Despite the efforts of a defensive computer user, the loss of important data can occur due to malware, power outages, equipment failure and general misuse. Although the loss of data cannot be completely prevented, defensive users can take steps to minimize the amount of data lost and restore systems to their previous state.

=== Backup of files ===
	A defensive strategy against unintentional data loss is the regular backup of important files. Users can make multiple copies of important data and store them either on the same computer or on another device such as a compact disc or an external hard drive.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/data/what.mspx http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/data/what.mspx], How to Decide what Data to Back Up&lt;/ref&gt; Users can also upload important files to the Internet, provided they have access to Internet storage services. 

=== Restoration ===
Some operating systems give users the option of performing a procedure that restores a computer to a predetermined state. If no option is available, a user can obtain the appropriate restoration software for their system. In the event of a system failure or a serious case of data loss, a user can restore any lost or changed files and remove any malicious files that did not previously exist.&lt;ref name="five"/&gt;

== Good practices for protecting data ==
* Regularly backup important files, documents and emails.
* Do not use the administrator account for day-to-day activities.
* Keep software up-to-date with the latest versions. 
* Keep antivirus and [[antispyware]] up-to-date with latest versions.
* Use different passwords 
* Disable auto run feature from USB [[flash drives]]. Some viruses, specially [[computer worm|worms]], spread automatically through USB flash drives &lt;ref name="seven"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-10027754-33.html http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-10027754-33.html], Be safer than NASA: Disable autorun&lt;/ref&gt;
* Always connect to the Internet behind a firewall
* When in doubt, throw it out

The '''discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation''' constitutes a major development in modern [[physical cosmology]]. The cosmic background radiation ([[CMB]]) was measured by Andrew McKellar in 1941 at an effective temperature of 2.3 K using [[cyano radical|CN]] stellar absorption lines observed by W. S. Adams.&lt;ref name="McKellar" /&gt; Theoretical work around 1950&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Sciama - https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-009-0655-6_1 Accessed 13 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the need for a CMB for consistency with the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|simplest relativistic universe models]]. In 1964, [[United States|US]] radio astronomers [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] rediscovered the CMB, estimating its temperature as 3.5 K, as they experimented with the [[Holmdel Horn Antenna]].&lt;ref name="PenziasWilson65CMB" /&gt; The new measurements were accepted as important evidence for a hot early Universe ([[big bang theory]]) and as evidence against the rival [[steady state theory]].&lt;ref name="Dicke65" /&gt;  In 1978, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] for their joint measurement.

==History==
[[Image:Bell Labs Horn Antenna Crawford Hill NJ.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Bell Labs' Horn Antenna in Crawford Hill, NJ - In 1964 while using the Horn Antenna, Penzias and Wilson stumbled on the microwave background radiation that permeates the universe.]]
{{Further|Timeline of cosmic microwave background astronomy}}
By the middle of the 20th century, [[cosmologist]]s had developed two different theories to explain the creation of the universe. Some supported the [[steady-state theory]], which states that the universe has always existed and will continue to survive without noticeable change. Others believed in the [[Big Bang]] theory, which states that the universe was created in a massive explosion-like event billions of years ago ([[Age_of_the_universe|later determined to be approximately 13.8 billion years]]).

In 1941, Andrew McKellar used W. S. Adams' spectroscopic observations of [[cyano radical|CN]] absorption lines in the spectrum of a B type star to measure a blackbody background temperature of 2.3 K. McKellar referred to his detection as a "'rotational' temperature of interstellar molecules", without reference to a cosmological interpretation, stating that the temperature "will have its own, perhaps limited, significance".&lt;ref name="McKellar" /&gt;

Over two decades later, working at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Holmdel, New Jersey]], in 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were experimenting with a supersensitive, 6 meter (20&amp;nbsp;ft) [[horn antenna]] originally built to detect [[radio wave]]s bounced off [[Echo satellite|Echo balloon satellite]]s. To measure these faint radio waves, they had to eliminate all recognizable [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] from their receiver. They removed the effects of [[radar]] and [[radio broadcasting]], and suppressed interference from the heat in the receiver itself by cooling it with liquid [[helium]] to &amp;minus;269&amp;nbsp;°C, only 4 K above [[absolute zero]].

When Penzias and Wilson reduced their data they found a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] that persisted in their receiver. This residual noise was 100 times more intense than they had expected, was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. They were certain that the radiation they detected on a wavelength of 7.35 centimeters did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]. After thoroughly checking their equipment, removing some [[Columbidae|pigeons]] [[nest]]ing in the antenna and cleaning out the accumulated [[Feces|droppings]], the noise remained. Both concluded that this noise was coming from outside our own galaxy—although they were not aware of any [[astronomical radio source|radio source]] that would account for it.

At that same time, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], [[astrophysicist]]s at [[Princeton University]] just {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, were preparing to search for [[microwave radiation]] in this region of the spectrum. Dicke and his colleagues reasoned that the Big Bang must have scattered not only the matter that condensed into galaxies but also must have released a tremendous blast of radiation. With the proper instrumentation, this radiation should be detectable, albeit as microwaves, due to a massive [[redshift]].

When a friend (Bernard F. Burke, Prof. of Physics at [[MIT]]) told Penzias about a preprint paper he had seen by Jim Peebles on the possibility of finding radiation left over from an explosion that filled the universe at the beginning of its existence, Penzias and Wilson began to realize the significance of what they believed was a new discovery. The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias read the paper and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the horn antenna and listen to the background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P. G. Roll interpreted this radiation as a signature of the Big Bang.

To avoid potential conflict, they decided to publish their results jointly. Two notes were rushed to the [[Astrophysical Journal Letters]]. In the first, Dicke and his associates outlined the importance of cosmic background radiation as substantiation of the Big Bang Theory.&lt;ref name="Dicke65" /&gt; In a second note, jointly signed by Penzias and Wilson titled, "A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Megacycles per Second," they reported the existence of a 3.5 K residual background noise, remaining after accounting for a sky absorption component of 2.3 K and a 0.9 K instrumental component,&lt;ref name="PW65antenna" /&gt; and attributed a "possible explanation" as that given by Dicke in his companion letter.&lt;ref name="PenziasWilson65CMB" /&gt;

In 1978, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] for their joint detection. They shared the prize with [[Pyotr Kapitsa]], who won it for unrelated work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3418">'''Domestication islands''' refers to regions within DNA that do not change despite gene flow between wild and domesticated species.&lt;ref name=bellucci2007/&gt;

==Speciation islands==
In 2005, a study of [[genome|genomic DNA]] within species of mosquitoes found that there were "speciation islands" of genes that remain differentiated despite considerable gene flow, and are therefore expected to contain the genes responsible for reproductive isolation between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Turner, T.L.|year=2005|title=Genomic Islands of Speciation in Anopheles gambiae|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=3|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030285|pages=e285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, there was criticism of this proposal and that there might be other explanations, including [[nucleotide]] diversity within species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Noor M.A.F.|year=2009|title=Islands of Speciation or Mirages in the Desert? Examining the Role of Restricted Recombination in Maintaining Species|journal=Heredity (Edinb)|pages=439–444|doi=10.1038/hdy.2009.151|volume=103|pmc=2809014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reduced diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cruikshank, T.E.|year=2014|title=Reanalysis suggests that genomic islands of speciation are due to reduced diversity, not reduced gene flow|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=23|issue=13|pages=3133–3157|doi=10.1111/mec.12796|pmid=24845075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate continues.

==Domestication islands==
In 2007, a study of the [[genome|genomic DNA]] differences of wild compared to domesticated species of beans found that there was a large fraction of the genome of the common bean that appears to have been subjected to the effects of selection during [[domestication]]. Domestication appears to have affected not only the target genes, but also a large portion of the genome around these genes. These "domestication islands" have probably experienced a higher level of isolation between the wild and the domesticated forms in comparison with the rest of the genome, probably because of linkage to the loci selected during domestication.&lt;ref name=bellucci2007&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bellucci, E|year=2007|title=Islands of domestication in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genome|publisher=Proceedings of the 51st Italian Society of Agricultural Genetics Annual Congress, Riva del Garda, Italy|ISBN =978-88-900622-7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a study looked at the [[genome]] sequences of pigs, and found that the assumption of  reproductive isolation and strong domestication bottlenecks were incompatible with the data. The domestication process was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. Despite gene flow between domestic and wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs had strong signatures of selection at loci that affect behavior and morphology. The conclusion was that recurrent selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created "islands of domestication" in the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frantz, L|year=2015|title=Evidence of long-term gene flow and selection during domestication from analyses of Eurasian wild and domestic pig genomes|doi=10.1038/ng.3394|pmid=26323058|volume=47|journal=Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13208">'''ERP Security''' is a wide range of measures aimed at protecting [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems from illicit access ensuring accessibility and integrity of system data. ERP system is a computer software that serves to unify the information intended to manage the company including Production, [[Supply Chain Management]], [[Financial Management]], [[Human Resource Management]], [[Customer Relationship Management]], [[Enterprise Performance Management]], etc. Common ERP systems are [[SAP ERP|SAP]], [[Oracle E-Business Suite]], [[Microsoft Dynamics]].&lt;ref name="ERP"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP (enterprise resource planning) |url=https://searcherp.techtarget.com/definition/ERP-enterprise-resource-planning |newspaper=SearchERP TechTarget|date=May 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Review == 
ERP system integrates business processes enabling procurement, payment, transport, human resources management, product management, and financial planning.&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/applications/erp/what-is-erp.html|title=What Is ERP?|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As ERP system stores confidential information, [[ISACA]] recommends to regularly conduct a comprehensive assessment of ERP system security, checking ERP servers for software vulnerabilities, configuration errors, segregation of duties conflicts, compliance with relevant standards and recommendations, and recommendations of vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Information Age"&gt; {{cite news |title=Why security should be a priority for an ERP ecosystem |url=http://www.information-age.com/security-priority-erp-ecosystem-123468295/ |newspaper=Information Age|date=31 August 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes for vulnerabilities in ERP systems == 

=== Complexity ===
ERP systems process transactions and implement procedures to ensure that users have different access privileges. There are hundreds of authorization objects in SAP permitting users to perform actions in the system. In case of 200 users of the company, there are approximately 800,000 (100*2*20*200) ways to customize security settings of ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;ERP Security and Segregation of Duties Audit: A Framework for Building an Automated Solution https://csbweb01.uncw.edu/people/ivancevichd/classes/MSA%20516/Extra%20Readings%20on%20Topics/Database/ERP%20Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth of complexity, the possibility of errors and segregation of duties conflicts increases.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specificity === 
Vendors fix vulnerabilities on the regular basis since hackers monitor business applications to find and exploit security issues. SAP releases patches monthly on [[Patch Tuesday]], Oracle issues security fixes every quarter in [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html Oracle Critical Patch Update]. Business applications are becoming more exposed to the Internet or migrate to the cloud.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP Security Deserves Our Attention Now More Than Ever |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/07/07/erp-security-deserves-our-attention-now-more-than-ever/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=7 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of competent specialists === 
ERP Cybersecurity survey&lt;ref&gt;ERP Cybersecurity survey 2017 https://erpscan.com/research/white-papers/erp-cybersecurity-survey-2017/&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that organizations running ERP systems "lack both awareness and actions taken towards ERP security".&lt;ref name="CSO"&gt; {{cite news |title=Survey reveals the damage of fraud attacks against SAP system is estimated at $10m |url=https://www.cso.com.au/article/621185/survey-reveals-damage-fraud-attacks-against-sap-system-estimated-10m/|newspaper=CSO from IDG |date=27 June 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ISACA states that "there is a shortage of staff members trained in ERP security"&lt;ref&gt;ERP Security and Segregation of Duties Audit: A Framework for Building an Automated Solution https://csbweb01.uncw.edu/people/ivancevichd/classes/MSA%20516/Extra%20Readings%20on%20Topics/Database/ERP%20Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and security services have the superficial understanding of risks and threats associated with ERP systems. Consequently, security vulnerabilities complicate undertakings such as detecting and subsequent fixing.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP Security Deserves Our Attention Now More Than Ever |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/07/07/erp-security-deserves-our-attention-now-more-than-ever/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=7 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CloudComputing"&gt; {{cite news |title=Six classic ERP system security problems – and how to avoid them |url=https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2017/may/10/six-classic-erp-system-security-problems-and-how-avoid-them/ |newspaper=CloudTech|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of security auditing tools  === 
ERP security audit is done manually as various tools with ERP packages do not provide means for system security auditing. Manual auditing is a complex and time-consuming process that increases the possibility of making a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large number of customized settings ===  
The system includes thousands of parameters and fine settings including segregation of duties for transactions and tables, and the security parameters are set for every single system. ERP system settings are customized according to customers' requirements.

== Security issues in ERP systems == 
Security issues occur in ERP systems at different levels.

=== Network layer  === 
'''Traffic interception and modification''' 
* absence of data encryption 
In 2011, Sensepost specialists analyzed DIAG protocol used in SAP ERP system for transferring data from the client to the SAP server. Two utilities were published that allowed to intercept, decrypt, and modify client-server requests containing critical information. This made attacks possible including [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]. The second utility operates like a Proxy and was created to identify new vulnerabilities. It allowed modifying requests coming to client and server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erpscan.ru/press-center/press-release/erpscan-warns-about-new-vulnerabilities-of-diag-protocol-in-sap/ ERPScan warns about new vulnerabilities of DIAG protocol in SAP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* sending password in cleartext (SAP J2EE Telnet / Oracle listener old versions) 
In the SAP ERP system, it is possible to perform administering functions via [[Telnet]] protocol, which encrypts passwords.

''Vulnerabilities in encryption or authentication protocols''' 
* authentification by hash 
* XOR password encryption (SAP DIAG) 
* imposing the use of outdated authentication protocols
* incorrect authentication protocols 

'''Vulnerabilities in protocols (e.g. RFC in SAP ERP and Oracle Net in Oracle E-Business Suite).''' 
RFC protocol is used (Remote Function Call) to connect two systems by TCP/IP in SAP ERP. RFC call is a function that enables calling and running a functional module located in a system. The [[ABAP]] language that is used for writing business applications for SAP have functions to make RFC calls. Several critical vulnerabilities were found in SAP RFC Library versions 6.x and 7.x&lt;ref&gt;SAP RFC Library Multiple Vulnerabilities http://www.cnet.com/forums/post/7986898c-0a03-43d4-af70-b8427164c8e2&lt;/ref&gt;:  
* RFC function "RFC_SET_REG_SERVER_PROPERTY" allows determining an exclusive use of RFC server. Vulnerability exploits lead to a denial of access for the legitimate users. [[DoS-attack|denial of service]] becomes possible. 
* Error in RFC function "SYSTEM_CREATE_INSTANCE". Exploiting vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code. 
* Error in RFC function "RFC_START_GUI". Exploiting vulnerability also allows executing arbitrary code. 
* Error in RFC function "RFC_START_PROGRAM".  Exploiting vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code or gain information about RFC server configuration. 
* Error in RFC function "TRUSTED_SYSTEM_SECURITY". Exploiting vulnerability allows obtaining information about existing users and groups in RFC server.

=== Operating system level === 
OS software vulnerabilities 
* any remote vulnerability in OS is used to gain access to applications 

Weak OS passwords 
* remote password brute-forcing 
* empty passwords for remote management tools like RAdmin and [[VNC]] 

Insecure OS settings 
* NFS and SMB. SAP data becomes accessible to remote users via NFS an SMB 
* file access rights. Critical SAP and DBMS Oracle data files have insecure access rights such as 755 and 777 
* insecure hosts settings. In the trusted hosts, servers can be listed and an attacker easily accesses them

=== Application vulnerabilities === 
ERP systems transfer more functionality on the web applications level with a lot of vulnerabilities:  
* Web application vulnerabilities ([[XSS]], [[XSRF]], [[SQL Injection]], Response Splitting, Code Execution) 
* Buffer overflow and format string  in web-servers and application-servers (SAP IGS, SAP Netweaver, Oracle BEA Weblogic) 
* Insecure privileges for access (SAP Netweaver, SAP CRM, Oracle E-Business Suite)

== Role-based access control == 
In ERP systems, RBAC ([[Role-Based Access Control]]) model is applied for users to perform transactions and gain access to business objects.&lt;ref&gt;Security for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems http://www.utdallas.edu/~bxt043000/Publications/Journal-Papers/DAS/J46_Security_for_Enterprise_Resource_Planning_Systems.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
In the model, the decision to grant access to a user is made based on the functions of users, or roles. Roles are a multitude of transactions the user or a group of users performs in the company. Transaction is a procedure of transforming system data, which helps perform this transaction. For any role, there is a number of corresponding users with one or multiple roles. Roles can be hierarchical. After the roles are implemented in the system, transactions corresponding to each role rarely change. The administrator needs to add or delete users from roles. The administrator provides a new user with a membership in one or more roles. When employees leave the organization, the administrator removes them from all the roles.&lt;ref&gt;Role-Based Access Controls http://csrc.nist.gov/rbac/ferraiolo-kuhn-92.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

== Segregation of Duties == 
Segregation or [[Separation of duties]], also known as SoD, is the concept according to which a user cannot make a transaction without other users (e.g. a user cannot add a new supplier, write out a cheque or pay to a supplier)&lt;ref&gt;ISACA Glossary Terms http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Lists/ISACA%20Glossary%20Terms/DispForm.aspx?ID=1700&lt;/ref&gt; and a risk of fraud is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;A risk-based approach
to segregation of duties http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_Segregation_of_duties/$FILE/EY_Segregation_of_dutie/s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SoD can be implemented by RBAC mechanisms, and a notion of mutually exclusive roles is introduced. For instance, to pay a supplier, one user initiates payment procedure and another accepts it.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Botha and J. H. P. Eloff [http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/403/botha.html Separation of Duties for Access Control Enforcement in Workflow Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, initiating payment and accepting are mutually exclusive roles. Segregation of duties can be either static or dynamic. With static SoD (SSoD), a user cannot belong to two mutually exclusive roles. With dynamic SoD (DSoD), a user does but cannot perform them within one transaction. Both of them have their own advantages. SSoD is simple, while DSoD is flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Simple Search http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/all/52d12689b4758c84c12572a600386f1d/$file/mcs-2006-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation of Duties is explained in SoD matrix. X and Y matrixes describe system roles. If the two roles are mutually exclusive, there is a flag at the interception of the corresponding rows and columns.

== ERP Security scanners == 
ERP Security scanner is a software intended to search for vulnerabilities in ERP systems. Scanner analyzes configurations of ERP system, searches for misconfigurations, access control and encryption conflicts, insecure components, and checks for updates. The scanner checks system parameters for compliance with the manufacturer's recommendations and auditing procedures [[:en:ISACA|ISACA]]. ERP Security scanners produce reports with the vulnerabilities listed according to their criticality.
The examples of scanners:

* [http://www.onapsis.com Onapsis] for [[SAP ERP|SAP]] ERP 
* [http://www.integrigy.com/products/appsentry AppSentry] for [[Oracle E-Business Suite]]

'''Emma Rush''' is a lecturer in philosophy and ethics at [[Charles Sturt University Faculty of Arts]], School of Humanities and Social Sciences, notable for her work on sexualisation of children.&lt;ref name=Charles_Sturt&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Emma Rush|url=http://www.csu.edu.au/faculty/arts/humss/staff/profiles/philosophy/emma-rush|publisher=Charles Sturt University, School of Humanities and Social Sciences|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Federation of Children's Book Groups''' is a national charity in the [[United Kingdom]] that promotes children's books and reading for pleasure for all ages of children, from newborns to teenagers. The organisation is run by volunteers interested in supporting children and their books, both at a national level, through an executive, and a local level, through local groups, with the support also of individuals and professional members. The Federation liaises with publishers, libraries, schools and other bodies with an interest in literacy, reading and young people. 

The Federation owns and coordinates the [[Red House Children's Book Award]], the UK's only national book award voted for entirely by children.

The Federation promotes [[National Share-a-Story Month]] (every May) and [[National Non-Fiction Day]] (every November). It holds an annual conference each spring (with the help of local groups) as well as various one day regional conferences. The Federation regularly publishes booklists for children of different ages, as well as producing newsletters three times a year, and providing general advice and information on children's books and reading for enjoyment.

In 2011 The Federation of Children's Book Groups won the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]] for distinguished service to the world of British children's books.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/news/4162_the_federation_of_childrens_book_groups_wins_award&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Anne Wood]], a British children's television producer, and creator of the [[Teletubbies]], established the first Book Group to promote enthusiasm for and about children's book in 1965. Soon more groups were created and the Federation of Children's Book Groups was created in 1968. Many of the original local groups are still in existence, though new groups are developing every year.

==Local Book Groups==
There are currently over 25 separate Book Groups throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Each group is different but typically a local group holds
*Meetings for adults to discuss children's books.
*Events with visiting speakers, including authors and illustrators.
*Activities for children such as storytelling and book exhibitions.

{{About|the type of media content}}
'''Fiction''' broadly refers to any [[narrative]] that is derived from the [[imagination]]—in other words, not based strictly on history or fact.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiction fiction]." Merriam-Webster, Incorporated. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sageng, Fossheim, &amp; Larsen (eds.) (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=q_AVJXKbE4wC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=events+places The Philosophy of Computer Games]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C. Hugh Holman 1990, p. 212"&gt;William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman ''A Handbook to Literature'' (7th edition).  New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the [[novel]] and [[short story]]), and is often used as a synonym for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;M. h. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition), Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In its most narrow usage fiction refers to novels, but it may also denote any "[[literature|literary]] narrative" (see [[literary fiction]]),&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' (7th edition). Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace, 1999, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fiction Definition of 'fiction']." ''Oxford English Dictionaries'' (online). Oxford University Press. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[novel]]s, [[novella]]s, and [[short story|short stories]]. More broadly, fiction has come to encompass imaginative storytelling in any format, including [[writing]]s, [[drama|theatrical performances]], [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, [[animation]]s, games (most notably, [[video game]]s and [[role-playing game]]s), and so on.

A work of fiction implies the inventive act of [[worldbuilding|constructing an imaginary world]], so its audience does not typically expect it to be totally faithful to the real world in presenting only [[character (arts)|characters]] who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true.&lt;ref name="litfiction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farner|first=Geir|year=2014|title=Literary Fiction: The Ways We Read Narrative Literature|chapter=Chapter 2: What is Literary Fiction?|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXXHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the context of fiction, generally understood as not adhering precisely to the real world, is more open to interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=31|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction|quote=Non-fictional discourse is usually embedded in a context that tells you how to take it: an instruction manual, a newspaper report, a letter from a charity. The context of fiction, though, explicitly leaves open the question of what the fiction is really about. Reference to the world is not so much a property of literary [i.e. fictional] works as a function they are given by interpretation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe: an independent [[fictional universe]].

Fiction's traditional opposite is [[non-fiction]], a narrative work whose creator assumes responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction however can be unclear in some recent artistic and literary movements, such as [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Iftekharuddin, Frahat (ed.). (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=61w4hxtXnFUC&amp;dq The Postmodern Short Story: Forms and Issues]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of fictional genres}}

Traditionally, fiction includes [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[fables]], [[legend]]s, [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[narrative poetry]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] (including [[operas]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], [[drama]]s, [[puppet play]]s, and [[concert dance|various kinds of theatrical dances]]). However, fiction may also encompass [[comic book]]s, and many [[animated cartoon]]s, [[stop motion]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[fictional film|films]], [[video games]], [[radio drama|radio programs]], [[television program]]s ([[television comedy|comedies]] and [[dramatic programming|dramas]]), etc.

The [[Internet]] has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction, calling into question the feasibility of [[copyright]] as a means to ensure [[royalties]] are paid to copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Oliver. (2015). "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/09/why-it-is-crucial-that-the-publishing-industry-embrace-fan-fiction.html Why Fan Fiction is the Future of Publishing]."
''The Daily Beast''. The Daily Beast Company LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[digital libraries]] such as [[Project Gutenberg]] make [[public domain]] texts more readily available. The combination of inexpensive home computers, the Internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction, such as interactive [[computer game]]s or computer-generated comics. Countless forums for [[fan fiction]] can be found online, where loyal followers of specific [[fictional realm]]s create and distribute derivative stories. The Internet is also used for the development of [[blog fiction]], where a story is delivered through a [[blog]] either as flash fiction or serial [[blog]], and [[collaborative fiction]], where a story is written sequentially by different authors, or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a [[wiki]].

Types of [[literary fiction]] in [[prose]] include:&lt;ref&gt;Milhorn, H. Thomas. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1AM825Ny4v0C&amp;pg Writing Genre Fiction: A Guide to the Craft]''. Universal Publishers: Boca Raton. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Short story]]: A work of at least 2,000 words but under 7,500 words. The boundary between a long short story and a novella is vague.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms'' (1992). London: Penguin Books, 1999, p. 600.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novella]]: A work of at least 7,500 words but under 50,000 words. [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) is an example of a [[novella]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/topic/Heart-of-Darkness Heart of Darkness Novella by Conrad] – ''Encyclopædia Britannica'',&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Novel]]: A work of 50,000 words or more.

== Genre fiction ==
{{main|Genre fiction}}

Fiction is commonly broken down into a variety of [[list of fictional genres|genres]]: subsets of fiction, each differentiated by a particular unifying [[Tone (literature)|tone or style]], [[literary technique#literary techniques|narrative technique]], [[content (media)|media content]], or popularly defined criterion. [[Science fiction]], for example, predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the work's creation: [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' was published in 1865 and only in 1969 did astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]] first land on the moon.

[[Historical fiction]] places imaginary characters into real historical events. In the early historical novel ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s fictional character Edward Waverley meets a figure from history, [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]], and takes part in the [[Battle of Prestonpans]]. Some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story, or a reconstructed biography.&lt;ref name="The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies"/&gt; Often, even when the fictional story is based on fact, there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting. An example is Tim O'Brien's ''[[The Things They Carried]]'', a series of [[short stories]] about the [[Vietnam War]].

Fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural, magical, or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of [[fantasy]], including [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice In Wonderland]]'', [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies.&lt;ref name="C. Hugh Holman 1990, p. 212"/&gt;

==Literary fiction==
{{main|Literature|Literary fiction}}

[[Literary fiction]] is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having [[literary merit]], from most commercial or [[genre fiction|"genre" fiction]].

[[Neal Stephenson]] has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, he suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor ''Slashdot Interview'' from 20 October 2004 with Neal Stephenson]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit".{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', he argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from 14 June 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary fiction often involves [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}} In general it focuses on "introspective, in-depth character studies" of "interesting, complex and developed" characters.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=7}} This contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|pp=181–82}} Usually in literary fiction the focus is on the "inner story" of the characters who drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit "emotional involvement" in the reader.{{sfn|Coles|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=8}} The [[Style (fiction)|style]] of literary fiction is often described as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}} The [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction,{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way".{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}}

== Realism{{anchor|Reality_and_fiction}} ==
{{See also|Literary realism}}

Realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic [[setting (narrative)|setting]] (time and location in the world) is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting; non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case, often being set in an entirely [[wikt:alternate universe|imaginary universe]], an [[alternative history]] of the world other than that currently understood as true, or some other non-existent location or time-period, sometimes even presenting [[impossible technology]] or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature. However, all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas, issues, or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting, or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality, though still distinct from it.{{refn|group=note|As philosopher Stacie Friend explains, "in reading we take works of fiction, like works of non-fiction, to be about the real world—even if they invite us to imagine the world to be different from how it actually is. [Thus], imagining a storyworld does not mean directing one's imagining toward something other than the real world; it is instead a mental activity that involves constructing a complex representation of what a story portrays".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Friend |first=Stacie |year=2017 |title=The Real Foundation of Fictional Worlds |url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/13997/1/13997.pdf |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=95 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.1080/00048402.2016.1149736}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|The research of Weisberg and Goodstein (2009) revealed that, despite not being specifically informed that, say, the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, had two legs, their subjects "consistently assumed that some real-world facts obtained in fiction, although they were sensitive to the kind of fact and the realism of the story."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deena_Weisberg/publication/233656603_What_Belongs_in_a_Fictional_World/links/54aadcd90cf2ce2df668ca52.pdf Weisberg, D.S. &amp; Goodstein, J., "What Belongs in a Fictional World?", ''Journal of Cognition and Culture'', Vol. 9, No. 1, (March 2009), pp. 69–78.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of the traditional separation between fiction and [[non-fiction]], the lines are now commonly understood as blurred, showing more overlap than mutual exclusion. Even fiction usually has elements of, or grounding in, truth. The distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience, according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people, places, and events are all historically or factually real, while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas. The distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding, on the one hand, that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions, while, on the other hand, imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], argues that "fiction is both artifice and [[verisimilitude (narrative)|verisimilitude]]", meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, James. 2008. ''How Fiction Works.'' New York. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; a notion often encapsulated in poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s term: [[willing suspension of disbelief]]. Also, infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality, provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality.&lt;ref name="subversive"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Fictive art''' is a practice that involves the production of objects, events, and entities designed to support the plausibility of a central narrative. Fictive art projects disguise their fictional essence by incorporating materials that stand as evidence for narrative factuality and thus are designed to deceive the viewer as to their ontological status. Very often, these materials take a form that carries presumptive cultural authority, such as 'historical' photographs or 'scientific' data. The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of 'making real' a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence. Since fictive art projects are designed to pass at least temporarily as 'real', fictive artists may draw opprobrium as hoaxers, pranksters, forgers, or con artists when their projects are revealed as fictional.

==History and usage==
The term fictive art was originated by the artists [[Antoinette LaFarge]] and [[Lise Patt]], in the title of a panel at the College Art Association Conference of 2004. It is allied to the terms [[superfiction]] and [[parafiction]] but, unlike both, does not construct the central activity as a departure from (super, para) fiction. Instead, it argues for the primacy of the visual art components, emphasizing the role they play in establishing, extending, and enabling the central narrative. A number of exhibitions in recent years have included examples of fictive art as part of broad explorations of the relationship between media, illusion, and deception; examples include "More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness" at SITE Santa Fe (2012) and "Faking It" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012).

==Examples of fictive art==
Fictive art has antecedents going back several centuries; for example, the 'Rowley' creations of [[Thomas Chatterton]], the 'Formosan' inventions of [[George Psalmanazar]], or the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs. With the rise of mass media in the second half of the 20th century, the practice of fictive art has expanded; it now includes such familiar forms as [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]]. Notable practitioners and projects include David Wilson ([[The Museum of Jurassic Technology]]), [[Kahn &amp; Selesnick|Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick]] (The Circular River), [[Beauvais Lyons]] (The Hokes Archives), [[Joan Fontcuberta]] (Sputnik), [[Eve Andree Laramee]] (Yves Fissiault), and [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] (O-ism).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''"Genre-busting"''' is a term used occasionally in reviews of written work, music and visual art and refers to the author or artist's ability to cross over two or more established styles. For instance, in writing, to combine the horror [[genre]] with a [[Western (genre)|western]] or [[hard-boiled]] detective story with [[science fiction]]. In music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification.

The sound of the term calls to mind other uses of "buster" such as "crime buster", "[[Gangbusters]]", "[[Ghostbusters]]", "[[No. 617 Squadron RAF|Dambusters]]", etc.

Creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of [[literary fiction]]. The publisher [[Atticus Books]] has gone so far as to declare, on their website: ''"We specialize in genre-busting literary fiction—i.e., titles that fall between the cracks of genre fiction and compelling narratives that feature memorable main characters."''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://atticusbooksonline.com/about |title=Atticus Books (about) |publisher=atticusbooksonline.com |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Video Movie Guide 1998'' stated in its foreword, "In past years, reviews in VMG have been broken down into genre categories. Now, by popular demand, we are listing all movies together in alphabetical order.... So many movies today mix genres... and there are no clear-cut categories anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Mick|last2=Porter|first2=Marsha|title=Video Movie Guide 1998|date=October 1997|isbn=978-0345424235|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in ''Mustard'' comedy magazine in 2005, writer [[Alan Moore]] said: "I mean, this is probably a bad thing to say to someone from a comedy magazine, but I don't like genre. I think that genre was made up by some spotty clerk in [[WH Smiths]] in the 1920s to make his worthless fucking job a little easier for him: "it'd be easier if these books said what they were about on the spine."" going on to say: "In the novel I'm writing, Jerusalem, there's an awful lot of funny stuff, and there's supernatural stuff; there's stuff in the prologue that's as good as [[Stephen King]] and it's just a description of my brother walking through a block of flats. It's horror. And there's social history, there's political stuff. Why not mix it all together? Because that's what life is actually like. We laugh, we cry, you know, we buy the t-shirt." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.mustardweb.org/04/page15.htm |title=The Mustard Interview |publisher=mustardweb.org |date=January 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16819">'''Habitat III''', the '''United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development''', took place in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], from 17 – 20 October 2016.

The UN Conferences on Housing (Habitat) are occurring in the bi-decennial cycle (1976, 1996 and 2016). The [[United Nations General Assembly]] decided to convene The Habitat III Conference in its resolution 66/207. The Habitat III Conference reinvigorates the global commitment to sustainable [[urbanization]], to focus on the implementation of a “New Urban Agenda”.

Habitat III was one of the first United Nations global summits after the adoption of the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. It gave the opportunity to open discussions on important urban challenges and questions, such as how to plan and manage [[cities]], [[town]]s and [[village]]s for [[sustainable development]]. The discussion of these questions shape the implementation of new global development and [[climate change]] goals. In particular the conference elaborates on Goal #11 of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]: "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017&gt;Wolfgang Amann &amp; Sandra Jurasszovich, "Habitat III — a critical review of the New Urban Agenda"; ''Housing Finance International'', Spring 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Habitat II]], the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, was held in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] from June 3–14, 1996. The conference outcomes were integrated in the Istanbul Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Istanbul Declaration of Human Settlements [http://unhabitat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/The-Habitat-Agenda-Istanbul-Declaration-on-Human-Settlements-20061.pdf.] "UH-Habitat".

[[Habitat I]] was the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, held in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], May 31 - June 11, 1976, governments began to recognize the need for [[sustainable]] [[human settlements]] and the consequences of rapid [[urbanization]], especially in the developing world. The conference outcomes were integrated the Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements,&lt;ref&gt;The Vancouver Declaration of Human Settlements [http://unhabitat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/The_Vancouver_Declaration_19761.pdf.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; which carried an action plan with 64 recommendations for National Action. The Conference also established the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements - UNCHS (Habitat).

=== Policy reports ===

The process towards Habitat III include the elaboration of national and regional reports -that will converge in a Global Report- to provide evidence based knowledge on the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and a comprehensive analysis on the global state of urbanization as well as good practices and tools both at the policy and intervention level. 

22 stock taking papers on relevant topics, Habitat III Issue Papers,&lt;ref&gt;Issue Papers and Policy Units [http://unhabitat.org/issue-papers-and-policy-units/.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; were developed through a collaborative exercise of the United Nations system coordinated by the Habitat III Secretariat.

A number of official Regional and Thematic High Level Meetings involving a wide range of participants are debating priorities for the New Urban Agenda and policy recommendations in the form of a final participants' declaration. The final declaration from Regional and Thematic meetings will be considered official inputs to the Habitat III process.&lt;ref&gt;Regional and Thematic Meetings for the Preparatory Process of Habitat III [http://unhabitat.org/regional-and-thematic-meetings.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 10 policy papers on relevant topics will be developed by Policy Units&lt;ref&gt;Issue Papers and Policy Units [http://unhabitat.org/issue-papers-and-policy-units/.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; composed of 20 experts each, coming from different geographic areas and constituencies .

=== Engagement===

The debate towards Habitat III is an ongoing process that includes past sessions of the World Urban Forums, especially the last one held in 2014 in [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]], and National Urban Forums&lt;ref&gt;National Urban Forums [http://unhabitat.org/nuf.]"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  to discuss and deliberate on national priority subjects including the preparation of the HIII National Reports.
Beyond the governmental participation in the process through the [[General Assembly]], the engagement to the Conference will include the General Assembly of Partners (GAP) to serve as a broad-based deliberative platform for non-governmental partners in order to develop a consensus for a joined outcome document and other related matters for Habitat III.&lt;ref&gt;How Partners Can Contribute to Habitat III {{cite web |url=http://www.worldurbancampaign.org/how-partners-can-contribute-to-habitat-iii-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906155342/http://www.worldurbancampaign.org/how-partners-can-contribute-to-habitat-iii-2/ |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}"UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Together Towards Habitat III campaign also promote a Global Citizenship Survey (2015/16) to embrace all contributions on the path to the final outcome of the Conference harvested through activities and initiatives to raise awareness on the New Urban Agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Together Towards Habitat III [http://unhabitat.org/together-towards-habitat-iii/ ] "UN-Habitat".Retrieved September 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
At Habitat III, [[SuRe]]® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of sustainability and resilience into infrastructure development and upgrade, was presented by [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] to the broader public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Urban Agenda ==
The primary goal and outcome of the conference was agreement by UN member states on the New Urban Agenda (NUA), which will serve as a guideline for urban development for the next twenty years.&lt;ref name=Broto /&gt;

A "zero draft" of the New Urban Agenda was released in May 2016 and subsequently edited. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] agreed on the final text in September 2016.&lt;ref name=BravoGuaralda2017&gt;Luisa Bravo &amp; Mirko Guaralda, "Our commitment to implement contents related to public space included in the New Urban Agenda adopted at the UN Habitat III conference"; ''Journal of Public Space'' 2(1), 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NUA makes frequent references to related UN agreements, including the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] passed in 1992, and the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]], the [[International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning]], the [[Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction]] (2015–2030), and the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Paris climate agreement]], all issued in 2015.&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt;

The four mechanisms envisioned for effecting the New Urban Agenda are:&lt;ref name=Watson2016&gt;Vanessa Watson, "Locating planning in the New Urban Agenda of the urban sustainable development goal"; ''Planning Theory'' 15(4), 2016; [[doi:10.1177/1473095216660786]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda/ New Urban Agenda]'', Habitat III Secretariat, 2017; A/RES/71/256*; {{ISBN|978-92-1-132731-1}}; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
# National urban policies promoting "integrated systems of cities and human settlements" in furtherance of "sustainable integrated urban development".
# Stronger urban [[governance]] "with sound institutions and mechanisms that empower and include urban stakeholders" along with checks and balances, to promote predictability, social inclusion, economic growth, and environmental protection.
# Reinvigorated "long-term and integrated urban and territorial planning and design in order to optimize the spatial dimension of the urban form and deliver the positive outcomes of urbanization"; and 
# Effective financing frameworks "to create, sustain and share the value generated by sustainable urban development in an inclusive manner."

=== Urban planning ===
[[Urban planning]] is the mechanism by which much of the New Urban Agenda can be accomplished. In particular NUA ¶51 calls for:&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;urban planning and design instruments that support sustainable management and use of natural resources and land, appropriate compactness and density, polycentrism, and mixed uses, through infill or planned urban extension strategies as applicable, to trigger economies of scale and agglomeration, strengthen food system planning, enhance resource efficiency, urban resilience, and environmental sustainability. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ¶66 the parties endorse a [[smart city]] model:&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We commit ourselves to adopting a smart-city approach that makes use of opportunities from digitization, clean energy and technologies, as well as innovative transport technologies, thus providing options for inhabitants to make more environmentally friendly choices and boost sustainable economic growth and enabling cities to improve their service delivery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Right to the city ===
The NUA includes language about a "[[right to the city]]", a debated concept referring to popular control over urban processes, but without definite implications for who will prevail when different parties' interests are in conflict.&lt;ref name=Broto /&gt;

=== Financing ===
The NUA calls for both [[public finance|public]] and [[private sector|private]] financing. Public financing may be derived from the economic gains from urbanization, including land and property value and infrastructure projects. Development funds and [[International financial institutions|development bank]]s are envisioned as "intermediaries for urban financing". (NUA ¶130–153).&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt;

Private funding is envisioned especially for [[real estate]] and [[housing]]; the NUA encourages
&lt;blockquote&gt;the participation of a diverse range of multilateral financial institutions, regional development banks and development finance institutions, cooperation agencies, private-sector lenders and investors, cooperatives, moneylenders and microfinance banks to invest in affordable and incremental housing in all its forms. (NUA ¶140)&lt;ref name=AmannJurasszovich2017 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Henry''' '''(Jindřich, Heinrich) Kulka'''&lt;ref&gt;Like Adolf Loos Henry Kulka was an Anglophile and adopted the preferred name of Henry Kulka since before his emigration to New Zealand. Kulka was a native Czech speaker. German was his second language.&lt;/ref&gt; (29 March 1900 – 9 May 1971) was a Moravian (Czechoslovak) modern architect who was a key figure in the development of ‘Raumplan’ architecture in central Europe between 1919 and 1938. Kulka brought this approach to spatial planning and the Loosian traditions of natural material craftsmanship to modern building in New Zealand (1940–1971) where he was a pioneer of modern architecture.

== Life ==
Henry Kulka was born on 29 March 1900 into a Jewish family in the town of [[Litovel]] near [[Olomouc]] in the Czech Republic (then [[Austria-Hungary]]). His father Moritz owned and ran the village drapery shop. He was the youngest of three children, having two older sisters. Young Henry was sent to Vienna to complete his secondary education after which he studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna. As he found his studies uninspiring he did not complete his degree but preferred to continue his architectural development as a pupil of the pioneer modern architect and ideologue Adolf Loos. He became Loos’s assistant in 1919 and by the end of 1927 ran a joint architectural practice with Loos as full collaborating partner. In 1927 he married Hilda Beran and they had two children, Richard and Elizabeth (Maru). The young couple was active in the rich intellectual life of Vienna of that time.  After Loos died Kulka continued his work in Vienna.  When the Nazis occupied Austria in 1938 Kulka and his family fled to Czechoslovakia where his wife’s family lived. When the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia he managed to travel to England, being forced to leave his family behind. Thanks to warm letters of recommendation from [[Jan Masaryk]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Karin Michaëlis|Karen Michaelis]] he obtained visas for his family and himself to emigrate to New Zealand. After travelling by separate routes he was united with his family in New Zealand. He settled in Auckland where he found employment with the Fletcher Construction Company. He was chief architect at Fletcher’s, designing numerous commercial buildings as well as private residences, until his retirement in 1960. From 1960 to his death in 1971 he designed and realised private houses prolifically. He died in Auckland in 1971 aged 71.

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
In 1919 after a brief period at the Technical University in Vienna, Henry Kulka began his studies at the Building School of the pioneer modern architect Adolf Loos.

Loos emphasized that all architecture should be related to human activity and evolve from it: form follows function. Loos was opposed to unnecessary ornamentation in architecture. He advocated the use of natural unadulterated materials and a respect for skilled craftsmanship. His designs included specifications of internal lining of quality materials such as stone marble and wood. The unique feature of Loos’s design was three dimensional planning later named Raumplan by Kulka and described in Kulka’s words;  “The rooms of his houses are situated on various levels, inter-related in harmonious proportions, space flowing into space, but forming a compact unit. The levels are not bound to a special floor (ground floor, first floor, etc.) and are not the result simply dividing a high room into mezzanine parts. The floors are inter-related rooms with open vistas, the levels connected by steps”&lt;ref&gt;Kulka, Henry ‘Adolf Loos: 1870-1933’, in Architects’ year book 9, ed. by Trevor Dannatt (London: Elek, 1957), pp. 7-29 (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Kulka had an affinity for Loos’s thinking and had an aptitude to three dimensional planning, he became Loos’s assistant and later became his partner, further developing the Raumplan concept.

In 1922 Kulka assisted Loos on the realisation of the first cubic Raumplan house, the [[Rufer House|Villa Rufer]] in Hietzing Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Weissenbacher, Gerhard, ''In Hietzing gebaut'' vol. II (Vienna: Verlag Holzhausen, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1922 and 1923 Kulka designed, autonomously, a cubic Raumplan in smaller cubic dimensions than the Villa Rufer. Kulka's autonomously designed prototype became subsequently known as the Cubic, Dice or Würfelhaus, and was realised in Vienna by Kulka a decade later at 55 Künniglbergasse.&lt;ref&gt;Risselada, Max, ed., ''Raumplan versus Plan Libre'', 2nd English edn. (New York: Rizzoli,1988, repr. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period 1923–1927 Kulka worked between Stuttgart, Vienna and Paris. Loos was based in Paris during this period. Kulka collaborated with Ernst Otto Oswald on the winning entry of the competition to design the Stuttgart Tagblatt Tower, which was built in 1927. In 1927 Kulka spent the year heading Loos’s office in Paris, leading the design of the Villa Moller Raumplan (after Loos and Kulka's colleague Zlatko Neuman had returned to Zagreb), the Paris Knize fashion botique and other unrealised projects such as the famous Raumplan Villa for [[Josephine Baker]]. 
In 1928 Kulka and Loos returned to Vienna and ran an atelier as full collaborating partners. Henry Kulka's wife, Hilda Kulka née Beran, was their practice manager during this period. In the last years of his life Loos was less active due to the deterioration of his health.

During those years the works often attributed to Loos such as the Khuner house of 1929 in Semmering, Austria were principally designed by Kulka. During that period Kulka was also involved in planning [[Villa Müller]] in Prague, and the Wien Werkbund Houses.

In 1930 Kulka authored the seminal monograph on Loos’s work; 'Adolf Loos: The work of the Architect' published by Anton Schroll Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Kulka, Adolf Loos: Das Werk des Architekten, (Vienna: Anton Schroll Verlag, 1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late work in Europe ===
After Loos's death in 1933, Kulka continued and expanded their former architectural practice, maintaining their Vienna office and opening a second satellite office in Hradec Králové in Czechoslovakia to service commissions across Bohemia and Moravia.



Between 1932-1939 Kulka evolved new cubic Raumplan Villa and Apartment typologies. In addition to functionality, Kulka's approach was humanistic. He considered the feelings of  people inhabiting the space of his buildings, striving to give them a sense of harmony and well being.  Among these works are the 1932 Weissmann House in Hietzing Vienna, the 1933 Oskar Semler Raumplan Apartment in Pilsen, the 1934 Kantor Cubic Raumplan Villa in Jablonec, the 1934 small mountain Raumplan for Dr. Samuel Teichner in Spicak in Zelezna Ruda and the Villa Holzner Raumplan in Hronov, near Nachod. A fine example of Kulka’s Raumplan work at this time is the Villa Kantor, 1934. This cubic Raumplan was tailored to the requirements of a medical doctor who needed a functional consulting room nestled within the corpus of a comfortable family home. The exterior envelope of the building is cubic and rendered in fine stucco punctured by symmetrical fenestration in the front façade and a functional asymmetrical positioning of fenestration at the sides of the house. The symmetry of the façade is maintained through the use of a classical wall projection which accommodates internal circulation. The  interior of the Raumplan villa is clad with light colored woods and marble. The house has larger windows than Kulka’s villas with Loos. Kulka lets in more light and incorporates a lighter chromatic selection of cladding materials. It is in the more relaxed and subtle management of spatial transition that the Villa Kantor evolves raumplanning, and points toward changes Kulka would bring to his later work in New Zealand.

=== Work in New Zealand ===
Kulka understood that he could not transplant his European mode of operation to New Zealand.  He adapted remarkably well to the very different conditions of building, which included climate, construction methods, materials and availability of space. The compact style of building which characterized his more vertically oriented European work became less necessary. He retained many elements which characterized his European houses such as built in seating surrounding a fire place, built in furniture in the periphery of rooms, raised dining areas opening on living space and flat roofs. He had an extraordinary sense of quality and recognized the beauty of New Zealand wood, lining his houses with fine wooden paneling.Kulka said that he "wanted the interiors of his houses to look like the inside of a violin." At first his style was considered to be eccentric and provocative by the public but in later years it became emulated by young modern architects.



From 1940 until 1960 Kulka was the chief architect of the Fletcher Construction Company for whom he designed a large number of commercial and public buildings as well as private houses. His designs were diverse: family homes, bungalows, beach houses, bush batches, galleried houses, apartments, libraries, churches and monuments. These were largely realized in New Zealand, although he did build a limited amount of structures through Fletcher Building in Samoa, Tonga and Fiji.  Kulka followed changes to building technology closely and employed these new techniques in his commercial designs. Kulka is estimated to have designed and realized over 100 commercial structures throughout the period of New Zealand's post war industrialization. Characteristic  features of Kulka’s commercial structures include simple, solid facades and the avoidance of structural or decorative exhibitionism. His simple exterior envelopes accorded with a post war mood, which favoured civic modesty and utility. The reception and board rooms of these commercial structures were lined with indigenous wood and stone. Kulka introduced many innovations into his industrial designs including natural lighting and the introduction to New Zealand of the saw tooth factory ceiling. In the E. A Robinson building (1959) Kulka designed a double fenestration system so that offices within the deeper sections of that structure could benefit from internal glass facades which enabled natural light to permeate into these working spaces. In the entrance to Fletcher Building (1941-1942) Kulka designed a dramatic curved staircase lined with light marble and amber native wood.

Privately, Kulka realized over 40 fine wooden houses throughout New Zealand. His wooden houses were innovative in their spatial and material resolution. The Halberstam House in Wellington (1945) is an excellent example of Kulka’s ability to design compact minimal dwellings. The single level bungalow sits on top of a small hill in Wellington. It had a  very modest construction budget and post war building restrictions were imposed on the commissioners. Notwithstanding these constraints, Kulka built a striking cubic bungalow clad with dark stained weather boards on the exterior with the uplifting surprise of a luminous and calming interior consisting of fine honey coloured native wood panels and clean fibrous plaster. In this modest sized family home a small piano nobile is built subtly into the lounge. This niche is separated from the main body of the lounge by the minimal gesture of a bookcase which projects a little into the lounge. A small lowered ceiling above the nobile adds to the sense of separateness, snugness of this sub space.  Built in seating on either side of a fireplace are positioned toward the view of northerly hills, and the light. Cosiness, economy and functionality are brought together to achieve a sense of gentle refinement. Notwithstanding the Halberstam villa’s more modest scale compared to other Kulka Houses in New Zealand, it remains exemplary of the spirit of his work spatially and materially.

Kulka's prolific building throughout New Zealand continues to influence Modern Architecture in New Zealand.

Until the 1980s, [[database]]s were viewed as computer systems that stored record-oriented and business data such as manufacturing inventories, bank records, and sales transactions. A database system was not expected to merge numeric data with text, images, or [[multimedia]] information, nor was it expected to automatically notice patterns in the data it stored. In the late 1980s the concept of an '''intelligent database''' was put forward as a system that manages information (rather than data) in a way that appears natural to users and which goes beyond simple record keeping.

The term was introduced in 1989 by the book ''Intelligent Databases'' by [[Kamran Parsaye]], [[Mark Chignell]], Setrag Khoshafian and [[Harry Wong]]. The concept postulated three levels of intelligence for such systems: high level tools, the [[user interface]] and the [[database engine]]. The high level tools manage data quality and automatically discover relevant patterns in the data with a process called [[data mining]]. This layer often relies on the use of [[artificial intelligence]] techniques. The user interface uses [[hypermedia]] in a form that uniformly manages text, images and numeric data. The intelligent database engine supports the other two layers, often merging [[relational database]] techniques with [[object-oriented programming|object orientation]].

In the twenty-first century, intelligent databases have now become widespread, e.g. hospital databases can now call up patient histories consisting of charts, text and x-ray images just with a few mouse clicks, and many corporate databases include [[decision support]] tools based on sales pattern analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6837">[[Image:Karl Lachmann - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|Karl Lachmann.]]
'''Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaxman|lang}}; 4 March 1793 – 13 March 1851) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philologist]] and [[critic]]. He is particularly noted for his foundational contributions to the field of [[textual criticism]].

==Biography==

Lachmann was born in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], in present-day [[Lower Saxony]]. He studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], devoting himself mainly to philological studies. In [[Göttingen]], he founded a critical and philological society in 1811, in conjunction with [[Georg Ludolf Dissen|Dissen]], [[Ernst Schulze (poet)|Schulze]], and [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen|Bunsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ADB|17|471|481|Lachmann, Karl|Wilhelm Scherer|ADB:Lachmann, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, he joined the [[Prussian army]] as a volunteer ''[[chasseur]]'' and accompanied his detachment to [[Paris]], but did not see active service. In 1816, he became an assistant master in the Friedrichswerder [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at Berlin, and a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the university. The same summer he became one of the principal masters in the Friedrichs-Gymnasium of [[Königsberg]], where he assisted his colleague, the Germanist [[Friedrich Karl Köpke]], with his edition of [[Rudolf von Ems]]' ''[[Barlaam und Josaphat]]'' (1818), and also assisted his friend in a contemplated edition of the works of [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

In January 1818, he became professor extraordinarius of classical philology in the [[University of Königsberg]], and at the same time began to lecture on [[Old German]] [[grammar]] and the [[Middle High German]] poets. He devoted himself during the following seven years to an extraordinarily detailed study of those subjects, and in 1824, obtained a leave of absence in order to search the libraries of middle and south Germany for further materials.

In 1825, Lachmann was nominated extraordinary professor of classical and German philology at the [[Humboldt University]], Berlin (ordinary professor 1827); in 1830, he was admitted a member of the [[Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[Berlin]].

==Importance in scholarship==

Lachmann is a figure of considerable importance in the history of German philology.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Rudolf von Raumer]], ''Geschichte der germanischen Philologie'', 1870.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Lachmann translated the first volume of P.E. Müller's ''Sagabibliothek des skandinavischen Altertums'' (1816). In his ''"Habilitationsschrift" über die ursprungliche Gestalt des Gedichts von der Nibelungen Noth'' (1816), and in his review of [[Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen|Hagen]]'s ''Nibelungen'' and [[Georg Friedrich Benecke|Benecke]]'s ''Bonerius'', contributed in 1817 to the ''Jenaische Literaturzeitung'', he had already laid down the rules of [[textual criticism]] and elucidated the phonetic and metrical principles of Middle High German in a manner which marked a distinct advance in that branch of investigation.

The rigidly scientific character of his method becomes increasingly apparent in the ''Auswahl aus den hochdeutschen Dichtern des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts'' (1820); in the edition of [[Hartmann von Aue|Hartmann]]'s ''Iwein'' (1827); in those of Walther von der Vogelweide (1827) and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] (1833); in the papers "''Über das [[Hildebrandslied]]''," "''Über althochdeutsche Betonung und Verskunst''," "''Über den Eingang des Parzivals''," and "''Über drei Bruchstücke niederrheinischer Gedichte''" published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy; and in ''Der Nibelunge Not und die Klage'' (1826), which was followed by a critical commentary in 1836.

Lachmann's ''Betrachtungen über Homer's Iliad'', first published in the ''Abhandlungen'' of the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841, in which he sought to show that the ''[[Iliad]]'' consists of eighteen independent "layers" variously enlarged and interpolated, had considerable influence on 19th century [[Homeric scholarship]], although his views are no longer accepted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

His smaller edition of the [[New Testament]] appeared in 1831, the 3rd edition in 1846, and the larger second edition, in two volumes, between 1842 and 1850. The plan of Lachmann's edition, which he explained in his ''Studia Krit.'' of 1830, is a modification of the unaccomplished project of [[Richard Bentley]]. Lachmann was the first major editor to break from the [[Textus Receptus]], seeking to restore the most ancient reading current in [[manuscript]]s of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], using the agreement of the [[Western text-type|Western]] authorities ([[Old Latin]] and Greek Western [[Uncial]]s) as the main proof of antiquity of a reading where the oldest Alexandrian authorities differ.

Lachmann's edition of [[Lucretius]] (1850), which was the principal occupation of his life from 1845, is perhaps his greatest achievement of scholarship. He demonstrated how the three main manuscripts all derived from one [[archetype]], containing 302 pages of 26 lines to a page. Further, he was able to show that this archetype was a copy of a manuscript written in a [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] hand, which was in turn a copy of a manuscript of the 4th or 5th centuries written in [[rustic capitals]]. To say his recreation of the text was accepted is anticlimactic; [[Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro|HAJ Munro]] characterized this accomplishment as "a work which will be a landmark for scholars as long as the Latin language continues to be studied." Lachmann also edited [[Propertius]] (1816); [[Catullus]] (1829); [[Tibullus]] (1829); [[Joseph Genesius|Genesius]] (1834); [[Terentianus Maurus]] (1836); [[Babrius]] (1845); [[Avianus]] (1845); [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (1841–1842); the ''Agrimensores Romani'' (1848–1852); and [[Lucilius]] (edited after his death by [[Johannes Vahlen|Vahlen]], 1876). He also translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s sonnets (1820) and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1829).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2672">The '''Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research''' in [[Dresden]] (German: Leibniz-Institut für Festkörper- und Werkstoffforschung Dresden) – in short [[IFW Dresden]] – is a non-university research institute and a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]]. It is concerned with modern materials science and combines explorative research in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]] with technological development of new materials and products.

==Research==
The IFW’s research program is jointly set up and implemented by scientists of the different IFW institutes. It comprises the following five research areas:

* [[Superconductivity]] &amp; [[superconductors]]
* [[Magnetism]] and [[magnetic materials]]
* Molecular [[Nanostructure]]s and [[Molecular solid]]s
* Metastable alloys
* Stress-driven architectures and phenomena

==Research institutes==
The IFW consists of five research institutes
*Institute for Solid State Research, Director: Prof. Dr. [[Bernd Büchner]]
*Institute for Metallic Materials, Director: Prof. Dr. [[Kornelius Nielsch]]
*Institute for Complex Materials, Director:  Dr. [[Thomas Gemming]] (temp.)
*Institute for Integrative Nanosciences, Director: Prof. Dr. [[Oliver G. Schmidt]]
*Institute for Theoretical Solid State Physics,  Director: Prof. Dr. [[Jeroen van den Brink]]

==History==
The IFW Dresden was founded on January 1, 1992 transforming the former  Academy Institute to an Institute of the ‘Blaue Liste’. It emerged from the largest materials science center of the former GDR, which was at the time already internationally acknowledged. Since then the IFW developed into a leading institute in selected topics of materials science.

At present the IFW employs about 400 people, among them 190 scientists, mostly physicists, chemists and materials engineers. 80 of them are young scientists working in the IFW on their doctoral thesis. About 100 guest scientists from all over the world come every year for some weeks or months to work at the IFW. The annual budget of 23 Million Euro is supplied by the Federal government and by the German states in equal parts, the latter mainly by the Free State of Saxony. Additionally to institutional funding the IFW Dresden raises project resources of about 5 Million Euro per year.

In [[applied mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''local optimum''' of an [[optimization problem]] is a solution that is optimal (either [[maxima and minima|maximal or minimal]]) within a [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighboring set]] of candidate solutions. This is in contrast to a [[global optimum]], which is the optimal solution among [[solution space|all possible solutions]], not just those in a particular neighborhood of values. 

==Continuous domain==

When the function to be optimized is [[Continuous function|continuous]], it may be possible to employ [[calculus]] to find local optima. If the [[First derivative test|first derivative]] exists everywhere, it can be equated to zero; if the function has an [[Bounded set|unbounded]] [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]], for a point to be a local optimum it is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]] that it satisfy this equation. Then the [[second derivative test]] provides a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient]] condition for the point to be a local maximum or local minimum.

==Search techniques==

[[Local search (optimization)|Local search]] or [[hill climbing]] methods for solving optimization problems start from an initial configuration and repeatedly move to an ''improving neighboring configuration''. A trajectory in search space is generated, which maps an initial point to a local optimum, where local search is stuck (no improving neighbors
are available). The search space is therefore subdivided into [[basin of attraction|basins of attraction]], each consisting of
all initial points which have a given local optimum as the final point of the local search trajectory.
A local optimum can be isolated (surrounded by non-locally-optimal points) or 
part of a [[Plateau (mathematics)|plateau]], a locally optimal region with more than one point of equal value.

If the problem to be solved has all locally optimal points with the same value of the function to be
optimized, local search effectively solves the global problem: finding a local optimum delivers
a globally optimal solution.

The locality of the optimum is dependent on the [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood structure]] as defined by the local search method that is used for optimizing the function.

In many cases, local optima deliver sub-optimal solutions to the global problem, and
a local search method needs to be modified to continue the search
beyond local optimality; see for example [[iterated local search]], [[tabu search]], reactive search optimization, and
[[simulated annealing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">The '''Mierscheid law''' is {{Citation needed span|text=a satirical forecast|date=September 2011}} [[hypothesis]], published in the German magazine ''[[Vorwärts]]'' on 14 July 1983 and attributed to the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]]. It forecasts the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD)'s share of the [[Direct election|popular vote]] based on the size of crude steel production in Western Germany:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/mdbhome/miersja0/mierscheid_gesetz.pdf |title=19 Jahre Mierscheid-Gesetz – ein ungerades Jubiläum und die Aussichten der SPD bei der Bundestagswahl (19 Years of the Mierscheid Law   an odd numbered anniversary and the chances of the SPD in the national parliamentary elections) |accessdate=2007-05-26 |author=Jakob Mierscheid, Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestages |authorlink=Jakob Maria Mierscheid |date=2002-03-20 |format=pdf |publisher=German Parliament,  Platz der Republik, 11011 Berlin |language=German |quote=Die Formulierung des Mierscheid-Gesetzes selber lautet: "Der Stimmenanteil der SPD richtet sich nach dem Index der deutschen Rohstahlproduktion – gemessen in Mio. Tonnen – im jeweiligen Jahr der Bundestagswahl." (The formulation of the Mierscheid Law is as follows: The proportion of votes for the SPD depends on the index of German crude steel production measured in millions of metric tons in the corresponding year.) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707200224/http://www.bundestag.de/mdbhome/miersja0/mierscheid_gesetz.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Vote share of the SPD equals the Index of the crude steel production in the western federal states – measured in millions of tonnes – in the year of the federal election.}}

There is a special rule for early elections. One then has to take the arithmetic mean of the regular and early year of election.

The last corroboration of the law was in the 2002 election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,362874,00.html | title = Warum die SPD die Wahl gewinnt (Why the SPD will win the election) | accessdate = 2007-01-11
| author = Yassin Musharbash| date = 2005-06-29| work = Spiegel Online| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the West German crude steel production was 38.6 million tonnes, and the vote share of the SPD 38.5%. For the early election in 2005 the vote share was 38.4%, with a mean crude steel value of 40.0 million tonnes.  Over the last ten elections, the two values were within two units nine times, and within one unit seven times.

==Possible refutation of the hypothesis in 2005==

In the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal elections]] of 18 September 2005 (which were originally due to be held in 2006), the law appeared not to hold, since the SPD obtained 34.3% of the relevant votes while the crude steel production of the "old" ''Länder'' (i.e. those states that belonged to the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification) in the previous year was 39.9 million [[tonnes]].

However, an article attributed to Jakob Mierscheid, published on the [[Bundestag|German Federal Parliament's]] website provided a correction to the hypothesis, to take account of the special situation. Since the elections had been brought forward, it was argued that the last months of the year should be discounted, yielding a steel production figure of 33.5 million tonnes. The graph included in the article showed a good match, thus supporting the (corrected) hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| title = Vorläufige Hypothese zum Mierscheid-Gesetz (Preliminary hypothesis on the Mierscheid Law)| accessdate = 2007-01-11| author = The legendary Jakob Mierscheid, MdB| authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid| date = 2005-12-13| format = pdf| work = | publisher = Official Web site of the German Bundestag| language = German| quote = | deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012233/http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/mierscheid/2005_12_05_hypothese.pdf| archivedate = 2008-09-11| df = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypothesis alteration might be considered an example of the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]].

Following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 elections]], an article was published by the statistical office of the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]] attempting to further refine the model in the form of the Mierscheid-Walla law. This article also mentions promising but inconclusive attempts to replace steel production with other measures that exhibited a degree of apparent [[correlation]], such as the export value of automobiles, employment levels in the field of legal advice, the price of coffee, and the number of accidents on town roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | title = Das Mierscheid-Walla-Gesetz (The Mierscheid-Walla Law) | accessdate = 2007-01-11 | author = Jakob Maria Mierscheid (the legend) | authorlink = Jakob Maria Mierscheid | author2 = Wolfgang Walla | date = March 2006 | format = pdf | work = Statistisches Monatsheft Baden-Württemberg 3/2006 | publisher = Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder (Statistical offices of the German federal government and the states) | language = German | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080911012231/http://www.statistik-portal.de/Veroeffentl/Monatshefte/PDF/Beitrag06_03_09.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Missions Héliographiques''' was a 19th-century project to photograph landmarks and monuments around France so that they could be restored.

The project was established by [[Prosper Mérimée]], France's Inspector General of Historical Monuments and author of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', in 1851.  The intent was to supplement [[Monument historique]], a program Mérimée started in 1837 to classify, protect and restore [[France|French]] landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Rosenblum|Rosenblum, Naomi]]. "Documentation: Landscape and Architecture." ''A World History of Photography.'' Ed. Walton Rawls and Nancy Grubb. 3rd ed. New York: Abbeville Press, 1997. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Mérimée hired [[Edouard Baldus]], [[Hippolyte Bayard]], [[Gustave Le Gray]], [[Henri Le Secq]] and [[Auguste Mestral]] &lt;ref name="Rosenblum, p. 100"&gt;Rosenblum, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; to carry out the photography, with the aim that architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] could eventually restore them.

Although the [[daguerrotype]] originated in [[France]], Mérimée preferred the [[calotype]], which offered more detailed textures.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Marianne. European Architecture. J 362E. Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas. 31 Jan. 2008.{{vague|date=December 2010}}&lt;!-- What is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GustaveLeGray.jpg|thumb|right|Central Portal of the Church of Saint-Jacques, [[Aubeterre-sur-Dronne|Aubeterre]] - Gustave Le Gray (1851)|390x390px]]

Mestral and Le Gray photographed areas southwest from [[Paris]], Le Secq the north and east. Bayard, who chose to work with glass negatives instead of paper, went west to [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]].  Baldus covered the south and east, including the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/heli/hd_heli.htm Mission Héliographique, 1851 | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While several of the images are classic examples of early photography, the overall results did not meet requirements, often portraying the decaying buildings artistically and obscuring their need for restoration.&lt;ref name="Rosenblum, p. 100"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemagny|first=Jean-Claude|title=A History of Photography: Social and Cultural Perspectives|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-34407-7|pages=55–56|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mycorrhiza''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μύκης ''mýkēs'', "fungus", and ῥίζα ''rhiza'', "root"; pl. '''mycorrhizae''', '''mycorrhiza''' or '''mycorrhizas''') is a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] association between a [[fungus]] and the roots of a [[vascular plant|vascular host plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kirk |first=P.

Mycorrhizae play important roles in [[soil life|soil biology]] and [[soil chemistry]].

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant's root tissues, either [[intracellular]]ly as in [[arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] (AMF or AM), or [[extracellular]]ly as in [[Mycorrhiza#Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] fungi. The association is generally [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], but in particular species or in particular circumstances, mycorrhizae may be variously [[Parasitism|parasitic]] in the host plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=NC|last2=Graham|first2=JH|last3=Smith|first3=FA|title=Functioning of mycorrhizal associations along the mutualism–parasitism continuum|journal=[[New Phytologist]]|date=1997|doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00729.x|volume=135|issue=4|pages=575–585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A mycorrhiza is the symbiotic association between a green plant and a fungus. The plant captures the energy coming from the sun by means of its chlorophyll and supplies it to the fungus, and the fungus supplies water and mineral nutrients taken from the soil to the plant. Mycorrhizas are located in the roots of the plant. Most plant species form mycorrhizal associations, though some families like [[Brassicaceae]] and [[Chenopodiaceae]] cannot. There is fossil evidence that early land plants formed arbuscular mycorrhizal associations.&lt;ref name="Remy et al."/&gt; Different forms for the association are detailed in the next section. The most common is the arbuscular type that is present in 70% of plant species, including many crop plants such as wheat and rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fortin and others|first1=J. André|title=Les Mycorhizes|date=2015|publisher=Inra|location=Versaillles|isbn=978-2-7592-2433-3|page=10|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Image:Wheat field.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wheat]] is [[arbuscular mycorrhiza]]l ]]

Mycorrhizas are commonly divided into ''ectomycorrhizas'' and ''endomycorrhizas''. The two types are differentiated by the fact that the hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual [[cell (biology)|cells]] within the root, while the [[hypha]]e of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;Harley, J.L. and S.E.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Endomycorrhiza includes ''arbuscular'', ''ericoid'', and ''orchid mycorrhiza'', while ''arbutoid mycorrhizas'' can be classified as ''ectoendomycorrhizas''. ''Monotropoid'' mycorrhizas form a special category.

===Arbuscular mycorrhiza===
{{Main|Arbuscular mycorrhiza}}
Endomycorrhizas are variable and have been further classified as arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid mycorrhizas.&lt;ref name="Peterson et al. 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Peterson |first=R.

The fungal [[hyphae]] do not in fact penetrate the [[protoplast]] (i.e. the interior of the cell), but invaginate the [[cell membrane]]. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the hypha and the cell [[cytoplasm]] to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them.

===Ectomycorrhiza===
[[Image:Grib skov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beech]] is [[ectomycorrhiza]]l ]]

{{Main|Ectomycorrhiza}}

Ectomycorrhizas, or EcM, are typically formed between the roots of around 10% of plant families, mostly woody plants including the [[Betulaceae|birch]], [[Dipterocarpaceae|dipterocarp]], [[Myrtaceae|eucalyptus]], [[Fagaceae|oak]], [[Pinaceae|pine]], and [[Rosaceae|rose]]&lt;ref name=Wang2006/&gt; families, [[Orchidaceae#Ecology|orchids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esciencenews.com/articles/2011/07/12/orchids.and.fungi.an.unexpected.case.symbiosis |title=Orchids and fungi: An unexpected case of symbiosis|date=July 12, 2011 |website= |publisher=American Journal of Botany |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungi belonging to the [[Basidiomycota]], [[Ascomycota]], and [[Zygomycota]]. Some EcM fungi, such as many ''[[Leccinum]]'' and ''[[Suillus]]'', are symbiotic with only one particular genus of plant, while other fungi, such as the ''[[Amanita]]'', are generalists that form mycorrhizas with many different plants.&lt;ref name=bak04/&gt;  An individual tree may have 15 or more different fungal EcM partners at one time.&lt;ref name=saari04/&gt; Thousands of ectomycorrhizal fungal species exist, hosted in over 200 genera. A recent study has conservatively estimated global ectomycorrhizal fungal species richness at approximately 7750 species, although, on the basis of estimates of knowns and unknowns in macromycete diversity, a final estimate of ECM species richness would probably be between 20000 and 25000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinaldi |first1=A.C. |last2=Comandini |first2=O.|last3=Kuyper |first3=T.W. |date=2008 |title=Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity: separating the wheat from the chaff |journal=Fungal Diversity |volume=33 |pages=1–45|url=http://www.fungaldiversity.org/fdp/sfdp/33-1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ectomycorrhizas consist of a hyphal sheath, or mantle, covering the root tip and a [[Hartig net]] of hyphae surrounding the plant cells within the root [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]]. In some cases the hyphae may also penetrate the plant cells, in which case the mycorrhiza is called an ectendomycorrhiza. Outside the root, [[Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium]] forms an extensive network within the soil and leaf litter.

Nutrients can be shown to move between different plants through the fungal network. Carbon has been shown to move from [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] trees into [[Coast Douglas-fir|Douglas-fir]] trees thereby promoting [[Ecological succession|succession]] in [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simard |first=Suzanne W. |last2=Perry |first2=David A. |last3=Jones |first3=Melanie D. |last4=Myrold |first4=David D. |last5=Durall |first5=Daniel M. |last6=Molina |first6=Randy |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Net transfer of carbon between ectomycorrhizal tree species in the field |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6642 |date=1997 |pages=579–582 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v388/n6642/full/388579a0.html |doi=10.1038/41557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ectomycorrhizal fungus ''[[Laccaria bicolor]]'' has been found to lure and kill [[springtail]]s to obtain nitrogen, some of which may then be transferred to the mycorrhizal host plant. In a study by Klironomos and Hart, [[Eastern White Pine]] inoculated with ''L. bicolor'' was able to derive up to 25% of its nitrogen from springtails.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710035451/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_14_159/ai_104730213/ Fungi kill insects and feed host plants] BNET.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klironomos |first1=J.

The first genomic sequence for a representative of symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete  ''[[Laccaria bicolor]]'', has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=F. |date=2008 |title=The genome of ''Laccaria bicolor'' provides insights into mycorrhizal symbiosis |doi=10.1038/nature06556 |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7183 |pages=88–92 |pmid=18322534 |first2=A. |last3=Ahrén |first3=D. |last4=Brun |first4=A. |last5=Danchin |first5=E.

Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizal root tips suggesting a role in the partner communication.  ''[[Laccaria bicolor]]'' is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells during the root colonisation. By contrast,  ''[[Laccaria bicolor]]'' possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins. This genome analysis revealed the dual [[saprotrophic]] and [[biotrophic]] lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots.

===Ericoid mycorrhiza===

{{Main|Ericoid mycorrhiza}}
Ericoid mycorrhizas are the third of the three more ecologically important types. They have a simple intraradical (grow in cells) phase, consisting of dense coils of hyphae in the outermost layer of root cells. There is no periradical phase and the extraradical phase consists of sparse hyphae that don't extend very far into the surrounding soil. They might form sporocarps (probably in the form of small cups), but their reproductive biology is little understood.&lt;ref name="Allen, Michael F 1991"/&gt;

Ericoid mycorrhizas have also been shown to have considerable [[saprotrophic]] capabilities, which would enable plants to receive nutrients from not-yet-decomposed materials via the decomposing actions of their ericoid partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Read |first=D.

===Arbutoid mycorrhiza===

This type of mycorrhiza involves plants of the Ericaceae subfamily [[Arbutoideae]]. It is however different from ericoid mycorrhiza and resembles ectomycorrhiza, both functionally and in terms of the fungi involved.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The difference to ectomycorrhiza is that some hyphae actually penetrate into the root cells, making this type of mycorrhiza an ''ectendomycorrhiza''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Monotropoid mycorrhiza===
{{Main|Myco-heterotrophy}}
This type of mycorrhiza occurs in the subfamily [[Monotropoideae]] of the [[Ericaceae]], as well as several genera in the [[Orchidaceae]]. These plants are [[heterotrophic]] or [[mixotrophic]] and derive their carbon from the fungus partner. This is thus a non-mutualistic, [[Parasitism|parasitic]] type of mycorrhizal symbiosis.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Orchid mycorrhiza===

{{Main|Orchid mycorrhiza}}

All [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] are [[myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophic]] at some stage during their lifecycle and form [[orchid mycorrhiza]]s with a range of basidiomycete fungi.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Their hyphae penetrate into the root cells and form pelotons (coils) for nutrient exchange.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Mutualist dynamics==
Mycorrhizal fungi form a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the roots of most plant species. In such a relationship, both the plants themselves and those parts of the roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or are absolutely dependent on mycorrhizae. The [[Orchidaceae]] are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds.&lt;ref name=Trappe1987&gt;{{Cite book |last=Trappe |first=J. M. |date=1987 |title=Phylogenetic and ecologic aspects of mycotrophy in the angiosperms from an evolutionary standpoint |work=Ecophysiology of VA Mycorrhizal Plants, G.R. Safir (EDS) |publisher=CRC Press |location=Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research into [[ectomycorrhizal]] plants in [[boreal forests]] has indicated that mycorrhizal fungi and plants have a relationship that may be more complex than simply mutualistic. This relationship was noted when mycorrhizal fungi were unexpectedly found to be hoarding nitrogen from plant roots in times of nitrogen scarcity. Researchers argue that some mycorrhizae distribute nutrients based upon the environment with surrounding plants and other mycorrhizae. They go on to explain how this updated model could explain why mycorrhizae do not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation, and why plants can switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines.&lt;ref name="pmid24824576"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Franklin O | author2=Näsholm T | author3=Högberg P | author4=Högberg MN| title=Forests trapped in nitrogen limitation - an ecological market perspective on ectomycorrhizal symbiosis | journal=New Phytol | date= 2014 | volume=  203| issue=  2| pages=  657–66| pmid=24824576 | doi=10.1111/nph.12840 | pmc= 4199275| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=24824576  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships can explain much more variation in the strength of mycorrhizal mutualisms than ecological factors.&lt;ref name="Hoeksema2018" /&gt;

===Sugar-water/mineral exchange===
[[File:Mycorrhiza (6).svg|thumb|The diagram demonstrates the mutualistic relationship between plants and their mycorrhiza, which is a fungus that helps plants take in key nutrients. The left side of this diagram shows the plant pathway of this relationship, where the host plant transfers between 4% to 20% of its photosynthetically fixed carbon, which is labeled “G” in this image because it represents glucose, to the mycorrhiza. On the right side of this diagram, the arbuscular mycorrhiza pathway, which branches off from the plant root, which is the brown cylinder-like figure in the image, provides the plant with nutrients, including, most importantly, phosphate and nitrogen. My reference source for this information is: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/P-uptake-of-the-plant-via-the-plant-pathway-or-mycorrhizal-pathway-Abbreviations_fig3_231104516]]

The mycorrhizal mutualistic association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to [[carbohydrate]]s, such as [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]].&lt;ref name="Harrison MJ."&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harrison MJ|date= 2005|title=Signaling in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis|journal=Annu Rev Microbiol|volume=59|pages=19–42|pmid=16153162 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123749}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue and on to the plant's fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the [[mycelium]]'s higher absorptive capacity for water and mineral nutrients, partly because of the large surface area of fungal hyphae, which are much longer and finer than plant [[root hair]]s, and partly because some such fungi can mobilize soil minerals unavailable to the plants' roots. The effect is thus to improve the plant's mineral absorption capabilities.&lt;ref name="Selosse"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Selosse MA |author2=Richard F |author3=He X |author4=Simard SW|date= 2006|title=Mycorrhizal networks: des liaisons dangereuses?|journal=Trends Ecol.

Unaided plant roots may be unable to take up [[nutrient]]s that are chemically or physically [[Immobilization (soil science)|immobilised]]; examples include [[phosphate]] [[ions]] and [[micronutrient]]s such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high [[clay]] content, or soils with a strongly [[pH|basic pH]]. The [[mycelium]] of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Li H |author2= Smith SE |author3=Holloway RE, Zhu Y |author4=Smith FA.|date= 2006|title=Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute to phosphorus uptake by wheat grown in a phosphorus-fixing soil even in the absence of positive growth responses|journal=New Phytol.|volume=172|pages=536–543|pmid=17083683 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01846.x|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, many plants are able to obtain phosphate, without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some [[dystrophic]] forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal [[hypha]]e acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

In some more complex relationships, mycorrhizal fungi do not just collect immobilised soil nutrients, but connect individual plants together by [[mycorrhizal networks]] that transport water, carbon, and other nutrients directly from plant to plant through underground hyphal networks.&lt;ref name=Simard2012&gt;Simard, S.W.; Beiler, K.J.; Bingham, M.A.; Deslippe, J.R.; Philip, L.J. and Teste, F.P. 2012.

''[[Suillus tomentosus]]'', a [[basidiomycete]] fungus, produces specialized structures known as tuberculate ectomycorrhizae with its plant host [[lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'' var. ''latifolia'').  These structures have been shown to host [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing]] [[bacteria]] which contribute a significant amount of [[nitrogen]] and allow the pines to colonize nutrient-poor sites.&lt;ref name=paul07/&gt;

===Mechanisms===
[[File:Raudonvirsis1-vi.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]'', an [[Mycorrhiza#Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] fungus]]
The mechanisms by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore soil material that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi differs from that of plants. For example, they may secrete [[organic acid]] that dissolve or [[Chelation|chelate]] many ions, or release them from minerals by [[ion exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cropsoil.psu.edu/sylvia/mycorrhiza.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623051447/http://cropsoil.psu.edu/sylvia/mycorrhiza.htm|date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e33/33b.htm |title=Botany online: Interactions - Plants - Fungi - Parasitic and Symbiotic Relations - Mycorrhiza |publisher=Biologie.uni-hamburg.de |accessdate=2010-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606050759/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e33/33b.htm |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease, drought and salinity resistance and its correlation to mycorrhizae===
Mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne [[pathogen]]s. These associations have been found to assist in plant defense both above and belowground. Mycorrhizas have been found to excrete enzymes that are toxic to soil borne organisms such as nematodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azcón-Aguilar, Barea|first1=C., J.M.|title=Arbuscular mycorrhizas and biological control of soil-borne plant pathogens – an overview of the mechanisms involved|journal=Mycorrhiza|date=29 October 1996|volume=6|issue=6|pages=457–464|doi=10.1007/s005720050147}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have shown that mycorrhizal associations result in a priming effect of plants that essentially acts as a primary immune response. When this association is formed a defense response is activated similarly to the response that occurs when the plant is under attack. As a result of this inoculation, defense responses are stronger in plants with mycorrhizal associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung, Martinez-Medina, Lopez-Raez, Pozo|first1=Sabine C., Ainhoa, Juan A., Maria J.|title=Mycorrhiza-Induced Resistance and Priming of Plant Defenses|journal=J Chem Ecol|date=24 May 2012|volume=38|issue=6|pages=651–664|doi=10.1007/s10886-012-0134-6|pmid=22623151|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance to toxicity===
Fungi have been found to have a protective role for plants rooted in soils with high metal concentrations, such as [[Soil pH|acidic]] and [[Soil contamination|contaminated soils]]. [[Pinus|Pine]] trees inoculated with ''[[Pisolithus tinctorius]]'' planted in several contaminated sites displayed high tolerance to the prevailing contaminant, survivorship and growth.&lt;ref name=paul_tam/&gt; One study discovered the existence of ''[[Suillus luteus]]'' strains with varying tolerance of [[zinc]]. Another study discovered that zinc-tolerant strains of ''[[Suillus bovinus]]'' conferred resistance to plants of ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]''. This was probably due to binding of the metal to the extramatricial [[mycelium]] of the fungus, without affecting the exchange of beneficial substances.&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt;

'''Negative-bias temperature instability''' ('''NBTI''') is a key reliability issue in [[MOSFET]]s. NBTI manifests as an increase in the [[threshold voltage]] and consequent decrease in drain current and [[transconductance]] of a MOSFET. The degradation exhibits a [[power law|power-law]] dependence on time. It is of immediate concern in p-channel [[MOSFET|MOS]] devices (pMOS), since they almost always operate with negative gate-to-source voltage; however, the very same mechanism also affects nMOS transistors when biased in the accumulation regime, i.e. with a negative bias applied to the gate.

== Physics ==
The details of the mechanisms of NBTI have been debated, but two effects are believed to contribute: trapping of positively charged [[Electron hole|holes]], and generation of interface states. 

* preexisting traps located in the bulk of the dielectric are filled with holes coming from the channel of pMOS. Those traps can be emptied when the stress voltage is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time.
* interface traps are generated, and these interface states become positively charged when the pMOS device is biased in the "on" state, i.e. with negative gate voltage.  Some interface states may become deactivated when the stress is removed, so that the Vth degradation can be recovered over time. 

The existence of two coexisting mechanisms has resulted in scientific controversy over the relative importance of each component, and over the mechanism of generation and recovery of interface states. 

In sub-micrometer devices [[nitrogen]] is incorporated into the silicon [[gate oxide]] to reduce the gate leakage current density and prevent [[boron]] penetration. It is known that incorporating nitrogen enhances NBTI. For new technologies (45&amp;nbsp;nm and shorter nominal channel lengths), [[high-K]] metal gate stacks are used as an alternative to improve the gate current density for a given equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). Even with the introduction of new materials like hafnium oxides, NBTI remains.

With the introduction of high K metal gates, a new degradation mechanism appeared, referred to as PBTI (for positive bias temperature instabilities), which affects nMOS transistor when positively biased. In this case, no interface states are generated and 100% of the Vth degradation may be recovered.

The "'''New Perspective on Paul'''" represents a significant shift since the 1960s in the way some scholars, especially [[Protestant]] scholars, interpret the writings of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]].

Paul, especially in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], advocates justification through faith in [[Jesus Christ]] over justification through works of the Law. In the historic [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] perspective, known as ''[[sola fide]]'', theologians understood Paul as arguing that Christians’ [[good works]] would not factor into their [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] &amp;ndash; only their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] would count. But according to the “new perspective”, Paul was not addressing good works in general, but instead questioning only observances such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], and Sabbath laws, which were the ‘boundary markers’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The New Perspective on Paul|last = Dunn|first = James D. G.|publisher = Eerdmans Publishing Co.|year = 2005|isbn = 978-0-8028-4562-7|location = Grand Rapids|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that set the Jews apart from the other nations. This grew from the work of [[E. P. Sanders]], ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism'', published in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Paul and Palestinian Judaism|last = Sanders|first = E. P.|publisher = Fortress Press|year = 1977 |isbn = 978-0-8006-1899-5|location = Minneapolis|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders saw the Jews of Pauline times not as a “legalistic community”, nor as oriented to “salvation by works”. For Sanders, the Jews felt they were saved as they were God's chosen people. By being God's chosen people they were under his [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]]. The Jews kept [[Torah|the Law]] to remain under the covenant &amp;ndash; the Law was not a way of entering the covenant but of staying within the covenant.

==Development==
Since the [[Protestant Reformation]] (c. 1517), studies of [[Pauline epistles|Paul’s writings]] have been heavily influenced by [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] views that are said to ascribe the negative attributes that they associated with [[Christianity in the 16th century|sixteenth-century Roman Catholicism]] to [[Second Temple Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} These Lutheran and Reformed views on Paul's writings are called “the old perspective” by adherents of the “new perspective on Paul”. The “new perspective” is an attempt to lift Paul's letters out of the Lutheran-Reformed framework and interpret them based on what is said to be an understanding of first-century Judaism, taken on its own terms.

In 1963 the Lutheran theologian [[Krister Stendahl]] published a paper arguing that the typical Lutheran view of the Apostle Paul’s theology did not fit with statements in [[Pauline Epistles|Paul’s writings]], and in fact was based more on mistaken [[Pauline Christianity|assumptions about Paul’s beliefs]] than careful interpretation of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0017816000024779 |jstor = 1508631 |title = The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West |year=1963 |last =Stendahl |first =Krister |journal= [[Harvard Theological Review]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=199–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendahl warned against imposing modern Western ideas on the Bible, and especially on the works of Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title= The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West |last= Stendahl |first= Krister |date= 1963 |journal= [[Harvard Theological Review]] |volume=56 |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 [[E. P. Sanders]] published ''Paul and Palestinian Judaism''.&lt;ref name="P. Sanders, 1977"&gt;{{Citation |first= EP |last= Sanders | author-link= E. P. Sanders |title= Paul and Palestinian Judaism: A Comparison of Patterns of Religion |publisher= Fortress Press |place= Philadelphia |year= 1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work he studies Jewish literature and Paul’s writings arguing that the traditional Lutheran understanding of the theology of Judaism and Paul was fundamentally incorrect.

Sanders continued to publish books and articles in this field, and was soon joined by the scholar [[James D. G. Dunn]]. Dunn reports that Anglican theologian [[N.T. Wright]] was the first to use the term “new perspective on Paul” in his 1978 Tyndale Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;[[N.T. Wright]], {{Google books|id=6i2xvonpvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y|page=11-2|title=Justification: God's Plan and Paul's Vision}}. SPCK, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-281-06090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more widely known after being used by Dunn as the title of his 1982 Manson Memorial Lecture where he summarized and affirmed the movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard N. Longenecker]], {{Google books|id=5Qs54KfN5dIC|page=327|title=Introducing Romans: Critical Issues in Paul's Most Famous Letter}}. Eerdmans, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0802866196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = James D. G. |last =Dunn |authorlink= James Dunn (theologian) |year = 1983 | title = The New Perspective on Paul |journal= Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester |volume=65 | issue =2 |pages=95–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of these writers inspired a large number of scholars to study, discuss, and debate the relevant issues. Many books and articles dealing with the issues raised have since been published. [[N. T. Wright]] has written a large number of works aimed at popularising the “new perspective” outside of academia.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Citation | first = NT | last = Wright | author-link = N. T. Wright | title = What Saint Paul Really Said | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 1997}}{{Page needed|date= December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The “new-perspective” movement is closely connected with a surge of recent scholarly interest in studying the Bible in the context of other ancient texts, and the use of social-scientific methods to understand ancient culture. Scholars affiliated with [[The Context Group]]{{refn|group=note|see: [[Philip Esler|Esler, Philip F.]] ''Conflict and Identity in Romans: The Social Setting of Paul's Letter''. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2003. - [[Bruce J. Malina|Malina, Bruce J.]] &amp; Neyrey, Jerome H., ''Portraits of Paul: An Archaeology of Ancient Personality'', Louisville: John Knox Press, 1996. - Neyrey, Jerome H., ''Paul, in Other Words: A Cultural Reading of His Letters''. Louisville: John Knox Press, 1990.}} have called for various reinterpretations of biblical texts based on studies of the ancient world.

== Main ideas ==
It is often noted that the singular title "the new perspective" gives an unjustified impression of unity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It is a field of study in which many scholars{{who|date=September 2018}} are actively pursuing research and continuously revising their own theories in light of new evidence, and who do not necessarily agree with each other on any given issue. It has been suggested by many that a plural title of "new" perspective''s'' may therefore be more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 2003, N. T. Wright, distancing himself from both Sanders and Dunn, commented that "there are probably almost as many 'new' perspective positions as there are writers espousing it – and I disagree with most of them".&lt;ref name = "NTW NP"&gt;N. T. Wright, ''[http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm New Perspectives].&lt;/ref&gt; There are certain trends and commonalities within the movement, but what is held in common is the belief that the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] are fundamentally incorrect. The following are some of the issues being widely discussed.

=== Works of the Law ===
Paul's letters contain a substantial amount of criticism of "[[Law and Gospel|works of the law]]". The radical difference in these two interpretations of what Paul meant by "works of the law" is the most consistent distinguishing feature between the two perspectives. The historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives interpret this phrase as referring to human effort to do good works in order to meet God's standards ([[Legalism (theology)|Works Righteousness]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In this view, Paul is arguing against the idea that humans can merit salvation from God by their good works alone (note that the "new" perspective agrees that we cannot merit salvation; the issue is what exactly Paul is addressing).

By contrast, new-perspective scholars see Paul as talking about "badges of covenant membership" or criticizing Gentile believers who had begun to rely on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship.&lt;ref&gt;For "badges of covenant membership", see N. T. Wright, ''Paul for Everyone: Romans part one'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2004), 35–41. 5. For reliance on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship, see {{cite journal |last=Eisenbaum |first=Pamela |date=Winter 2004 |title=A Remedy for Having Been Born of Woman: Jesus, Gentiles, and Genealogy in Romans
 |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=671–702 |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/JBL1234.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-26 |doi=10.2307/3268465 |publisher=The Society of Biblical Literature |jstor=3268465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that in Paul's time, Israelites were being faced with a choice of whether to continue to follow their ancestral customs, the [[Torah]] ("the ancestral customs"), or to follow the Roman Empire's trend to adopt Greek customs ([[Hellenization]], see also [[Antinomianism]], [[Hellenistic Judaism]], and [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity]]). The new-perspective view is that Paul's writings discuss the comparative merits of following [[Torah|ancient Israelite]] or [[Athenian Golden Age|ancient Greek customs]]. Paul is interpreted as being critical of a common Jewish view that following traditional Israelite customs makes a person better off before God, pointing out that Abraham was righteous before the Torah was given. Paul identifies customs he is concerned about as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Taboo food#Blood|dietary laws]], and [[Sabbath in Christianity|observance of special days]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James D. 'The New Perspective on Paul', 104, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human effort and good works ===
Due to their interpretation of the phrase "works of the law", theologians of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives see Paul's rhetoric as being against human effort to earn righteousness. This is often cited by Lutheran and Reformed theologians as a central feature of the Christian religion, and the concepts of [[sola gratia|grace alone]] and [[sola fide|faith alone]] are of great importance within the creeds of these denominations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

"New-perspective" interpretations of Paul tend to result in Paul having nothing negative to say about the idea of human effort or good works, and saying many positive things about both. New-perspective scholars point to the many statements in Paul's writings that specify the criteria of [[Last judgment|final judgment]] as being the works of the individual.

{{Quote | Final Judgment According to Works... was quite clear for Paul (as indeed for Jesus). Paul, in company with mainstream second-Temple Judaism, affirms that God’s final judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led – in accordance, in other words, with works. | N. T. Wright&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm | title = New Perspectives on Paul | publisher = 10th Edinburgh Dogmatics Conference |date=August 2003 | first = N. T | last = Wright}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wright however does not hold the view that good works contribute to one's salvation but rather that the final judgment is something we can look forward to as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works are a result of our salvation and the future judgment will show that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.pdf | title = New perspective | last = Wright | first = NT | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Advocates of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives often see this as being "salvation by works", and as a bad thing, contradicting fundamental tenets of Christianity. New-perspective scholars often respond that their views are not so different. For in the perspective of Luther and Calvin, God graciously empowers the individual to the faith which leads to salvation and also to good works, while in the "new" perspective God graciously empowers individuals to the faith and good works, which lead to salvation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== Faith, or faithfulness ===
An ongoing debate related to the "new" perspective has been over Paul's use of the Greek word ''pistis'' (''πίστις'', meaning "trust", "belief", "faith", or "faithfulness"). Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have typically interpreted this word as meaning a [[Faith in Christianity|belief in God and Christ]], and trust in Christ for salvation with faith that he will save you.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This interpretation is based on several passages from the Christian Bible, notably the [[Deutero-Pauline]] epistle to the Ephesians: "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast" (Eph. 2:9). [[E. P. Sanders]] has conceded that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Prentiss Waters, Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul, p. 167, notes "Sanders has conceded to me that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional view."&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, many recent studies of the Greek word ''pistis'' have concluded that its primary and most common meaning was ''faithfulness'', meaning firm commitment in an interpersonal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Campbell, "The Quest For Paul’s Gospel: A Suggested Strategy", 2005, pp. 178–207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=3267114 |pages=461–476 |last1=Hay |first1=D. M. |title=Pistis as "Ground for Faith" in Hellenized Judaism and Paul |volume=108 |issue=3 |journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |year=1989 |doi=10.2307/3267114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=212–5 |doi=10.1177/001452467408500710 |title=The 'Faith of Christ' |year=1974 |last1=Howard |first1=G. |journal=The Expository Times |volume=85 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilch and Malina, "Handbook of Biblical Social Values", 1998, pg 72–75&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the word could be almost synonymous with "obedience" when the people in the relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to "lack of human effort", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need "faithfully" to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying that we need to have "faith" that he will do everything for us. This is also argued to explain why James was adamant that "faith without works is dead" and that "a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone" (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to believe places one on the same level as the demons (see [[Epistle of James#Content|James 2]]). The "new" perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended "faith" to mean a full submission to God.

Another related issue is the ''pistis Christou'' ("faith of Christ") debate. Paul several times uses this phrase at key points in his writings and it is linguistically ambiguous as to whether it refers to our faith in Christ ("objective genitive"), or Christ's own faithfulness to God ("subjective genitive"), or even our faith/faithfulness to God like that which Christ had ("adjectival genitive"). There is wide disagreement within the academic community over which of these is the best rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2011}}See, e.g.: '''for subjective genitive''':

=== Grace, or favor ===
Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have generally translated the Greek word ''charis'' as "grace" and understood it to refer to the idea that there is a lack of human effort in salvation because God is the controlling factor. However those who study ancient Greek culture have pointed out that "favor" is a better translation, as the word refers normally to "doing a favor". In ancient societies there was the expectation that such favors be repaid, and this semi-formal system of favors acted like loans.&lt;ref&gt;David A.deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Kinship and Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture, 2000, pg 117&lt;/ref&gt; Gift giving corresponded with the expectation of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Oropeza, "The Expectation of Grace," ''Bulletin for Biblical Research'' 24.2 (2014) 207-226&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is argued that when Paul speaks of how God did us a "favor" by sending Jesus, he is saying that God took the initiative, but is not implying a lack of human effort in salvation, and is in fact implying that Christians have an obligation to repay the favor God has done for them. Some argue that this view then undermines the initial "favor"—of sending Jesus—by saying that, despite his life, death and resurrection, Christians still have, as before, to earn their way to heaven. However, others note this is the horns of a [[false dilemma]] (all grace versus all works). Many new-perspective proponents that see "charis" as "favor" do not teach that Christians ''earn'' their way to heaven outside of the death of Christ. Forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ is still necessary to salvation. But, that forgiveness demands effort on the part of the individual (cf. Paul in Phil. 3:12–16).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Romans_Theology_Paul.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Atonement ===
{{See also|Atonement in Christianity}}
To writers of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives the [[penal substitution]] atonement theory and the belief in the "finished work" of Christ have been central. New-perspective writers have regularly questioned whether this view is really of such central importance in Paul's writings. Generally new-perspective writers have argued that other theories of the atonement are more central to Paul's thinking, but there has been minimal agreement among them as to what Paul's real view of the atonement might be.

The following is a broad sample of different views advocated by various scholars:
* E. P. Sanders argued that Paul's central idea was that we mystically spiritually participate in the risen Christ and that all Paul's judicial language was subordinate to the participationary language.&lt;ref name="P. Sanders, 1977"/&gt;
* N. T. Wright has argued that Paul sees Israel as representative of humanity and taking onto itself the sinfulness of humanity through history. Jesus, in turn, as Messiah is representative of Israel and so focuses the sins of Israel on himself on the cross. Wright's view is thus a "historicized" form of Penal Substitution.&lt;ref&gt;N. T. Wright, "Jesus and the Victory of God"{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chris VanLandingham has argued that Paul sees Christ as having defeated the Devil and as teaching humans how God wants them to live and setting them an example.&lt;ref&gt;Chris VanLandingham, "Judgment and Justification in Early Judaism and the Apostle Paul", Hendrickson 2006{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* David Brondos has argued that Paul sees Jesus as just a part in a wider narrative in which the Church is working to transform lives of individuals and the world, and that Paul's participatory language should be understood in an ethical sense (humans living Christ-like lives) rather than mystically as Sanders thought.&lt;ref&gt;David Brondos, "Paul on the Cross: Reconstructing the Apostle's Story of Redemption", Fortress Press, 2006{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pilch and Malina take the view that Paul holds to the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction theory of atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Malina and John J. Pilch, "Social-Science Commentary on the Letters of Paul" Augsburg Fortress 2006{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stephen Finlan holds that Paul uses numerous different metaphors to describe the atonement; “justified by his blood” (Rom 5:9) means that a cultic substance has a judicial effect. Paul also taught the transformation of believers into the image of God through Christ ([[Divinization (Christian)|Theosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Finlan, Problems with Atonement: The Origins of, and Controversy about, the Atonement Doctrine, Liturgical Press 2005, pp. 58–59, 120–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The "new" perspective has been an extremely controversial subject and has drawn strong arguments and recriminations from both sides of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/august/13.22.html|title=What Did Paul Really Mean? - Christianity Today|author=Simon Gathercole|work=ChristianityToday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Steve Chalke]], after being influenced by new-perspective writers, published a book targeted at a popular audience which made comments highly critical of the [[penal substitution]] theory of the atonement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Steve | last1 = Chalke | first2 = Alan | last2 = Mann | title = The Lost Message of Jesus | publisher = Zondervan | year = 2003}}.{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an extensive and ongoing controversy among Evangelicals in Britain, with a strong backlash from laypeople and advocates of the [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, Pat. "Atonement row gets personal as Evangelical partnership splits", 'Church Times', 27 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chalke's views drew much support as well as criticism, with numerous articles, blogs and books being written on both sides of the debate.

The continuing controversy led to the [[Evangelical Alliance]] organising a symposium in July 2005 to discuss the issue. A record of this symposium includes a chapter by Chalke and his views are also contained in "the atonement debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Derek Tidball, David Hilborn, | first = Justin Thacker | title = the atonement debate | page = 34 to 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eauk.org/media/joint-evangelical-alliance-london-school.cfm |title = Joint Evangelical Alliance&amp;nbsp;– London School Of Theology Atonement Symposium |accessdate = 2007-08-26 |date = 2005-07-08 |publisher = [[Evangelical Alliance]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephen |first = Jonathan |url = http://www.evangelical-times.org/archive/item/950/Biblical-theological/Chalkegate/ |title = Chalkegate |accessdate = 2011-11-25 |date = February 2005 |publisher = [[Evangelical Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of three [[Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative evangelical]] theologians responded to Chalke with their book, ''Pierced for our Transgressions'' (Crossway Publishing, 2007), which strongly criticised Chalke's position as inconsistent with some evangelical confessions of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jeffery | first = Steve |author2=Mike Ovey |authorlink2=Mike Ovey |author3=Andrew Sach | isbn = 1-84474-178-8 | publisher = [[Inter-Varsity Press]] | title = Pierced for our Transgressions&amp;nbsp;– Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.piercedforourtransgressions.com | title = Pierced for our Transgressions&amp;nbsp;– Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution | accessdate = 2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[N. T. Wright]] endorsed Chalke and spoke out against the latter book, commenting, for instance, that ‘despite the ringing endorsements of famous men, it [''Pierced For Our Transgressions''] is deeply, profoundly, and disturbingly unbiblical.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Wright |first = NT |authorlink = N.

Both sides of the debate have attempted to claim the higher, and more accurate, view of scripture. New-perspective advocates claim that supporters of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective are too committed to historic [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] tradition, and therefore fail to take a "natural" reading of the Bible; while those of the Lutheran and Reformed perspectives claim that new-perspective advocates are too intrigued by certain interpretations of context and history, which then lead to a biased hermeneutical approach to the text.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

The "new" perspective has been heavily criticized by conservative scholars in the Reformed tradition, arguing that it undermines the classical, individualistic, Augustinian interpretation of election and does not faithfully reflect the teachings of the Scriptures. It has been the subject of fierce debate among Evangelicals in recent years, mainly due to N. T. Wright's increasing popularity in [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] circles. Its most outspoken critics include Calvinists [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]],&lt;ref&gt;John Piper, [http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/interviews/interview-with-john-piper-about-the-future-of-justification-a-response-to-n-t-wright Interview with Piper on Wright], October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinclair Ferguson]],&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair Ferguson, [http://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/what-does-justification-have-do-gospel/ What Does Justification Have to do with the Gospel?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ligon Duncan and Sinclair Ferguson (video resource) [http://www.ligonier.org/learn/media/wright-teaching-another-gospel/ Is Wright Teaching Another Gospel?]&lt;/ref&gt; C.

Smith, ''The Tension Between God as Righteous Judge and as Merciful in Early Judaism''; id., ''What Must I Do to Be Saved? Paul Parts Company with His Jewish Heritage''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[John M.G. Barclay]] published ''Paul and the Gift'' which re-frames Paul's theology of grace and, in doing so, provides a nuanced critique of the New Perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eerdmans.com/Products/6889/paul-and-the-gift.aspx|title=Paul and the Gift - John M.

== Catholic and Orthodox reactions ==
The "new" perspective has, by and large, been an internal debate among Protestant scholars. [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] writers have generally responded favorably to new-perspective ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Despotis, A., Die „New Perspective on Paul“ und die griechisch-orthodoxe Paulusinterpretation, [VIOTh 11], St. Ottilien: EOS-Verlag 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-8306-7705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing both a greater commonality with their own beliefs and strong similarities with the views of many of the early [[Church Fathers]]. From a Catholic point of view, the "new" perspective is seen as a step toward the progressive reality of human salvation in Christ. Moreover, passages in the works of many early Church Fathers show that new-perspective-style interpretations were widely held among them.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, "Against Heresy" 4:13–16. Ambrosiaster, "Commentary on Romans". Pelagius, "Commentary on Romans". Origen "Commentary on Romans". Justin Martyr, "Dialogue" Ch 10–11. Clement of Alexandria, "Stromata" 6:6. Ignatius, "Magnesians" 8. Cyril of Jerusalem, "Catechetical Lectures" 4:33.{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the many exceptions is the influential [[Augustine of Hippo]]. While most in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox schools would see him as espousing a view of grace and justification in keeping with this "new" perspective, Augustine is blamed by some for introducing incorrect ideas{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Some Orthodox have long criticized Augustine's soteriology, claiming it introduced novelties into Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. John Romanides, The Ancestral Sin, Zephyr Publishing, Ridgewood, NJ, 1998, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased importance new-perspective writers have given to good works in salvation has created strong common ground with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Historic [[Protestantism]] has never denied that there is a place for good and faithful works, but has always excluded them from [[Justification (theology)|justification]] and salvation, which Protestants argue is through [[faith alone]], and to which good deeds do not contribute, whether with or without God's grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Augsburg Confession|url=http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article20|work=Book of Concord|accessdate=8 September 2012|location=Article 20|quote=[..]Furthermore, it is taught on our part that it is necessary to do good works, not that we should trust to merit grace by them, but because it is the will of God. It is only by faith that forgiveness of sins is apprehended, and that, for nothing. And because through faith the Holy Ghost is received, hearts are renewed and endowed with new affections, so as to be able to bring forth good works. For Ambrose says: Faith is the mother of a good will and right doing. For man's powers without the Holy Ghost are full of ungodly affections, and are too weak to do works which are good in God's sight. Besides, they are in the power of the devil who impels men to divers sins, to ungodly opinions, to open crimes. This we may see in the philosophers, who, although they endeavored to live an honest life could not succeed, but were defiled with many open crimes. Such is the feebleness of man when he is without faith and without the Holy Ghost, and governs himself only by human strength. Hence it may be readily seen that this doctrine is not to be charged with prohibiting good works, but rather the more to be commended, because it shows how we are enabled to do good works.[..]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvin|first=John|title=Commentary on James|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vi.iii.vi.html|work=Commentary on the Catholic Epistles|accessdate=8 September 2012|authorlink=John Calvin|location=James 2:18-19|quote=[..]This only he means, that faith, without the evidence of good works, is vainly pretended, because fruit ever comes from the living root of a good tree.[..]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has, since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], been a line of distinction between Protestantism (both [[Reformed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of Dort|url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/dort.htm|accessdate=9 September 2012|location=FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 3.|quote=Rejections of errors[..][of those W]ho teach: That the good pleasure and purpose of God, of which Scripture makes mention in the doctrine of election, does not consist in this, that God chose certain persons rather than others, but in this, that He chose out of all possible conditions (among which are also the works of the law), or out of the whole order of things, that act of faith which from its very nature is undeserving, as well as it incomplete obedience, as a condition of salvation, and that He would graciously consider this in itself as a complete obedience and count it worthy of the reward of eternal life. For by this injurious error the pleasure of God and the merits of Christ are made of none effect, and men are drawn away by useless questions from the truth of gracious justification and from the simplicity of Scripture, and this declaration of the apostle is charged as untrue: "who has saved us and called us to a holy life, not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time (2 Tim 1:9)."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919133747/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/dort.htm|archivedate=19 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lutheran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Augsburg Confession|url=http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article12|work=Book of Concord|accessdate=8 September 2012|location=Article XII|quote=They also are rejected who do not teach that remission of sins comes through faith but command us to merit grace through satisfactions of our own.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and other Christian communions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3647">Of all the [[agile software development]] methodologies, '''outside–in software development''' takes a different approach to optimizing the software development process. Unlike other approaches, '''outside–in''' development focuses on satisfying the needs of stakeholders. The underlying theory is that to create successful software, the team must have a clear understanding of the goals and motivations of the stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to produce software that is highly [[Consumability|consumable]] and meets or exceeds the needs of the intended client.

Outside–in software development is meant to primarily supplement existing software development methodologies. While it is suited for agile software development, it is possible to fit outside-in development into [[waterfall model|waterfall]]-based methodologies.

== The four stakeholder groups ==

What sets outside-in software development apart from other stakeholder-based approaches is the categorization of the four types of stakeholders. While the following four groups are unique however there can be and is usually a lot of interaction between them:

* '''Principals''': The people who buy your software—the most important stakeholder to appease. 
* '''End users''': The people who interact with your product. They experience how your software works in the real world.
* '''Partners''':  The people who make your product work in real life, such as operations teams and also business partners and system integrators.
* '''Insiders''': The people within your company that have some impact on how your team develops software.

It is crucial to speak with all stakeholders, even if they are not the primary audience of your software.

== Implementing outside–in software development ==

The outside–in approach does not require your entire development methodology to change. Outside–in development can supplement the existing tools of developers.

Outside–in development works particularly well in the context of agile/lean development. One of the major tenets of lean-based software development is to program with the least amount of waste. Outside-in methodologies promote only developing according to stakeholder requirements. By identifying your stakeholders properly and soliciting helpful feedback early on in the development process, agile and outside-in methodologies can mesh together seamlessly.

Kessler and Sweitzer recommend that, no matter what kind of development methodology you employ, you incrementally introduce outside–in development to your team. They cite the lack of enthusiasm by developers as the main reason to not implement sweeping, large scale change.

Outside–in software development should not be introduced as a holistic development process. It is meant to supplement your current software development methodology.

'''Overpopulation''' occurs when a [[species]]' [[population]] exceeds the [[carrying capacity]] of its [[ecological niche]]. It can result from an increase in [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|births (fertility rate)]], a decline in the [[mortality rate]], an increase in [[immigration]], or an [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] [[biome]] and depletion of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dhirubhai Ambani International Model United Nations 2013|url=http://www.daimun.org/pdf/ecosoc3_taraparambi.pdf|website=Daimun|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it means that if there are too many people in the same habitat, people are limiting available resources to survive.

==Animal overpopulation==
In the wild, overpopulation often results in growth in the populations of [[predator]]s. This has the effect of controlling the prey population and ensuring its [[evolution]] in favor of genetic characteristics that render it less vulnerable to predation (and the predator may [[co-evolution|co-evolve]], in response).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Joe|title=Predators and their prey - why we need them both|url=http://www.conservationnw.org/what-we-do/predators-and-prey/carnivores-predators-and-their-prey|website=Conservation Northwest|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of predators, species are bound by the resources they can find in their environment, but this does not necessarily control overpopulation, at least in the short term. An abundant supply of resources can produce a population boom followed by a population crash. Rodents such as [[lemming]]s and [[vole]]s have such cycles of rapid population growth and subsequent decrease.{{cn|date=April 2017}} [[Snowshoe hare]]s populations similarly cycled dramatically, as did those of one of their predators, the [[lynx]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The introduction of a foreign species has often caused ecological disturbance, as when  [[deer]] and [[trout]] were introduced into Argentina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Speziale|first1=Karina|last2=Sergio |first2=Lambertucci|last3=Jose´ |first3=Tella|last4=Martina|first4=Carrete |title=Dealing with Non-native Species: what makes the Difference  in South America?|url=http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/64587/1/biolInv.pdf|website=[[Digital.CSIC]] Open Science|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Rabbits in Australia|rabbits were introduced to Australia]], and indeed when predators such as cats were introduced in turn to attempt to control the rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zukerman|first1=Wendy|title=Australia's Battle with the Bunny|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2009/04/08/2538860.htm|website=ABC Science|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species such as [[locust]]s experience large natural cyclic variations, experienced by farmers as plagues.&lt;ref name="CurrentBio"&gt;Simpson, Stephen J.; Sword, Gregory A. (2008). "Locusts". ''[[Current Biology]]'' 18:r364-366. {{doi|10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.029}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human overpopulation==
{{main|Human overpopulation}}

''Human overpopulation'' occurs when the [[ecological footprint]] of a human population in a specific geographical location exceeds the [[carrying capacity]] of the place occupied by that group. Overpopulation can further be viewed, in a long term perspective, as existing when a population cannot be maintained given the rapid depletion of [[non-renewable resources]] or given the degradation of the capacity of the environment to give support to the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrlich |first1=Paul R. Ehrlich &amp; Anne H. |title=The population explosion |date=1990 |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |isbn=0091745519 |pages=39–40 |url=http://www.ditext.com/ehrlich/title.html|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=When is an area overpopulated? When its population can not be maintained without rapidly depleting nonrenewable resources [39] (or converting renewable resources into nonrenewable ones) and without decreasing the capacity of the environment to support the population. In short, if the long-term carrying capacity of an area is clearly being degraded by its current human occupants, that area is overpopulated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''human overpopulation'' also refers to the relationship between the [[world population|entire human population]] and its [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]: the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.food Global food crisis looms as climate change and population growth strip fertile land] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429094959/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.food |date=29 April 2016 }}". Guardian.co.uk (2007-08-31).&lt;/ref&gt; or to smaller geographical areas such as countries. Overpopulation can result from an increase in [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|births]], a decline in [[mortality rate]]s, an increase in [[immigration]], or an [[Sustainability|unsustainable]] [[biome]] and depletion of resources. It is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meagre or non-existent capability to sustain life (e.g. a [[desert]]). Advocates of population moderation cite issues like [[quality of life]], [[carrying capacity]] and risk of [[starvation]] as a basis to argue against continuing high human population growth and for [[population decline]]. Scientists suggest that the [[human impact on the environment]] as a result of overpopulation, profligate [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and proliferation of technology has pushed the planet into a new geological [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] known as the [[Anthropocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-03-coping-anthropocene.html|title= Coping with the Anthropocene|first= |last= |date=March 17, 2015|work=[[Phys.org]]|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/07/human-impact-has-pushed-earth-into-the-anthropocene-scientists-say|title=Human impact has pushed Earth into the Anthropocene, scientists say|first=Adam |last=Vaughan|date=January 7, 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/09/140920-population-11billion-demographics-anthropocene/|title=As World’s Population Booms, Will Its Resources Be Enough for Us?|first=Dennis |last=Dimick|date=September 21, 2014|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[hydrodynamics]], a '''plume''' is a column of one fluid moving through another.  Several effects control the motion of the fluid, including momentum (inertia), diffusion and buoyancy (density differences).  Pure ''jets'' and pure ''plumes'' define flows that are driven entirely by momentum and buoyancy effects, respectively.  Flows between these two limits are usually described as forced plumes or buoyant jets.  "Buoyancy is defined as being positive" when, in the absence of other forces or initial motion, the entering fluid would tend to rise.  Situations where the density of the plume fluid is greater than its surroundings (i.e. in still conditions, its natural tendency would be to sink), but the flow has sufficient initial momentum to carry it some distance vertically, are described as being negatively buoyant.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J.S. (1979), "Buoyancy effects in fluids", Ch.6, pp.165--&amp;, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
Usually, as a plume moves away from its source, it widens because of [[entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrainment]] of the surrounding fluid at its edges. Plume shapes can be influenced by flow in the ambient fluid (for example, if local wind blowing in the same direction as the plume results in a co-flowing jet). This usually causes a plume which has initially been 'buoyancy-dominated'  to become 'momentum-dominated' (this transition is usually predicted by a dimensionless number called the [[Richardson number]]).

=== Flow and detection ===
A further phenomenon of importance is whether a plume has [[laminar flow]] or [[turbulent flow]]. Usually there is a transition from laminar to turbulent as the plume moves away from its source. This phenomenon can be clearly seen in the rising column of smoke from a cigarette. When high accuracy is required, [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) can be employed to simulate plumes, but the results can be sensitive to the [[turbulence model]] chosen. CFD is often undertaken for '''rocket plumes''', where condensed phase constituents can be present in addition to gaseous constituents. These types of simulations can become quite complex, including [[afterburning]] and [[thermal radiation]], and (for example) [[ballistic missile]] launches are often detected by sensing hot rocket plumes. Similarly, spacecraft managers are sometimes concerned with impingement of [[attitude control system]] thruster plumes onto sensitive subsystems like solar arrays and star trackers.

Another phenomenon which can also be seen clearly in the flow of smoke from a cigarette is that the leading-edge of the flow, or the starting-plume, is quite often approximately in the shape of a ring-[[vortex]] ([[smoke ring]]).&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. S. (1962). ''The Starting Plume in Neutral Surroundings'', J. Fluid Mech. vol 13, pp356-368&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Pollutants]] released to the ground can work their way down into the [[groundwater]], leading to [[groundwater pollution]]. The resulting body of polluted water within an [[aquifer]] is called a plume, with its migrating edges called plume fronts. Plumes are used to locate, map, and measure [[water pollution]] within the aquifer's total body of water, and plume fronts to determine directions and speed of the contamination's spreading in it.&lt;ref&gt;Fetter, C.W. Jr 1998 Contaminant Hydrogeology&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumes are of considerable importance in the [[atmospheric dispersion modelling]] of [[air pollution]]. A classic work on the subject of air pollution plumes is that by Gary Briggs.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Gary A. (1975). ''Plume Rise Predictions'', Chapter 3 in ''Lectures on Air Pollution and Environmental Impact Analysis'',  Duanne A. Haugen, editor, Amer. Met. Soc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermal plume''' is one which is generated by gas rising above heat source. The gas rises because [[thermal expansion]] makes warm gas less dense than the surrounding cooler gas.

==Simple plume modelling==
Quite simple modelling will enable many properties of fully developed, turbulent plumes to be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Scase, M. M., Caulfield, C. P., Dalziel, S. B. &amp; Hunt, J. C. R. (2006). ''Time-dependent plumes and jets with decreasing source strengths'', J. Fluid Mech. vol 563, pp443-461&lt;/ref&gt;

# It is usually sufficient to assume that the pressure gradient is set by the gradient far from the plume (this approximation is similar to the usual [[Turbulence modeling#Eddy viscosity|Boussinesq approximation]]).
# The distribution of density and velocity across the plume are modelled either with simple Gaussian distributions or else are taken as uniform across the plume (the so-called 'top hat' model).
# The rate of entrainment into the plume is proportional to the local velocity.&lt;ref name="morton turb"&gt;Morton, B. R., Turner, J. S., and Taylor, G.I. (1956), ''Turbulent gravitational convection from maintained and instantaneous sources'', P. Roy. Soc. Lond., vol. 234, pp.1--&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Though initially thought to be a constant, recent work has shown that the entrainment coefficient varies with the local Richardson number.&lt;ref&gt;Kaminski, E. Tait, S. and Carazzo, G. (2005), ''Turbulent entrainment in jets with arbitrary buoyancy'', J. Fluid Mech., vol. 526, pp.361--376&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical values for the entrainment coefficient are of about 0.08 for vertical jets and 0.12 for vertical, buoyant plumes whilst for bent-over plumes, the entrainment coefficient is about 0.6.
# Conservation equations for mass (including entrainment), and momentum and buoyancy fluxes are sufficient for a complete description of the flow in many cases,&lt;ref name="morton turb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, A.W. (2010), ''Turbulent plumes in nature'', Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., Vol. 42, pp. 391--412&lt;/ref&gt; For a simple rising plume these equations predict that the plume will widen at a constant half-angle of about 6 to 15 degrees.

==Gaussian plume modelling==
Gaussian plume models can be used in several fluid dynamics scenarios to calculate concentration distribution of solutes such as a smoke stack release or contaminant released in a river. Gaussian distributions are established by Fickian diffusion, and follow a gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution.&lt;ref name="connolly model"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/paul.connolly/teaching/practicals/gaussian_plume_modelling.html|title=Gaussian Plume Model|website=personalpages.manchester.ac.uk|last1=Connolly|first1=Paul|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For calculating the expected concentration of a one dimensional instantaneous point source we consider a mass M released at an instantaneous point in time, in a one dimensional domain along x. This will give the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Nepf. ''1.061 Transport Processes in the Environment.'' Fall 2008. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare, https://ocw.mit.edu License: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C(x,t)=M/\surd(4\pi*D*t) *exp((x-x0)^2/(4D(t-t0)) &lt;/math&gt;

where M is the mass released at time t=t0 and location x=x0, and D is the diffusivity [m^2/s]. This  equation makes the following four assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mass Transport in Environmental Flows|last=Variano|first=Evan|publisher=UC Berkeley|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The mass M is released instantaneously.
# The mass M is released in an infinite domain.
# The mass spreads only through diffusion.
# Diffusion does not vary in space.&lt;ref name="connolly model"/&gt;

A '''pneumatic motor''' ('''air motor''') or '''compressed air engine''' is a type of [[Engine|motor]] which does [[mechanical work]] by expanding [[compressed air]]. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion.  Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor, piston air motor, air turbine or gear type motor.

Pneumatic motors have existed in many forms over the past two centuries, ranging in size from hand-held motors to engines of up to several hundred horsepower. Some types rely on pistons and cylinders; others on slotted rotors with vanes (vane motors) and others use turbines. Many compressed air engines improve their performance by heating the incoming air or the engine itself. Pneumatic motors have found widespread success in the hand-held tool industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directindustry.com/cat/motors-geared-motors-motion-control/pneumatic-motors-D-77.html|title=Motors and Motor Control,Pneumatic motors - All industrial manufacturers in this category - Videos|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129004608/http://www.directindustry.com/cat/motors-geared-motors-motion-control/pneumatic-motors-D-77.html|archivedate=2011-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are also used stationary in a wide range of industrial applications.  Continual attempts are being made to expand their use to the transportation industry.  However, pneumatic motors must overcome inefficiencies before being seen as a viable option in the transportation industry.
&lt;!-- From: compressed air engine: A '''compressed air engine''' is a [[pneumatic actuator]] that creates useful work by expanding compressed air. They have existed in many forms over the past two centuries, ranging in size from hand-held turbines up to several hundred horsepower. Some types rely on pistons and cylinders, others use turbines. Many compressed air engines improve their performance by heating the incoming air or the engine itself. Some have taken this a stage further by burning fuel in the cylinder or turbine, forming a type of [[internal combustion engine]]. --&gt;

==Classification==

===Linear===
In order to achieve linear motion from compressed air, a system of pistons is most commonly used.  The compressed air is fed into an air-tight chamber that houses the shaft of the piston.  Also inside this chamber a spring is coiled around the shaft of the piston in order to hold the chamber completely open when air is not being pumped into the chamber.  As air is fed into the chamber the force on the piston shaft begins to overcome the force being exerted on the spring.&lt;ref name="engineersedge"&gt;Engineers Edge. Pneumatic actuator design and operation. Retrieved from http://www.engineersedge.com/hydraulic/pneumatic_actuator.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As more air is fed into the chamber, the pressure increases and the piston begins to move down the chamber. When it reaches its maximum length the air pressure is released from the chamber and the spring completes the cycle by closing off the chamber to return to its original position. 
	
[[Reciprocating engine#Common features in all types|Piston motors]] are the most commonly used in hydraulic systems. Essentially, piston motors are the same as [[hydraulic motor]]s except they are used to convert hydraulic energy into mechanical&lt;ref&gt;Technology zone-air motor.

Piston motors are often used in series of two, three, four, five, or six cylinders that are enclosed in a housing.  This allows for more power to be delivered by the pistons because several motors are in sync with each other at certain times of their cycle.

===Rotary vane motors===
A type of pneumatic motor, known as a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft.  The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane.&lt;ref name="vane"/&gt; The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft.  Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and the diameter of the housing.&lt;ref name="engineersedge"/&gt;
	
One application for vane-type air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines.  Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor.  This causes the rotor to turn at high speed.  Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used.  Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input.  These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.

==Application==
A widespread application of pneumatic motors is in hand-held tools, impact wrenches, pulse tools, screwdrivers, nut runners, drills, grinders, sanders and so on. Pneumatic motors are also used stationary in a wide range of industrial applications. Though overall energy efficiency of pneumatics tools is low and they require access to a compressed-air source, there are several advantages over electric tools.  They offer greater power density (a smaller pneumatic motor can provide the same amount of power as a larger electric motor), do not require an auxiliary speed controller (adding to its compactness), generate less heat, and can be used in more volatile atmospheres as they do not require electric power &lt;ref&gt;Air motors.

The pneumatic motor was first applied to the field of transportation in the mid-19th century.  Though little is known about the first recorded compressed-air vehicle, it is said that the Frenchmen Andraud and Tessie of Motay ran a car powered by a pneumatic motor on a test track in Chaillot, France, on July 9, 1840.  Although the car test was reported to have been successful, the pair didn’t explore further expansion of the design.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;The History of compressed air vehicles. (n.d.). Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.aircarfactories.com/air-cars/compressed-air-history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103064123/http://www.aircarfactories.com/air-cars/compressed-air-history.html |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The first successful application of the pneumatic motor in transportation was the [[Mekarski system]] air engine used in locomotives.  Mekarski’s innovative engine overcame cooling that accompanies air expansion by heating air in a small boiler prior to use.  The [[Tramway de Nantes]], located in Nantes, France, was noted for being the first to use Mekarski engines to power their fleet of locomotives.  The tramway began operation on December 13, 1879, and continues to operate today, although the pneumatic trams were replaced in 1917 by more efficient and modern electrical trams.
	
American Charles Hodges also found success with pneumatic motors in the locomotive industry.  In 1911 he designed a pneumatic locomotive and sold the patent to the [[H.K. Porter, Inc.|H.K. Porter Company]] in Pittsburgh for use in coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, C.B (1912). U.S. Patent No. 1024778. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Because pneumatic motors do not use combustion they were a much safer option in the coal industry.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Many companies claim to be developing [[Compressed air car]]s, but none are actually available for purchase or even independent testing.

==Tools==

[[Impact wrench]]es, pulse tools, nutrunners, [[screwdriver]]s, [[drill]]s, [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinders]], [[die grinder]]s, [[sander]]s, [[dental drill]]s and other [[pneumatic tool]]s use a variety of [[air motor]]s. These include vane type motors, [[turbine]]s and piston motors.

==Torpedoes==
Most successful early forms of self-propelled [[torpedo]]es used [[Torpedo#Compressed air|high pressure compressed air]], although this was superseded by internal or external combustion engines, steam engines, or electric motors.

==Railways==
Compressed air engines were used in trams and shunters, and eventually found a successful niche in mining locomotives, although in the end they were replaced by electric trains, underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/comprair/comprair.htm|title=Compressed-Air Propulsion|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027073257/http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/comprair/comprair.htm|archivedate=2014-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years designs increased in complexity, resulting in a triple expansion engine with air-to-air reheaters between each stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aircaraccess.com/images/3stage%201.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031053915/http://www.aircaraccess.com/images/3stage%201.jpg |archivedate=2015-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information see [[Fireless locomotive]] and [[Mekarski system]].

==Flight==

Transport category airplanes, such as commercial airliners, use compressed air starters to start the main engines. The air is supplied by the load compressor of the aircraft's [[auxiliary power unit]], or by ground equipment.

[[Water rocket]]s use compressed air to power their water jet and generate thrust, they are used as toys.

[[Air Hogs]], a toy brand, also uses compressed air to power piston engines in toy airplanes (and some other toy vehicles).

==Automotive==
{{Main|Compressed-air vehicle}}

There is currently some interest in developing [[air car]]s. Several engines have been proposed for these, although none have demonstrated the performance and long life needed for personal transport.

===Energine===
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085338/http://www.energine.com/ Energine Corporation] was a [[South Korea]]n company that claimed to deliver fully assembled cars running on a hybrid compressed air and electric engine. The compressed-air engine is used to activate an [[alternator]], which extends the autonomous operating capacity of the car. The CEO was arrested for fraudulently promoting air motors with false claims.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Compressed air car#Energine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===EngineAir===
[http://www.engineair.com.au EngineAir], an Australian company, is making a [[Pistonless rotary engine|rotary engine]] powered by compressed air, called The [[Angelo Di Pietro (inventor)|Di Pietro]] motor.
The Di Pietro motor concept is based on a rotary piston. Different from existing rotary engines, the Di Pietro motor uses a simple cylindrical rotary piston (shaft driver) which rolls, with little friction, inside the cylindrical stator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineair.com.au/airmotor.htm|title=Engineair|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005161858/http://www.engineair.com.au/airmotor.htm|archivedate=2010-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used in boat, cars, burden carriers and other vehicles. Only 1 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (≈ 6,8 [[kPa]]) of pressure is needed to overcome the friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineair.com.au/applications.htm|title=Engineair|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414225522/http://www.engineair.com.au/applications.htm|archivedate=2008-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineair.com.au/|title=Engine Air|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625150355/http://www.engineair.com.au/|archivedate=2007-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was also featured on the ABC's New Inventors programme in Australia on 24 March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/newinventors/txt/s1072065.htm|title=New Inventors: Rotary Piston Engine|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909030016/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/newinventors/txt/s1072065.htm|archivedate=2011-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===K'Airmobiles===
K'Airmobiles vehicles were intended to be commercialized from a project developed in France in 2006-2007 by a small group of researchers. However, the project has not been able to gather the necessary funds.
 
People should note that, meantime, the team has recognized the physical impossibility to use on-board stored compressed air due to its poor energy capacity and the thermal losses resulting from the expansion of the gas. 
  
These days, using the patent pending 'K'Air Generator', converted to work as a compressed-gas motor, the project should be launched in 2010, thanks to a North American group of investors, but for the purpose of developing first a green energy power system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kair-energy.com/index.php|title=K°Air Energy Inc|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215231323/http://kair-energy.com/index.php|archivedate=2015-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MDI===
{{Main|Motor Development International}}

In the original [[Guy Nègre|Nègre]] air engine, one piston compresses air from the atmosphere to mix with the stored compressed air (which will cool drastically as it expands). This mixture drives the second piston, providing the actual engine power. MDI's engine works with constant torque, and the only way to change the torque to the wheels is to use a pulley transmission of constant variation, losing some efficiency.  When vehicle is stopped, MDI's engine had to be on and working, losing energy. In 2001-2004 MDI switched to a design similar to that described in Regusci's patents (see below), which date back to 1990.

It has been reported in 2008 that Indian car manufacturer Tata was looking at an MDI compressed air engine as an option on its low priced Nano automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/398180/tata-nano-to-offer-compressed-air-engine-optional-make-electric-cars-look-silly|title=Tata Nano To Offer Compressed Air Engine Optional, Make Electric Cars Look Silly|first=Ben|last=Wojdyla|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016153410/http://jalopnik.com/398180/tata-nano-to-offer-compressed-air-engine-optional-make-electric-cars-look-silly|archivedate=2011-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tata announced in 2009 that the compressed air car was proving difficult to develop due to its low range and problems with low engine temperatures.

===Quasiturbine===
{{Main|Quasiturbine}}
The '''Pneumatic Quasiturbine''' engine is a [[compressed air]] [[pistonless rotary engine]] using a rhomboidal-shaped [[Rotor (engine)|rotor]] whose sides are hinged at the vertices.

The Quasiturbine has demonstrated as a [[pneumatic]] engine using stored compressed air &lt;ref&gt;Quasiturbine Low RPM High Torque Pressure Driven Turbine for Top Efficiency Power Modulation. Peers reviewed paper - Published in The Proceeding of Turbo Expo 2007 of the IGTI (International Gas Turbine Institute) and ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers).[http://www.quasiturbine.com/QTPapiers/ASME2007QTMontreal.pdf Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113144212/http://www.quasiturbine.com/QTPapiers/ASME2007QTMontreal.pdf |date=2006-11-13 }} [http://www.quasiturbine.com/Presse/QTASME2007.htm info]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also take advantage of the energy amplification possible from using available external heat, such as [[solar energy]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quasiturbine.promci.qc.ca/ETypePneumatic.htm|title=Quasiturbine&gt; Type&gt; Pneumatic|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920045657/http://quasiturbine.promci.qc.ca/ETypePneumatic.htm|archivedate=2011-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quasiturbine rotates from pressure as low as 0.1 atm (1.47psi).

Since the Quasiturbine is a pure expansion engine, while the [[Wankel]] and most other rotary engines are not, it is well-suited as a compressed fluid engine, air engine or air motor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Regusci===
Armando Regusci's version of the air engine couples the transmission system directly to the wheel, and has variable torque from zero to the maximum, enhancing efficiency. Regusci's patents date from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regusciair.com/index.html|title=REGUSCIAIR - Home|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307085856/http://regusciair.com/index.html|archivedate=2010-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team Psycho-Active ===
Psycho-Active is developing a multi-fuel/air-hybrid chassis which is intended to serve as the foundation for a line of automobiles. Claimed performance is 50&amp;nbsp;hp/litre. The compressed air motor they use is called the DBRE or Ducted Blade Rotary Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psycho-active.org/|title=Psycho-Active Contenders for the Automotive X-Prize|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727191029/http://www.psycho-active.org/|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psycho-active.org/dbre.html|title=THOUGHTFLOW DESIGN'S DUCTED-BLADE ROTARY ENGINE|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042320/http://www.psycho-active.org/dbre.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conger motor===
Milton M. Conger in 1881 patented and supposedly built a motor that ran off compressed air or steam that using a '''flexible tubing''' which will form a wedge-shaped or inclined wall or abutment in the rear of the tangential bearing of the wheel, and propel it with greater or less speed according to the pressure of the propelling medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.machine-history.com/Conger%20Air%20Powered%20Flex%20Tube%20Motor%201881 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714014658/http://www.machine-history.com/Conger%20Air%20Powered%20Flex%20Tube%20Motor%201881 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relational sociology''' is a collection of sociological theories that emphasize [[relationalism]] over [[substantivalism]] in explanations and interpretations of social phenomena and is most directly connected to the work of [[Harrison White]] and [[Charles Tilly]] in the United States and [[Pierpaolo Donati]] and [[Nick Crossley]] in Europe.

==Background==
Relational sociology draws on a perspective or social ontology that Tilly and Donati refer to as ''[[relational realism]]'' or "the doctrine that transactions, interactions, social ties and conversations constitute the central stuff of social life."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories, Identities, and Political Change|author=Tilly, C.|date=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781461642602|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zU57AAAAQBAJ|page=72|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although, Donati argues that other relational sociologies based on constructivist ontology are not truly relational realism.)&lt;ref name="Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives" /&gt; This redefines the object of sociology, as Donati argues: "Society is not a space “containing” relations, or an arena where relations are played. It is rather the very tissue of relations (society “is
relation” and does not “have relations”).&lt;ref name="relationalstudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relationalstudies.net/uploads/2/3/1/5/2315313/donati_birth_and_development_of_the_relational_theory_of_society.pdf|date=15 February 2011|title=Birth and development of the relational theory of society: a journey looking for a deep 'relational sociology'|author=Pierpaolo Donati|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although several relational thinkers emerge throughout human thought, these presumably disparate theoretical ideas were consolidated in the United States under one banner during what some,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xS2wAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20York%20School%22&amp;f=false ''Conceptualizing Relational Sociology: Ontological and Theoretical Issues'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dTt0rG_B130C&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;ots=HrWugxwyhk&amp;dq=%22relational%20sociology%22%20%22new%20york%20school%22&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20York%20School%22&amp;f=false ''Understanding Terrorism in the Age of Global Media: A Communication Approach'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ssc.wisc.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/BIO.html|title=BIO|publisher=ssc.wisc.edu|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Ann Mische]], refer to as [[New York School (sociology)|The New York School]] of relational sociology in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Mische, Ann 2011"&gt;Mische, Ann. "Relational sociology, culture, and agency." The Sage handbook of social network analysis (2011): 80-97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Sociological Association has referred to it as the "relational turn" in social sciences spreading around the world.&lt;ref name=csa&gt;[http://www.csa-scs.ca/files/webapps/csapress/annual-conferences/2014/05/08/relational-sociology-research-cluster-meeting/ Relational Sociology Research Cluster Meeting], Canadian Sociological Association. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While substantivalism (similar to [[substantialism]] in philosophy) tends to view individuals (or other social objects) as self-subsistent or self-acting entities, relationalism underscores that practices constitute individuals, and that all action is always trans-action: always with implication transcending the momentary intent.&lt;ref&gt;Emirbayer, Mustafa. "Manifesto for a Relational Sociology" ''The American Journal of Sociology'' 103 (1997): 281-317. {{JSTOR|231209}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is frequently cited by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who borrowed it from [[Ernest Cassirer]],&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociological Insights of Great Thinkers: Sociology Through Literature, Philosophy, and Science|author1=Edling, C.|author2=Rydgren, J.|date=2011|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313384707|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9XojFmUmNQC|page=115|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically, Cassirer's 1923 publication ''[[Substance and Function]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassirer|first1=Ernest|title=Substance and Function And Einsteins Theory Of Relativity|date=1923|publisher=Dover Publications|url=https://archive.org/details/substanceandfunc033163mbp|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, "relational theorists reject the notion that one can posit discrete, pre-given units such as the individual or society as ultimate starting points of sociological analysis" &lt;ref&gt;Emirbayer, Mustafa. "Manifesto for a Relational Sociology." ''The American Journal of Sociology'' 103 (1997): 281-317, pg 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In [[Mustafa Emirbayer]]'s 1997 "Manifesto for a Relational Sociology" he traces the tradition of privileging relations over substances to the pre-Socratic, Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]. He is attributed the cryptic saying "Ever-newer waters flow on those who step into the same rivers," from which the simpler "everything flows" (Panta rhei) emerges. Among the classical sociologists, Emirbayer and sociologist [[Marion Fourcade]]&lt;ref&gt;Fourcade, Marion. "Theories of markets and theories of society." American Behavioral Scientist 50.8 (2007): 1015–1034.&lt;/ref&gt; agree that relational ideas emerge in the work of several founders of sociology, including [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]], [[George Herbert Mead|Mead]], and [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]. Among early and mid-20th century sociologists, the most prominently relational theorists are [[John Dewey]], [[Arthur F. Bentley]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Norbert Elias]], and [[Niklas Luhmann]]. [[Pierpaolo Donati]] contends that Simmel, specifically the concept ''[[Wechselwirkung]]'', is "the first one to give sociology the "relational turning point."&lt;ref name="Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donati|first1=Pierpaolo|title=Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=O6HSJ1IcpwgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Donati,+Pierpaolo#v=onepage&amp;q=Donati%2C%20Pierpaolo&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donati's own "Manifesto" for his own variety of relational sociology&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociologists in a Global Age: Biographical Perspectives|author=Deflem, P.M.|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Limited|isbn=9781409490838|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6HSJ1IcpwgC|page=167|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first published in 1983 in Italian, entitled ''Introduzione alla sociologia relazionale''.&lt;ref name="francoangeli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francoangeli.it/Ricerca/Scheda_libro.aspx?CodiceLibro=1534.1.5|title=Introduzione alla sociologia relazionale|publisher=francoangeli.it|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the French sociologist [[Guy Bajoit]] authored "Pour une sociologie relationnelle,"&lt;ref&gt;Bajoit, Guy.

Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences]] at [[Columbia University]], as well as the [[The New School|Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research]]&lt;ref name="orgtheory.wordpress.com"/&gt; and [[New York University]]. These sociologists included [[Harrison White]], [[Charles Tilly]], [[Mustafa Emirbayer]], [[David R. Gibson|David Gibson]], [[Ronald Burt]], [[Mimi Sheller]], [[Jeff Goodwin]], [[Ann Mische]] and [[Melissa Fischer]]. During the 1990s New York was the site of many conferences and workshop discussing relational ideas: Harrison White hosted several conferences at the Lazersfeld Center discussing the themes of time, language, identities, and networks; Charles Tilly hosted the ''Workshop on Contentious Politics'';&lt;ref name="Charles Tilly's Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Tilly's Obituary|url=http://www.hacereditorial.es/contingut/m_pujadocuments/documents/File/CharlesTillyFinalOBit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mustafa Emirbayer organized a study group on Theory and Culture at the New School&lt;ref name="Mustafa Emirbayer's CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mustafa Emirbayer's CV|url=http://ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/HOME_files/Mustafa%20Vita.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed early drafts of his ''Manifesto for Relational Sociology''.&lt;ref name="Mische, Ann 2011"/&gt; A 2008 symposium cited White's ''Identity and Control'', Mische's ''Partisan Publics'', Tilly's ''Contentious Politics in Great Britain, 1758–1834'', [[Peter Bearman|Bearman]]'s ''Relations into Rhetorics'', and [[Roger V.

===Spread of relational sociology===

In September 2008, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] hosted an international symposium on relational sociology organized by [[Jan Fuhse]] titled ''Relational Sociology: Transatlantic Impulses for the Social Sciences''. The symposium centered on the work of Harrison White.&lt;ref name="janfuhse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janfuhse.de/relational-sociology/relational.html|title=Relational Sociology, Symposium, Berlin 2008 - Relational Sociology|author=Jan Fuhse|publisher=janfuhse.de|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="janfuhse2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janfuhse.de/relational-sociology/hcw.html|title=Relational Sociology, Symposium, Berlin 2008 - Harrison White|author=Jan Fuhse|publisher=janfuhse.de|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to White, presenters included: [[John Levi Martin]], [[Patrik Aspers]], [[Eiko Ikegami]], [[Ann Mische]], [[Stephan Fuchs]] and [[Sophie Muetzel]].&lt;ref name="janfuhse3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janfuhse.de/relational-sociology/program.html|title=Relational Sociology, Symposium, Berlin 2008 - Program|author=Jan Fuhse|publisher=janfuhse.de|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, sociologist [[Yanjie Bian]] hosted the ''International Conference on Relational Sociology'' at the Institute for Empirical Social Science Research of [[Xi'an Jiaotong University]].&lt;ref name="iessr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iessr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080/newdetail.aspx?news_type=zhxw&amp;news_id=85|title=IESSR Xi'an JiaoTong University|publisher=iessr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080|accessdate=18 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022125434/http://iessr.xjtu.edu.cn:8080/newdetail.aspx?news_type=zhxw&amp;news_id=85|archivedate=22 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference included keynote speakers [[Nan Lin]] and [[Peter Li]].

In 2010, the [[University of California-Davis]] hosted a conference on [[relational work]],&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/recent-conference-on-relational-sociology/|title=recent conference on relational sociology &amp;#124; orgtheory.net|publisher=orgtheory.wordpress.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Fred Block]]&lt;ref name="ucdavis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/fzblock/people/fzblock/CVFB.doc|title=CURRICULUM VITAE|author=Fred L.

Italian sociologist [[Pierpaolo Donati]] is one of the founders of relational sociology in Europe&lt;ref name="socialtrendsinstitute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialtrendsinstitute.org/experts/all/pierpaolo-donati|title=Pierpaolo Donati &amp;#124; Social Trends Institute|publisher=socialtrendsinstitute.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published ''Relational Sociology: A New Paradigm for the Social Sciences'' in 2011. Also in 2011, British sociologist [[Nick Crossley]] published ''Towards Relational Sociology''.

Beginning in 2011, the [[Canadian Sociological Association]] has held meetings at every annual conference to develop a research cluster devoted to relational sociology.&lt;ref name=csa /&gt; The most recent meeting was organized by [[François Dépelteau]] and Chris Powell from the [[Laurentian University]] and Ryerson University.

A 2013 call for papers from the''Sociological Network Research'' section of the [[German Sociological Association]] argues that, while major methodological advances occurred in the United States, relational sociology has strong roots in the German-language tradition of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamburg-sunbelt2013.org/789/ "The German-Language Tradition: Approaches to Social Networks"]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Simmel, Marx, [[Norbert Elias|Elias]] and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]], such German relational sociologists include: [[Leopold von Wiese]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Theodor Litt]], [[Alfred Schütz]], and [[Helmuth Plessner]]. The invitation was for oral presentations which addressed scholars who are part of the German-language tradition of relational sociology.

Also in 2013, two books were published on relational sociology by F. Dépelteau and C. Powell. ''Conceptualizing Relational Sociology'' and ''Applying Relational Sociology'',&lt;ref&gt;Powell, C. and Dépelteau, F. (2013) ''Conceptualizing Relational Sociology: Ontological and Theoretical Issues'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Dépelteau, F. and Powell, C. (2013) ''Applying Relational Sociology: Relations, Networks, and Society'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; both published with Palgrave Macmillan, are collections of texts presenting the variety of the last theoretical and empirical researches done within this intellectual current.

In 2014, a research cluster on relational cluster was created through the Canadian Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.csa-scs.ca/files/webapps/csapress/relational/&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years has seen the development of a relational approach to organizational theory in education by [[Scott Eacott]]&lt;ref&gt;See http://scottteacott.com&lt;/ref&gt;, best captured in "Beyond leadership: A relational approach to organizational theory in education". &lt;ref&gt; See https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811065675&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Sociologist [[Richard Swedberg]], argues that relational sociology disregards the potential role that [[Interest (emotion)|interests]] play in social action:

{{Quotation| In several types of modern sociology...interests are seen as having no or little influence on what is happening. According to so-called relational sociology, for example, it is old fashioned and wrong to explain things through 'substances' (such as interests); everything should be seen in terms of relations, and only relations can be used to explain.| Richard Swedberg ''Interests'' 2005 pg 4|&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg [https://books.google.com/books?id=kJJYS8EvypYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=JRfArK7DGv&amp;dq=%22richard%20swedberg%22%20%22relational%20sociology%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22relational%20sociology%22&amp;f=false ''Interests''] 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologist [[Christian Smith (sociologist)|Christian Smith]] states in ''What is a Person?'' that he rejects Emirbayer's position that substantialism and relationalism represent fundamentally different points of view, rather:

{{Quotation|...pure relationality cannot and does not create objects. Relations need substances and substances need relations. All that exists and every way it works requires relations and substances.| Christian Smith ''What is a Person?'' 2010 pg 232&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith [https://books.google.com/books?id=sT9r_h8X8I4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=what+is+a+person&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fb82VIHDGcmVyASd6YK4Cg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Relations%20need%20substances&amp;f=false ''What is a Person?''] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Reverberation mapping''' is an [[astrophysics|astrophysical technique]] for measuring the structure of the [[broad emission-line region]] (BLR) around a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of an [[active galaxy]], and thus estimating the hole's mass. It is considered a "primary" mass estimation technique, i.e., the mass is measured directly from the motion that its [[gravitational force]] induces in the nearby gas.&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David| authorlink=David Merritt | title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravity]] defines a direct relation between the mass of a central object and the speed of a smaller object in orbit around the central mass. Thus, for matter orbiting a black hole, the black hole mass is related by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; 
GM_\bullet = f R_\mathrm{BLR} (\Delta V)^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

to the [[RMS velocity]] Δ''V'' of gas moving near the black hole in the broad emission-line region, measured from the [[Doppler effect|Doppler broadening]] of the gaseous emission lines. In that formula, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;BLR&lt;/sub&gt; is the radius of the broad-line region; ''G'' is the [[constant of gravitation]]; and ''f'' is a poorly known "form factor" that depends on the shape of the BLR.

While Δ''V'' can be measured directly using [[spectroscopy]], the necessary determination of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;BLR&lt;/sub&gt; is much less straightforward. This is where reverberation mapping comes into play.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Peterson &amp; K. Horne  [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407538 Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; It utilizes the fact that the emission-line fluxes vary strongly in response to changes in the continuum, i.e., the light from the [[accretion disk]] near the black hole. Put simply, if the brightness of the accretion disk varies, the emission lines, which are excited in response to the accretion disk's light, will "reverberate", that is, vary in response. But it will take some time for light from the accretion disk to reach the broad-line region. Thus, the emission-line response is delayed with respect to changes in the continuum. Assuming that this delay is solely due to light travel times, the distance traveled by the light, corresponding to the radius of the broad emission-line region, can be measured.

Only a small handful of AGN (less than 40) have been accurately "mapped" in this way. An alternative approach is to use an empirical [[correlation]] between ''R''&lt;sub&gt;BLR&lt;/sub&gt; and the continuum luminosity.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt;

Another uncertainty is the value of ''f''. In principle, the response of the BLR to variations in the continuum could be used to map out the three-dimensional structure of the BLR. In practice, the amount and quality of data required to carry out such a [[deconvolution]] is prohibitive. Until about 2004, ''f'' was estimated ab initio based on simple models for the structure of the BLR. More recently, the value of ''f'' has been determined so as to bring the [[M-sigma relation]] for active galaxies into the best possible agreement with the [[M–sigma relation]] for quiescent galaxies.&lt;ref name=DEGN/&gt; When ''f'' is determined in this way, reverberation mapping becomes a "secondary", rather than "primary," mass estimation technique.

The '''Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO)''' is an internationally renowned [[Oceanography|marine science]] research institute located on the northern end of [[Skidaway Island, Georgia|Skidaway Island]] near [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States|USA]].&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skio.usg.edu/|title=Skidaway Institute of Oceanography|accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1968, it is now a research unit of the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name="aboutSkIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skio.usg.edu/aboutus/|title=Skidaway Institute of Oceanography|accessdate=2007-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821020406/http://www.skio.usg.edu/aboutus/|archivedate=2006-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not grant degrees, but its faculty serve as adjuncts to universities, and as mentors and advisors for visiting students and interns. SkIO faculty also frequently collaborate with marine scientists of other institutes both nationally and internationally. In 2012, it was announced that SkIO would be put under the management of the [[University of Georgia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skidaway Institute to become part of UGA|url=http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2012-11-13/skidaway-institute-become-part-uga|publisher=OnlineAthens|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an effort to streamline the University System of Georgia, the realignment with the University of Georgia being completed in July 2013.

==History==

===pre-SkIO===
Skidaway Island was originally a hunting and ceremonial ground of the [[Timucua]] Indians. European settlement of the island was successful between 1754 and 1771, and included John Milledge (the father of [[John Milledge]]), who established a plantation on the northern end. He named it "Modena," presumably after the [[Modena|Italian city]] for its famed production of [[silk]]. Silk was an early industry of the European settlers of coastal Georgia. The Modena Plantation grew corn, cotton, oranges and mulberry trees, and kept sheep, cattle, hogs and horses. It survived as a plantation into the 1840s, until John Milledge III sold it in 1843. The name "Modena" is still used to refer to the northern part of the island.

After the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), many of the plantations on the island were unable to continue without slave labor, and their owners gradually sold them to wealthy northerners, who mostly held them on speculation. Much of the island reverted to wilderness and was used mainly for hunting, trapping, fishing and lumber for several decades. The Modena Plantation changed hands sixteen more times after the war. In 1927 the property became a private hunting preserve for Ralph H. Isham, best known for purchasing a collection of [[James Boswell]]'s private papers from [[Baron Talbot of Malahide]] and passing them to [[Yale University]].

Mr. Isham sold the property in 1934 to Robert C. Roebling (great-grandson of [[John A. Roebling|John Augustus Roebling]]). The Roebling family (Robert, Dorothy, and five children) established a farm for [[Angus cattle|Black Angus cattle]] while living on their {{convert|176|ft|m|adj=on}} [[schooner]], the ''[[Schooner Black Douglas|Black Douglas]]'', which provided all of the power needed by the farm until it was sold in 1941 to the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. The cattle farm was very successful for the next twenty years, until it came to an end in 1954 due to post-[[World War II|WWII]] economic pressures. Many of the buildings from the farm are still standing and in use by SkIO, most notably the seven-sided barn with its compass rose mosaic at the center.

Another successful European settler of the mid-18th century was Henry Yonge, who had a plantation located just southeast of Modena, called Orangedale. In 1877 it came into the ownership of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Order]]. The Benedictines tried to establish a monastery and Catholic school for the newly freed former slaves on the island, but were unsuccessful. They abandoned their efforts in 1889. The "Priest tract," as the property had come to be called, became one of many acquired by a partnership of Thomas Bourke Floyd, James Boog Floyd, and A. Goden Guerard Jr. Thomas Floyd eventually assumed ownership of the entire middle portion of the island, until economic hardship forced a transfer to C&amp;S Bank in 1924. The [[Union Camp Corporation]] purchased it from the bank in 1941.

===The Founding of SkIO===
[[Image:Skidaway Institute of Oceanography.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to SkIO]]
In 1966, the Georgia Science and Technology Commission of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] proposed the establishment of an oceanographic research center on Skidaway Island. The thought at the time was to foster economic growth in coastal Georgia by attracting secondary industries of oceanography, in much the same way that secondary industries of space exploration had arisen around [[NASA]].

Dorothy Roebling donated approximately {{convert|790|acre|km2|1}} of the Modena property to the State of Georgia for this purpose in 1967, including {{convert|384|acre|km2|1}} of high land, all of the buildings and farm workers, and both of their docks on the Skidaway River at the western side of the island. In addition, Union Camp donated {{convert|635|acre|km2|1}} of the Orangedale property, including {{convert|300|acre|km2|1}} of high land with access to the Wilmington River at the eastern side of the island; this portion of the campus is now called Priest Landing.

With the land donations, the Georgia General Assembly created the "Ocean Science Center of the Atlantic (OSCA)" in 1967. The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography was officially created in January 1968 with Thomas Jackson (formerly of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]) as director, two co-directors, a secretary, and several former workers inherited from the Roebling farm. Its first faculty member, Herbert L. Windom, began work in July 1968. President [[Richard Nixon]] and Governor [[Lester Maddox]] dedicated the first building of the program in 1970. Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] dissolved OSCA in 1972, at which point SkIO became an independent research unit in the University System of Georgia.

SkIO has had five directors during its existence: Thomas Jackson (1967–1970), David Menzel (1970–1993), Herbert L. Windom (1994–2001), James G. Sanders (2002–2016), and Clark R. Alexander (2016–present).

==The Skidaway Marine Science Campus==

Much of the institute's research since its inception has focused on the southeastern U.S. [[continental shelf]], the influences of land, open ocean, and atmosphere on the continental shelf, and other continental shelf environments worldwide.

Several other institutions share the {{convert|684|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} campus with SkIO including:

===UGA Marine Extension Service===
The [[University of Georgia]] Marine Extension Service (UGA MAREX) consists of several educational outreach facilities in the state of Georgia, including one on the Skidaway Marine Science Campus. The [http://marex.uga.edu/ Marine Education Center and Aquarium (MECA)] operates a small public saltwater aquarium of local marine fish and invertebrates, which is visited by 18,000 schoolchildren per year. There is also a small research facility for [[shellfish]] [[aquaculture]].

===Gray's Reef===
The campus hosts the administering offices for [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s [[Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary]], which is one of thirteen [[United States National Marine Sanctuary|marine sanctuaries]] in the United States. It consists of {{convert|17|sqnmi|km2 sqmi|0}} of a nearshore live-bottom rock reef, {{convert|17|nmi|km mi|0}} off the coast of [[Sapelo Island]], Georgia.

===GSU Applied Coastal Research Lab===
Dr. Clark Alexander of SkIO is the director of [[Georgia Southern University]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613184618/http://cost.georgiasouthern.edu/geo/acrl.html Applied Coastal Research Laboratory (ACRL)], which studies sedimentary processes of the coastal zone of Georgia, such as [[Hydrogeology|groundwater hydrology]] and [[Erosion#Shoreline|shoreline erosion]].

===CIRE Lab===
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070331141437/http://www.skio.usg.edu/aboutus/info/cire.php CIRE program] ("A '''C'''ollaboration to '''I'''ntegrate '''R'''esearch and '''E'''ducation in Marine and Environmental Science and Biotechnology") of [[Savannah State University]] (SSU) collaborates with SkIO to operate a teaching laboratory on the campus. It provides hands-on research experience to undergraduate marine science students from SSU.

===Georgia Tech Chemical Ecology Lab===
Dr. [[Mark Hay]] of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] has a laboratory facility at Priest Landing for studies in [[chemical ecology]]. Research focuses on the ability of marine fauna to detect predators, prey, competitors, and compatriots by smell, at varying levels of water turbulence.

===Georgia Aquarium===
The [[Georgia Aquarium]] has a specimen collection facility at Priest Landing.

===Georgia DNR===
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources Historic Preservation Division operates the Coastal Underwater Archaeology Field Station on campus. The field station manages, surveys, and protects state-owned underwater and shoreline archaeological sites on navigable inland and coastal waterways extending three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) offshore. The station provides archaeological assistance to local, state, and federal agencies as well as the general public by offering information, support, educational opportunities, and technical guidance regarding Georgia’s underwater cultural resources and maritime heritage.

==Research Vessels and Facilities==
[[Image:RVSavannah2007.JPG|thumb|right|The ''R/V Savannah'' [[research vessel]] at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography]]SkIO operates the ''R/V Savannah'', a {{convert|92|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[research vessel]]. Unlike its predecessor, the {{convert|72|ft|m|0|adj=on}} ''R/V Blue Fin'' (1970–2001) which had the hull of a [[fishing trawler]] and was originally a yacht named ''Princess Anne'', the ''Savannah'' was specifically designed for marine research by the scientists who use it. It has a full-time crew of four and has been in operation since 2001.

In addition to the two docks originally from the Roebling farm and a third dock later constructed on the Skidaway River, a {{convert|300|ft|m|-1|adj=on}} dock was constructed at Priest Landing to provide low-tide access for large research and other seagoing vessels from the Wilmington River. It was completed in 1972.

{{About-distinguish|Social Practice as a minor psychological theory|Practice Theory}}

{{For|the art medium of Social Practice|Social practice (art)}}

'''Social practice''' is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smolka, A. L. B. (2001). Social practice and social change: activity theory in perspective. Human Development, 44(6), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in psychology==
Through research, [[Sylvia Scribner]] sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Hedegaard, M. (1998). A cultural-historical approach to mind. Human Development, 41(3), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.

==Social practice as activity==
Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives.&lt;ref&gt;“What is social practice?” (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://spiritstorelimerick.weebly.com/what-is-social-practice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, D., Tan, S. C., &amp; Koh, T. S. (2006). From traditional to constructivist epistemologies: a proposed theoretical framework based on activity theory for learning communities. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17(1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social practice as inquiry==
Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Herndl, C. G., &amp; Nahrwold, C. A. (2000). Research as social practice: a case study of research on technical and professional communication. Written Communication, 17(2), 158-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education===
In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D. W. (2010). Directions for studying early literacy as social practice. Language Arts, 88(2), 134-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Under social practice, [[literacy]] is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and [[numeracy]] are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.

===Literature===
As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, P., Ferguson, P. P., &amp; Griswold, W. (Eds.). (1989). Literature and social practice, 1st Ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and social practice===
{{main|Social practice (art)}}

'''Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Confidential,'' Chicago Tribune, Business, Section 2, Sunday, January 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;''' is an educational center in [[Chicago]], Illinois. Not affiliated with any single branch of [[Judaism]], Spertus offers learning opportunities that are "rooted in Jewish wisdom and culture and open to all."&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.spertus.edu/about "About"] on the Spertus Institute website&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate programs and workshops "train leaders and engage individuals in exploration of Jewish life."&lt;ref name=about /&gt;  Public programs include films,&lt;ref&gt;''Spertus to screen tale of two cultures,'' Chicago Tribune, November 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; speakers,&lt;ref&gt;''Book marks,'' Chicago Jewish Star, January 25-February 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; seminars, concerts,&lt;ref&gt;''Jazz meets Jewish music in a Hanukkah Jam,'' Chicago Tribune, December 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibits&lt;ref&gt;''Tales, Myths, and Nightmares,'' JUF News, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; — at the Institute’s main campus at 610 S. [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], as well as in the Chicago suburbs and online.

==Architecture of the Spertus Institute building==
In November 2007, Spertus Institute opened an award-winning,&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago AIA Awards 2008,'' Architecture Week, January 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; environmentally sustainable facility at 610 S. Michigan Avenue. Designed by Chicago-based [[Krueck and Sexton Architects]], the building features interconnected interior spaces and an unusual ten-story faceted window wall that provides views of the Chicago skyline, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], and [[Lake Michigan]]. This window wall is built from 726 individual pieces of glass in 556 different shapes.&lt;ref&gt;"Light radiates throughout new home of Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies," ''JUF News'', November 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The building also houses a 400-seat theater, space for community events and [[kosher]] catering facilities.

Like the surrounding buildings, many constructed in the period of architectural innovation that followed the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, this building is forward-looking in its design and use of materials, while maintaining respect for its setting.{{fact|date=December 2017}} Like the bays of its 19th- and 20th-century neighbors, the facets that create the façade’s dynamic crystalline form allow light to extend into the narrow building, while expanding the views enjoyed from inside.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}} The geometry of the façade is unique because the surface is constantly tilting in three dimensions, resulting in individual units of glass that are parallelograms rather than rectangles.{{tone-inline|date=December 2017}} At the same time, the average size of each of the façade's individual panes of glass is consistent with the standard size of the windows in the buildings up and down [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The Spertus building was the first new construction in the [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]] after the area was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002. The cost of the Spertus project was more than $50 million.&lt;ref name ="Kamin"&gt;Blair Kamin, "Blades of Glass," ''Chicago Tribune'', November 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Meadville Lombard Theological School]], a [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[seminary]], relocated from its [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] location to the sixth floor of the Spertus building. Academic and administrative tasks of the school now take place in the Spertus building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadville.edu/Ab_News_loopmove.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110103444/http://www.meadville.edu/Ab_News_loopmove.html |archivedate=2012-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He practiced medicine for 30 years in [[Liverpool]], and was a founder of the [[Royal Institution of Liverpool]], the [[Liverpool Mechanics' Institution]] and the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool]]. He became acquainted with the Arctic explorer [[William Scoresby]], contributing a list of animals observed in eastern [[Greenland]] to Scoresby's ''Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale Fishery'' (1823). Scoresby named [[Traill Island]] in Greenland for him.

When [[John James Audubon]] arrived in Liverpool in July 1826 Traill helped him to find a publisher for his ''The Birds of America''. Audubon named the Traill's flycatcher after him, which at one time referred to a species which included both the [[willow flycatcher]] (''Empidonax traillii'') and the [[alder flycatcher]] (''Empidonax alnorum'').

==University of Edinburgh and the Encyclopædia Britannica==
Traill returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1832 as a professor of medical jurisprudence, and served in this role until death, also serving as President of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh]] 1852 to 1854.&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt; He edited the 8th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (1852–61), which concluded a year before his death.

He was President of the [[Royal Scottish Society of the Arts]] 1843-44.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rssa.org.uk/history/past-presidents.shtml|title=RSSA: History: Past Presidents|website=www.rssa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840 he was living at 10 Albyn Place in Edinburgh's [[Moray Estate]] close to [[Charlotte Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1840&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Edinburgh on 30 July 1862, and was interred at [[St Cuthbert's cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt; The grave contains members of both the Omond family and Traill family and stands against an outer eastern wall of the southern section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2421">'''Tolerable daily intake''' ('''TDI''') refers to the daily amount of a chemical that has been assessed safe for human being on long-term basis (usually whole lifetime). Originally [[acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) was introduced in 1961 to define the daily intake of a [[food additive]] which, during the entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable [[Risk management|risk]].&lt;ref name=Faustman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Faustman |first1=Elaine M. |last2=Omenn |first2=Gilbert S. |chapter=Risk assessment |editor1-first=Curtis D. |editor1-last=Klaassen |title=Casarett &amp; Doull's Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisons |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=92–4 |isbn=978-0-07-134721-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For contaminants and other foreign chemicals not used intentionally, the term TDI is often preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/713810655 |title=Consultation on assessment of the health risk of dioxins; re-evaluation of the tolerable daily intake (TDI): Executive Summary |year=2000 |journal=Food Additives and Contaminants |volume=17 |issue=4 |pmid=10912238 |pages=223–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ADI and TDI are usually assessed based on [[animal experiments]], and it is most often hundreds of times lower than the dose causing [[no observable adverse effect level|no observable adverse effect]] (NOAEL) in the most sensitive tested animal species.&lt;ref name=Faustman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Renwick |first1=A.

The [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects.

'''Virginia Wesleyan University''' is a comprehensive university of the liberal arts and sciences located in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. Founded in 1961 by the Virginia Conference of [[United Methodist Church|The United Methodist Church]], the university enrolls approximately 1,500 students annually in undergraduate, graduate, and online programs. An additional 510 non-credit continuing education students enroll annually through the Robert F. Boyd Institute, the Center for the Study of Religious Freedom, the Center for Sacred Music, and the Westminster/Wesleyan Lifelong Learning Institute. Virginia Wesleyan transitioned from a college to a university in 2017.

The Virginia Wesleyan University campus is also home to the Chesapeake Bay Academy, an educational institution founded in 1989 that educates and guides students with learning disabilities, including attention disorders (ADHD), dyslexia, and dysgraphia, and the Tidewater Collegiate Academy, an innovative laboratory for teaching and learning that extends from the primary grades through high school.

Through academic collaboration with local arts and sciences partners, on-site learning experiences are also provided at the [[Virginia Aquarium &amp; Marine Science Center]] in Virginia Beach (the university and aquarium jointly own and operate "The Ocean Explorer," a marine science research vessel); The [[Chrysler Museum of Art]] in Norfolk; [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]]; and the [[Norfolk Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/about-us/accolades.php|title=Accolades|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school was chartered in 1961 as Virginia Wesleyan College under the initiative of Methodist minister Joseph S. Johnston, later the college's first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/about-us/our-history.php|title=Our History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a university in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vwu.edu/news-a-events/news-releases/virginia-wesleyan-college-announces-transition-to-university-status|title="Virginia Wesleyan Announces Transition to University Status"|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Virginia Wesleyan University consists of three schools devoted to specific areas of study: the Susan S. Goode School of Arts and Humanities, the Joan P. Brock School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, and the Birdsong School of Social Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/academics/|title=Academics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.vwu.edu/academics/batten-honors-college/ Batten Honors College], named for Virginia Wesleyan Trustee Emerita Jane Batten and her late husband [[Frank Batten|Frank Batten, Sr.]], was founded in 2017 with a mission to "inspire, engage, and prepare academically talented students to become leaders, environmental stewards, and impactful citizens in the global community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/academics/batten-honors-college/|title=Batten Honors College|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.vwu.edu/academics/university-college.php University College] at Virginia Wesleyan University operates all for-credit programs outside of the traditional undergraduate program and also supports non-credit, continuing-education offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/academics/university-college.php|title=University College|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Situated on {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in Virginia Beach, the university is separated into four villages.

The university maintains an Athletic Hall of Fame honoring those who have made lasting contributions to Virginia Wesleyan's intercollegiate athletic program through outstanding achievements or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vwu.edu/alumni-a-friends/athletic-hall-of-fame/|title=Athletic Hall of Fame|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Virginia Wesleyan University has earned recognition as one of the top NCAA Division III programs in the country. The men's basketball team won the national championship in 2006, and the following year returned to the championship game, which they lost. The women's soccer team made it to the final four in 2006 after winning the ODAC tournament for the first time in program history. In 2016, Evan Cox was the Individual NCAA National Champion for Men's Golf. The Virginia Wesleyan softball team won the 2017 NCAA Division III National Championship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/softball/article/2017-05-29/diii-softball-championship-virginia-wesleyan-sweeps-final-against|title=DIII softball championship: Virginia Wesleyan sweeps final against St. John Fisher|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a record 54 wins. Head Coach Brandon Elliott was named ODAC Coach of the Year and State Coach of the Year, while his coaching staff earned Regional and National Coaching Staff of the Year honors. Freshman pitcher Hanna Hull earned 2017 Schutt Sports/NFCA Division III National Freshman of the Year and honors as the first National Player of the Year in program history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vwuathletics.com/sports/sball/championshipcentral|title=Virginia Wesleyan Softball|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, they repeated as NCAA Champions, Hull was again National Player of the Year, and Elliott's staff again earned National Coaching Staff of the Year honors.

The success has been greeted with support from private donors for new and renovated facilities:

* In 2015: Construction of Birdsong Field complete with artificial turf, lights, 300 seats, press box, pavilion, and “jumbo” scoreboard. The facility is used by field hockey, men's and women's lacrosse, recreation, and in inclement weather by men's and women's soccer.
* In 2016: Fully renovated Kenneth R. Perry Field for the baseball team.
* In 2017: Renovated the aquatics facility in the Jane P. Batten Student Center to serve as the home of the new men's and women's swimming teams.

'''Waterway restoration''' is the activity of restoring a [[canal]] or [[river]], including special features such as [[warehouse]] buildings, [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], [[boat lift]]s, and boats. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the focus of waterway restoration is on improving [[navigability]], while in [[Australia]] the term may also include improvements to [[water quality]]. ''(For water quality improvement activity in the US and UK see [[stream restoration]].)''

===Shubenacadie Canal===
The [[Shubenacadie Canal]] Commission was formed in 1986 to oversee the future of this waterway. Locks three and five have been restored, water levels in the connecting lakes have been stabilized and a visitor center opened. The ten year business plan [http://shubie.chebucto.org/documents/overview_000.pdf] for 2007-2016 aims to save four more locks and  rebuild four water control structures to make the route open for small boats from Lake Banook to the village of [[Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia|Shubenacadie]].

===Soulanges Canal===
The [[Soulanges Canal]] closed in 1958. Today there are plans to reopen the canal to pleasure boats. The mission of the Régie intermunicipale du canal de Soulanges is to manage the development of a  tourism development as part of the reopening of the canal.

===Suvorov military canals===

[[Suvorov military canals]] (Suvorov canals) is a series of four open [[canal]]s on [[Saimaa|Saimaa lake]] in Finland. Apart from the Kutvele canal, the other three canals spent 200 years almost untouched from early 19th century until 2003, when [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]] began restoration works on them. Now they have been turned into tourist attractions.

===Tar canals===

The tar canals in [[Kajaani]] were canals and locks built to pass the Koivukoski and Ämmäkoski rapids. First used in 1846, the locks were vital in the transportation of wood [[pine tar]] to [[Oulu]]. The worn down canals were closed in 1915. Refurbished Ämmäkoski lock was re-opened in 1984, but the Koivukoski canal has been totally dismantled and the site now houses a hydroelectric power plant. The refurbished canal is not used for transport, but in summertime, tar boat shows are organised for tourists.&lt;ref&gt; City of [[Kajaani]].

==Waterway restoration in the United Kingdom==
[[File:Droitwich canal restoration.jpg|thumb|Excavation work at [[Salwarpe]] on the Droitwich Canal during 1978 Waterway Recovery Group summer work camp.]]
Due to competition from the [[railway]]s and the narrow design of most [[United Kingdom|UK]] canals (which prevented the carriage of economically sized bulk loads), large parts of the [[list of canals in the United Kingdom|UK's canal system]] were abandoned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The rise of the leisure industry in the 1950s meant that the complete abandonment of the remaining canals was avoided.

The increasing use of canals for leisure purposes led some people to consider restoring some of those that had been abandoned. At first, progress was slow due to the lack of funding, with most of the work having to be done manually by volunteers.

As the leisure industry grew, the economic benefits of having a canal became more apparent and some state funding started to appear. At the same time public interest increased the size of various volunteer groups.

At the present time, canal restoration in the UK is carried out by a mixture of volunteers and professionals working on a large variety of projects.

The '''World Values Survey''' ('''WVS'''), a global [[research project]], explores people's [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and [[belief]]s, how they change over time and what social and political impact they have. Since 1981 a worldwide network of [[social scientists]] have conducted representative national [[Statistical survey|surveys]] as part of WVS in almost 100 countries.

The WVS measures, monitors and analyzes: support for [[democracy]], tolerance of foreigners and [[ethnic minorities]], support for [[gender equality]], the role of [[religion]] and changing levels of [[religiosity]], the impact of [[globalization]], attitudes toward the [[Natural environment| environment]], [[Labour economics |work]], [[family]], [[politics]], national identity, [[culture]], [[multiculturalism |diversity]],  insecurity,  and [[subjective well-being]].

The findings provide information for policy makers seeking to build [[civil society]] and democratic institutions in [[developing countries]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} The work is also frequently used by governments around the world, scholars, students, journalists and international organizations and institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the United Nations ([[United Nations Development Programme | UNDP]] and [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme | UN-Habitat]]). Data from the World Values Survey have (for example) been used{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to better understand the motivations behind events such as the [[Arab Spring]], the [[2005 French civil unrest]], the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994 and the [[Yugoslav wars]] and political upheaval in the 1990s. {{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

[[Romano Prodi]], former Prime Minister of Italy and the tenth President of the [[European Commission]], said about WVS work:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The growing globalization of the world makes it increasingly important to understand ... diversity.  People with varying beliefs and values can live together and work together productively, but for this to happen it is crucial to understand and appreciate their distinctive [[worldview]]s.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = xiii}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insights==
The WVS has over the years demonstrated that people's [[beliefs]] play a key role in [[economic development]], the emergence and flourishing of democratic institutions, the rise of [[gender equality]], and the extent to which societies have effective [[government]].

===Inglehart–Welzel cultural map===
{{main|Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world}}

Analysis of WVS data made by political scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] asserts that there are two major dimensions of cross cultural variation in the world: 
# '''Traditional values''' versus '''Secular-rational values''' and 
# '''Survival values''' versus '''Self-expression values'''.
The global cultural map (below) shows how scores of societies are located on these two dimensions. Moving upward on this map reflects the shift from Traditional values to Secular-rational and moving rightward reflects the shift from Survival values to Self–expression values.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Traditional values'' emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide.  These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Secular-rational values'' have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Survival values'' place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively [[ethnocentric]] outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

''Self-expression values'' give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life.&lt;ref name=wvs-old/&gt;

====Culture variations====
A somewhat simplified analysis is that following an increase in [[standards of living]], and a transit from development country via [[industrialization]] to  [[post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Society#Knowledge society|knowledge society]], a country tends to move diagonally in the direction from lower-left corner (poor) to upper-right corner (rich), indicating a transit in both dimensions.

However, the attitudes among the population are also highly correlated with the philosophical, political and religious ideas that have been dominating in the country. Secular-rational values and [[materialism]] were formulated by philosophers and the [[left-wing politics]] side in the [[French revolution]], and can consequently be observed especially in countries with a long history of social democratic or socialistic policy, and in  countries where a large portion of the population have studied philosophy and science at universities.  Survival values are characteristic for eastern-world countries and self-expression values for western-world countries. In a liberal [[post-industrial economy]], an increasing share of the population has grown up taking survival and freedom of thought for granted, resulting in that self-expression is highly valued.

====Examples====
* Societies that have high scores in Traditional and Survival values: Zimbabwe, Morocco, Jordan, Bangladesh.
* Societies with high scores in Traditional and Self-expression values: the U.S., most of Latin America, Ireland.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Survival values: Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Estonia.
* Societies with high scores in Secular-rational and Self-expression values: Japan, [[Nordic countries]], Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, Czechia, Slovenia, France.

===Gender values===
Findings from the WVS indicate that support for [[gender equality]] is not just a consequence of [[democratization]]. It is part of a broader cultural change that is transforming [[Industrialisation|industrialized societies]] with mass demands for increasingly democratic institutions. Although a majority of the world's population still believes that men make better political leaders than women, this view is fading in advanced industrialized societies, and also among young people in less prosperous countries.{{Sfn | Alesina | Giuliano | Nunn | 2010}}

===Religion===
The data from the World Values Survey cover several important aspects of people's religious orientation.  One of them tracks how involved people are in religious services and how much importance they attach to their religious beliefs.  In the data from 2000, 98% of the public in [[Indonesia]] said that religion was very important in their lives while in [[China]] only three percent considered religion very important.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Basanez | Diez-Medrano | Halman | 2004 | p = 2}}  Another aspect concerns people's attitudes towards the relation between religion and politics and whether they approve of religious spokesmen who try to influence government decisions and people's voting preferences.

In a [[factor analysis]] of the latest wave (6) of World Values Survey data, [[Arno Tausch]] ([[Corvinus University Budapest]]) found that family values in the tradition of [[Joseph Alois Schumpeter]] and religious values in the research tradition of [[Robert Barro]] can be an important positive asset for society. Negative phenomena, like the distrust in the state of law; the shadow economy; the distance from altruistic values; a growing fatigue of democracy; and the lack of entrepreneurial spirit are all correlated with the loss of [[religiosity]]. Tausch based his results on a [[factor analysis]] with [[promax]] rotation of 78 variables from 45 countries with complete data, and also calculated performance indices for the 45 countries with complete data and the nine main global religious denominations. On this account, [[Judaism]] and also [[Protestantism]] emerge as most closely combining religion and the traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A. (2015) Towards new maps of global human values, based on World Values Survey (6) data. [[Corvinus University Budapest]] https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/63349.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Happiness and life satisfaction===
The WVS has shown that from 1981 to 2007 happiness rose in 45 of the 52 countries for which long-term data are available.&lt;ref name=wvs-old2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |title=Is Denmark the happiest country in the world? |publisher=WVS |author=WVSA |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019111440/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_122 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, economic development, democratization, and rising social tolerance have increased the extent to which people perceive that they have free choice, which in turn has led to higher levels of happiness around the world, which supports the [[human development theory]].&lt;ref name=wvs-old2/&gt;

===Findings===
Some of the survey's basic findings are:
# Much of the variation in human values between societies boils down to two broad dimensions: a first dimension of “''traditional vs. secular-rational values''” and a second dimension of “''survival vs. self-expression values''.”{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the first dimension, traditional values emphasize religiosity, national pride, respect for authority, obedience and marriage. Secular-rational values emphasize the opposite on each of these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# On the second dimension, survival values involve a priority of security over liberty, non-acceptance of homosexuality, abstinence from political action, distrust in outsiders and a weak sense of happiness. Self-expression values imply the opposite on all these accounts.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# Following the ‘revised theory of modernization,’ values change in predictable ways with certain aspects of modernity. People's priorities shift from traditional to secular-rational values as their ''sense of existential security'' increases (or backwards from secular-rational values to traditional values as their sense of existential security decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in existential security occurs with the ''transition from agrarian to industrial societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from traditional towards secular-rational values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# People's priorities shift from survival to self-expression values as their ''sense of individual agency'' increases (or backwards from self-expression values to survival as the sense of individual agency decreases).{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The largest increase in individual agency occurs with the ''transition from industrial to knowledge societies''. Consequently, the largest shift from survival to self-expression values happens in this phase.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2005 | loc = chapter 2}}
# The value differences between societies around the world show a pronounced ''culture zone pattern''. The strongest emphasis on traditional values and survival values is found in the Islamic societies of the Middle East. By contrast, the strongest emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values is found in the Protestant societies of Northern Europe.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# These culture zone differences reflect different ''historical pathways'' of how entire groups of societies entered modernity. These pathways account for people's different senses of existential security and individual agency, which in turn account for their different emphases on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Values also differ within societies along such cleavage lines as gender, generation, ethnicity, religious denomination, education, income and so forth.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# Generally speaking, groups whose living conditions provide people with a stronger sense of existential security and individual agency nurture a stronger emphasis on secular-rational values and self-expression values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# However, the ''within''-societal differences in people's values are dwarfed by a factor five to ten by the ''between''-societal differences. On a global scale, basic living conditions differ still much more between than within societies, and so do the experiences of existential security and individual agency that shape people's values.{{Sfn | Inglehart | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 551–67}}
# A specific subset of self-expression values—''[[emancipation|emancipative]] values''—combines an emphasis on freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. Emancipative values, thus, involve priorities for lifestyle liberty, gender equality, personal [[autonomy]] and the voice of the people.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values constitute the key cultural component of a broader process of ''human empowerment''. Once set in motion, this process empowers people to exercise freedoms in their course of actions.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# If set in motion, human empowerment advances on three levels. On the socio-economic level, human empowerment advances as growing ''action resources'' increase people's capabilities to exercise freedoms. On the socio-cultural level, human empowerment advances as rising ''emancipative values'' increase people's aspirations to exercise freedoms.  On the legal-institutional level, human empowerment advances as widened ''democratic rights'' increase people's entitlements to exercise freedoms.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Klingemann | 2003 | pp = 341–80}}
# Human empowerment is an ''entity of empowering capabilities, aspirations, and entitlements''. As an entity, human empowerment tends to advance in virtuous spirals or to recede in vicious spirals on each of its three levels.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2008 | pp = 126–40}}
# As the cultural component of human empowerment, emancipative values are highly consequential in manifold ways. For one, emancipative values establish a ''civic form of modern individualism'' that favours out-group trust and cosmopolitan orientations towards others.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–23}}
# Emancipative values encourage ''nonviolent protest'', even against the risk of repression. Thus, emancipative values provide [[social capital]] that activates societies, makes publics more self-expressive, and vitalizes civil society. Emancipative values advance entire societies’ civic agency.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | Deutsch | 2005 | p = 121–46}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are democratic, they help to ''prevent movements away from democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# If emancipative values grow strong in countries that are undemocratic, they help to trigger ''movements towards democracy''.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values exert these effects because they encourage mass actions that put power holders under pressures to sustain, substantiate or establish democracy, depending on what the current challenge for democracy is.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Objective factors that have been found to favour democracy (including economic prosperity, income equality, ethnic homogeneity, world market integration, global media exposure, closeness to democratic neighbours, a Protestant heritage, social capital and so forth) exert an influence on democracy mostly insofar as these factors favour emancipative values.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2007 | pp = 397–424}}
# Emancipative values do not strengthen people's desire for democracy, for the desire for democracy is universal at this point in history. But emancipative values do change the ''nature of the desire for democracy''. And they do so in a double way.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# For one, emancipative values make people's understanding of democracy more liberal: people with stronger emancipative values emphasize the empowering features of democracy rather than bread-and-butter and law-and-order issues.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Next, emancipative values make people assess the level of their country's democracy more critical: people with stronger emancipative values rather underrate than overrate their country's democratic performance.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Together, then, emancipative values generate a ''critical-liberal desire for democracy''. The critical-liberal desire for democracy is a formidable force of democratic reforms.  And, it is the best available predictor of a country's effective level of democracy and of other indicators of good governance. Neither democratic traditions nor cognitive mobilization account for the strong positive impact of emancipative values on the critical-liberal desire for democracy.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 311–29}}
# Emancipative values constitute the single most important factor in advancing the [[empowerment]] of women. Economic, religious, and institutional factors that have been found to advance women's empowerment, do so for the most part because they nurture emancipative values.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2010 | pp = 1–21}}
# Emancipative values change people's life strategy from an emphasis on securing a decent subsistence level to enhancing human agency. As the shift from subsistence to agency affects entire societies, the overall level of [[subjective well-being]] rises.{{Sfn | Welzel | Inglehart | 2010 | pp = 43–63}}
# The emancipative consequences of the human empowerment process are not a culture-specific peculiarity of the ‘West.’ The same empowerment processes that advance emancipative values and a critical-liberal desire for democracy in the ‘West,’ do the same in the ‘East’ and in other culture zones.{{Sfn | Welzel | 2011 | pp = 1–31}}
# The social dominance of Islam and individual identification as Muslim both weaken emancipative values. But among young Muslims with high education, and especially among young Muslim women with high education, the Muslim/Non-Muslim gap over emancipative values closes.{{Sfn | Alexander | Welzel | 2011}}

==History==
The World Values Surveys were designed to test the hypothesis that economic and technological changes are transforming the basic values and motivations of the publics of industrialized societies. The surveys build on the [[European Values Study]] (EVS) first carried out in 1981. The EVS was conducted under the aegis of [[Jan Kerkhofs]] and [[Ruud de Moor]] and continues to be based in the [[Netherlands]] at the [[Tilburg University]]. The 1981 study was largely limited to developed societies, but interest in this project spread so widely that surveys were carried out in more than twenty countries, located on all six inhabited continents. [[Ronald Inglehart]] of the [[University of Michigan]] played a leading role in extending these surveys to be carried out in countries around the world. Today the network includes hundreds of social scientist from more than 100 countries.

Findings from the first wave of surveys pointed to the conclusion that intergenerational changes were taking place in basic values relating to politics, economic life, religion, gender roles, family norms and sexual norms. The values of younger generations differed consistently from those prevailing among older generations, particularly in societies that had experienced rapid economic growth. To examine whether changes were actually taking place in these values and to analyze the underlying causes, a second wave of WVS surveys was carried out in 1990–91. Because these changes seem to be linked with economic and technological development, it was important to include societies across the entire range of development, from low income societies to rich societies.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

A third wave of surveys was carried out in 1995–97, this time in 55 societies and with increased attention being given to analysing the cultural conditions for democracy. A fourth wave of surveys was carried out in 1999–2001 in 65 societies. A key goal was to obtain better coverage of African and Islamic societies, which had been under-represented in previous surveys. A fifth wave was carried out in 2005–07 and a sixth wave was carried out during 2011–12.&lt;ref name=wvs51&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |title=Building A Worldwide Network Of Social Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409204339/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_51 |archivedate=April 9, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the European origin of the project, the early waves of the WVS were [[eurocentric]] in emphasis, with little representation in Africa and South-East Asia. To expand, the WVS adopted a decentralised structure, in which social scientists from countries throughout the world participated in the design, execution and analysis of the data, and in publication of findings. In return for providing the data from a survey in their own society, each group obtained immediate access to the data from all participating societies enabling them to analyse social change in a broader perspective.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt;

The WVS network has produced over 300 publications in 20 languages and secondary users have produced several thousand additional publications.&lt;ref name=wvs51/&gt; The database of the WVS has been published on the internet with free access.

The official archive of the World Values Survey is located in [ASEP/JDS] [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

==Methodology==
The World Values Survey uses the [[sample survey]] as its mode of data collection, a systematic and standardized approach to collect information through interviewing representative national samples of individuals. The basic stages of a sample survey are Questionnaire design; [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]]; [[Data collection]] and [[Analysis]].

===Questionnaire design===
For each wave, suggestions for questions are solicited by social scientists from all over the world and a final master [[questionnaire]] is developed in English. Since the start in 1981 each successive wave has covered a broader range of societies than the previous one. Analysis of the data from each wave has indicated that certain questions tapped interesting and important concepts while others were of little value. This has led to the more useful questions or themes being replicated in future waves while the less useful ones have been dropped making room for new questions.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 386}}

The questionnaire is translated into the various national languages and in many cases independently translated back to English to check the accuracy of the translation. In most countries, the translated questionnaire is pre-tested to help identify questions for which the translation is problematic. In some cases certain problematic questions are omitted from the national questionnaire.

===Sampling===
Samples are drawn from the entire population of 18 years and older. The minimum sample is 1000. In most countries, no upper age limit is imposed and some form of stratified random [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] is used to obtain representative national samples. In the first stages, a random selection of sampling points is made based on the given society statistical regions, districts, census units, election sections, [[electoral registers]] or [[polling place]] and central population registers. In most countries the population size and/or degree of [[urbanization]] of these Primary Sampling Units are taken into account. In some countries, individuals are drawn from national registers.{{Sfn | Esmer | 2004 | p = 390}}

===Data collection and field work===
Following the sampling, each country is left with a representative national sample of its public. These persons are then interviewed during a limited time frame decided by the Executive Committee of the World Values Survey using the uniformly structured questionnaires. The survey is carried out by professional organizations using face-to-face [[interviews]] or phone interviews for remote areas. Each country has a Principal Investigator (social scientists working in academic institutions) who is responsible for conducting the survey in accordance with the fixed rules and procedures.  During the field work, the agency has to report in writing according to a specific check-list.  Internal consistency checks are made between the sampling design and the outcome and rigorous data cleaning procedures are followed at the WVS data archive. No country is included in a wave before full documentation has been delivered. This means a data set with the completed methodological questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/survey_2005 | title = World values survey | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a report of country-specific information (for example important political events during the fieldwork, problems particular to the country). Once all the surveys are completed, the Principal Investigator has access to all surveys and data.

===Analysis===
The World Values Survey group works with leading social scientists, recruited from each society studied. They represent a wide range of cultures and perspectives which makes it possible to draw on the insights of well-informed insiders in interpreting the findings. It also helps disseminate social science techniques to new countries.

Each research team, that has contributed to the survey,  analyses the findings according to its hypotheses. Because all researchers obtain data from all of the participating societies, they are also able to compare the values and beliefs of the people of their own society with those from scores of other societies and to test alternative hypotheses. In addition, the participants are invited to international meetings at which they can compare findings and interpretations with other members of the WVS network. The findings are then disseminated through international conferences and joint publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/new_index_publications | title = New index publications | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The World Values Survey data has been downloaded by over 100,000 researchers, journalists, policy-makers and others. The data is available on the WVS website which contains tools developed for online analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/index_surveys | title = Index surveys | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==
The World Values Survey is organised as a network of social scientists coordinated by a central body - the World Values Survey Association. It is established as a non-profit organization seated in Stockholm, Sweden, with a constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52/files/constitution.pdf | title = Constitution | format = PDF | publisher = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_52 | title = World values survey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is guided by an Executive Committee representing all regions of the world. The Committee is also supported by a Scientific Advisory Committee, a Secretariat and an Archive. The WVS Executive Committee provides leadership and strategic planning for the association. It is responsible for the recruitment of new members, the organization of meetings and workshops, data processing and distribution, capacity building and the promotion of publications and dissemination of results. The WVS Executive Committee also raises funds for central functions and assists member groups in their fundraising.

Each national team is responsible for its own expenses and most surveys are financed by local sources. However, central funding has been obtained in cases where local funding is not possible. Presently, the activities of the WVS Secretariat and WVS Executive Committee are funded by the [[Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation]]. Other funding has been obtained from the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA), the Volkswagen Foundation, the [[German Science Foundation (DFG)]] and the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]].
