Static '''atmospheric models''' describe how the [[ideal gas]] properties (namely: pressure, temperature, density, and molecular weight) of an atmosphere change, primarily as a function of [[altitude]].  The [[World Meteorological Organization]] defines a standard atmosphere as "a hypothetical vertical distribution of atmospheric temperature, pressure and density which, by international agreement, is roughly representative of year-round, [[midlatitude]] conditions. Typical usages are as a basis for [[Altimeter#Pressure altimeter|pressure altimeter]] calibrations, aircraft performance calculations, aircraft and rocket design, [[External ballistics#Ambient air density|ballistic]] tables, and meteorological diagrams."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| author-link = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | author2 = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | author2-link = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | author3 = United States Air Force | author3-link = United States Air Force | date = October 1976 | title = U. S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 | publisher = U. S. Government Printing Office | publication-place = Washington, D.C. | page = xiv | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770009539.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[U.S. Standard Atmosphere]] derives the values for air temperature, pressure, and mass density, as a function of altitude above sea level.

Other static atmospheric models may have other outputs, or depend on inputs besides altitude.

==Basic assumptions==
The gas which comprises an atmosphere is usually assumed to be an [[ideal gas]], which is to say:

&lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{M P}{R T} &lt;/math&gt;

Where ''ρ'' is mass density, ''M'' is average molecular weight, ''P'' is pressure, ''T'' is temperature, and ''R'' is the ideal gas constant.

The gas is held in place by so-called "[[hydrostatic]]" forces.   That is to say, for a particular layer of gas at some altitude: the downward (towards the planet) force of its weight, the downward force exerted by pressure in the layer above it, and the upward force exerted by pressure in  the layer below, all sum to zero.  Mathematically this is:

:&lt;math&gt;P A - (P + \text{d}P) A - (\rho A \text{d}h) g_0 = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{d}P = - g_0 \rho \text{d}h \,&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, these variables describing the system do not change with time; i.e. it is a static system.

==Some examples==

Depending on the model, some gas properties may be treated as constant with respect to altitude.

===Ocean example===
If the density of a gas is persistent, then it isn't really behaving like a gas.  Instead it is behaving like an [[incompressible fluid]], or [[liquid]], and this situation looks more like an ocean.  Assuming density is constant, then a graph of pressure vs altitude will have a retained slope, since the weight of the ocean over head is directly proportional to its depth.

[[Image:Liquid ocean atmosphere model.png]]

===Isothermal-barotropic approximation and scale height===

This atmospheric model assumes both molecular weight and temperature are constant over a wide range of altitude. Such a model may be called [[isothermal]] (constant temperature). Inserting constant molecular weight and constant temperature into the equation for the [[ideal gas law]] produces the result that density and pressure, the two remaining variables, depend only on each other.  For this reason, this model may also be called [[barotropic]] (density depends only on pressure).

For the isothermal-barotropic model, density and pressure turn out to be exponential functions of altitude.  The increase in  altitude necessary for ''P'' or ''ρ'' to drop to 1/''e'' of its initial value is called the [[scale height]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{R T}{M g_0} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the ideal gas constant, ''T'' is temperature, ''M'' is average molecular weight, and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the gravitational acceleration at the planet's surface. Using the values ''T''=273 K and ''M''=29 g/mol as characteristic of the Earth's atmosphere, ''H'' = ''RT''/''Mg'' = (8.315*273)/(29*9.8) = 7.99, or about 8&amp;nbsp;km, which coincidentally is approximate height of [[Mount Everest|Mt. Everest]].

For an isothermal atmosphere,  &lt;math&gt;(1-\frac{1}{e})&lt;/math&gt; or about 63% of the total mass of the atmosphere exists between the planet's surface and one scale height.  (The total air mass below a certain altitude is calculated by integrating over the density function.)

For the ocean example there was a sharp transition in density at the top or "surface" of the ocean.  However, for atmospheres made of gas there is no equivalent sharp transition or edge.  Gas atmospheres simply get less and less dense until they're so thin that they're space.

[[Image:Isothermal-barotropic atmosphere model.png]]

===The U.S. Standard Atmosphere===
{{Main|U.S. Standard Atmosphere}}
The U.S. Standard Atmosphere model starts with many of the same assumptions as the isothermal-barotropic model, including ideal gas behavior, and constant molecular weight, but it differs by defining a more realistic temperature function, consisting of eight data points connected by straight lines; i.e. regions of constant temperature gradient. (See graph.)   Of course the real atmosphere does not have a temperature distribution with this exact shape.  The temperature function is an approximation.  Values for pressure and density are then calculated based on this temperature function, and the constant temperature gradients help to make some of the maths easier.

===NASA Global Reference Atmospheric Model===

The NASA Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Earth-GRAM) was developed by the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] to provide a design reference atmosphere that, unlike the standard atmospheres, allows for geographical variability, a wide range of altitudes (surface to orbital altitudes), and different months and times of day.  It can also simulate spatial and temporal perturbations in atmospheric parameters due to turbulence and other atmospheric perturbation phenomena.  It is available&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Software Catalog 2015–2016 | chapter = Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model (Earth-Gram) 2010 | publisher = NASA – Technology Transfer Program | place =  | url = https://software.nasa.gov/software/MFS-32780-1 | accessdate = 16 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in computer code written in [[Fortran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Leslie | first = F.W. | last2 = Justus | first2 = C.G. | date = June 2011 | title = The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Earth Global Reference Atmospheric Model—2010 Version | series = NASA/TM—2011–216467 | publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | place = Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110012696.pdf | accessdate = 15 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GRAM series also includes atmospheric models for the planets [[Venus]], [[Mars]] and [[Neptune]] and the [[Saturn]]ian moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Justh | first = Hilary L. | last2 = Justus | first2 = C. G. | last3 = Keller | first3 = Vernon W. | date = 2006  | title = AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialists Conference; 21–24 Aug. 2006; Keystone, CO; United States  | contribution = Global Reference Atmospheric Models, Including Thermospheres, for Mars, Venus and Earth | contribution-url = http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20060048492 | doi = 10.2514/6.2006-6394 | accessdate = 19 August 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geopotential altitude==

Gravitational acceleration, [[gravitational acceleration|''g''(z)]], decreases with altitude since moving up means moving away from the planet's center.

:&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \frac{G m_e}{(r_e + z)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

This problem of decreasing ''g'' can be dealt with by defining a transformation from real geometric altitude ''z'' to an abstraction called "geopotential altitude" ''h'', defined: 
:&lt;math&gt;h = \frac{r_e z}{r_e + z} &lt;/math&gt;

''h'' has the property 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{} g(z) dz = g_0 dh &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g_0 = g(0) = \frac{G m_e}{{r_e}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Which basically says the amount of work done lifting a  test mass ''m'' to height ''z'' through an atmosphere where gravity decreases with altitude, is the same as the amount of work done lifting that same mass to a height ''h'' through an atmosphere where ''g'' magically remains equal to ''g0'', its value at sea level.  
 
This geopotential altitude ''h'' is then used instead of geometric altitude ''z'' in the hydrostatic equations.

The '''Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt''' ('''CASED''') is a LOEWE Center for IT security research and development with an interdisciplinary and cross-organizational approach. It was founded in July 2008 by [[TU Darmstadt]], [[the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology]] (SIT) and the [[Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences]]. CASED promotes and coordinates cooperation between the three institutions.

LOEWE is an initiative of the government of Hesse (Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts) for supporting the development of scientific and economic excellence in Hesse on a long-term basis. The government of [[Hesse]] provides funding for the infrastructure of CASED as well as for various projects of the three institutions involved.

In those funded projects, computer scientists, engineers, physicians, legal experts and economists of the three cluster partners do basic and application-oriented research.

Research and development of new security solutions for important growing areas of IT technology, such as embedded systems and [[service-oriented architecture]], is the ultimate goal of the Center. Subsequently, they hope to prevent substantial economic damage caused by economic espionage, manipulation, and product counterfeiting. Another aim is to make new techniques and online services run smoothly and safely for both providers and users.

'''Chabot Space and Science Center''', located in [[Oakland, California]], is a hands-on center featuring interactive exhibits, a digital [[planetarium]], a large screen theater, hands-on activities and three powerful [[telescopes]].

The Center is the continuation and expansion of a [[public observatory]] that has served [[San Francisco Bay Area]] schools and citizens with [[astronomy]] and [[science]] education programs since 1883. It is named after the father of [[hydraulic mining]] and benefactor of the original Oakland Observatory, [[Anthony Chabot]]. Since 2000, the Center has been located on the western border of Redwoods Regional Park.

==History==
[[Image:Chabot SSC front.jpg|thumbnail|left|The sign at the entrance of the Chabot Space and Science Center.]]

The institution began in 1883 as the Oakland Observatory, through a gift from [[Anthony Chabot]] to the City of Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabotspace.org/aboutus/ |title=Chabot Space &amp; Science Center (CSSC) educates students of all ages on Planet Earth and the universe |accessdate=August 19, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815021228/http://www.chabotspace.org/aboutus/ |archivedate=August 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Oakland Observatory was located in [[downtown Oakland]] and provided public telescope viewing for the community. For decades, it also served as the official timekeeping station for the entire Bay Area, measuring time with its [[transit telescope]].

The observatory moved to its Mountain Boulevard location in 1915 due to increasing [[light pollution]] and urban congestion. In the mid-1960s, the facility was expanded considerably. Throughout this time, the Chabot Science Center, as it was renamed, was staffed mainly by Oakland Unified School District personnel and volunteers. In 1977, seismic safety concerns terminated public school students’ access to the original observatory facility. The observatory building remained open to the general public, but school activities were limited to outlying classroom buildings and the planetarium.

[[File:Wightman Observatory Plaza at Chabot Space and Observatory Center.jpg|thumbnail|Wightman Observatory Plaza at the current location.]]

Recognizing the need to restore full access to the facility, either by repair or relocation, in 1989 Chabot Observatory &amp; Science Center was formed as a Joint Powers Agency with the City of Oakland, the Oakland Unified School District, and the East Bay Regional Park District, in collaboration with the [http://www.eastbayastro.org Eastbay Astronomical Society], and in 1992 was recognized as a nonprofit organization. The project was led by Chabot's Executive Director and CEO, Dr. [[Michael D. Reynolds]], breaking ground for the facility in October 1996 with construction of the new {{convert|88000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Science Center beginning in May 1998.

In January 2000, anticipating the opening of the new facility, the organization changed its name from Chabot Observatory &amp; Science Center to Chabot Space &amp; Science Center. The new name was chosen to better convey the organization's focus on astronomy and the [[space sciences]], while communicating both the broad range and the technologically advanced nature of programs available in the new Science Center.

Opened August 19, 2000, the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center is an {{convert|86000|sqft|m2|sing=on}}, state-of-the-art science and technology education facility on a {{convert|13|acre|m2|sing=on}} site in the hills of Oakland, California. The museum was formerly an affiliate in the [[Smithsonian Affiliations]] program.&lt;ref name="Chabot"&gt;{{cite web|year=2011|title=Chabot Space and Science Center|work=Affiliate Details|publisher=Smithsonian Affiliations|url=http://affiliations.si.edu/AffiliateDetail.Asp?AffiliateID=17|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is currently no longer an affiliate.

==Attractions==
Aside from its telescopes, it contains:

[[Image:chabot planetarium.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Chabot's Ask Jeeves Planetarium]]

The Planetarium seats 250 people under a {{convert|70|ft|m|sing=on}} diameter dome, and features live weekly shows and daily pre-recorded "[[fulldome]]" shows.  The weekly live shows are presented by a staff astronomer.

*'''Live Show:'''
''Cosmos 360''  uses the planetarium's digital [[fulldome]] system to view the night sky as well as flying through space to see the universe from a different perspective. The guided tour include in-depth views of planets, constellations and other current astronomical events. The show is updated to reflect seasonal night skies.

*'''Daily Shows:'''
The daily shows range from content geared for young children through more sophisticated shows designed for a general audience.

A complete schedule and listing of daily shows as well as current show times can be found at the center's [http://www.chabotspace.org/planetarium-shows.htm planetarium page].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabotspace.org/planetarium-shows.htm Chabot's Planetarium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Retrieved August 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galaxy Explorers program==
The Chabot Space and Science Center offers volunteer and educational opportunities to local teens, who work as explainers on the museum floor or on outreach trips. The program was initiated by a grant from ''YouthALIVE!'' (Youth Achievement through Learning Involvement, Volunteer and Employment!) through the Association of Science-Technology Centers.

The '''Climate Policy Initiative''' (CPI) is a climate [[think tank]] of 70&lt;ref name="CPI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Services and impact |url=https://climatepolicyinitiative.org/about-cpi/ |website=Climate Policy Initiative |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysts and advisors that works to improve energy and land use policies around the world, with a particular focus on finance.&lt;ref name="TTmap"&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Policy Initiative |url=http://www.thinktankmap.org/ThinkTankDetails.aspx?ID=149 |website=TTmap |publisher=ICCG |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Climate Policy Initiative''' should not to be confused with Initiative on Climate Change policy and Governance (ICCG), formerly (up to 2017) International Center for Climate Governance.

CPI is an independent, non-profit organization, mainly supported by [[Open Society Foundations]],&lt;ref name="TTmap"/&gt; but also by another 18 charitables.&lt;ref name="CPI"/&gt; It is considered a leader expert group in tracking global climate finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=El Club de Bancos para el Desarrollo aumenta en USD 30.000 millones su financiamiento verde |url=https://www.caf.com/es/actualidad/noticias/2017/12/el-club-de-bancos-para-el-desarrollo-aumenta-en-usd-30000-millones-su-financiacion-verde/ |website=CAF-Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina |publisher=CAF |accessdate=31 May 2018 |date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In TTmap, a worldwide observatory on climate think tanks, CPI was ranked 49th. The first one is the [[Woods Hole Research Center]].&lt;ref name="TTmap"/&gt;

==History==
CPI started operations in 2009.&lt;ref name="TTmap"/&gt;

==Current fields of research==
* [[Renewable energy]] &amp; [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]

The '''Convention on Biological Diversity''' ('''CBD'''), known informally as the '''Biodiversity Convention''', is a [[multilateral treaty]]. The Convention has three main goals including: the conservation of biological diversity (or [[biodiversity]]); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from [[Germplasm|genetic resource]]s.

In other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It is often seen as the key document regarding [[sustainable development]]. The Convention was opened for signature at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. At the 2010 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October in [[Nagoya]], Japan, the Nagoya Protocol was adopted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/cop10/ Welcome to COP 10&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==

The notion of an international convention on bio-diversity was conceived at a [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities.
In 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the convention's text.&lt;ref name="CBDweb01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/history/|title=History of the Convention|work=Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD)|accessdate= 14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the [[Nairobi Final Act]].&lt;ref name="nairAct"&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/doc/handbook/cbd-hb-09-en.pdf Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the adoption of the agreed text of the Convention on Biological Diversity], Heinrich, M. (2002). Handbook of the Convention on Biological Diversity: Edited by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Earthscan, London, 2001. {{ISBN|9781853837371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention's text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio "Earth Summit"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.&lt;ref name="CBDweb01" /&gt;

The convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biodiversity is "a common concern of humankind" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all [[ecosystem]]s, [[species]], and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Louafi, Sélim and Jean-Frédéric Morin, International governance of biodiversity: Involving all the users of genetic resources, IDDRI, 2004, https://www.academia.edu/3809935/Louafi_S._and_J-F_Morin_2004_International_Governance_of_biodiversity_Involving_all_the_Users_of_Genetic_Resources_Les_synth%C3%A8ses_de_lIddri_n_5._4_p&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and [[biosafety]] issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.

The convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of [[sustainable use]]. While past [[conservation biology|conservation]] efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.

The convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the [[precautionary principle]] which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.

The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].

==Issues==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

Some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include:

* Measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
* Regulated access to genetic resources and [[traditional knowledge]], including Prior Informed Consent of the party providing resources.
* Sharing, in a fair and equitable way, the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of [[Genetics|genetic]] resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources (governments and/or local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized).
* Access to and transfer of technology, including [[biotechnology]], to the governments and/or local communities that provided traditional knowledge and/or biodiversity resources.
* Technical and scientific cooperation.
* Coordination of a global directory of taxonomic expertise (Global Taxonomy Initiative).
* Impact assessment.
* Education and public [[awareness]].
* Provision of financial resources.
* National reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments.

==Cartagena Protocol==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

{{main|Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety}}
The '''Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety''' of the Convention, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.

The Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the [[precautionary principle]] and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a [[genetically modified organism]] if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is [[safe]] and requires exporters to label shipments containing [[genetically modified]] commodities such as corn or cotton.

The required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.

== Global Strategy for Plant Conservation ==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

{{main|Global Strategy for Plant Conservation}}

In April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.

==Parties==
As of 2016, the Convention has 196 parties, which includes 195 states and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|title=CBD List of Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt; All UN member states—with the exception of the United States—have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. The [[Holy See]] and the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] are non-parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Presses U.S. to Pass Biotic Treaty|last=Hazarika|first=Sanjoy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 April 1995|page=1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has not announced plans to ratify it.

==International bodies established==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

'''Conference of the parties:'''
The convention's governing body is the [[Conference of the parties]] (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.

The Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, two main organs are:

'''Secretariat:'''
The CBD Secretariat, based in [[Montreal]], operates under the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.

'''Subsidiary body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA):'''
The SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues.

The 13th Meeting of the SBSTTA, or SBSTTA-13, held from 18&amp;ndash;22 February 2008 at the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] headquarters in Rome, Italy. SBSTTA-13 delegates finalized and adopted recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and forest biodiversity and SBSTTA's modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues, as well as on inland waters biodiversity, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] biodiversity, [[invasive alien species]], and biodiversity and [[climate change]].

The current chairperson of the SBSTTA is Dr. Theresa Mundita Lim of the [[Philippines]].

==Country implementation==

===National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)===
"National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level (Article 6). The Convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy (or equivalent instrument) and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity. To date [2012-02-01], 173 Parties have developed NBSAPs in line with Article 6."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/nbsap/|title= National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/27/harrison-ford-conservation-nagoya | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | title=Harrison Ford calls on US to ratify treaty on conservation | date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species Recovery Programs and other mechanisms long in place in the USA for species conservation.

Singapore has also established a detailed ''National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606095712/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/docs/nbc/NPark-booklet-final-4sep.pdf National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Biodiversity Centre'' of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150119041729/https://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=124 National Biodiversity Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Reports===
In accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, Parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the Convention.

==Executive secretary==
The current executive secretary is [[Cristiana Pașca Palmer]], who took up this post on 17 March 2017.&lt;ref name="exec"&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/secretariat/es/default.shtml] as on 20th March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias]] was the previous executive secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/secretariat/former-es/default.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nagoya Protocol==
{{main|Nagoya Protocol}}

The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity&lt;ref name="nagoya_text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/ |title=Text of the Nagoya Protocol |work=cbd.int |publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Province, Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. Its objective is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cbd.int/abs/about/|title= Nagoya Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 COP 11===
{{Main|2012 Hyderabad Biodiversity Conference}}
Leading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in [[Hyderabad, India]] 2012, preparations for a World Wide Views on Biodiversity has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the [[World Wide Views on Global Warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biodiversity.wwviews.org/  World Wide Views on Biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 COP 12===
Under the theme, "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development," thousands of representatives of governments, NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector gathered in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], Republic of Korea in October 2014 for the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/cop2014; Webcasting: {{cite web |url=http://www.liveto.com/cop12/floor/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120510/http://www.liveto.com/cop12/floor/index.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6–17 October 2014, Parties discussed the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which are to be achieved by the end of this decade. The results of Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, the flagship assessment report of the CBD informed the discussions.

The conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the UN Decade on Biodiversity (2011-2020) initiative, which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature.
 
At the end of the meeting, the meeting adopted the "Pyeongchang Road Map," which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation, funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;(Source http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/2014/pr-2014-10-06-cop-12-en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 COP 13===
[[File:COP13 Mexico conference.jpg|thumb|COP13 Mexico meeting]]
The thirteenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place between 2 and 17 December 2016 in Cancun, Mexico.

==Commemorative periods==
2010 was the [[International Year of Biodiversity]] and the Secretariat of the CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories during COP 10 at [[Nagoya]] in October 2010, the UN, on 22 December 2010, declared 2011 to 2020 as the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].

==Criticism==
There have been criticisms against CBD that the Convention has been weakened in implementation due to the resistance of Western countries to the implementation of the pro-South provisions of the Convention. &lt;ref&gt;Faizi, S (2004) The Unmaking of a Treaty. Biodiversity 5(3) 2004&lt;/ref&gt; CBD is also regarded as a case of a hard treaty gone soft in the implementation trajectory &lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Stuart &amp; Pritchard, Diana. (2011). A Hard Instrument Goes Soft: The Implications of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Current Trajectory. Global Environmental Change-human and Policy Dimensions - GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANGE. 21. 474-480. 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.014. &lt;/ref&gt; The argument to enforce the treaty as a legally binding multilateral instrument with the Conference of Parties reviewing the infractions and non-compliance is also gaining strength&lt;ref&gt;Faizi, S (2012) CBD: Putting the focus on enforcement. Square Brackets. Issue No. 7. October, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions,&lt;ref name="cbd1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/text/ |title=Text of the CBD|publisher=www.cbd.int|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for example, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants, but does not mention [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] or [[protists]] at all.&lt;ref name="cbd_eur1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/eur/eur-nr-05-en.pdf |title=Fifth Report of the European Union to the Convention on Biological Diversity. June 2014 |publisher=www.cbd.int |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Society for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less than 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously deficient or totally deficient.&lt;ref name="isfc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm |title=The Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation |publisher=www.fungal-conservation.org |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, intensive monoculture and human overpopulation are the two most pertinent biodiversity issues to address.

Scientists working with biodiversity and medical research are expressing fears that the Nagoya Protocol is counterproductive, and will will hamper disease prevention and conservation efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6396/1405.full|title= When the cure kills—CBD limits biodiversity research|website=science.sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and that the threat of imprisonment of scientists will have a chilling effect on research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nature.com/news/biopiracy-ban-stirs-red-tape-fears-1.16028|title= Biopiracy ban stirs red-tape fears}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-commercial researchers and institutions such as [[natural history museum]]s fear maintaining biological reference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become difficult&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/05/biosci.biv056.short?rss=1|title= The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing—International treaty poses challenges for biological collections}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and medical researchers have expressed alarm at plans to expand the protocol to make it illegal to publicly share genetic information, e.g. via [[GenBank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6413/404|title= Threats to timely sharing of pathogen sequence data|website=science.sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Copperbelt University is a Public University established through the Act of Parliament No. 19 of 1987. Prior to 1987, the University existed as a campus of the University of Zambia Federal System with two schools; namely: School of Business and Industrial Studies (SBIS) and School of Environmental Studies (SES). The campus was referred to as the University of Zambia at Ndola (UNZANDO) until 1 December 1987. As of 1 January 1989 the Zambia Institute of Technology (ZIT) was incorporated into the Copperbelt University to form the School of Technology. Since 1987, the University has significantly grown from only two faculties to ten by the end of 2013; it now provides very unique programmes that have not been replicated elsewhere. The total number of students in 2017 was 11,900 and having had over 54,000 students in the past 25 years. The University too is proud of its graduates who are holding key responsibilities in various sectors of the economy within the country and beyond. At its first graduation ceremony in 1992, the University had only 100 students then graduating from the various disciplines but graduating average of 1,500 as at 2017.

In 2014, the School of Medicine received US$1 million in donation from the [[Council of Zambian Jewry]],  of the [[African Jewish Congress]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/14643/zambian_jews_support_one_of_zambia_s_medical_schools_with_a_generous_donation Zambian Jews support one of Zambia's medical schools with a generous donation], World Jewish Congress, April 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7111">'''Curriculum-based measurement''', or '''CBM''', is also referred to as a general outcomes measures (GOMs) of a student's performance in either basic skills or content knowledge.

==Early history==
CBM began in the mid 1970s with research headed by [[Stan Deno]] at the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Deno, S.L. (1985). Curriculum-based measurement: The emerging alternative. ''Exceptional Children'', 52(3), 219–32&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of 10 years, this work led to the establishment of measurement systems in reading, writing, and spelling that were: (a) easy to construct, (b) brief in administration and scoring, (c) had technical adequacy (reliability and various types of validity evidence for use in making educational decisions), and (d) provided alternate forms to allow time series data to be collected on student progress.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Neddenriep, Bradley-Klug &amp; Ziemann (2002) Advances in Curriculum-Based Measurement: Alternative Rate Measures for Assessing Reading Skills in Pre- and Advanced Readers. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(3), 270–83 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; This focus in the three language arts areas eventually was expanded to include mathematics, though the technical research in this area continues to lag that published in the language arts areas. An even later development was the application of CBM to middle-secondary areas: Espin and colleagues at the University of Minnesota developed a line of research addressing vocabulary and comprehension (with the maze) and by Tindal and colleagues at the [[University of Oregon]] developed a line of research on concept-based teaching and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Espin, C. &amp; Tindal, G. (1998). Curriculum-based measurement for secondary students (pp. 214–53). In M.R. Shinn (Ed.), ''Advanced applications of curriculum-based measurement''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing importance==
Early research on the CBM quickly moved from monitoring student progress to its use in screening, normative decision-making, and finally benchmarking. Indeed, with the implementation of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] in 2001, and its focus on large-scale testing and accountability, CBM has become increasingly important as a form of standardized measurement that is highly related to and relevant for understanding student's progress toward and achievement of state standards.

==Key feature==
Probably the key feature of CBM is its accessibility for classroom application and implementation. It was designed to provide an experimental analysis of the effects from interventions, which includes both instruction and curriculum. This is one of the most important conundrums to surface on CBM: To evaluate the effects of a curriculum, a measurement system needs to provide an independent "audit" and not be biased to only that which is taught. The early struggles in this arena referred to this difference as mastery monitoring (curriculum-based which was embedded in the curriculum and therefore forced the metric to be the number (and rate) of units traversed in learning) versus experimental analysis which relied on metrics like oral reading fluency (words read correctly per minute) and correct word or letter sequences per minute (in writing or spelling), both of which can serve as GOMs. In mathematics, the metric is often digits correct per minute. N.B. The metric of CBM is typically rate-based to focus on "automaticity" in learning basic skills.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, A.D.; Skinner, C.H.; Williams, J.; Hawkins, R.; Neddenriep, C.E. &amp; Dizer, J. (2007). Comparing Comprehension Following Silent and Aloud Reading across Elementary and Secondary Students: Implication for Curriculum-Based Measurement. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(1), 9–23. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent advancements==
The most recent advancements of CBM have occurred in three areas. First, they have been applied to students with low incidence disabilities. This work is best represented by Zigmond in the Pennsylvania Alternate Assessment and Tindal in the Oregon and Alaska Alternate Assessments. The second advancement is the use of generalizability theory with CBM, best represented by the work of John Hintze, in which the focus is parceling the error term into components of time, grade, setting, task, etc. Finally, Yovanoff, Tindal, and colleagues at the University of Oregon have applied Item Response Theory (IRT) to the development of statistically calibrated equivalent forms in their progress monitoring system.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel M. Stewart, Ronald C. Martella, Nancy E. Marchand-Martella and Gregory J. Benner (2005): Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior. ''JEIBI'', 2(3), 115–24. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Curriculum-based measurement emerged from behavioral psychology and yet several [[behaviorists]] have become disenchanted with the lack of the dynamics of the process.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R.L.; Skinner, C.H. &amp; Jaspers, K. (2008). Extending Research on the Validity of Brief Reading Comprehension Rate and Level Measures to College Course Success. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(2), 163–74. [http://baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ardoin, et al. Evaluating Curriculum-Based Measurement from a Behavioral Assessment Perspective. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 9(1), 36–49 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialogue''' (sometimes spelled '''dialog''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]]&lt;ref&gt;See entry on "dialogue (n)" in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a written or spoken [[conversation]]al exchange between two or more people, and a [[literature|literary]] and [[theatrical]] form that depicts such an exchange. As a [[narrative]], [[philosophy|philosophical]] or [[didactic]] device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the [[Socratic dialogue]] as developed by [[Plato]], but antecedents are also found in other traditions including [[Indian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples|page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0824800788|isbn=0824800788 |first=Hajime |last=Nakamura |year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Paulo Freire]], [[Martin Buber]], and [[David Bohm]]. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Promise of Dialogue: The dialogic turn in the production and communication of knowledge|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9ZwM1XEI4IC&amp;pg=PA26|first=Louise|last=Phillips|isbn=9789027210296|pages=25–26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators such as Freire and [[Ramón Flecha]] have also developed a body of theory and techniques for using [[egalitarian dialogue]] as a pedagogical tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ramón|last=Flecha|year=2000|title=Sharing Words: Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning|location=Lanham, MD|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term dialogue stems from the Greek διάλογος (''dialogos'', conversation); its roots are διά (''dia'': through) and λόγος (''logos'': speech, reason). The first extant author who uses the term is Plato, in whose works it is closely associated with the art of dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/view/14987/6295|title = From Dialogos to Dialogue: The Use of the Term from Plato to the Second Century CE|last = Jazdzewska|first = K.|date = 1 June 2015|journal = Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 54.1 (2014), p. 17-36|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin took over the word as ''dialogus''.&lt;ref&gt;"Dialogue", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==As genre==
[[File:Politeia beginning. Codex Parisinus graecus 1807.jpg|thumb|Oldest extant text of Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'']]

===Antiquity and the Middle Ages===

Dialogue as a genre in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]] dates back to ancient works, such as [[Sumerian disputations]] preserved in copies from the late third millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;G. J., and H. L. J. Vanstiphout. 1991. Dispute Poems and Dialogues in the Ancient and Mediaeval Near East: Forms and Types of Literary Debates in Semitic and Related Literatures. Leuven: Department Oriëntalistiek.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rigvedic dialogue hymns]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.

In the East, In 13th century Japan, dialogue was used in important philosophical works. In the 1200s, Nichiren Daishonin wrote some of his important writings in dialogue form, describing a meeting between two characters in order to present his argument and theory, such as in "Conversation between a Sage and an Unenlightened Man" (The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin 1: pp.99-140, dated around 1256), and "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land" (Ibid., pp.6-30; dated 1260), while in other writings he used a question and answer format, without the narrative scenario, such as in "Questions and Answers about Embracing the Lotus Sutra" (Ibid., pp.55-67, possibly from 1263). The sage or person answering the questions was understood as the author.

In the West, [[Plato]] (c. 437 BC – c. 347 BC) has commonly been credited with the systematic use of dialogue as an independent literary form.{{sfn|gosse|1911}} Ancient sources indicate, however, that the Platonic dialogue had its foundations in the ''mime'', which the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] poets [[Sophron]] and [[Epicharmus]] had cultivated half a century earlier.{{sfn|Kutzko|2012|p=377}} These works, admired and imitated by Plato, have not survived and we have only the vaguest idea of how they may have been performed.{{sfn|Kutzko|2012|p=381}} The ''Mimes'' of [[Herodas]], which were found in a papyrus in 1891, give some idea of their character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V21AAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR9|page=ix|title=The Mimes of Herodas|first=John Arbuthnot|last=Nairn|year=1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato further simplified the form and reduced it to pure [[Logical argument|argumentative]] conversation, while leaving intact the amusing element of [[fictional character|character]]-drawing.&lt;ref name="gosse"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Dialogue |volume=8|pages=156-157|first=Edmund |last=Gosse |authorlink=Edmund Gosse}}&lt;/ref&gt; By about 400 BC he had perfected the [[Socratic dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA322|pages=322–323|year=1995|isbn=9780877790426}}&lt;/ref&gt; All his extant writings, except the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' and [[Epistles (Plato)|Epistles]], use this form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QE_CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA405|page=405|title=Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece|first=George|last=Sarton|year=2011|isbn=9780486274959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Plato, the dialogue became a major literary genre in antiquity, and several important works both in Latin and in Greek were written. Soon after Plato, [[Xenophon]] wrote his own ''[[Symposium (Xenophon dialogue)|Symposium]]''; also, Aristotle is said to have written several philosophical dialogues in Plato's style (of which only fragments survive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmic and Meta-Cosmic Theology in Aristotle's Lost Dialogues |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9004091556|isbn=9004091556 |first=A. P. |last=Bos |year=1989 |page=xviii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period to the present===
{{see also|Closet drama}}
Two French writers of eminence borrowed the title of Lucian's most famous collection; both [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] (1683) and [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]] (1712) prepared ''Dialogues des morts'' ("Dialogues of the Dead").{{sfn|gosse|1911}} Contemporaneously, in 1688, the French philosopher [[Nicolas Malebranche]] published his ''Dialogues on [[Metaphysics]] and Religion'', thus contributing to the genre's revival in philosophic circles. In English non-dramatic literature the dialogue did not see extensive use until [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] employed it, in 1713, for his treatise, ''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]''.&lt;ref name="gosse"/&gt; His contemporary, the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] wrote ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.'' A prominent 19th-century example of literary dialogue was [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]'s ''[[Imaginary Conversations]]'' (1821–1828).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Walter Savage Landor|title=English Prose of the Nineteenth Century|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWWX3INTw78C&amp;pg=PA215|first1=Hardin|last1=Craig|first2=Joseph M.|last2=Thomas|year=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] adopted this form for several important satirical works published between 1780 and 1799. In Spanish literature, the ''Dialogues'' of [[Juan de Valdés|Valdés]] (1528) and those on ''Painting'' (1633) by [[Vincenzo Carducci]] are celebrated. Italian writers of collections of dialogues, following Plato's model, include [[Torquato Tasso]] (1586), [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1632), [[Ferdinando Galiani|Galiani]] (1770), [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]] (1825), and a host of others.&lt;ref name="gosse"/&gt;

In the 19th century, the French returned to the original application of dialogue. The inventions of "[[Sibylle Gabrielle Marie Antoinette Riqueti de Mirabeau|Gyp]]", of [[Henri Léon Emile Lavedan|Henri Lavedan]], and of others, which tell a mundane [[anecdote]] wittily and maliciously in conversation, would probably present a close analogy to the lost mimes of the early Sicilian poets. English writers including [[F. Anstey|Anstey Guthrie]] also adopted the form, but these dialogues seem to have found less of a popular following among the English than their counterparts written by French authors.&lt;ref name="gosse"/&gt;

The [[Platonic dialogue]], as a distinct genre which features Socrates as a speaker and one or more interlocutors discussing some philosophical question, experienced something of a rebirth in the 20th century. Authors who have recently employed it include [[George Santayana]], in his eminent ''Dialogues in Limbo'' (1926, 2nd ed. 1948; this work also includes such historical figures as [[Alcibiades]], [[Aristippus]], [[Avicenna]], [[Democritus]], and [[Dionysius the Younger]] as speakers). Also [[Edith Stein]] and [[Iris Murdoch]] used the dialogue form. Stein imagined a dialogue between [[Edmund Husserl]] (phenomenologist) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (metaphysical realist). {{Anchor|Murdoch}}Murdoch included not only Socrates and Alcibiades as interlocutors in her work ''Acastos: Two Platonic Dialogues'' (1986), but featured a young Plato himself as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iris Murdoch and the Art of Imagining |first=Marije|last=Altorf |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2008 |isbn=9780826497574|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02QhAQAAIAAJ|page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Timothy Williamson]] wrote ''Tetralogue'', a philosophical exchange on a train between four people with radically different [[Epistemology|epistemological]] views.

==As topic==
{{main article|Philosophy of dialogue}}
[[File:David Bohm.jpg|thumb|[[David Bohm]], a leading 20th-century thinker on dialogue.]]
[[Martin Buber]] assigns dialogue a pivotal position in his [[theology]]. His most influential work is titled ''[[I and Thou]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beacons of the Light: 100 Holy People Who Have Shaped the History of Humanity|page=560 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1846941857|isbn=1846941857 |first=Marcus|last=Braybrooke|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buber cherishes and promotes dialogue not as some purposive attempt to reach conclusions or express mere points of view, but as the very prerequisite of authentic relationship between man and man, and between man and [[God]]. Buber's thought centers on "true dialogue", which is characterized by openness, honesty, and mutual commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogical Philosophy from Kierkegaard to Buber|page=219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0791406237|isbn=0791406237 |first=Samuel Hugo |last=Bergman |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Vatican Council]] placed a major emphasis on dialogue with the World. Most of the Council's documents involve some kind of dialogue : dialogue with other religions (''[[Nostra aetate]]''), dialogue with other Christians ([[Unitatis Redintegratio]]), dialogue with modern society (''[[Gaudium et spes]]'') and dialogue with political authorities ([[Dignitatis Humanae]]).{{sfn|Nolan|2006}} However, in the English translations of these texts, "dialogue" was used to translate two Latin words with distinct meanings, ''colloquium'' ("discussion") and ''dialogus'' ("dialogue").{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=30}} The choice of terminology appears to have been strongly influenced by Buber's thought.{{sfn|Nolan|2006|p=174}}

The [[physicist]] [[David Bohm]] originated a related form of dialogue where a group of people talk together in order to explore their assumptions of thinking, meaning, communication, and social effects. This group consists of ten to thirty people who meet for a few hours regularly or a few continuous days. In a [[Bohm dialogue]], dialoguers agree to leave behind [[debate]] tactics that attempt to convince and, instead, talk from their own experience on subjects that are improvised on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dialogue and The Art Of Thinking Together|page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0307483789|isbn=0307483789 |first=William |last=Isaacs |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his influential works, [[Russians|Russian]] philosopher and [[semiotician]]&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] provided a [[linguistics|linguistic]] methodology to define the dialogue, its nature and meaning:&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Dialogic relations'' have a specific nature: they can be reduced neither to the purely [[logical]] (even if dialectical) nor to the purely linguistic ([[Composition (language)|compositional]]-[[Syntax|syntactic]]) They are possible only between complete [[utterance]]s of various speaking subjects... Where there is no word and no [[language]], there can be no dialogic relations; they cannot exist among objects or logical quantities (concepts, judgments, and so forth). Dialogic relations presuppose a language, but they do not reside within the system of language. They are impossible among elements of a language.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1986, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Brazil]]ian educationalist [[Paulo Freire]], known for developing popular education, advanced dialogue as a type of pedagogy. Freire held that dialogued communication allowed students and teachers to learn from one another in an environment characterized by respect and equality. A great advocate for oppressed peoples, Freire was concerned with praxis—action that is informed and linked to people's values. Dialogued pedagogy was not only about deepening understanding; it was also about making positive changes in the world: to make it better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Narrative as Pedagogy |first1=Ivor|last1=Goodson|first2=Scherto|last2=Gill |isbn=9781623566890|year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7xnAwAAQBAJ|publisher=Bloomsbury |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As practice==
{{main article|Dialogic learning}}
[[File:Shimer College Classroom Upshot.jpg|thumb|A classroom dialogue at [[Shimer College]].]]

Dialogue is used as a practice in a variety of settings, from [[education]] to [[business]]. Influential theorists of dialogal education include [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Ramon Flecha]].

In the United States, an early form of dialogic learning emerged in the [[Great Books]] movement of the early to mid-20th century, which emphasized egalitarian dialogues in small classes as a way of understanding the foundational texts of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Great Books Programs|title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science |year=1973|volume=10 |pages=159–160 |first1=Otto A.|last=Bird|first2=Thomas J.|last2=Musial }}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions that continue to follow a version of this model include the [[Great Books Foundation]], [[Shimer College]] in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Guardian|first=Ronson|last=Jon|authorlink=Jon Ronson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/06/shimer-college-illinois-worst-school-america|date=2014-12-06|title=Shimer College: The Worst School in America?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in Annapolis and Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/|title=Why SJC?|accessdate=2015-01-18|publisher=St. John's College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egalitarian dialogue===
{{main article|Egalitarian dialogue}}
Egalitarian dialogue is a concept in [[dialogic learning]]. It may be defined as a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing Words. Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning|first=Ramon|last=Flecha|authorlink=Ramon Flecha|year=2000|location=Lanham, MD|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structured dialogue===
Structured dialogue represents a class of dialogue practices developed as a means of orienting the dialogic discourse toward problem understanding and [[consensus|consensual]] action. Whereas most traditional dialogue practices are unstructured or semi-structured, such conversational modes have been observed as insufficient for the coordination of multiple perspectives in a problem area. A disciplined form of dialogue, where participants agree to follow a dialogue framework or a [[Facilitation (business)|facilitator]], enables groups to address complex shared problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Family Business and Social Capital|page=xxi |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1849807388|isbn=1849807388 |first=R. L.|last=Sorenson|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Christakis|Aleco Christakis]] (who created ''structured dialogue design'') and [[John N. Warfield]] (who created ''science of generic design'') were two of the leading developers of this school of dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Onlife Manifesto|page=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3319040936|isbn=3319040936 |editor=Floridi, Luciano |chapter=Reengineering and Reinventing both Democracy and the Concept of Life in the Digital Era|first=Yiannis|last=Laouris }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for engaging structured dialogue follows the observation that a rigorous bottom-up democratic form of dialogue must be structured to ensure that a sufficient variety of stakeholders represents the problem system of concern, and that their voices and contributions are equally balanced in the dialogic process.

Structured dialogue is employed for complex problems including [[peacemaking]] (e.g., [[Civil Society Dialogue project in Cyprus]]) and indigenous community development.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory and Practice of Dialogical Community Development|page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1136272852|isbn=1136272852 |first1=Peter|last1=Westoby|first2=Gerard|last2=Dowling|year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as government and social policy formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Youth Policy Manual: How to Develop a National Youth Strategy|page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9287165769|isbn=9287165769 |first=Finn Yrjar |last=Denstad|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one deployment, structured dialogue is (according to a European Union definition) "a means of mutual communication between governments and administrations including [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] and young people. The aim is to get young people's contribution towards the formulation of policies relevant to young peoples lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthweek.magusine.net/spip.php?article46 Definition of structured dialogue focused on youth matters]&lt;/ref&gt; The application of structured dialogue requires one to differentiate the meanings of discussion and deliberation.

Groups such as Worldwide Marriage Encounter and Retrouvaille use dialogue as a communication tool for married couples. Both groups teach a dialogue method that helps couples learn more about each other in non-threatening postures, which helps to foster growth in the married relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage Enrichment: Preparation, Mentoring, and Outreach|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0876309139|isbn=0876309139 |first1=Richard A. |last1=Hunt|first2=Larry|last2=Hof|first3=Rita|last3=DeMaria|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogical leadership===
The German philosopher and classicist [[:de:Karl-Martin Dietz|Karl-Martin Dietz]] emphasizes the original term of dialogue, which goes back to Heraclitus: "The logos [...] answers to the question of the world as a whole and how everything in it is connected. Logos is the one principle at work, that gives order to the manifold in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Martin Dietz: Acting Independently for the Good of the Whole. From Dialogical Leadership to a Dialogical Corporate Culture. Heidelberg: Menon 2013. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For Dietz dialogue (gr. dia-logos) means "a kind of thinking, acting and speaking, which the logos "passes through""&lt;ref&gt;Dietz: Acting Independently for the Good of the Whole. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, talking to each other is merely one part of "dialogue". Acting dialogically means directing someone's attention to another one and to reality at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Martin Dietz: Dialog die Kunst der Zusammenarbeit. 4. Auflage. Heidelberg 2014. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this background and together with Thomas Kracht, Karl-Martin Dietz developed what he termed "[[:de:Dialogische Führung|dialogical leadership]]" as a form of organizational management.&lt;ref name="Karl-Martin Dietz 2011"&gt;Karl-Martin Dietz, Thomas Kracht: Dialogische Führung. Grundlagen - Praxis Fallbeispiel: dm-drogerie markt. 3. Auflage. Frankfurt am Main: Campus 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In several German enterprises and organisations it replaced the traditional human resource management, e.g. in the German [[drugstore]] chain [[dm-drogerie markt]].&lt;ref name="Karl-Martin Dietz 2011"/&gt;

Separately, and earlier to Thomas Kracht and Karl-Martin Dietz, Rens van Loon published multiple works on the concept of [https://books.google.nl/books?id=yHA8etYwBLwC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;ots=1r56caF9Bk&amp;dq=Dialogical%20Leadership%20van%20Loon&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=Dialogical%20Leadership%20van%20Loon&amp;f=false Dialogical Leadership], starting with a chapter in the Dutch book, The Organization as Story (2003). Van Loon is the chair of Dialogical Leadership at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, Department of Humanities and Ethics.

===Moral dialogues===
Moral dialogues are social processes which allow societies or communities to form new shared moral understandings. Moral dialogues have the capacity to modify the moral positions of a sufficient number of people to generate widespread approval for actions and policies that previously had little support or were considered morally inappropriate by many. Communitarian philosopher Amitai Etzioni has developed an analytical framework which—modeling historical examples—outlines the reoccurring components of moral dialogues. Elements of moral dialogues include: establishing a moral baseline; sociological dialogue starters which initiate the process of developing new shared moral understandings; the linking of multiple groups' discussions in the form of “megalogues”; distinguishing the distinct attributes of the moral dialogue (apart from rational deliberations or culture wars);  dramatization to call widespread attention to the issue at hand; and, closure through the establishment of a new shared moral understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69623-2_4|title=Moral Dialogues|isbn=978-3-319-69623-2|language=en|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral dialogues allow people of a given community to determine what is morally acceptable to a majority of people within the community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6733">'''Ecological literacy''' (also referred to as ''ecoliteracy'') is the ability to understand the [[systems ecology|natural systems]] that make [[life]] on [[earth]] possible. To be ecoliterate means understanding the principles of organization of ecological communities (i.e. [[ecosystem]]s) and using those principles for creating [[sustainable]] human communities. The term was [[neologism|coined]] by American educator [[David W. Orr]] and physicist [[Fritjof Capra]] in the 1990s&lt;ref name=orr&gt;{{cite book| last = Orr| first = David|authorlink=David W. Orr|title = Ecological Literacy: Education and the Transition to a Postmodern World| publisher = S.U.N.Y. Press, NY| year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], The Web of Life, Harper Collins (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;- thereby a new value entered education; the “well-being of the earth”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Sterling]], Whole Systems Thinking as a Basis for Paradigm Change in Education, PhD paper, University of Bath. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 

An ecologically literate society would be a [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[society]] which did not destroy the [[natural environment]] on which they depend. Ecological literacy is a powerful concept as it creates a foundation for an integrated approach to environmental problems. Advocates champion eco-literacy as a new educational paradigm emerging around the poles of [[holism]], [[systems thinking]], [[sustainability]], and [[complexity]]. 

== Overview ==
Ecoliteracy concerns understanding the principles of organisation of ecosystems and their potential application to understanding how to build a sustainable [[human society]].&lt;ref&gt;(Capra, 1997: 89).&lt;/ref&gt; It combines the sciences of systems and ecology in drawing together elements required to foster learning processes toward a deep appreciation of nature and our role in it. Systems thinking is the recognition of the world as an integrated whole rather than a collection of individual elements. Within systems thinking, basic principles of organization become more important than the analysis of various components of the system in isolation. Ecological literacy and systems thinking implies a recognition of the manner in which all phenomenon are part of networks that define the way that element functions. Systems thinking is necessary to understand complex [[interdependence]] of [[ecological systems]], [[social system]]s and other systems on all levels.

According to [[Fritjof Capra]], “In the coming decades, the survival of humanity will depend on our ecological literacy – our ability to understand the basic principles of ecology and to live accordingly. This means that ecoliteracy must become a critical skill for [[politician]]s, business leaders, and professionals in all spheres, and should be the most important part of education at all levels – from primary and secondary schools to colleges, universities, and the continuing education and training of professionals.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritjof Capra]], "The New Facts of Life," 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051039/http://www.ecoliteracy.org/publications/fritjof_capra_facts.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David W. Orr]] has stated that the goal of ecological literacy is “built on the recognition that the disorder of ecosystems reflects a prior disorder of mind, making it a central concern to those institutions that purport to improve minds. In other words, the ecological crisis is in every way a crisis of education.... All education is environmental education… by what is included or excluded we teach the young that they are part of or apart from the natural world.” He also emphasizes that ecoliteracy does not only require mastery of subject matter, but the creation of meaningful connections between head, hands, and heart as well.&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone and [[Zenobia Barlow]], eds., Ecological Literacy: Educating Our Children for a Sustainable World, Sierra Club Books (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others have reiterated the urgent importance of ecological literacy in today's world, where young people are faced with escalating environmental challenges, including climate change, depletion of resources, and environmentally linked illnesses. {{quote|This generation will require leaders and citizens who can think ecologically, understand the interconnectedness of human and natural systems, and have the will, ability, and courage to act|Michael K. Stone&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Stone/[[Center for Ecoliteracy]], Smart by Nature: Schooling for Sustainability, Watershed Media (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With an understanding of ecological literacy, [[perceptions]] naturally shift. The need to protect the ecosystems is not simply a belief held by [[environmentalist]]s; it is a biological imperative for survival over the time. This [[Value (ethics)|value]] will become a basic principle for prioritizing thought and action in a sustainable society. In the face of the increasing capacity of industrial systems to destroy habitats and the [[climate system]], the explicit declaration of the principles of ecological literacy – and the resulting awareness of the importance of living within the ecological [[carrying capacity]] of the earth, is increasingly necessary. Whether ecoliteracy can address the infamous [[value-action gap]] is unclear.

The '''Edison Engineering Development Program''' (EEDP) is one of [[General Electric]]'s 8 corporate entry level programs. Focused on engineering, the program aims to "develop technical problem-solving skills through advanced courses in engineering and technical projects that are aligned with business objectives". It is named in honor of GE's founder, [[Thomas Edison]].
Typically each GE business runs its own program, and candidates are required to apply for and rotate within the program at a specific business.

EEDP, the oldest of GE's rotational programs, founded in 1923, for new BS and MS grads, provides three to five assignments (6–8 months each (12 months in GE Aviation)) over two or three years. Assignments are driven by real GE business priorities, which may include working with systems, analysis, design, quality, reliability, integration, and testing. Program members develop and enhance their technical problem-solving skills through advanced engineering course work, reports, and team presentations. Another benefit of EEDP is the opportunity to earn a masters in engineering while in (or shortly upon completion of) the program.  EEDP is most popular at the more technical businesses in GE's portfolio, including GE Aviation, Healthcare, Power, Renewable Energy, Digital, Transportation.

==Program Summary==
* Two or three year entry-level program consisting of at least three rotation assignments
* Assignments are engineering projects and may include systems, hardware/software/mechanical design, quality, and validation
* First year coursework includes advanced engineering topics to develop technical skills
* Second year coursework includes corporate leadership topics to develop business skills
* Program members are encouraged (if not required) to earn credit towards an MS degree in Engineering while on program (normally done in the third year of the program)

==Candidate Criteria==
(from GE's official site)
* Passion for technology
* Demonstrated academic excellence
* Commitment to technology and quality
* Strong analytical, problem-solving and communication skills
* Engineering degree and relevant internship/co-op experience preferred
* Minimum GPA 3.0/4.0

==Advanced Courses in Engineering==

The Advanced Courses in Engineering, or ACE, is the official title for the graduate-level coursework undertaken by EEDP members. The ACE is divided into three sections: A Course, B Course, and C Course.  Grading is assessed based on homework and/or tests.  Homework may consist of problem sets, short reports or formal reports, team or individual presentations and typically requires 20–40 hours of effort per week, which must be completed outside of normal work hours.

During the first year in the program, EEDP participants are required to take GE's engineering "A Course," which is designed to sharpen technical and problem-solving skills.  The content of A Course varies by business, but typically includes a collection of topics rooted in technology, math, and science, such as [[Statistics]], [[Differential Equations]], [[Digital Electronics]], [[Analog Electronics]], Software Design, [[Data Mining]], [[Metallurgy]], and [[Heat Transfer]], as well as business-specific engineering, which may include engines, digital imaging, chemistry, and the physics of technologies used in that business' field. For instance, wind turbine design, wind resource assessment in GE Renewable Energy. Additionally, members participate in GE's esteemed "Activating your Leadership Journey (ALJ) (Formerly: Foundations of Leadership)" course on its [[Crotonville, New York]] campus and "Eng@GE" (Engineering @ GE) in various locations in the world. 

The second year in the program, participants are required to take the "B Course," which applies technical skills to actual business proposals.  Coursework typically involves technical business fundamentals, such as program management incorporated in team projects where a certain business priority problem is solved by a team of Edisons.  Additional classes cover extensive seminars on technology and a lot of hands-on training, either in the field or at the factories. Program members may choose a major business project to complete at the conclusion of the program, and then report out to senior management on the benefits generated (cost reductions, use of advanced technologies, etc.).

The third and final part of the ACE program is "C Course," which is a strictly optional course for some businesses.  The focus of C Course is a design project related to the enrollee's Masters thesis.  Few program members pursue a C Course certificate, but it is considered a top achievement throughout technical roles at GE.

After completion of the ACE program, EEDP engineers will have a number of graduate credits they can transfer to one of several universities (typically universities located near the business, or other top schools available via distance learning) to help complete a master's degree.  This allows program participants to earn a Masters or other advanced degree through a number of top schools while still employed by GE and working full-time.

ACE requirements vary from business to business. ACE programs at all GE businesses do not strictly adhere to the above definitions of the A, B, and C Courses.

==Rotations==
The members taking this course work in a minimum of 2 or 3 fields/teams over a period of 2 to 3 years. These rotations help in bridging the knowledge gap between teams and thus adding value to the organization.

==Leadership Trainings==
The participants undergo different levels of Management trainings such as "ALJ-Activating your Leadership Journey", eng@ge-engineering @ GE, as well as Six Sigma Green Belt Certification.

{{Original research|date=October 2016}}

'''Empirical evidence''' is the [[information]] received by means of the [[senses]], particularly by [[observation]] and documentation of patterns and behavior through [[experiment]]ation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickett|2006|p=585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for experience, ἐμπειρία (''empeiría''). 

After [[Immanuel Kant]], in philosophy, it is common to call the knowledge gained ''[[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]]'' (in contrast to ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge).

==Meaning==
Empirical evidence is information that verifies the [[truth]] (which accurately corresponds to reality) or falsity (inaccuracy) of a claim. In the [[empiricism|empiricist]] view, one can claim to have knowledge only when based on empirical evidence (although some empiricists believe that there are other ways of gaining knowledge). This stands in contrast to the [[rationalism|rationalist]] view under which [[reason]] or reflection alone is considered evidence for the truth or falsity of some [[proposition]]s.&lt;ref name="cdp"&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2001|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence is information acquired by observation or experimentation. This data is recorded and analyzed by scientists.  This is the primary source of empirical evidence. Secondary sources describe, discuss, interpret, comment upon, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and process primary sources. Secondary source materials can be articles in newspapers or popular magazines, book or movie reviews, or articles found in scholarly journals that discuss or evaluate someone else's original research.&lt;ref name="cdp" /&gt;

Empirical evidence may be synonymous with the outcome of an experiment. In this regard, an empirical result is a unified confirmation. In this context, the term ''semi-empirical'' is used for qualifying theoretical methods that use, in part, basic [[axiom]]s or postulated scientific laws and experimental results. Such methods are opposed to theoretical ''[[ab initio]]'' methods, which are purely [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] and based on [[first principle]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In [[science]], empirical evidence is required for a hypothesis to gain acceptance in the [[scientific community]].  Normally, this validation is achieved by the [[scientific method]] of forming a [[hypothesis]], [[design of experiments|experimental design]], [[peer review]], [[Scientific Method#Reproducibility|reproduction of results]], conference presentation, and [[Scientific literature|journal publication]]. This requires rigorous communication of hypothesis (usually expressed in mathematics), experimental constraints and controls (expressed necessarily in terms of standard experimental apparatus), and a common understanding of measurement.

[[Statement (logic)|Statements]] and [[argument]]s depending on empirical evidence are often referred to as ''[[a posteriori]]'' ("following experience") as distinguished from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (preceding it). ''A priori'' knowledge or justification is independent of experience (for example "All bachelors are unmarried"), whereas ''a posteriori'' knowledge or justification is dependent on experience or empirical evidence (for example "Some bachelors are very happy"). The notion that the distinction between ''a posteriori'' and ''a priori'' is tantamount to the distinction between empirical and non-empirical knowledge comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]].''&lt;ref name=Craig2005&gt;{{harvnb|Craig|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard [[positivism|positivist]] view of empirically acquired information has been that observation, experience, and experiment serve as neutral arbiters between competing theories. However, since the 1960s, a persistent critique most associated with [[Thomas Kuhn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2014}} has argued that these methods are influenced by prior beliefs and experiences. Consequently, it cannot be expected that two scientists when observing, experiencing, or experimenting on the same event will make the same theory-neutral observations. The role of observation as a theory-neutral arbiter may not be possible. Theory-dependence of observation means that, even if there were agreed methods of inference and interpretation, scientists may still disagree on the nature of empirical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' (DFI) is an independent non-profit organization devoted to research on and documentation of contemporary [[Franco-German relations]].

[[Image:DFI Villa.jpg|thumb|The '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' in Ludwigsburg.]]
The institute is funded by the [[German Foreign Office]], the regional government of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the town of [[Ludwigsburg]]. Projects are also funded by external partners.

== History ==
The Institute was established in 1948, with the aim of promoting Franco-German cooperation in all areas of public life and academia. It is based in  [[Ludwigsburg]], a Paris office being opened in 2004. In 1990 the Frankreich-Bibliothek, a library and documentation centre, was opened in Ludwigsburg. 

Founding members of the DFI included prominent figures, such as [[Joseph Rovan]] and Alfred Grosser, on the French side, and the Germans [[Theodor Heuss]] and [[Carlo Schmid (German politician)|Carlo Schmid]]. The first director was Fritz Schenk (1948-1972), followed by [[Robert Picht]] (1972-2002) and Frank Baasner (2002- ). The titular head of the Institute is the president, currently the former prime minister of Baden Württemberg, [[Erwin Teufel]]. 

The Institute currently has approximately 20 members of staff, including 5 researchers.

== Profile and activities ==
The dfi conducts applied research and provides consultancy on social, political and economic developments in France and on topics relating to Franco-German relations. The core research areas of economic policy, social policy, European policy, and [[intercultural communication]] form the focus of its activities, which are mainly long-term projects, partially or wholly funded by external financing from foundations or businesses. With the aim of promoting links between research and practice, the dfi hosts conferences and seminars, publishes extensively, and provides background information for the media.

In addition to this, the Institute holds seminars and training sessions for various groups. Participants include journalists and students from France and Germany. The research staff also teach at German and foreign universities.

The Institute’s activities are chiefly directed at decision makers and those occupying positions of influence in politics, business, education and the media, but also at the German and French public.

== Frankreich-Bibliothek ==
[[Image:DFI Bibliothek.JPG|thumb|The Frankreich-Bibliothek of the '''Deutsch-Französisches Institut''' in Ludwigsburg.]]
The open access library and documentation centre was opened in 1990,  the collection focusing on contemporary France and Franco-German relations. The library currently holds around 37,000 volumes. In addition, there is a press cuttings archive containing over half a million articles, covering the period from 1975 to the present. The press archive has been online since summer 2009, although older material has not yet been retro-digitalised.

The dfi, represented by the Frankreich-Bibliothek, is a member of the information network “International Relations and Area Studies” (FIV) and thus participates in the production of the World Affairs Online database (WAO). All literature, including relevant journal articles and book chapters, is catalogued in the FIV database and can be searched via the dfi catalogue, as well as through further regional and national online catalogues. The Frankreich-Bibliothek is an associate member of the Südwestdeutschen Bibliotheksverbund, a union catalogue.

With the support of the Wüstenrot Foundation, the dfi offers a limited number of grants for short-term research in the library for both undergraduate and post-graduate students from Germany and abroad.

'''Gay Meets Girl''' ({{lang-nl|Een man weet niet wat hij mist}}; lit. ''A man does not know what he is missing'') is a 2013 Dutch documentary film written, directed by and starring Tim den Besten and Nicolaas Veul. The documentary film explores the subjects of sexual fluidity and bisexuality through a gay man's quest to have sex with a woman. The original Dutch title means "A man doesn't know what he's missing" in English, a reference to a gay man not know what he is missing out on by not having sex with women. The documentary aired on [[Dutch public broadcasting system|Dutch public television]].

==Plot==
Tim den Besten (age 26) and Nicolaas Veul (age 29) are documentary makers and friends. They are both [[gay men]], or at least, they think they are gay. Tim and Nicolaas set out to test and explore the boundaries of their [[Human male sexuality|sexualities]]. Tim is a gold-star gay man (a gay man who has never had sex with a woman) and decides that he wants to lose his [[Virginity#Definitions of virginity loss|heterosexual virginity]] to a woman. The documentary filmmakers want to explore whether or not [[Innate bisexuality|"everyone is bisexual"]], as is common in the [[Homosexual behavior in animals|animal world]], as well as what the boundaries to gay male sexuality are. Tim wants to find out if his [[sexual orientation]] is as fixed as he believed it to be or if he might not be as gay as he thought.

The documentary opens with Nicolaas interviewing Tim about the issues of homosexuality and sex with women. Nicolaas interrogates Tim, asking him what it means to be "[[gay]]" and what Tim's own "gayness" entails. Nicolaas asks Tim if he currently sleeps with women or slept with women in the past. When Tim explains that he has never been with a woman, Nicolaas asks him why he has never considered it. Nicolaas further relates to Tim that sleeping with women was surprisingly enjoyable and that trying sex with women helped him realize he was not as gay as he believed himself to be. Nicolaas tells Tim that he wants him to have sex with a woman, causing Tim to repeatedly decline the suggestion and claim he would never sleep with a woman. Nicolaas insists that Tim should sleep with a woman, engaging in a [[Socratic method|Socratic-style]] debate with Tim about the merits of sex with women, with Tim eventually [[Seduction|relenting]] and coming to the conclusion that gay men having sex with women is the correct thing to do. Tim further adds that he has no reason not to try it and that sleeping with a woman would give him a better understanding of his own sexuality. Nicolaas relates that after trying so hard to be gay, including [[coming out]] to parents and society as well as being involved in the [[gay community]], it can be very difficult for a gay man to "go back" and start sleeping with women again, but that the stigma shouldn't deter gay men from sleeping with women.

During the documentary, Tim and Nicolaas visit a [[sex coach]] to give them lessons on [[heterosexual intercourse|heterosexual intimacy]] and [[female sexuality]] and help prepare Tim for his [[Deflower|heterosexual deflowering]]. They also visit a [[bonobo]] habitat to learn about the bisexual behavior of the primate species. They visit with science journalist Asha ten Broeke, who offers her view that all human beings, including all gay men, are bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.2doc.nl/documentaires/series/3doc/2013/een-man-weet-niet-wat-hij-mist.html |title=A man does not know what he's missing |publisher=[[2Doc]] |accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim arranges to meet a [[Pornographic film actor|pornographic film actress]] in France who wants to have sex with an openly gay man. [[Judy Minx]], a French porn actress, tells Tim she has only ever had sex with [[straight men]], but is enthusiastic about having sex with a gay man in order to explore the boundaries of homosexuality and go beyond homosexuality's [[Heterosexual–homosexual continuum|binary]] limitations. The film culminates with Tim losing his gold-star by having [[Unsimulated sex|unsimulated]] heterosexual intercourse with the French woman, while Nicolaas films the sexual encounter. During their encounter, Tim tries vaginal sex, performs cunnilingus and receives heterosexual fellatio for the first time. Afterwards, Tim [[high-fives]] the woman he just slept with and gives the [[thumbs-up sign]] to Nicolaas, happy and excited that he'd just finished having his first straight sex. Nicolaas is smiling and asking how things went, while Tim explains to Nicolaas that the sex was excellent and he was surprised by how easy it was for him to perform heterosexual sex. One month later Nicolaas interviewed Tim again, with Tim reiterating that he was glad he tried heterosexual sex and still considered it to have been a very enjoyable experience. However, Tim makes clear that his homosexuality has not been "[[Sexual orientation change efforts|cured]]" as he is still sexually and romantically attracted to men.

It was the goal of Tim and Nicolaas to reject the [[compartmentalization (psychology)|compartmentalization]] of human sexuality into the categories of "gay" or "straight" by exploring sexual fluidity and [[bi-curiosity]]. Tim believes the film was a success because he accomplished what he set out to do by answering whether a gay man could have satisfactory sex with a woman. The answer was "yes", because Tim was able to easily have sex with a woman and enjoy the experience. Tim described his experience of sleeping with a woman and losing his gold-star by saying, "Can you be gay and still have satisfying sex with a girl? I did it and it was quite a revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paduaan.nl/tim-den-besten/ |title=TIM DEN BESTEN "IF I YOLANTHE ENCOUNTER, I RUN REAL HARD ROAD" |publisher=Paduaan |accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The film caused controversy in the Netherlands, with some denouncing the film as prurient or [[homophobic]]. Given that the documentary was financed by the publicly funded Dutch television channel [[VPRO]], some objected that the government was paying a gay man to have sex with a woman. One Dutch newspaper headline read: "Gay wants sex with woman, using your taxpayer money." Other critics objected to the fact that the sex was shown on television. VPRO received many angry letters from viewers, particularly gay men who felt that the program encouraged a "[[Reparative therapy|gay cure]]". Tim defended the film, claiming that it was not homophobic because he is gay and he simply wanted to see if sex with a woman would be physically arousing. While some of Tim's friends criticized him as shameless, his parents were supportive of his film. In an interview with [[de Volkskrant]] magazine, Tim said he announced to his father, "Dad, I'm going to have sex with a girl" during a dinner party. Tim described this as a "second-coming out" and says that his father was supportive of his choice to sleep with a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief/-ik-durf-meer-met-camera-dan-zonder~a3517683/ |title='Ik durf meer met camera dan zonder' |publisher= |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Dutch journalist Fleur Baxmeier, Tim said his parents attended the premier of the film, but sat in the hallway during the scene where Tim loses his gay gold-star because they didn't want to see their son having sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fleurbaxmeier.nl/pdf/viva/VIVA_Nicolaas_en_Tim.pdf |title=STATUS: GESLOOPT - Nicolaas en Tim over het effect van 'Super stream me' |publisher=Fleur Baxmeier |accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction from the Dutch daily morning newspaper [[De Telegraaf]] was negative. The newspaper dismissed the program as a "sex dating show". The newspaper declared that "VPRO is looking for heterosexual girls for gay boys". Noting that Tim den Besten had made an appeal on the internet for a woman to take his virginity, De Telegraaf wondered how many women would want to sign up for such a program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/21727430/__Seksdating_bij_VPRO__.html |title=VPRO zoekt hetero-meisjes voor homo-jongens |publisher=[[De Telegraaf]] |accessdate=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Nieuwe Revu]], Dutch television presenter [[Rutger Castricum]] defended the documentary by saying that fears that the film advocated a cure for homosexuality were nonsense and the people in the gay community who complained about the film looked ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revu.nl/nu-in-revu/rutger-castricum-is-verworden-tot-een-vadsige-en-onsympathieke-presentator-in-een-tenenkrommende-talkshow-zonde/ |title=‘Rutger Castricum is verworden tot een vadsige en onsympathieke presentator in een tenenkrommende talkshow’ |publisher=[[Nieuwe Revu]] |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bram de Wijs, the gay drummer for the Dutch band "[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Seven_Left Only Seven Left] expressed concern with the film's "awkward and homophobic" and "nasty" premise, likening it to homophobic people who ask gay men how they can know they are gay if they haven't had sex with a woman and macho men who believe that lesbians need to find the right man. De Wijs denies den Besten's homosexuality, declaring him to be "not a bit" gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bramdewijs.nl/2013/een-man-weet-niet-wat-hij-mist/ |title=Een Man Weet Niet Wat Hij Mist |publisher=Bram de Wijs |accessdate=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In an interview with [[HUMO]] magazine, Nicolaas Veul stated that it was his idea for Tim den Besten to have sex with a woman on camera and film it. Nicolaas and Tim would often talk about sexual matters, but when Nicolaas asked Tim if he'd ever had sex with a woman, Tim replied that he would never want to do it. It was from these conversations that Nicolaas developed the idea of Tim losing his heterosexual virginity on camera and basing a film around the event that would explore the topics of [[bisexuality]] and gay men's [[sexual fluidity]]. At the outset, Nicolaas identified as a gay man but had dated women and had heterosexual sex in the past, and although Tim had dated a woman before, he identified as a gay man and had never slept with a woman. Tim was initially hesitant about losing his heterosexual virginity, but found himself increasingly aroused by Nicolaas's suggestion that he sleep with a woman and film it, eventually deciding to go ahead with the project. Tim decided he wanted to sleep with a woman because he felt it important to challenge the Dutch taboo on sexual experimentation. While Tim still identifies as gay he has said he is glad he slept with a woman and learned a lot from the experience, while Nicolaas has stated that he found the effect of the heterosexual sex on Tim to be so interesting that it has motivated him to consider having sex with women again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humo.be/tv-tips/260743/docu-een-man-weet-niet-wat-hij-mist |title=Docu: Een man weet niet wat hij mist |publisher=[[HUMO]] |accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[de Volkskrant]], Nicolaas stated that while Tim had always said he would never have sex with a woman, Nicolaas believed Tim was capable of having heterosexual sex and enjoying it. Although Tim felt initial resistance to the concept, Nicolaas states that overcoming Tim's resistance and capturing the results on film was the purpose of the documentary. Nicolaas also said that Tim's heterosexual experiment enriched him, so Nicolaas was inspired to consider trying straight sex again. Nicolaas says he slept with a woman to prove he was a "real man", but wants to truly enjoy sex with women in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief/seks-buiten-je-hokje~a3533495/ |title=Seks buiten je hokje |publisher=[[de Volkskrant]] |accessdate=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema ==

===Features===
Gross-out is a [[genre|subgenre]] of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully "tasteless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor]|first=Joe Garner ; foreword by Richard|title=Made you laugh! : the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movie comedy|year=2004|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-7407-4695-2|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capsuto|first=Steven|title=Alternate channels : the uncensored story of gay and lesbian images on radio and television|year=2000|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-41243-5|pages=250|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or [[Schadenfreude]]. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Geoff|title=Film comedy|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=1-903364-35-3|pages=73|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie "edgy" and to generate media attention for it.

===History===
In the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious [[Production Code]] and its replacement with the [[MPAA film rating system]] in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive&lt;ref name= "Mitchell03"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink = Elvis Mitchell | title = Revisiting Faber College (Toga, Toga, Toga!) | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages =  | language = | publisher = | date=25 August 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/movies/critic-s-notebook-revisiting-faber-college-toga-toga-toga.html | accessdate = 2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions.  Noteworthy examples include 1972's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and 1974's sketch comedy film ''[[The Groove Tube]]''. As these films emerged from the [[counterculture]] movement and gained a measure of audience success,&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the [[lost film|lost]] ''[[Nell's Eugenic Wedding]]'' starring [[Fay Tincher]] and [[Tod Browning]].

The label "gross-out movie" was first applied by the mainstream media to [[1978 in film|1978]]'s ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[Animal House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernheimer|first=Kathryn|title=The 50 funniest movies of all time : a critic's ranking|year=1999|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0-8065-2091-4|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comedy about the [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] experience at [[Higher education in the United States|US colleges]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Its humor included not only explicit use of bodily functions (like projectile vomiting), but also references to topical political matters like [[Kent State shootings]], [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam war]], and the [[Civil rights movement#Civil rights movement in the United States|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name= "Peterson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Molly | title = ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' | work = [[National Public Radio]] | date = July 29, 2002 | url = https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/animalhouse/ | accessdate = 2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a great [[box office]] success despite its limited production costs and thus started an industry trend.&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Since then, gross-out films increased in number, and became almost the norm for American comedy films. Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[American Pie (series)|American Pie]]'' or ''[[Eurotrip]]''), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' or ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'').

== Television ==
{{advert|date=June 2012}}

''The Tom Green Show and [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and its UK cousin, ''[[Dirty Sanchez (television series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'', were the pioneers of "gross out television".  The shows featured dangerous [[stunts]], [[nudity]], [[profanity]], and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on [[MTV]], and progressed to feature-length movies.  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[Rugrats]], [[Rocko's Modern Life]],  [[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]], and ''[[Animaniacs]]'' transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen [[animation]] largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', [[Regular Show]], [[American Dad!]] and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

== Theater ==

Gross-out [[theater]] is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous [[United Kingdom|British]] theaters.

The prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' by bestselling playwright and author [[Irvine Welsh]]; the controversial New York musical ''[[Urinetown]]'' by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous [[anarchistic]] schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre ''Restart'' by Komedy Kollective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komedykollective.com komedykollective.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the [[iconic]] theatrical [[gorefest]] ''Bloody Mess''.

== Art ==

Controversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer [[Basil Wolverton]] invented his trademark "[[spaghetti]] and [[meatball]]s" style of artwork.

Various artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were [[Damien Hirst]], known for encasing mutilated, rotting [[cattle]] in [[formaldehyde]], and making art of [[endangered]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[species]] such as [[shark]]s in formaldehyde tanks, and [[Tracey Emin]], whose [[Art exhibition|exhibit]] of an unmade [[bed]] featured used [[tampons]], [[condoms]] and blood-stained [[underwear]].

== Music ==

Gross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[hard rock]], where shock value helps create marketable notoriety.  Bands include [[Blink-182]] famous for including [[breast]] and [[fart]] jokes in their songs, while bands such as [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]] write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.

Probably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of [[GG Allin]]. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.

Sometimes the line between truth and [[urban myth]] is blurred by the [[sensationalist]] sections of the media.  For example, [[Frank Zappa]] never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving [[Ozzy Osbourne]] biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).

Similar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a [[Single (music)|single]] from [[indie (music)|indie]]/[[garage rock]] band, [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

[[File:Bischofferode Grotte01.jpg|thumb|294x294px|A Marian grotto in [[Bischofferode]], [[Germany]]]]
A '''grotto''' (Italian ''grotta'' and French ''grotte'') is a natural or artificial [[cave]] used by humans in both modern times and antiquity, and historically or prehistorically. Naturally occurring grottoes are often small caves near water that are usually flooded or liable to flood at [[high tide]]. Sometimes, artificial grottoes are used as [[garden feature]]s. The ''[[Blue Grotto (Capri)|Grotta Azzurra]]'' at [[Capri]] and the grotto at the villa of [[Tiberius]] in the [[Bay of Naples]] are examples of popular natural seashore grottoes.

Whether in tidal water or high up in hills, grottoes are generally made up of [[limestone]] [[geology]], where the acidity of standing water has [[Solvation|dissolved]] the [[carbonate]]s in the [[rock matrix]] as it passes through what were originally small fissures.{{cn|date=June 2018}} See [[karst topography]], [[cavern]].
{{Wiktionary|grotto}}

==Etymology==
The word "grotto" comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''grotta'', [[Vulgar Latin]] grupta, and [[Latin]] crypta (a [[crypt]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' "grotto".&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also related by a historical accident to the word "grotesque". In the late 15th century, Romans accidentally unearthed [[Nero]]'s ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' on the [[Palatine Hill]], a series of rooms, decorated with designs of garlands, slender architectural framework, foliage, and animals. The rooms had sunk underground over time. The Romans who discovered this historical monument found it very strange, partly because it was uncovered from an "underworld" source. This led the Romans of that era to give it the name ''grottesca'', from which came the French ''[[grotesque]]''.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Taq-e Bostan - view of two grottoes.jpg|thumb|upright|Two vaulted grottoes called [[Taq-e Bostan]], located in Iran, [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] era]]
Grottoes were very popular in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture. Spring-fed grottoes were a feature of Apollo's oracles at [[Delphi]], [[Corinth]], and [[Clarus]].&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Elderkin, "The Natural and the Artificial Grotto", ''Hesperia'' '''10'''.2 (April – June 1941), pp. 125–137, gives numerous well-known ancient Greek examples, natural and architectural, with some details of their sites.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] city of [[Rhodes]] was designed with rock-cut artificial grottoes incorporated into the city, made to look natural.&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Rice, "Grottoes on the Acropolis of Hellenistic Rhodes", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''90''' (1995), pp. 383–404.&lt;/ref&gt; At the great Roman sanctuary of [[Palestrina|Praeneste]] south of Rome, the oldest portion of the primitive sanctuary was situated on the second lowest terrace, in a grotto in the natural rock where a spring developed into a well. According to tradition, Praeneste's sacred spring had a native [[nymph]], who was honored in a grotto-like watery [[nymphaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R.A. van Aken, "Some Aspects of Nymphaea in Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia" ''[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]'', Fourth Series, '''4'''.3/4 (1951), pp. 272–284&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiberius]], the Roman emperor, filled his grotto with sculptures to create a sense of mythology, perhaps channeling [[Polyphemus]]' cave in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The [[numinous]] quality of the grotto is still more ancient: in a grotto near [[Knossos]] in Crete, [[Eileithyia]] was venerated, even before [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-building. Even farther back in time, the [[immanence]] of the divine in a grotto is seen in the sacred caves of [[Lascaux]].

== Garden grotto history and design ==
[[File:Villa torrigiani di lucca, scalinata.JPG|thumb|Grotto entrance, [[Villa Torrigiani]]]]

The popularity of artificial grottoes introduced the [[Mannerism|Mannerist style]] to Italian and French gardens of the mid-16th century. Two famous grottoes in the [[Boboli Gardens]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]] were begun by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] and completed by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati|Ammanati]] and [[Bernardo Buontalenti|Buontalenti]] between 1583 and 1593. One of these grottoes originally housed the ''Prisoners'' of [[Michelangelo]]. Before the Boboli grotto, a garden was laid out by [[Niccolò Tribolo]] at the Medici [[Niccolò Tribolo|Villa Castello]], near [[Florence]]. At [[Villa di Pratolino|Pratolino]], in spite of the dryness of the site, there was a Grotto of Cupid (surviving), with water tricks for the unsuspecting visitor.&lt;ref&gt;Webster Smith, "Pratolino", ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' '''20'''.4 (December 1961), pp. 155–168.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fonte di Fata Morgana]] ("Fata Morgana's Spring") at Grassina, not far from Florence, is a small garden building, built in 1573–4 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa "Riposo" (rest) of Bernardo Vecchietti. It is decorated with sculptures in the [[Giambologna]]n manner.

The outsides of garden grottoes are often designed to look like an enormous rock, a rustic porch or a rocky overhang. Inside, they are decorated as a temple or with fountains, [[stalactites]] and imitation gems and shells (sometimes made in ceramic); herms and mermaids, mythological subjects suited to the space; and [[naiad]]s, or river gods whose urns spilled water into pools.  Damp grottoes were cool places to retreat from the Italian sun, but they also became fashionable in the cool drizzle of the [[Île-de-France]]. In [[Kuskovo]] in the Sheremetev estate there is a Summer Grotto, built in 1775.
[[File:Villa torrigiani di lucca, statua 04.JPG|thumb|upright|Sculpture in a grotto setting, [[Villa Torrigiani]], Lucca]]

Grottoes could also serve as baths; an example of this is at the [[Palazzo del Te]], in the 'Casino della Grotta', where a small suite of intimate rooms is laid out around a grotto and ''loggetta'' (covered balcony). Courtiers once bathed in the small cascade that splashed over the pebbles and shells encrusted in the floor and walls.

Grottoes have also served as [[chapel]]s, or at [[Villa Farnese]] at Caprarola, a little theater designed in the grotto manner. They were often combined with cascading fountains in Renaissance gardens.

The grotto designed by [[Bernard Palissy]] for [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s château in [[Paris, France|Paris]], the [[Tuileries]], was renowned. There are also grottoes in the gardens designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] for [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. In England, an early garden grotto was built at [[Wilton House]] in the 1630s, probably by [[Isaac de Caus]].

Grottoes were suitable for less formal gardens too. [[Pope's Grotto]], created by [[Alexander Pope]], is almost all that survives of one of the very first [[Landscape architecture|landscape gardens]] in England, at [[Twickenham]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Bracher, "Pope's Grotto: The Maze of Fancy Pope's Grotto: The Maze of Fancy", ''The Huntington Library Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (February 1949), pp. 141–162; Anthony Beckles Willson, "Alexander Pope's Grotto in Twickenham", ''Garden History'' '''26'''.1 (Summer, 1998), pp. 31–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope was inspired after seeing grottoes in Italy during a visit there. Efforts are under way to restore his grotto.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/11866157/Inside-Alexander-Popes-hidden-grotto.html] Lambert, Victoria. “Inside Alexander Pope's hidden grotto”. The Telegraph.  September 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There are grottoes in the landscape gardens of [[Painshill Park]],&lt;ref&gt;Alison Hodges, "Painshill, Cobham, Surrey: The Grotto", ''Garden History'' '''3'''.2 (Spring 1975), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stowe Landscape Garden|Stowe]], [[Clandon Park]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;James Turner, "The Structure of Henry Hoare's Stourhead", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''61'''.1 (March 1979), pp. 68–77; Malcolm Kelsall, "The Iconography of Stourhead", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''46'''(1983), pp. 133–143; Kenneth Woodbridge, "Henry Hoare's Paradise," ''The Art Bulletin'' '''47'''.1 (March 1965), pp. 83–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's Grotto is a series of interconnected chambers, extending 67&amp;nbsp;ft (20 metres) into the chalk hillside on the outskirts of [[Ware, Hertfordshire]]. Built during the late 18th century, the chambers and tunnels are lined with shells, flints and pieces of coloured glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scotts-grotto.org/CMS/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513215354/http://scotts-grotto.org/CMS/index.php |archivedate=2005-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic generation of tourists might not actually visit [[Fingal's Cave]], on the remote isle of [[Staffa]] in the Scottish [[Hebrides]], but they have often heard of it, perhaps through [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s "[[Hebrides Overture]]", better known as "[[Hebrides Overture|Fingal's Cave]]", which was inspired by his visit. In the 19th century, when miniature [[Matterhorn]]s and rock-gardens became fashionable, a grotto was often found, such as at [[Ascott House]]. In Bavaria, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig]]'s [[Linderhof]] contains an abstraction of the grotto under Venusberg, which figured in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''.

Although grottoes have largely fallen from fashion since the British [[Picturesque]] movement, architects and artists occasionally try to redefine the grotto in contemporary design works. Such examples include Aranda/Lasch's ''Grotto Concept,'' (2005), Callum Moreton's ''Grotto'' pavilion (2010), ARM's post-modern ''Storey Hall'' (1995), and [[Frederick Kiesler]]'s ''Grotto of Meditation for New Harmony'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alderslade, Jessica| title=An Introduction to the Grotto and Its Place within Contemporary Design|work=  Reinterpreting the Grotto in Contemporary Design|location= Australia, |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, artificial grottoes are purchased and built for ornamental and devotional purposes. They are often used as [[shrine]]s in which to place statues of saints, particularly the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], in outdoor gardens.

Many [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] visit a grotto where [[Bernadette Soubirous]] claimed she saw apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Numerous garden shrines are modelled after these apparitions. They can commonly be found displayed in gardens and [[church architecture|churches]], among other places (see [[Lourdes grotto]]).

[[File:Hankycode.jpg|thumb|An assortment of handkerchiefs]]
{{LGBT symbols}}

The '''handkerchief code''' (also known as the '''hanky code''', the '''bandana code''', and '''flagging'''&lt;ref name=Andrews2010 &gt;{{cite book | last=Andrews | first=Vincent | year=2010 | title=The Leatherboy Handbook | publisher=The Nazca Plains Corp. | isbn=978-1-61098-046-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Color coding|color-coded system]], employed usually among the [[gay]] male [[casual sex|casual-sex]] seekers or [[BDSM]] practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, to indicate preferred [[sexual fetish]]es, what kind of sex they are seeking, and whether they are a [[top (sex)|top]]/[[dominance and submission|dominant]] or [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]/submissive.

Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a "top" (one considered active in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief), while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a "bottom" (one considered passive in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief).  The hanky code was widely used in the 1970s by gay and [[bisexual]] men.

==Origin==
[[File:Handkerchief code.jpg|thumb|Hanky code]]

The wearing of various colored bandanas around the neck was common in the mid- and late-nineteenth century among [[cowboy]]s, [[Railroad engineer|steam railroad engineer]]s, and [[miner]]s in the [[Western United States]]. It is thought that the wearing of [[Kerchief|bandanas]] by gay men originated in [[San Francisco]] after the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], when, because of a shortage of women, men dancing with each other in [[square dance]]s developed a code wherein the man wearing the blue bandana took the male part in the square dance, and the man wearing the red bandana took the female part (these bandanas were usually worn around the arm or hanging from the belt or in the back pocket of one's [[jeans]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} . It is thought that the modern hanky code started in New York City in late 1970 or early 1971 when a journalist for the ''[[Village Voice]]'' joked that instead of simply wearing keys to indicate whether someone was a "top" or a "bottom", it would be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored hankies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Susan |last1= Stryker |authorlink= Susan Stryker |first2= Jim |last2= Van Buskirk |title= Gay by the Bay: A History of Queer Culture in the San Francisco Bay Area |location= San Francisco |publisher= [[Chronicle Books]] |year= 1996 |page= 18 |isbn= 0-8118-1187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources attribute the expansion of the original red–blue system into today’s code to marketing efforts around 1971 by the San Francisco [[department store]] for erotic merchandise, The Trading Post, promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing the meanings of various colors.&lt;ref name="gay-semiotics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Hal |date=1977 |title=Gay Semiotics ♂ |url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/HalPages/GaySempg2.html |location=San Francisco |publisher=NFS Press |isbn=0-917986-03-2|quote=In San Francisco, the signs began appearing around 1971. The Trading Post, a department store specializing in erotic merchandise, began promoting handkerchiefs in the store and printing cards with their meanings. The red and blue handkerchiefs and their significance were already in existence, and meanings were assigned to other colors as well. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alan Selby, founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco, claimed that he created the first hanky code with his business partners at Leather 'n' Things in 1972, when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and the expanded code would help them sell the extra colors they had received.&lt;ref name="selby"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jordy|date=2017|title=The Mayor of Folsom Street, The Auto/Biography of "Daddy Alan" Selby aka Mr. S|publisher=Fair Page Media LLC|isbn=978-0-9989098-0-6|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

This table is drawn from [[Larry Townsend]]'s ''The Leatherman's Handbook II'' (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) and is generally considered authoritative. Implicit in this list is the concept of left/right polarity, left as usual indicating the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner.  Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color "only because the idea of the hankie turns them on" or "may not even know what it means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=Larry|title=The Leatherman's Handbook II |year=1983 |publisher=Modernismo Publications |location=New York |isbn=0-89237-010-6 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer lists found on the web are more elaborate and the many color codes in them are less often used in practice, although some of these colors are offered for sale at LGBT stores along with free cards listing their meanings.

In mass communication, the '''Hierarchy of Influences''', formally known as the '''Hierarchical Influences Model''', is an organized theoretical framework introduced by [[Pamela Shoemaker]] &amp; Stephen D. Reese. It comprises five levels of influence on media content from the macro to micro levels: social systems, social institutions, media organizations, routine practices, and individuals. This framework was introduced in their book ''Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media Content''.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (1996). Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media Content, 2nd edn, White Plains, NY: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Five levels of Hierarchy of Influences ==

The framework was proposed for use in media effects research of media content. Based on media sociology and psychological studies perspective, the framework "takes into account the multiple forces that simultaneously impinge on media and suggests how influence at one level may interact with that at another."&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most media effects study treat media content as independent variable to understand how audience use media content and how they are influenced by media content, "Hierarchy of Influences" framework treats media content as dependent variable and five levels of influences as potential independent variables.

Overall, the framework provides a way to understand the "media and their links with culture, other organizations, and institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social systems ===

The macro social systems level is the outer-most ring of the model that represent the influences from social systems as a whole. This level focus on how ideological forces shape and influence media content. For this reason, it is often employed in cross-national comparative media studies.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge..&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social institutions ===

Social institutional level describes influences coming from larger trans-organizational media field. How media organizations combine into larger institutions that become part of larger structured relationships that compete or depend on each other as powerful social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media organizations ===

Media organization level is distinguished from routines as this level describes larger organizational and occupational context such as organizational policy, occupational roles, and how the media enterprise  itself is structured.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Routine practices ===

The routines level has three sources of routines, which constrain and enable communicators in their work process: audiences, organizations, and suppliers of content. Journalists have developed routines from endless pattern of norms in response to common situations. This level is where Mr. Gates or [[gatekeeping (communication)]] theory is also applied in journalists' appearance

=== Individuals ===

The micro individual level is located at the center of the model. On this level, individual communicator's characteristics, on both personal and professional, influence media content. Individual's innate characteristics such as gender, race, religious and political background influence media content indirectly through shaping personal attitude and values (e.g. ethical values) as well as professional roles and education.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Hierarchy of influences model has been employed as theoretical framework to explain different levels of influences on media content.

The '''High Flux Australian Reactor''' ('''HIFAR''') was Australia's first [[nuclear reactor]]. It was built at the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]] (later [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|ANSTO]]) Research Establishment at {{NSWcity|Lucas Heights}}, [[Sydney]]. The reactor was in operation between 1958 and 2007, when it was superseded by the [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor]], also in Lucas Heights.

==Background and operation==
Based on the [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO reactor]] at [[Harwell]] in the UK, HIFAR was cooled and moderated by [[heavy water]] ([[deuterium oxide|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]), and the fuel was [[enriched uranium]]. There was also a graphite neutron reflector surrounding the core. Like DIDO, its original purpose was nuclear materials testing, using its high neutron flux to give materials intended for use in [[nuclear power reactor]]s their entire expected lifetime neutron exposure in a relatively short period.

HIFAR was used for research, particularly [[neutron diffraction]] experiments, production of neutron transmutation doped (NTD) silicon, and for production of medical and industrial [[radioisotope]]s.

HIFAR went critical at 11:15 pm local time on 26 January 1958,&lt;ref name="hifar_background"&gt;{{cite press release|author=|title=HIFAR Media Backgrounder|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/6449/HIFAR_Media_Backgrounder.pdf|format=PDF|work=|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first run at full power of {{convert|10|MW}} (thermal) in 1960. The initial fuel was highly enriched uranium, but over the years the enrichment level of new fuel was steadily reduced, in line with international trends designed to reduce the danger of diversion of research reactor fuel for weapons programs. HIFAR completed conversion to low enriched uranium fuel (LEU) in 2006.
Of the six DIDO class reactors built including DIDO itself, HIFAR was the last to cease operation.  Permanent decommissioning of HIFAR commenced on 30 January 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Science Minister turns off nuclear reactor|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1836243.htm|work=ABC online|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to be completed by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/history_of_ansto/hifar|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505144252/http://www2.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/history_of_ansto/hifar|title=Australia's first reactor|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|archivedate=5 May 2013|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 2006 [[Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor]] (abbreviated as OPAL), the {{convert|20|MW}} replacement reactor located on an adjacent site, went critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/anstos_research_reactor/development_of_opal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162011/http://www2.ansto.gov.au/discovering_ansto/anstos_research_reactor/development_of_opal|title=Development of OPAL|publisher=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation|archivedate=16 May 2013|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPAL is served by the same complex of research, isotope production and remote handling laboratories.  The two reactors ran in parallel for six months while OPAL was being tested. HIFAR was then permanently shut down and OPAL took over HIFAR's role of Australia's only operating nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="hifar_background" /&gt;

"'''Im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon'''" ("In [[Ashkelon]]'s Black Whale") is a popular academic [[commercium song]]. It was known as a beer-drinking song in many German speaking ancient universities. [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] provided the lyrics under the title '''''Altassyrisch''''' ([[Assyria|Old Assyrian]]) 1854, the melody is from 1783 or earlier&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lieder-archiv.de/im_schwarzen_walfisch_zu_askalon-notenblatt_600700.html Lieder-Archiv (de) (Song Archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Content ==
The lyrics reflect an endorsement of the [[bacchanalia]]n mayhem of student life, similar as in [[Gaudeamus igitur]]. The song describes an [[Assyria|old Assyrian]] [[drinking binge]] of a man in an inn with some references to the [[Classics]]. The desks are made of marble and the large invoice is being provided in [[cuneiform]] on bricks. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in Nineveh. A Nubian house servant kicks him out then and the song closes with the notion, that (compare John 4:44) a prophet has no honor in his own country, if he doesn't pay cash for his consumption.  [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] has translated the poems among other works of Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], Gaudeamus! Humorous Poems by Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35848?msg=welcome_stranger#bibrec Ebook-Nr. 35848 on gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Each stanza begins with the naming verse "Im Schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon", but varies the outcome. The "Im" is rather prolonged with the melody and increases the impact. Some of the stanzas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im schwarzen Wallfisch zu Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
Da trank ein Mann drei Tag',
&lt;br&gt;
Bis dass er steif wie ein Besenstiel
&lt;br&gt;
Am Marmortische lag.
&lt;br&gt;

'In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
A man drank day by day,
&lt;br&gt;
Till, stiff as any broom-handle,
&lt;br&gt;
Upon the floor he lay.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
The waiters brought the bill,
&lt;br&gt;
In arrow-heads on six broad tiles
&lt;br&gt;
To him who thus did swill.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
No prophet hath renown;
&lt;br&gt;
And he who there would drink in peace
&lt;br&gt;
Must pay the money down.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras, parodistic notions on current science,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to German Poetry: A Dual-Language Book, Gustave Mathieu, Guy Stern Courier Dover Publications, 31.05.2012, including as well a translation 
&lt;/ref&gt; as e.g. [[Historical criticism]] and interpretations of the [[Book of Jonah]] as a mere shipwrecking narrative. According to Scheffel, the guest didn't try to get back in the inn as „Aussi bini, aussi bleibi, wai Ascalun, ihr grobi Kaibi“ (I been out, I stay so, you rude Aschkelon calves). There are various additional verses, including political parodist ones and verses mocking different sorts of fraternities.
The song has been used as name for traditional inns and restaurants, e.g. in Heidelberg and [[Bad Säckingen]]. In Bad Säckingen the name was used on several (consecutive) inns and was namegiver for the still existing club "Walfisch Gesellschaft Säckingen" (Walfischia), honoring Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotel-restaurant-schwarzer-walfisch.de/de/geschichte.html Hotel-Restaurant “Zum Schwarzen Walfisch” Bad Säckingen]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics International ==
There is one version just and only one for mathematics, called 'International'.&lt;ref&gt;History of Mathematics: A Supplement C. Smoryński, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient times, upon the door &lt;br&gt;
Of Plato, there was writt'n: &lt;br&gt;
“To each non-mathematicus &lt;br&gt;
The entrance is forbidd'n.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same stanza is available in further 13 languages, including Greek (Μελαίνῃ τῇ ἐν Φαλαίνᾳ - Melaínē (black) tē (the) en (in) Phalaína (whale)) and Volapük, which are sung one after the other.

==Overview and History==

The Instructional Skills Workshop (ISW) is offered within a small group setting (5-6 participants) and is designed to enhance the teaching effectiveness of both new and experienced educators. It is a structured approach to peer feedback on [[microteaching]] with additional thematic sessions for instructors' learning. During the 24-hour workshop (usually offered over 3-4 days), participants design and conduct three "mini-lessons" and receive verbal, written and video feedback from the other participants who have been learners in the mini-lessons. Using an intensive [[experiential learning]]&lt;ref&gt; Kolb, D. (1984). Experiential Learning: experience as the source of learning and development. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; approach, the workshop encourages reflection and examination of one's teaching practices with feedback focused on the learning process rather than on the content of the lesson.&lt;ref&gt;Day, R. (2005) The Instructional Skills Workshop: The Heart of an Educator Learning Community in British Columbia and Beyond.  INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP OF TEACHING &amp; LEARNING. Retrieved April 8, 2013 from http://iswnetwork.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Hand_ISW_ISSoTL1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who wish to facilitate ISW after taking it must take the 40-hour [[Facilitator Development Workshop]] (FDW), and those who wish to train facilitators take the Trainer Development Workshop (TDW) by shadowing the FDW with a trainer from the network. 

The ISW promotes participatory learning and the building of community. Detailed information about the ISW and related workshops can be found at [http://www.iswnetwork.ca the ISW Network website]

The Instructional Skills Workshop was initially designed for instructors at community colleges and institutes in [[British Columbia]] in 1978 by Douglas Kerr, from the [[Vancouver Community College]] at the request of Diane Morrison from the Ministry of Advanced Education.&lt;ref name="iswhandbook"&gt;ISW Handbook for Participants. 2006. Pat Pattison &amp; Russell Day, eds. {{ISBN|0-9781360-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[University of British Columbia]] introduced the ISW as a program designed for teaching assistants.&lt;ref name="iswhandbook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first handbook was written by Douglas Kerr in 1978. As the ISW grew across Canada and internationally, there have been numerous collaborators contributing to the handbook.&lt;ref name="iswhandbook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interior design''' is the [[art]] and [[science]] of enhancing the interior of a [[building]] to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. An '''interior designer''' is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution of the design.

==History and current terms==
[[Image:Vlkolínec, Slovakia 020.jpg|thumb|right|Typical interior of one of the houses in the Folk Architecture Reservation in [[Vlkolínec]] ([[Slovakia]])]]
In the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Pile, J., 2003, Interior Design, 3rd edn, Pearson, New Jersey, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex [[architecture]] that has resulted from the development of industrial processes. The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of ''interior decorator'', a term commonly used in the US. The term is less common in the UK where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.

In ancient India, architects used to work as interior designers. This can be seen from the references of Vishwakarma the architect - one of the gods in Indian mythology. Additionally, the sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen in palaces built in 17th-century India.

In ancient Egypt, "soul houses" or models of houses were placed in tombs as receptacles for food offerings.  From these, it is possible to discern details about the interior design of different residences throughout the different Egyptian dynasties, such as changes in ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, R.G. ''History of Interior Design Furniture: From Ancient Egypt to Nineteenth-Century Europe''. J. Wiley, 2006, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century, interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker, or an employed [[upholsterer]] or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space. Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings.

===Commercial interior design and management===
In the mid-to-late 19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the [[middle class]] in [[industrial revolution|industrial]] countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status. Large [[furniture]] firms began to branch out into general interior design and management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur, designers. This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Clive|date=4 February 2013|title=Complete House Furnishers: The Retailer as Interior Designer in Nineteenth-Century London|journal=Journal of Interior Design|volume=38|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/joid.12000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shoolbred catalogue.jpg|thumb|Illustrated catalog of the [[James Shoolbred|James Shoolbred Company]], published in 1876.]]
In the 1950s and 1960s, upholsterers began to expand their business remits. They framed their business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public. To meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as [[office]]s, [[hotel]]s, and [[public building]]s, these businesses became much larger and more complex, employing builders, joiners, plasterers, textile designers, artists, and furniture designers, as well as engineers and technicians to fulfil the job. Firms began to publish and circulate [[Trade literature|catalogs]] with prints for different lavish styles to attract the attention of expanding middle classes.&lt;ref name="wiley" /&gt;

As department stores increased in number and size, retail spaces within shops were furnished in different styles as examples for customers. One particularly effective advertising tool was to set up model rooms at national and international [[exhibition]]s in showrooms for the public to see. Some of the pioneering firms in this regard were [[Waring &amp; Gillow]], [[James Shoolbred]], [[Mintons]], and Holland &amp; Sons. These traditional high-quality furniture making firms began to play an important role as advisers to unsure middle class customers on taste and style, and began taking out contracts to design and furnish the interiors of many important buildings in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=156993&amp;CategoryID=36646|title=Amanda Girling-Budd’s Statement|accessdate=2012-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829143857/http://rca.ac.uk/Default.aspx?ContentID=156993&amp;CategoryID=36646|archive-date=2012-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of firm emerged in America after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[Herter Brothers]], founded by two German emigre brothers, began as an upholstery warehouse and became one of the first firms of furniture makers and [[interior decorator]]s.

[[Image:Wallpaper group-p6m-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Illustration from ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), by interior designer [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]].]]
A pivotal figure in popularizing theories of interior design to the middle class was the architect [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Clouse, Doug. "The Handy Book of Artistic Printing: Collection of Letterpress Examples with Specimens of Type, Ornament, Corner Fills, Borders, Twisters, Wrinklers, and other Freaks of Fancy". Princeton Architectural Press, 2009. p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' first project was his most important—in 1851 he was responsible for not only the decoration of [[Joseph Paxton]]’s gigantic [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] for the [[Great Exhibition]], but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within. He chose a controversial [[color theory|palette]] of red, yellow, and blue for the interior ironwork and, despite initial negative publicity in the newspapers, was eventually unveiled by [[Queen Victoria]] to much critical acclaim. His most significant publication was ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856),&lt;ref&gt;Clouse, Doug. "The Handy Book of Artistic Printing: Collection of Letterpress Examples with Specimens of Type, Ornament, Corner Fills, Borders, Twisters, Wrinklers, and other Freaks of Fancy". Princeton Architectural Press, 2009. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; in which Jones formulated 37 key principles of interior design and decoration.

Jones was employed by some of the leading interior design firms of the day; in the 1860s he worked in collaboration with the London firm Jackson &amp; Graham to produce furniture and other fittings for high-profile clients including art collector [[Alfred Morrison]] and the [[Khedive]] of Egypt, [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]].

In 1882, the [[Kelly's Directory|London Directory]] of the [[Post Office]] listed 80 interior decorators. Some of the most distinguished companies of the period were [[John Dibblee Crace|Crace]], Waring &amp; Gillow and Holland &amp; Sons; famous decorators employed by these firms included [[Thomas Edward Collcutt]], [[Edward William Godwin]], [[Charles Barry]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[George Edmund Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcLc-1rLq5oC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Turning Houses Into Homes: A History of the Retailing and Consumption of Domestic Furnishings|author=Clive Edwards|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to professional interior design===
[[File:Design for a room by John Dibblee Crace.jpg|thumb|300px|This interior was designed by [[John Dibblee Crace]], President of the Institute of British Decorators, established in 1899.]]
By the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design. English [[feminism|feminist]] author [[Mary Haweis]] wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIARJjg8w_gC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Art|author=Gillian Perry|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated the individual adoption of a particular style, tailor made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer:
:"One of my strongest convictions, and one of the first canons of good taste, is that our houses, like the fish’s shell and the bird’s nest, ought to represent our individual taste and habits.''

The move towards decoration as a separate artistic profession unrelated to the manufacturers and retailers, received an impetus with the 1899 formation of the Institute of British Decorators; with [[John Dibblee Crace]] as its president it represented almost 200 decorators around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facultyofdecoration.org/history.htm|title=History|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915, the London Directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators, of which 10 were women. Rhoda and Agnes Garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874. The importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of [[William Morris]]. In 1876, their work - ''Suggestions for House Decoration in Painting, Woodwork and Furniture'' - spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=53628&amp;back=|title=Garrett sisters|publisher=DNB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the situation was described by ''The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder'':
:"Until recently when a man wanted to furnish he would visit all the dealers and select piece by piece of furniture ....Today he sends for a dealer in art furnishings and fittings who surveys all the rooms in the house and he brings his artistic mind to bear on the subject."&lt;ref&gt;The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder, December 7 (1900): Suppl. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, [[Candace Wheeler]] was one of the first woman [[interior designers]] and helped encourage a new style of American design. She was instrumental in the development of art courses for women in a number of major American cities and was considered a national authority on homedesign. An important influence on the new profession was ''[[The Decoration of Houses]]'', a manual of interior design written by [[Edith Wharton]] with architect [[Ogden Codman]] in 1897 in America. In the book, the authors denounced Victorian-style [[interior decoration]] and interior design, especially those rooms that were decorated with heavy window curtains, [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian bric-a-brac]] and overstuffed furniture. They argued that such rooms emphasized upholstery at the expense of proper space planning and architectural design and were, therefore, uncomfortable and rarely used. The book is considered a seminal work and its success led to the emergence of professional decorators working in the manner advocated by its authors, most notably [[Elsie de Wolfe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/wharton/whar3.htm "Edith Wharton's World"] National Portrait Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Elsiedewolfe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elsie de Wolfe]], taken from ''The House in Good Taste'', 1913.]]
[[Elsie De Wolfe]] was one of the first interior designers. Rejecting the Victorian style she grew up with, she chose a more vibrant scheme, along with more comfortable furniture in the home. Her designs were light, with fresh colors and delicate [[Chinoiserie]] furnishings, as opposed to the Victorian preference of heavy, red drapes and upholstery, dark wood and intensely patterned wallpapers. Her designs were also more practical;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Flanner |first=J. |year=2009 |publisher=The New Yorker |title= Archive, Handsprings Across the Sea |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1938/01/15/1938_01_15_025_TNY_CARDS_000170753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she eliminated the clutter that occupied the Victorian home, enabling people to entertain more guests comfortably. In 1905, de Wolfe was commissioned for the interior design of the [[Colony Club]] on [[Madison Avenue]]; its interiors garnered her recognition almost over night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munhall|first=Edward|title=Elsie de Wolf: The American pioneer who vanquished Victorian gloom|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/architecture/archive/dewolfe_article_012000|publisher=Architectural Digest|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher (2003), "Streetscapes/Former Colony Club at 120 Madison Avenue; Stanford White Design, Elsie de Wolfe Interior," ''The New York Times'', 28 September 2003 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5D6143DF93BA1575AC0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print]&lt;/ref&gt; She compiled her ideas into her widely read 1913 book, ''The House in Good Taste''.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"&gt;Lees-Maffei, G, 2008, Introduction: Professionalization as a focus in Interior Design History, Journal of Design History, Vol. 21, No. 1, Spring.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Syrie Maugham]] became a legendary interior designer credited with designing the first all-white room. Starting her career in the early 1910s, her international reputation soon grew; she later expanded her business to [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Plunket, Robert. "Syrie's Turn: Once, everyone read W. Somerset Maugham. But now his late ex-wife is the one selling books", ''Sarasota Magazine'', 2006, v. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Born during the [[Victorian Era]], a time characterized by dark colors and small spaces, she instead designed rooms filled with light and furnished in multiple shades of white and mirrored screens. In addition to mirrored screens, her trademark pieces included: books covered in white vellum, cutlery with white porcelain handles, console tables with plaster palm-frond, shell, or dolphin bases, upholstered and fringed sleigh beds, fur carpets, dining chairs covered in white leather, and lamps of graduated glass balls, and wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5wYRQAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Pauline+C.+Metcalf%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtoUUqSIN47Ysgb2_YG4DA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ|title=Syrie Maugham: Staging the Glamorous Interiors|author=Pauline C. Metcalf|year=2010|publisher=Acanthus PressLlc|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
The interior design profession became more established after [[World War II]]. From the 1950s onwards, spending on the home increased. Interior design courses were established, requiring the publication of textbooks and reference sources. Historical accounts of interior designers and firms distinct from the decorative arts specialists were made available. Organisations to regulate education, qualifications, standards and practices, etc. were established for the profession.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt;

Interior design was previously seen as playing a secondary role to architecture. It also has many connections to other design disciplines, involving the work of [[architects]], [[industrial designers]], [[engineers]], builders, craftsmen, etc. For these reasons, the government of interior design standards and qualifications was often incorporated into other professional organisations that involved design.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt; Organisations such as the [[Chartered Society of Designers]], established in the UK in 1986, and the American Designers Institute, founded in 1938, governed various areas of design.

It was not until later that specific representation for the interior design profession was developed. The US National Society of Interior Designers was established in 1957, while in the UK the Interior Decorators and Designers Association was established in 1966. Across Europe, other organisations such as The Finnish Association of Interior Architects (1949) were being established and in 1994 the International Interior Design Association was founded.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt;

Ellen Mazur Thomson, author of ''Origins of Graphic Design in America'' (1997), determined that professional status is achieved through education, self-imposed standards and professional gate-keeping organizations.&lt;ref name="professionalization1"/&gt; Having achieved this, interior design became an accepted profession.

==Interior decorators and interior designers==
[[File:Michelin two-starred Shang Palace main dining hall.jpg|thumb|280px|Interior design in a restaurant]]
Interior design is the art and science of understanding people's behavior to create functional spaces within a building. Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things. In short, interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design.

===Interior designer===
Interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning, [[functional design]] and the effective use of space, as compared to interior decorating. An interior designer in fineline design can undertake projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as window and door positioning, [[acoustics]], and [[lighting]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Although an interior designer may create the layout of a space, they may not alter load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a structural engineer. Interior designers often work directly with architects, engineers and contractors.

Interior designers must be highly skilled in order to create interior environments that are functional, safe, and adhere to building codes, regulations and ADA requirements. They go beyond the selection of color palettes and furnishings and apply their knowledge to the development of construction documents, occupancy loads, healthcare regulations and sustainable design principles, as well as the management and coordination of professional services including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and life safety—all to ensure that people can live, learn or work in an innocuous environment that is also aesthetically pleasing.

Someone may wish to specialize and develop technical knowledge specific to one area or type of interior design, such as residential design, commercial design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition design, furniture design, and spatial branding. 
Interior design is a creative profession that is relatively new, constantly evolving, and often confusing to the public. It is not an artistic pursuit and relies on research from many fields to provide a well-trained understanding of how people are influenced by their environments.

=== Color in interior design ===
Color is a powerful design tool in decoration, as well as in interior design which is the art of composing, and coordinating colors together to create a stylish scheme on the interior architecture of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interiordezine.com/color/|title=Color Wheel, Color Schemes, Color Therapy, Colors by Interiordezine |website=www.interiordezine.com| access-date = 2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential to interior designers to acquire a deep experience with colors, understand their psychological effects, and understand the meaning of each color in different locations and situations in order to create suitable combinations for each place.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designlike.com/the-psychology-of-color-for-interior-design/|title=The Psychology of Color for Interior Design – Interior Design, Design News and Architecture Trends|website=designlike.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining colors together could result in creating a state of mind as seen by the observer, and could eventually result in positive or negative effects on them. Colors make the room feel either more calm, cheerful, comfortable, stressful, or dramatic. Color combination make a tiny room seem larger or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hgtv.com/remodel/interior-remodel/the-psychology-of-color|title=The Psychology of Color|newspaper=HGTV| access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is the Interior designer profession to choose appropriate colors for a place in a way people want to look and feel in the space.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Specialties==
[[Image:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|280px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] decoration [[fair]].]]

===Residential===
Residential design is the design of the interior of private residences. As this type design is very specific for individual situations, the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area of interior design. The interior designer may work on the project from the initial planning stage or may work on the remodelling of an existing structure. It is often a very involved process that takes months to fine-tune and create a space with the vision of the client.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Piotrowski, C, 2004, Becoming an Interior Designer, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New Jersey, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
Commercial design encompasses a wide range of subspecialties.
* Retail: includes malls and shopping centers, department stores, specialty stores, visual merchandising, and showrooms.
* Visual and spatial branding: The use of space as a medium to express a corporate brand.
* Corporate: office design for any kind of business such as banks.
* Healthcare: the design of hospitals, assisted living facilities, medical offices, dentist offices, psychiatric facilities, laboratories, medical specialist facilities.
* Hospitality and recreation: includes hotels, motels, resorts, cruise ships, cafes, bars, casinos, nightclubs, theaters, music and concert halls, opera houses, sports venues, restaurants, gyms, health clubs and spas, etc.
* Institutional: government offices, financial institutions (banks and credit unions), schools and universities, religious facilities, etc.
* Industrial facilities: manufacturing and training facilities as well as import and export facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;
* Exhibition: includes museums, gallery, exhibition hall, specially the design for showroom and exhibition gallery.
* Traffic building: includes bus station, subway station, airports, pier, etc.
* Sports: includes gyms, stadiums, swimming rooms, basketball halls, etc.
* Teaching in a private institute that offer classes of interior design
* Self-employment
* Employment in private sector firms

===Other===
Other areas of specialization include amusement and theme park design, museum and exhibition design, [[exhibit design]], event design (including ceremonies, weddings, baby and bridal showers, parties, conventions, and concerts), interior and prop styling, craft styling, food styling, product styling, tablescape design, theatre and performance design, stage and set design, [[scenic design]], and [[production designer|production design]] for film and television. Beyond those, interior designers, particularly those with graduate education, can specialize in healthcare design, gerontological design, educational facility design, and other areas that require specialized knowledge. Some university programs offer graduate studies in theses and other areas. For example, both [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of Florida]] offer interior design graduate programs in environment and behavior studies.

===Education===
{{main|Interior design education}}
There are various paths that one can take to become a professional interior designer. All of these paths involve some form of training. Working with a successful professional designer is an informal method of training and has previously been the most common method of education. In many states, however, this path alone cannot lead to licensing as a professional interior designer. Training through an institution such as a college, art or design school or university is a more formal route to professional practice.

In the UK and the U.S, several university degree courses are now available, including those on interior architecture, taking three or four years to complete.

A formal education program, particularly one accredited by or developed with a professional organization of interior designers, can provide training that meets a minimum standard of excellence and therefore gives a student an education of a high standard. There are also university graduate and Ph.d. programs available for those seeking further training in a specific design specialization (i.e. gerontological or healthcare design) or those wishing to teach interior design at the university level.

===Working conditions===
There are a wide range of working conditions and employment opportunities within interior design. Large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as employees on regular working hours. Designers for smaller firms and [[online renovation platforms]] usually work on a contract or per-job basis. Self-employed designers, which make up 26% of interior designers,&lt;ref&gt;"Employment." Occupational Outlook Handbook: 2008-09 Edition, [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos293.htm#empty US Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt; usually work the most hours. Interior designers often work under stress to meet deadlines, stay on budget, and meet clients' needs.

In some cases, licensed professionals review the work and sign it before submitting the design for approval by clients or construction permisioning. The need for licensed review and signature varies by locality, relevant legislation, and scope of work. Their work can involve significant travel to visit different locations. However, with technology development, the process of contacting clients and communicating design alternatives has become easier and requires less travel.&lt;ref name="IBIS World"&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial Design Industry Report |url=http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=1410&amp;chid=1 |publisher=ibisworld.com |date= July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also renovate a space to satisfy the specific taste for a client.

==Styles==

===Art Deco===
[[File:Eastern Columbia Building entrance.jpg|thumb | upright | right | [[Terracotta]] [[Art Deco]] [[Sunburst|sunburst design]] above front doors of the [[Eastern Columbia Building]] in Los Angeles; built 1930.]]
The [[Art Deco]] style began in Europe in the early years of the 20th century, with the waning of [[Art Nouveau]]. The term "Art Deco" was taken from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, a world’s fair held in Paris in 1925.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Tinniswood, Adrian. The Art Deco House: Avant-Garde House of the 1920s and 1930s. Watsonguptill publishing company. New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco rejected many traditional classical influences in favour of more streamlined geometric forms and metallic color. The Art Deco style influenced all areas of design, especially interior design, because it was the first style of interior decoration to spotlight new technologies and materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"&gt;Striner, Richard. "Art Deco: Polemics and Synthesis". WInterthur portfolio, Vol 25. No. 1 spring, 1990. PP. 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco style is mainly based on geometric shapes, streamlining, and clean lines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;Beusterien, John. Rodriguez, EduardoLuis. Narciso G. The Architectural Avant-Garde: From Art Deco to Modern Regionalism. The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, Vol. 22, Cuba Theme Issue (1996), PP. 254-277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Stanley, Meisler. ’Art Deco: High Style. Smithsonian’, Nov 2004, Vol. 35 Issue 8, PP 57-60&lt;/ref&gt; The style offered a sharp, cool look of mechanized living utterly at odds with anything that came before.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Bayer, Patricia, Art Deco Interiors: Decoration and Design Classics of the 1920s and 1930s, Thames &amp; Hudson, London 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco rejected traditional materials of decoration and interior design, opting instead to use more unusual materials such as [[chrome plating|chrome]], [[glass]], [[stainless steel]], shiny fabrics, [[mirror]]s, [[aluminium]], [[lacquer]], [[inlay|inlaid wood]], [[sharkskin]], and zebra skin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt; The use of harder, metallic materials was chosen to celebrate the machine age. These materials reflected the dawning modern age that was ushered in after the end of the [[First World War]]. The innovative combinations of these materials created contrasts that were very popular at the time - for example the mixing together of highly polished wood and black lacquer with satin and furs.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Jian. "Art Deco 1910-39". Craft Arts International, 2003, Issue 59, PP. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt; The barber shop in the Austin Reed store in London was designed by P. J. Westwood. It was soon regarded as the trendiest barber shop in Britain due to its use of metallic materials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

The color themes of Art Deco consisted of metallic color, neutral color, bright color, and black and white. In interior design, cool metallic colors including silver, gold, metallic blue, charcoal grey, and platinum tended to predominate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tinniswood, Adrian. ‘The Art Deco House: Avant-Garde House of the 1920s and 1930s’. Watsonguptill publishing company. New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serge Chermayeff]], a Russian-born British designer made extensive use of cool metallic colors and luxurious surfaces in his room schemes. His 1930 showroom design for a British dressmaking firm had a silver-grey background and black mirrored-glass wall panels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Striner, Richard. ‘Art Deco: Polemics and Synthesis’. WInterthur portfolio, Vol 25. No. 1 ( spring, 1990). PP. 26-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black and white was also a very popular color scheme during the 1920s and 1930s. Black and white checkerboard tiles, floors and wallpapers were very trendy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Jian. ‘Art Deco 1910-39’. Craft Arts International, 2003, Issue 59, PP. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt; As the style developed, bright vibrant colors became popular as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, David. ‘Art Deco Renaissance’. Silvester-Carr, Denise. History Today, Jul, Vol. 49. Issue 7. PP.4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco furnishings and lighting fixtures had a glossy, luxurious appearance with the use of inlaid wood and reflective finishes. The furniture pieces often had curved edges, geometric shapes, and clean lines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Art Deco lighting fixtures tended to make use of stacked geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alastair. "Art Deco Lighting". The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts. Vol. 1 (spring. 1986). PP. 20-31&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Art ===
"Modern design grew out of the decorative arts, mostly from the [[Art Deco]], in the early 20th century."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Modern Interior Design|url = http://homeguides.sfgate.com/modern-interior-design-8659.html#|website = Home Guides {{!}} SF Gate|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to introduce this style was [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], who hadn't become hugely popularized until completing the house called [[Fallingwater]] in the 1930s. "Modern art reached its peak in the 1950s and 60s which is why designers and decorators today may refer to modern design as being "mid-century."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Modern Art does not refer to the era or age of design. "Modern art is not the same as contemporary design, which is a term that interior designers apply to a shifting group of recent styles and trends."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arab Materials===
“[[Majlis]] painting”, also called [[nagash painting]], is the decoration of the [[majlis]] or front parlor of traditional Arabic homes in the [[Asir]] province of [[Saudi Arabia]] and adjoining parts of [[Yemen]] These wall paintings, an [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] form of [[mural]] or [[fresco]], show various geometric designs in bright colors: “Called 'nagash' in Arabic, the wall paintings were a mark of pride for a woman in her house.”&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201304/the.majlis.painters.htm Yunis, Alia, "The Majlis Painters,"] Saudi Aramco World Magazine, July/August 2013, pages 24-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns. “In contrast with the sobriety of architecture and decoration in the rest of Arabia, exuberant color and ornamentation characterize those of 'Asir. The painting extends into the house over the walls and doors, up the staircases, and onto the furniture itself. When a house is being painted, women from the community help each other finish the job. The building then displays their shared taste and knowledge. Mothers pass these on to their daughters. This artwork is based on a [[geometry]] of straight lines and suggests the patterns common to textile [[weaving]], with solid bands of different colors. Certain motifs reappear, such as the triangular [[mihrab]] or 'niche' and the [[palmette]]. In the past, paint was produced from mineral and vegetable [[pigment]]s. [[Clove]]s and [[alfalfa]] yielded green. Blue came from the [[indigo]] plant. Red came from [[pomegranate]]s and a certain mud. [[Paintbrush]]es were created from the tough hair found in a goat's tail. Today, however, women use modern manufactured paint to create new looks, which have become an indicator of social and economic change.”&lt;ref&gt;Maha Al Faisal and Khalid Azzam. 1999. "Doors of the Kingdom" Saudi Aramco World. This article appeared on pages 68-77 of the January/February 1999 print edition of Saudi Aramco World# http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199901/doors.of.the.kingdom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the Asir province often complete the decoration and painting of the house interior. “You could tell a family’s wealth by the paintings,” [[Um Abdullah]] says: “If they didn’t have much money, the wife could only paint the [[motholath]],” the basic straight, simple lines, in patterns of three to six repetitions in red, green, yellow and brown.” When women did not want to paint the walls themselves, they could [[barter]] with other women who would do the work. Several Saudi women have become famous as majlis painters, such as [[Fatima Abou Gahas]].&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"/&gt;

The interior walls of the home are brightly painted by the women, who work in defined patterns with lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns. “Some of the large triangles represent mountains. Zigzag lines stand for water and also for lightning. Small triangles, especially when the widest area is at the top, are found in pre-Islamic representations of female figures. That the small triangles found in the wall paintings in ‘Asir are called banat may be a cultural remnant of a long-forgotten past.”&lt;ref name="Yunis, Alia, The Majlis Painters,"/&gt;

"[[Courtyard]]s and upper pillared [[porticoes]] are principal features of the best Nadjdi architecture, in addition to the fine incised plaster wood ([[jiss]]) and painted window shutters, which decorate the reception rooms. Good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light, delicate and airy. It is usually around the [[majlis]], around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs, against cushions. Doughty wondered if this "[[parquet]]ting of jis", this "[[gypsum]] fretwork... all adorning and unenclosed" originated from [[India]]. However, the Najd fretwork seems very different from that seen in the Eastern Province and [[Oman]], which are linked to Indian traditions, and rather resembles the [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s and patterns found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. The rosette, the star, the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns, and can be found all over the [[Middle East]] of antiquity. [[Al-Qassim Province]] seems to be the home of this art, and there it is normally worked in hard white [[plaster]] (though what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth). In [[Riyadh]], examples can be seen in unadorned [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;Mostyn, Trevor. 1983. Saudi Arabia. London: Middle East Economic Digest. Pages 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media popularization==
{{main|Interior design magazine}}
Interior design has become the subject of [[television]] shows. In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), popular interior design and decorating programs include ''[[60 Minute Makeover]]'' ([[ITV Network|ITV]]), ''[[Changing Rooms]]'' ([[BBC]]), and ''Selling Houses'' ([[Channel 4]]). Famous interior designers whose work is featured in these programs include [[Linda Barker]] and [[Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen]]. In the [[United States]], the [[TLC Network]] aired a popular program called ''[[Trading Spaces]]'', a show based on the UK program ''Changing Rooms''. In addition, both [[HGTV]] and the [[DIY Network]] also televise many programs about interior design and decorating, featuring the works of a variety of interior designers, decorators, and home improvement experts in a myriad of projects.

Fictional interior decorators include the Sugarbaker sisters on ''[[Designing Women]]'' and [[Grace Adler]] on ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. There is also another show called ''Home MADE''. There are two teams and two houses and whoever has the designed and made the worst room, according to the judges, is eliminated. Another show on the [[Style Network]], hosted by [[Niecy Nash]], is ''[[Clean House]]'' where they re-do messy homes into themed rooms that the clients would like. Other shows include ''[[Design on a Dime]]'', ''[[Designed to Sell]]'', and ''[[The Decorating Adventures of Ambrose Price]]''. The show called ''[[HGTV Design Star|Design Star]]'' has become more popular through the 5 seasons that have already aired. The winners of this show end up getting their own TV shows, of which are ''[[Color Splash]]'' hosted by [[David Bromstad]], ''Myles of Style'' hosted by [[Kim Myles]], ''Paint-Over!'' hosted by [[Jennifer Bertrand]], ''[[The Antonio Treatment]]'' hosted by Antonio Ballatore, and finally ''Secrets from a Stylist'' hosted by [[Emily Henderson]]. [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] also has a variety of shows that explore the lives of interior designers. These include ''[[Flipping Out]]'', which explores the life of [[Jeff Lewis (real estate speculator)|Jeff Lewis]] and his team of designers; ''[[Million Dollar Decorators]]'' explores the lives of interior designers [[Nathan Turner]], Jeffrey Alan Marks, Mary McDonald, Kathryn Ireland, and [[Martyn Lawrence Bullard]].

Interior design has also become the subject of [[radio]] shows. In the U.S., popular interior design &amp; lifestyle shows include ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' and ''Living Large'' featuring Karen Mills. Famous interior designers whose work is featured on these programs include Bunny Williams, [[Barbara Barry]], and [[Kathy Ireland]], among others.

Many interior design magazines exist to offer advice regarding color palette, furniture, art, and other elements that fall under the umbrella of interior design. These magazine often focus on related subjects to draw a more specific audience. For instance, architecture as a primary aspect of ''[[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]]'', while ''[[Veranda (magazine)|Veranda]]'' is well known as a luxury living magazine. ''[[Lonny (magazine)|Lonny Magazine]]'' and the newly relaunched, ''[[Domino (magazine)|Domino Magazine]]'', cater to a young, hip, metropolitan audience, and emphasize accessibility and a do-it-yourself ([[DIY]]) approach to interior design.

==Research==
His pioneering work with [[Howard Penman]] on [[evapotranspiration]] is applied worldwide as the [[Penman-Monteith]] equation. It predicts [[evapotranspiration]] and is recommended by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] for calculating irrigation quantities.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Monteith's research on the role of the environment in agriculture, the physics of crop microclimate, physiology of crop growth and yield, radiation climatology, heat balance in animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heat Loss from Animals and Man|last=|first=|publisher=Butterworths|year=1974|isbn=040870652X|editor-last=Monteith|editor-first=John L.|location=London|pages=|editor-last2=Mount|editor-first2=Laurence E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instrumentation for measuring physical and physiological variables in agriculture has been published in journals throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rmets.org/about-us/history-society/distinguished-voices-audio|title=Distinguished Voices Audio: John Lennox Monteith DSc FRS FRMetS (interview: 2 hours 40 mins in 4 parts)|last=|first=|date=1994|website=Royal Meteorological Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He was President of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] from 1978 to 1980. In his presidential address in 1980 he advised colleagues that unless they could understand how crop yields were determined by weather events, they would have little hope of predicting how crop yields would vary as a result of [[global warming]] and elevated {{co2}} levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = T.

His nomination for the [[Royal Society]] reads: {{centred pull quote|Dr. Monteith has made outstanding contributions to knowledge and understanding of the micro-climatology of field crops. In the physics, he has achieved complete energy, water, and carbon dioxide balances; in the biology, he has linked transpiration, assimilation and respiration rates with stomatal responses to light intensity, leaf orientation, ventilation and soil water stress. His early work on the physics of dew is unlikely to be superseded: his radiation studies embrace a survey for the British Isles down to the attenuation and spectral changes as sunlight filters through a crop canopy. He has been highly successful in devising or improving apparatus, and he has added much to the concept of "potential photosynthesis" as a measure of how a plant ought to grow in a given environment. In the application of physical principles to plant ecology he has few peers, and is an acknowledged leader in this aspect of crop meteorology.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1971%2F17%27) |title=EC/1971/17: Monteith, John Lennox |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=25 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QbSbeikG?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1971%2F17%27%29 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Korea Aerospace Research Institute''' ('''KARI''') established in 1989, is the [[aeronautics]] and [[space agency]] of [[Republic of Korea]].  Its main laboratories are located in [[Daejeon]], in the [[Daedeok Science Town]]. KARI's vision is to continue building upon indigenous launch capabilities, strengthen national safety and public service, industrialize satellite information and applications technology, explore the moon, and develop environmentally-friendly and highly-efficient cutting-edge aircraft and core aerospace technology.  Current projects include the KSLV-2 launcher. Past projects include the 1999 [[Arirang-1]] [[satellite]].  The agency was founded in 1989.  Prior to South Korea's entry into the [[Institute for Advanced Engineering|IAE]] in 1992, it focused primarily on [[aerospace technology]].

== Background ==

KARI began on October 10, 1989 as a national aerospace research institute with the purpose of contributing to sound development of the national economy and enhancement of people's  lives through a new exploration, technological advancement, development, and dissemination in the field of aerospace science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Greeting address. (2016). Korea Aerospace Research Institute. retrieved from https://www.kari.re.kr/eng/sub01_01.do&lt;/ref&gt;

KARI began in 1989 to develop its own rockets. It produced the KSR-I and KSR-II, one and two-stage rockets in the early 1990s.

In December 1997 it began development of a [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[kerosene]] rocket engine. KARI wished to develop satellite launch capability. A test launch of the KSR-III took place in 2002.

==KSLV-1 and KSLV-2==
{{Main|KSLV-II}}
KSLV-1 launched on August 25, 2009. It was originally a cluster indigenous liquid KSR-III rockets with a solid propellant to form a multistage launcher. However, KARI experienced more difficulties than expected in SLV development, because it required much stronger propellant power than KSR-III possessed to launch a satellite into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;An, H. (2013). Seeking independence in space: South korea's space program (1958–2010). Quest: History Of Spaceflight, 20(2), 34–51.&lt;/ref&gt; After several failed attempts, KARI turned to Russia's Khrunichev Design Bureau for assistance in developing a liquid-propellant rocket engine for the KSLV-1 as well as for cooperation in the construction of the launch facility at the Naro Space Center. KSLV-1 was transformed into a two-stage launcher, 33 m high with a maximum diameter of 2.9 m. It has a mass of 140 tons at lift-off. The first stage of the launcher was derived from the Russian URM-1 (Universal Rocket Module) developed by Khrunichev. The second stage of the launcher was a solid Kick Motor developed by Korea, which includes the Inertial Navigation System; the power, control, and flight safety systems; plus the nose fairing. KSLV-1 was the most prominent project of the whole South Korean space development program and was successfully launched in late January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;An, H. (2013). Seeking independence in space: South korea's space program (1958–2010). Quest: History Of Spaceflight, 20(2), 34–51.&lt;/ref&gt; 
South Korea is planning to launch its next rocket [[KSLV-2]] by year 2019. The first stage of its rocket will have 4 clustered engines, each of which will have a 75 metric ton thrust. It was announced that KARI has already developed few prototypes of a 75 metric ton thrust engine.

===KSLV-2 TLV===

The Test Launch Vehicle (TLV) is a two stages rocket used to test the performance of the 75-tons and 7-tons thrust rocket engines that will power the KSLV-2. 
The TLV is 25.8 meters in length, 2.6 meters in diameter, and with a mass of 52.1 tons. The main-stage [[Kerolox]] engine is fully gimballed. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kari2030/status/1039052196443172865&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kari.re.kr/kor/kariimg/view.do?idx=1082&amp;mno=sub05_01&lt;/ref&gt;

The first TLV was launched from the Naro Space Center in Goheung, South Jeolla Province. 
The main objective of the first suborbital flight was for the  single-stage rocket's main engine to burn 140 seconds, reaching a 100 km altitude before splashing down in the sea between Jeju Island and Okinawa Island.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20181128003900320?section=science/science&lt;/ref&gt;

The maiden flight was first delayed from October 25, 2018, for two months, due to abnormal readings detected in the rocket propellant pressurization system.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2018/10/17/0504000000AEN20181017011100320.html
&lt;/ref&gt;
The test flight was then rescheduled for November 28, 2018, at 16:00 KST(UTC+9). No payload is to be placed into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kari2030/status/1062254241513795584&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the first TLV while deemed successful with its main engine burning for 151 seconds in a 10 minute flight&lt;ref&gt;https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20181128003952320?section=news&lt;/ref&gt;, was not broadcast live.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/kari2030/status/1067684625529503745&lt;/ref&gt;
After reaching a maximum suborbital altitude of 209 kilometers, the rocket stage hit the ocean 429 kilometers southeast of Jeju.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20181128008452320?section=science/science&lt;/ref&gt;

==KSLV-3 and KSLV-4==

KSLV3 is to launch geostationary satellites of 6 tons, and to enter service in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;http://penpal.kjclub.com/kr/exchange/theme/read.php?tname=exc_board_65&amp;uid=341142&amp;fid=341142&amp;thread=1000000&amp;idx=1&amp;page=1&amp;number=218281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjclub.com/UploadFile/exc_board_66/2013/12/24/kslv-3.png&lt;/ref&gt;

KSLV4 will carry the 64-tons class space station's modules. KSLV-4 scheduled to enter service in 2028 (updated plan).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjclub.com/UploadFile/exc_board_66/2013/12/24/kslv-4.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjclub.com/UploadFile/exc_board_65/2013/02/02/asdf.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjclub.com/UploadFile/exc_board_53/2013/11/27/PYH2013112608480001300_P2_59_20131126175004.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solid-fuel launcher==

On November 12, 2018, the South Korean government was discussing with its American counterparts, on its plan to develop solid-fuel space vehicles, and comparable to the Japanese Epsilon rocket in performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2018/11/12/0301000000AEN20181112008151315.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea Multiple- Purpose Satellite-3A==
Korea Multiple-Purpose Satellite- 3A (KOMPSAT-3A) was launched on 25 March 2015, on a Dnepr-1 launch vehicle from the Jasny Kombarovsky site in Russia. The purpose of the KOMPSAT-3A is to enable us to take advantage of geographical information systems (GIS) in environmental, agricultural, and oceanographic sciences, and to facilitate natural hazards. The KOMPSAT-3A is equipped with two distinctive sensors, a high-resolution multi-spectral (MS) optical sensor, namely the Advanced Earth Image Sensor System-A (AEISS-A), and the Scanner Infrared Imaging System (SIIS).&lt;ref&gt;Yeom, J., Hwang, J., Jung, J., Lee, K., &amp; Lee, C.

==Smart Tilt Rotor UAV==
In late 2011, KARI unveiled its tiltrotor [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] (UAV) that can fly at around 400&amp;nbsp;km/hr.

==Korean Lunar Exploration Program==
As part of the national space promotion plan, the Korean lunar exploration program (KLEP) is to develop the first lunar probe in Korea and secure the necessary base technology for lunar exploration, such as orbit, lander, science payload, and deep space telecommunication.&lt;ref&gt;Korean lunar exploration project. (2016). Korea Aerospace Research Institute. retrieved from https://www.kari.re.kr/eng/sub03_04_01.do&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is the development of experimental orbit lines which will be carried out to secure core technology for space exploration establishment of deeps space networked, and international joint development of payloads. The second stage, the unmanned lunar orbiter and lander are developed and launched as Korean launch vehicle. The lunar probe will be equipped with mission equipment for analyzing the environment of the moon and exploring resources such as scientific payloads, space internet, nuclear energy, and rover. Korea has secured about 70% of the core technologies needed for lunar exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Korean lunar exploration project. (2016). Korea Aerospace Research Institute. retrieved from https://www.kari.re.kr/eng/sub03_04_01.do&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, KARI signed a lunar exploration technical cooperation with NASA which increased the possibility of exploration success greatly.  A Korean Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) is to be followed by a Korean Lunar Explorer (KLE) which constitutes and orbiter and a lander unit equipped with a small rover with a mass of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;kg. The Key goals of the Korean lunar mission are the investigations of lunar geology and space environment, exploration of lunar resources, and testing of future space and planetary exploration technology which will assist in future human activities on the moon and beyond. The exploration is expected to begin in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, K., Wohler, C., Hyeok Ju, G., Lee, S., Rodriguez, A., Berezhnoy, A., Gasselt, S., Grumpe, A., &amp; Aymaz, R. (2016).

'''''Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre ''''' is a 2007 documentary film directed by [[Alidou Badini]] and [[Philippe Baqué]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipa.tm.fr/en/programs/2008/le-beurre-et-l-argent-du-beurre-16779.htm|title=Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre|publisher=FIPA|accessdate=9 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816231020/http://www.fipa.tm.fr/en/programs/2008/le-beurre-et-l-argent-du-beurre-16779.htm|archivedate=16 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title, which translates to "Butter and the money from butter", derives from a [[French language|French]] idiom equivalent to the English phrase "[[Have one's cake and eat it too]]".

== Synopsis ==
Fair trading is very much in fashion today. The concept is to help the most underprivileged populations on our planet to emerge from this state thanks to a fairer distribution of revenues. The [[Shea nut and butter production in Burkina Faso|Shea butter]] is produced by the poorest women of [[Burkina Faso]], and is more and more appreciated in Europe. It is used in the cosmetic industry and as a cocoa substitute.  Various fair trading experiences claim to help them but, who really profits from the money of the butter?&lt;ref name=voir&gt;{{cite web|title=BEURRE ET L’ARGENT DU BEURRE (LE)|url=http://voiretagir.org/BEURRE-ET-L-ARGENT-DU-BEURRE-LE.html|work=Voir et agir|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Utopia&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre|url=http://www.atelierideal.lautre.net/IMG/pdf/chronique-utopia-LeBeurre.pdf|publisher=Cinema Utopia|accessdate=11 March 2012|location=Bordeaux, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IntNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Commerce "équitable": le beurre et l'argent du beurre (docu)|url=http://internationalnews.over-blog.com/article-31826072.html|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=International News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serpentine lines from William Hogarth's The Analysis of Beauty.jpg|thumbnail|right|Serpentine lines from Hogarth's ''The Analysis of Beauty'']]

'''Line of beauty''' is a term and a theory in [[art]] or [[aesthetics]] used to describe an S-shaped curved line (a [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] line) appearing within an object, as the boundary line of an object, or as a virtual boundary line formed by the composition of several objects. This theory originated with [[William Hogarth]] (18th-century English painter, satirist, and writer), and is an essential part of Hogarth's theory of aesthetics as described in his ''[[Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753). According to this theory, S-shaped curved lines signify liveliness and activity and excite the attention of the viewer as contrasted with straight lines, parallel lines, or right-angled intersecting lines, which signify stasis, death, or inanimate objects.

In contrast to grand compositional lines, which are regularly found in [[Baroque]] or [[Rococo]] art, the serpentine line is not primarily dictating the whole composition of a canvas. Instead, the line should be understood as being found in parts; a composition is created by employing various kinds of lines in various relations to each other without destroying its simplicity.

The School was established in 1966, following the model of Kolmogorov School at Moscow University which had been launched in Moscow a year earlier, in 1965, under Lomonosov Moscow State University, by one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Andrei Nikolayevich Kolmogorov]], and which was later named after him – Kolmogorov School.

In 1977, as part of a statewide education reform in former [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the School was merged into the streamlined secondary education (in Serbian: ''srednje usmereno obrazovanje''), thus cancelling many, but not all, specifics and advantages over other schools. At that time principal, [[Milan Raspopović]] was desperately pulling strings in scientific and policy-making community to re-establish special status, special rights, special funding, and special curriculum{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}{{According to whom|date=March 2012}}. As a result, eleven years later, in 1988, the School was officially re-established as a specialized school, this time in the form of experimental education institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.edu.rs/onama/istorijat History of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; New curriculum was officially published in 1989, in Official Gazette of Socialist Republic of Serbia, no.2, 15 April 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.edu.rs/attachments/121_godizvestaj2010.pdf Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade, Annual Report]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, page 2 of 76. PDF document.{{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "experimental status" finally concluded in 1995, when the School was recognized as a "Specialized school for talented/gifted students in mathematics, informatics, physics and other natural sciences" by the Serbian Ministry of Education. At the same time, the School was given the status of a "school of special national importance", as the first school of its kind in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Matematička gimnazija - MG - School of Special National Interest.jpg|Mathematical Gymnasium is a school of Special National Interest]] (JPEG), Official Records from Serbian Ministry of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although MGB is formally classified as a special secondary school ("srednja škola", grades nine to twelve in the [[Education in Serbia|Serbian education system]], for funding and other legal reasons), it enrolls experimental classes of the seventh and eighth grade primary school (age 12 and above). It is the only school in Serbia and in all states formed from former Yugoslavia that has merged elementary school (or part of it) and high school.

Students of Mathematical Grammar School have the highest [[grade point average]] (GPA) compared to students from other schools and the same rule applies to their university studies, whether is Serbia or abroad.

See also: ''[[Academic grading in Serbia]]'' and ''[[Education in Serbia]]''.

== List of school principals ==
The School had 6 principals in its 45 years long history, all of whom are authors of university, high school, and elementary school textbooks and accompanying collections of solved problems and questions. Five principals were mathematicians, and one – and the longest serving principal – was a physicist.

Five MGB principals with [[Doctor of Sciences]] titles, and one with [[Doctor of Science]] title, earned their degrees at [[University of Belgrade]], and served as university professors and as professors at Mathematical Grammar School.

Mathematical Grammar School has a significant number of alumni work in a wide area of applied mathematics and applied physics, especially to economics and finance.

== IT and ICT ==

=== IT infrastructure and facilities ===

Mathematical Grammar School is connected to [http://www.amres.ac.rs/ Academic Network of Serbia (AMRES)] via 1 Gbit/s optical cables. Internet connection is being realised through [http://www.rcub.bg.ac.rs/ Computing Center of University of Belgrade (RCUB)], using two independent links: Primary RCUB link has 1 Gbit/s capacity over Hungarian academic Network – HUNGARNET, through which the Internet access and the connection with the European Academic Network – GÉANT are being realised; secondary RCUB Internet link is being realized over [http://www.telekom.rs/ Telekom Srbija], with the capacity of 34 Mbit/s. In comparison to the primary link, this one is of a lower capacity, therefore it is being used for traffic exchange with local Internet providers and as a backup link in the event of a primary link failure.

Apart from these connections, RCUB realises traffic exchange with certain local Internet providers (Internet peering), in order to enable AMRES users to have a more efficient communication with local Internet providers' users. In this way, following connections have been realised:
* [http://www.sbb.rs Serbian Broad Band Communications (SBB)] – traffic exchange over 1 Gbit/s link, used with 30 Mbit/s,
* [http://www.ptt.rs Serbian Post, Telegraph, and Telephone State Company (PTT)] – traffic exchange over 1 Mbit/s link,
* Internet Exchange on the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]] [http://www.etf.bg.ac.rs]: it is being used for traffic exchange with Eunet, AVCOM, VeratNet and YUBC Internet providers. The link has 1 Gbit/s capacity, while the effective traffic, approximately, has 20 Mbit/s flow.

Mathematical Grammar School administers main physics and IT laboratories for distance learning in Serbian schooling system and develops plans to distribute its lab-time and resources to other elementary and high schools throughout Serbia and region. This mission is supported by strong optical Internet links and grid networks of Mathematical Grammar School, [http://www.rcub.bg.ac.rs/ Computing Center of University of Belgrade (RCUB)], [http://www.amres.ac.rs/ Academic Network of Serbia (AMRES)], and [http://scl.ipb.ac.rs/ Scientific Computing Lab] of the [http://www.ipb.ac.rs Institute of Physics Belgrade].

Mr. Bogdanović was Mathematical Grammar School alumnus, graduated 1973.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;]]
From about 8,000 graduates in the 40-year history of this school, more than 400 have obtained PhD degrees and 600 have obtained [[Magister (degree)#Territories of Former Yugoslavia|Magister of Science]] degrees. These numbers are to be taken with precautions since this is the number of only those who reported their PhD to MG authorities. It is widely believed that much greater number of MG graduates who hold PhDs from western countries never reported their status to MG authorities. MG statistics say the ratio is 1:5, meaning on every 1 alumni that obtains PhD title at Serbian universities there are 5 MG alumni who got their PhD in Western world, mostly at US universities: [[MIT]], [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], [[Cooper Union]], and [[Ivy League]] universities [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Brown University|Brown]], the [[University of Pennsylvania|UPenn]], Yale, [[Cornell University|Cornell]], and [[Dartmouth College]], Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London, University College London, and several other universities (mostly [[ETH Zurich]], [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]], Lomonosov Moscow State University, and [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Israel).

MG alumni holds university positions around the globe,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.physics.udel.edu/ssd/Main_Page Serbian Scientific Diaspora Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;  but also managerial positions in prestigious world companies, since many of former MG graduates continue careers in business as Executive or Managing Directors of world banks&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/mathematics/quantitative+finance/book/978-3-642-04453-3?detailsPage=authorsAndEditors One example of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade graduate in investment banking sector]&lt;/ref&gt; and hold various business diplomas from notable institutions such as [[Wharton School|Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Kennedy School of Government and Politics at Harvard University (also known as Harvard Kennedy School and HKS)]], [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], [[INSEAD]], [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), Imperial College London, etc. MG Alumni is formally being established recently (in 2009) and started working in 2011, so data should become more accurate in future.

More than 99% of the MG graduates hold graduate university Diploma. Almost all of above mentioned 8,000 MG graduates hold at least M.Sc. in either Mathematics, Physics, or Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.edu.rs/onama Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade – About us] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former students of Mathematical Gymnasium are usually employed in special divisions and prepare pupils for international competitions and for entering exams for prestigious universities around the world, usually in UK and USA. Rastko Marinković, Vladimir Baltić, Miljan Knežević, Mladen Laudanović, Velibor Tintor, Vladimir Božin, Igor Devetak, Zlatko Filipović, Miloš Kojašević, Igor Salom, Predrag Milenović, Đorđe Krtinić, are some of the former students that held lectures, guided pupils' graduate theses, mentored special divisions, or prepared competitions and held competition seminars. Đorđe Krinić prepared and led 2010 Serbian Mathematics Olympiad Team, while Vesna Kadelburg, also a former student of Mathematical Gymnasium, led 2010 UK National Team, from her chair at University of Cambridge, where she obtained her PhD.

Professor Čaluković was herself student of Mathematical Grammar School (graduated 1974), before graduating from the Faculty of Physics, University of Belgrade; as a student of MGB, Nataša's professor and mentor was prof. dr [[Milan Raspopović]], one of the founders of MGB, a physics and philosophy professor, and the longest serving Director and Principal of Mathematical Gymnasium.

Famous alumni also include athletes [[Slobodan Soro]] and [[Rajko Jokanović]], chess player [[Alisa Marić]], former Minister of Telecommunications and Information Society in the [[Government of Serbia]] [[Aleksandra Smiljanić]], former [[Mayor of Belgrade]] [[Nenad Bogdanović]]...

== Acceptance to UK and USA universities ==
Mathematical Grammar School alumni are usually accepted to universities of their choice, because the Curriculum is more advanced and demanding in the fields of mathematics and natural sciences than usual curricula (such as IBO or various national baccalaureates) and MGB students usually have no problem in passing qualification exams and/or interviews.

Some students win more than one full scholarship. Notable examples are 2010 graduates Dušan Milijančević, who got full scholarships from University of Cambridge and from [[MIT|Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24sata.rs/vesti.php?id=72518 Posle Kembridža Dušanu i MIT ponudio stipendiju] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nataša Dragović, who got full scholarships from University of Oxford and from MIT.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

== Diploma relative value ==
MG graduate Diploma alone is treated as "Associate Degree" in named field, be it nuclear engineering, mathematics and IT, laser physics, or any other of 20 or so fields present in MG during its 40 years existence. However, due to old legal regulations in Serbia, graduates of MG are still obliged to start their university studies from year 1, even though many of university subjects are taught throughout MGB 6 years course (e.g. [[probability theory]], [[statistics]], [[mathematical analysis]], [[numerical analysis]], [[combinatorics]], [[number theory]], [[geometry]], [[linear algebra]], [[analytical geometry]], [[algebra]], various advanced physics topics such as [[Atomic Physics|atomic]], [[Solid State Physics|solid state]] and [[nuclear physics]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.edu.rs/skolovanje/nastavni-plan-i-program Curriculum] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; When leaving abroad for studies, MG graduates usually graduate faster than their peers (e.g. Ranko Lazić left MGB after 2nd grade (out of 4) to enroll to University of Oxford. He is now professor at University of Oxford and at [[University of Warwick]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~lazic/cv.pdf |title=Ranko Lazić Curriculum Vitae |format=PDF |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said he appreciates top achievements in education, since he himself won French national competitions for high-school students in history and economics in 1980 and 1981,&lt;ref name=danas2&gt;{{cite web|title=Božidar Đelić: Čuvar prazne kase|url=http://www.danas.rs/20021128/dijalog.htm#7|author=Vojislav Stevanović|date=28 November 2002|publisher=[[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725135737/http://www.danas.rs/20021128/dijalog.htm#7|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated at the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]] and later [[École des Hautes Études Commerciales]] in Paris where he graduated as a top student. In 1987 he received a double master's degree in economics at the [[Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales]]. He eventually moved to the United States, where he completed a [[Master of Business Administration]] at the [[Harvard Business School]], as well as a [[Master of Public Administration]], specializing in macroeconomics and international relations, at Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]].&lt;ref name="bio2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031030112146/http://www.dataprotection2003.info/program.html abc]&lt;/ref&gt; His mentors were [[Alain Gomez]], the chairman of [[Thomson SA]], who taught him how to be a manager, and the economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]], who took him along from Harvard to Warsaw and Moscow.&lt;ref name=lemonde&gt;{{cite web|title=L'étonnante popularité du ministre serbe des finances|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=777175|

== Enrollment ==
&lt;!-- [[File:Matematička gimnazija - MG - Students with Serbian President Boris Tadić.jpg|thumb|left|Mathematical Grammar School students with Serbian President [[Boris Tadić]]]] --&gt;
Mathematical Grammar School has built a reputation as an elite school throughout its 45 years of existence, with significant world stage highlights at the end of 1980s and during the 1990s, which led to increased number of candidates applying every year. Eventually the number of applicants far outnumbered the number of available spaces. Paid classes were introduced in 1997 for students whose parents were willing and able to pay for their education. This practice has continued since, enabling the School to keep its high teaching standards through budget improvements. Basic fees are 10,000 euros per year.

The School currently has four high-school grades (nine to twelve, or high school grades one to four), and two elementary-school grades (seven and eight; elementary school starts from grade zero). Due to recent changes in general law governing all public schools and institutions, all high-school classes are now financed by the state.

To successfully enroll in the high school classes, candidates have to pass a special mathematics entrance exam, different from the statewide high-school mathematics entrance exam. Candidates are ranked according to the total score that combines result achieved at special MGB entrance exam (maximum of 120 points) and performance from previous elementary-school grades (maximum of 60 points). Preference is given to outstanding achievers at competitions and recipients of national prizes during the previous years of their education.

The ranking process for candidates enrolling in the elementary school classes is similar, with mathematics entrance exam (max. 120 points), performance from the previous grades in school (max. 60 points), and awards from state competitions in mathematics, physics, chemistry, or informatics (120 points).

State-controlled education in Serbia is free of charge, so there are no official enrollment fees, except the exam costs.

On Monday, 21 June 2010, Michael O'Sullivan, Director of the [[Cambridge Commonwealth Trust]] paid visit to Mathematical Grammar School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.edu.rs/component/content/article/1-aktuelno/141-poseta-direktora-fonda-cambridge Посета директора фонда Cambridge] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Sullivan was greeted by  Principal Srdjan Ognjanovic, Zoran Kadelburg, a professor of Mathematical Analysis, and MGB students who will continue their education in Cambridge. This event was recorded by the [[Radio Television of Serbia]].

The cause for O'Sullivan's visit was that in 2009 16 students of Mathematical Grammar School were admitted to University of Cambridge. Two were female, and both received full scholarship from Trinity College, Cambridge,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/Blistavi-umovi-Matematichke-gimnazije-odlaze-u-svet.lt.html Bright minds of Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade leave for UK and USA] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2010 15 students enrolled in Cambridge, 7 of whom received full scholarships from Trinity College. Policy of scholarship granting of Trinity College of University of Cambridge allows maximum of 2 full scholarships per world regions (such as North America, or Europe, or Africa, or Indochina, etc.), and Mathematical Grammar School excellent score caused exceptions in Trinity's policy year by year, and caused O'Sullivan to pay a visit to MGB.

== Legal status ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Matematička gimnazija - MG - School of Special National Interest.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|Declaration by the Serbian Government and Serbian Ministry of Education: Mathematical Gymnasium is a school of Special National Interest.]] --&gt;
The School operates as a public school and acts as a member of [[Education in Serbia|Serbian education system]], which is governed by the Ministry of Education.

Formally a part of former Yugoslav and now Serbian state educational system (i.e. financed by the state), Mathematical Grammar School had a status of "experimental school", which allowed it to operate autonomously since its foundation.

It has fundings independent from general high school fundings and is helped both by the state and by the University of Belgrade. University pay scale applies to all employees.

Mathematical Grammar School has the following legal statuses:

* "Experimental school whose aim is to reinforce mathematical education for students which show a special gift for mathematics and natural sciences", according to the decision of the Educational Council of SR Serbia (Decision no. 110-32/89 from 18 January 1989);
* "School for talented students in the areas of mathematics and natural sciences", according to the decision of the Ministry of Education of Serbia;
* "School of special national interest", according to the decision of the Government of the Republic of Serbia. (please see picture on the right)

== Teaching positions ==
[[File:Matematička gimnazija - Mathematical Gymnasium Belgrade - MGB - Anniversary - future Principal Ognjanović, Dean Kadelburg, former Principal Protić, Secretary of School Svetlana Lana Jakšić.jpg|thumb|right|Mathematical Grammar School professors: [[Srđan Ognjanović]] (Principal 2008 – ), [[Zoran Kadelburg]] (former Dean of Faculty of Mathematics), [[Ljubomir Protić]] (Principal 2002–2004, now Director of State Institute for textbooks [http://www.zavod.co.rs "Zavod"]), Svetlana Lana Jakšić (school database administrator).]]
Teaching position in Mathematical Gymnasium comprises a timetable of 18 hours per week for "ordinary professors", and up to 12 hours of teaching for "special professors" (usually called "special teachers") in special divisions (usually university employed staff, or institute researchers, former MG students from special divisions, many still studying at university level).

There is no institution of [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS) in Serbia, other than university diploma in appropriate scientific field. Since MG curriculum is scientifically much more demanding than international curricula (such as [[International Baccalaureate]]), it is school's policy to appoint professors mostly from former MG graduates, themselves holders of various awards from domestic and international competitions.

In general, Mathematical Grammar School appoints scientists from universities and institutes, and alumni of Mathematical Gymnasium with a proven track record in domestic and international competitions, with strong talent and passion for teaching, and with high pedagogical qualities. Thus, teaching staff of Mathematical Grammar School includes several generations of School and university professors and their present-day colleagues and former students, and former students' students, which brings unique spirit to the teaching and scientific community of the School. Many scientific puzzles are brought to students' attention as their professors tend to discuss scientific problems and ideas freely among themselves and students, mixing regular lessons with contemporary scientific ideas, puzzles, and projects they work on.

MGB teachers usually collaborate on international scientific programs and, from time to time, publish specialized textbooks for use in Mathematical Gymnasium.

Most of the textbooks in mathematics and ICT, and all of the textbooks in physics, used in elementary and high schools in Serbia, are written by professor of Mathematical Grammar School.

MGB students regularly win full scholarships from leading universities around the globe, and some of them later return to teach in Mathematical Gymnasium.

== Teaching staff ==
Mathematical Gymnasium usually employs former students of the School as "special teachers", many of whom are still students or graduate students, to work in special divisions (of which are most respected A- and world known D-divisions).

"Lead Teacher", "Head Teacher", and Principal titles and responsibilities are held by professors (teachers) who are former MGB students. Teachers with higher rank are commonly referred as "special teachers", since they teach to special divisions. (Although all divisions of Mathematical Grammar School are special divisions, A- and D- divisions are "more special" than others, thus have internally reserved the term "special" for themselves.)

In the current full-time engaged school staff, 23 teachers hold [[Doctor of Sciences]] degrees, 17 either PhD, [[Magister (degree)#Territories of Former Yugoslavia|Magister of Science]], or [[Magister Artium|MA]] degrees, and all the rest hold graduated or M.Sc. degrees; other PhD and M.Sc. degree holders, University professors and assistants, or Institute assistant researchers, usually teach in special divisions.

The department of Mathematics has 33 full-time professors, of which 15 teachers hold [[Doctor of Sciences]] degrees, 8 hold PhD or Magister of Science, 1 holds [[Magister Artium|MA]], 1 holds [[Master of Science]] degree, and 8 are postgraduate students. 22 of the mentioned 33 full-time professors of Mathematics are former students of Mathematical Gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mg.edu.rs%2Fstrucna-veca%2Fmatematika&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en Department of Mathematics: full-time professors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.edu.rs/strucna-veca/matematika Стручно веће: математика] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental teaching methods and programs prevail in the School. Many classes are taught by [[University of Belgrade]] professors and research assistants from the Faculty of Mathematics, Faculty of Physics, Belgrade Institute of Physics – Zemun [http://www.ipb.ac.rs], [[Vinca Nuclear Institute|Institute for Nuclear Sciences Vinča]], and [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]], and teaching methods vary according to professors' styles.

Mathematical Grammar School students set demands of high standard in front of the professors, and vice versa. One in every 10–15 students enroll in two different faculties and study both (in parallel). The School is very supportive and help both its former students and its employees to balance such activities, if and when they occur. It is not unusual to have professors who graduated two faculties, even three. The most usual choices are combination of electrical engineering, technical faculties (technology), mathematics, physics, and informatics. Some examples include economy, finance, and business studies, and even philosophy and languages.

The School welcomes broad knowledge, and supports activities that lead towards new knowledge and expertise.

'''Night combat''' is [[combat]] that occurs during the hours of darkness.  It is distinguished from daytime combat by lower visibility and its reversed relation to the [[Circadian cycle]].  Typically combat at night is favorable to the attacker, with offensive tactics being focused on exploiting the advantages to maximum effect.&lt;ref name="NCBRC"&gt;[http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ntcombat/index.html NIGHT COMBAT BY RUSSIAN CAVALRY]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toppe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zW63yXqltbEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=night+combat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ncBHnD-qS0&amp;sig=sT1_TdCa8WT9bpP8vLxEeD43k_4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H9n7SvWXKoHiswPBioB5&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Night Combat]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defensive night tactics mainly focus on negating the advantages given by the night to the attacker.&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;[http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/morris/morris.asp#7 Night Combat Operations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of night==
The most obvious effect of darkness is reduced [[visibility]].  This affects a soldier's ability to observe friendly troop movements, understand terrain, and especially affects perception of enemy movements and position.  Officers find that darkness hampers many aspects of command, including their ability to preserve control, execute movement, firing, maintenance of direction, reconnaissance, security, and mutual support. A [[U.S. Army]] report on historic Japanese warfare described an instance of this confusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An example is recorded in the history of Japan when about 1180 a force[sic] of the Heike confronting a force of the Genji across the Fuji river (Shizuoka Prefecture) beat a hasty retreat one night due to mistaking the noise made by water fowl for an attacking Genji force.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, a side effect of the reduced visibility is heightened audibility, as soldiers focus more on what they can hear.  There are many instances of soldiers losing their bearings at night due to flashes from guns or enemy searchlights.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/33825657/Japanese-Night-Combat-Part-1-Principles-of-Night-Combat-USA-1955 Eight United States Army Military History Section: Japanese Research Division]&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties of perception lend themselves to fear of the unknown.  Soldiers under fire can't tell where the fire originates and can't devise appropriate countermeasures.  Such uncertainty is associated with feelings of loneliness and helplessness, and creates a tendency to over estimate enemy strength or be excessively pessimistic of the combat situation.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat" /&gt;

In addition, without the aid of artificial illumination, a soldier's marksmanship skills are negatively affected in total darkness. "Prior to the introduction of aided night vision devices, effective firing at night with a rifle was limited to very close distances, typically within 50 meters. The ability to hit targets was dependant upon a soldiers ability to acquire targets in their sights, which in turn, depended greatly upon the amount of natural and artificial illumination." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a297284.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Night operations have been subject to vast shifts in effectiveness and frequency throughout history, as tactics and technology became more sophisticated.

===Classical antiquity===
Night fighting between [[Standing army|standing armies]] was rare in ancient times.  Night logistics were mostly limited to the carrying of torches, or navigation by what little light was provided by the stars or moon.  However, circumstances occasionally necessitated fighting at night.  Usually due to the massive nature of the battles, they could not be resolved in one day, and combat could not be cleanly disengaged as darkness fell, or prevented as armies camped near each other overnight.{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} [[Sieges]] which lasted for weeks, months or, even years were often fought day and night. Below are a few notable examples.

Ancient historian [[Diodorus]] claims that at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] the Spartans attempted to assassinate Persian King [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] by infiltrating his camp at night.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They immediately seized their arms, and six hundred men rushed into the camp of five hundred thousand, making directly for the king's tent, and resolving either to die with him, or, if they should be overpowered, at least in his quarters. An alarm spread through the whole Persian army. The Spartans being unable to find the king, marched uncontrolled through the whole camp, killing and overthrowing all that stood in their way, like men who knew that they fought, not with the hope of victory, but to avenge their own deaths. The contest was protracted from the beginning of the night through the greater part of the following day. At last, not conquered, but exhausted with conquering, they fell amidst vast heaps of slaughtered enemies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/warsbattles/a/Thermopylae.htm Diodorus on the Battle of Thermopylae]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], over a period of 3 days, an alliance of Germanic tribes wore down and eventually annihilated 3 Roman legions (about 16,000 to 20,000 men).  The Romans attempted several defensive night tactics.  On the first night they managed to erect a fortified camp.  On the second night, they marched at night in an attempt to break through the encircling Germanic forces, but the Germans had already built a wall in their way, and when combat resumed the following day, the Romans were defeated.

The [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]] saw exceptional chaos caused by nightfall.  The night before the battle proper, one of the Roman allied forces stumbled on a band of Hunnic troops and in the resulting skirmish, as many as 30,000 (unverified) men were killed.  Later in the battle,  [[Thorismund]], son of king [[Theodoric I|Theodoric]], accidentally walked into [[Attila the Hun]]'s encampment while attempting to return to his own forces at night.  He was wounded in the ensuing mêlée before his followers could rescue him and withdraw.  That same night, the Roman commander [[Flavius Aëtius]] became separated from his men and, believing that disaster had befallen them, had to stay the night with his Germanic allies.

===Middle Ages===
[[The Night Attack]] of [[Târgovişte]] pitted [[Vlad The Impaler]] of [[Wallachia]] against [[Mehmed II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  Vlad reportedly disguised himself as a Turk and walked freely throughout the Ottoman camp in an effort to find the Mehmed's tent and learn about the organization of his army.  One chronicle of the battle says that Mehmed disallowed his troops to exit their tents so as not to cause a panic in case of an attack.  According to that chronicle, Vlad learned of this and planned his attack at night knowing that the enemy soldiers would have to remain in their tents.  Accounts of the battle and its casualties are mixed, but in the end it was a Wallachian victory, with around 5000 Wallachian casualties compared to around 15,000 for the Ottomans.

===World War I===
The adoption of illumination rounds led to an improvement in the ability to carry out night operations. These projectiles were fired from howitzers and field guns in the direction their light was required. The first illumination rounds (also called [[Shell (projectile)|starshell]]) were modified shrapnel shells which ejected magnesium pellets. These were somewhat ineffective, and were soon replaced by improved designs that had greater candle power, and a parachute to prolong the descent to ground. Tracer ammunition was also introduced during World War I. Tracers made marksmanship at night easier for soldiers, because they could observe the trajectory of their shots and correct their aim accordingly.

===World War II===
{{see also|Night fighter}}
Night continued to have a significant impact on combat during [[World War II]]. Particularly in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], the Japanese military was proficient in night warfare, as acknowledged by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In anticipation of a conflict with the Soviet Union, whose numbers of tanks, planes, and artillery were vastly superior, the Japanese developed a series of training manuals designed to counter these advantages. The "Red Books" (classified materials bound in red paper) emphasized the advantages of attacking at night, in the evening, and at dawn. These tactics later proved useful against the Allies who were similarly better equipped.

The Japanese used this advantage to win engagements where they were severely outnumbered in China and against the Allies at sea. It wasn't until late in the war that early warning technologies of the Allies subverted their surprise attacks at night, reducing their effectiveness. These tactics completely broke down once the Japanese military replaced their well trained troops with hastily trained recruits.&lt;ref name="Japanese Principles of Night Combat" /&gt; The [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CV-6)]] was the first [[aircraft carrier]] in the [[U.S. Navy]] that carried out night strike operations. It received the new designation (CV(N)-6), the "N" standing for "Night", to indicate this capability.

Another type of illumination device was the [[tripflare]]. This consisted of a pyrotechnic instrument activated by a tripwire, which was planted near trails to provide early warning of enemy movement. By 1944, the Wehrmacht was making extensive use of tripflares in Italy, after their perimeters had been repeatedly infiltrated at night by U.S. Army Rangers. Tripflares helped foil an attack launched by the [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] on January 20 at the Rapido Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World War II River Assault Tactics |year=2013 |publisher=Osprey |isbn=9781780961088 |pages=59 |author=Gordon L. Rottman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II===
In the [[First Battle of al-Faw]] in late stages of the [[Iran–Iraq War]], one of the elements contributed to the success of Iranians was their using of dug in infantry which would move only at night and during poor weather, which reduced the Iraqis' advantage in armor. The Iranian forces had been trained in night warfare prior to the battle.

==Tactics==
Perhaps the most important deciding factor in a battle at night is preparation.  This includes [[Military education and training|training]], [[Reconnaissance#Military reconnaissance|reconnaissance]], and [[Military operation plan|planning]].  As with any military operation, leadership is important in both the high-ranking officers and the low-level squad and unit leaders.&lt;ref name="morris"/&gt;

===Offensive tactics===
The decision to engage at night or continue an engagement at night is usually made by the attacking force.  Combat continued at night is aimed at exploiting an advantage gained from an attack during the day or similarly denying the defending force the opportunity to regroup or reinforce.  Combat initiated at night can either be aimed to gain an advantage (such as territory or prisoners) which is then held during the following day or to harass and demoralize the enemy before disengaging prior to sunrise.  The latter case is considered a [[Raid (military)|raid]].

Historically, night combat involves greater risk and reward compared to similar battles in the day time.  Victories can be crushing, with the defending side taken completely by surprise and hardly a shot fired in response to an attack.  Alternatively, defeats can be disastrous with huge casualties resulting from attacking armies floundering around chaotically while they themselves are ambushed in pitch darkness.

==Definitions and practices==

===General===
While non-penetrative sex (or outercourse) is usually defined as excluding sexual penetration,&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRosa"/&gt; some non-penetrative sex acts can have penetrative components and may therefore be categorized as non-penetrative sex. Oral sex, for example, which can include oral caress of the [[Sex organ|genitalia]], as well as penile penetration of the mouth or oral penetration of the vagina, may be categorized as non-penetrative sex.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Leary"/&gt; Oral sex may also be considered outercourse solely because it is not [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[Anal sex|anal]] intercourse.&lt;ref name="Kalichman"&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Seth C.

===Frottage===
[[File:Wiki-frot1.png|thumb|200px|Frot: two men rubbing their penises together to create sexual sensations]]
''Frottage'' is the general term for the act of rubbing any part of the body, including the buttocks, the breasts, abdomen, thighs, feet, hands, legs and sexual organs against the sexual organ of another person; this is done whether naked or clothed and is more commonly known as ''dry humping'' or ''dry sex''.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;{{cite journal| last = M.| first = Hodge| authorlink = |author2=Evelyn Blackwood |author3=Jeffrey M.

Couples may engage in frottage as a form of foreplay or simply as a method to achieve sexual gratification without the penetrative aspects of vaginal, anal or oral sex, which may also be their personal way of preserving [[virginity]]&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt; or their way of practicing [[safer sex]].&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt; Often, young people will engage in frottage as an earlier stage of sexual intimacy before their idea of more explicit sexual contact is desired.

Other terms associated with frottage are:
* ''[[Princeton University|Princeton]] rub'', ''[[Ivy League]] rub'', and so on are slang terms referring to male-male [[frot]] or [[intercrural sex]] or both, presumably surviving from the days when these colleges only admitted men.&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"/&gt; [[W.&amp;nbsp;H. Auden]] was proud of having been the first person to use the terms ''Princeton rub'' and ''Princeton first-year'' in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=W.&amp;nbsp;H.

*The term ''frottage'' derives from the [[French language|French]] verb ''frotter'' (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;to rub). Three terms derive from ''frotter''. These include frottage, the sexual act involving rubbing; frot, the sexual act that refers exclusively to male-male genital rubbing without penetration (but may also be referred to as ''frottage'');&lt;ref name="Piepenburg"&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik|last=Piepenburg|title=What's Rub Got to Do With it?|publisher=''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''|date=February 2006|accessdate=July 4, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2IEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=frot+weintraub+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=frot%20weintraub%20definition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite book | author =Joe Perez|title=Rising Up|isbn=1411691733|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2006|page=248|accessdate=July 4, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caJ7gPv0DrAC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Bill%20Weintraub%20anal%20sex&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[frotteurism]], a [[paraphilia]] involving obsession with frottage or performing frottage non-consensually (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;pressing one's genitals against a stranger on a crowded subway); this was once called "frottage," but the usage is no longer acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;''Eccentric and Bizarre Behaviors'', Louis R.

===Mutual masturbation===
&lt;!--NOTE: Mutual masturbation redirects to this section; changing this heading will affect that redirect.--&gt;

[[Image:Geiger-masturbation-mutuelle.jpg|thumb|right|1840 [[Johann Nepomuk Geiger]] depiction of mutual masturbation]]
Mutual [[masturbation]] (also called manual intercourse) usually involves the manual stimulation of genitals by two or more people who stimulate themselves or one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fulbright|first=Yvonne K.|title=The Better Sex Guide to Extraordinary Lovemaking|year=2010|publisher=Quiver|isbn=9781592333523|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPVEEWaKK1UC&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richters"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richters | first1 = J. | last2 = Song | first2 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Australian university students agree with Clinton's definition of sex | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 318 | issue = 7189| page = 1011 | doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7189.1011a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done in situations where the participants do not feel ready, physically able, socially at liberty, or willing to engage in any penetrative sex act, or a particular penetrative sex act, but still wish to engage in a mutual sexual activity. It is also done as part of a full repertoire of sexual activity, where it may be used as foreplay,&lt;ref name="Richters"/&gt; while, for others, it is the primary sexual activity of choice.

Types of mutual masturbation include the [[handjob]] (the manual sexual stimulation of the [[Human penis|penis]] or [[scrotum]] by a person on a male)&lt;ref name="Handjob"&gt;{{cite web|title=Handjob|publisher=[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]|year=2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013|url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/handjob}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] (the manual sexual stimulation of the [[vagina]], [[clitoris]] or other parts of the [[vulva]], by a person on a female). Sexual stimulation of the genitals by using the feet may also be included, and so may manual stimulation of the [[Human anus|anus]].&lt;ref name="Richters2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richters | first1 = J. | last2 = Hendry | first2 = O. | last3 = Kippax | first3 = S. | year = 2003 | title = When safe sex isn't safe | url = | journal = Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 37–52 | doi=10.1080/713804637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like frottage in general, mutual masturbation may be used as an alternative to penile-vaginal penetration, to preserve virginity or to prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intimate"/&gt; It might result in one or more of the partners achieving [[orgasm]]. If no bodily fluids are exchanged (as is common), mutual masturbation is a form of safe sex, and greatly reduces the risk of transmission of sexual diseases.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aids.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;

In partnered manual genital stroking to reach orgasm or expanded orgasm, both people focus on creating and experiencing an orgasm in one person. Typically, one person lies down pant-less, while his or her partner sits alongside. The partner who is sitting uses his or her hands and fingers (typically with a lubricant) to slowly stroke the penis or clitoris and other genitals of the partner. Expanded orgasm as a mutual masturbation technique reportedly creates orgasm experiences more intense and extensive than what can be described as, or included in the definition of, a regular orgasm.&lt;ref name="ESO"&gt;{{cite book|title=The ESO Ecstasy Program: Better, Safer Sexual Intimacy and Extended Orgasmic Response|author1=Alan Brauer  |author2=Donna Brauer |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Warner Books|year=1991|pages=24–25|quote=Masters in Johnson ... described female orgasm as "a brief episode of physical release" characterized by either "a series of rapidly recurrent orgasmic experiences between which no recordable plateau-phase intervals can be demonstrated or by a single, long-continued orgasmic episode... status orgasmus is may last from 20 to more than 60 seconds"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a range of sensations that include orgasms that are full-bodied, and orgasms that last from a few minutes to many hours.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Taylor, PhD thesis (2000), In her PhD research study, the average time spent in an EO session was 54 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this technique is not without risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, in particular HIV. A person using his or her finger, with a small wound, to stimulate a woman's genitals could be infected with HIV found in her vagina's fluids; likewise regarding a man's semen containing HIV, which could infect a partner who has a small exposed wound on his or her skin.

===Exclusively non-penetrative===

&lt;!--If you don't like the above picture, create/obtain a suitable (i.e., non-hideous) replacement.--&gt;

Non-penetrative sex may sometimes be divided into acts that are exclusively non-penetrative and those that are not.{{By whom|date=June 2017}} Exclusively non-penetrative sexual acts include:

*[[Axillism|Axillary intercourse]]: (slang: "bagpiping", in reference to the underarm manner in which [[bagpipes]] are played; ''directing traffic'', or ''pit-wank'', a variant of the term ''tit-wank'', are also terms for axillary intercourse).

== Hookup culture ==
{{Main|Hookup culture}}In many [[Developed country|developed countries]], there is a trend where young individuals (typically late teens and early twenties) engage in [[casual sex]], also known as a hookup. This phenomenon has been termed ''[[hookup culture]].'' The term ''hookup'' in this context loosely means participating in some type of sexual activity (whether it is non-penetrative or penetrative) with another individual or group of individuals outside of a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnold | first1 = K. D. | year = 2010 | title = College student development and the hook-up culture | url = | journal = Journal of College &amp; Character | volume = 11 | issue = | page = 4 | doi=10.2202/1940-1639.1736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hooking up may be in the form of a [[one-night stand]], where the sex acts are contained within a single situation or the individuals may "hook up" on a more consistent basis (sometimes known as being "friends with benefits").  In addition, hooking up can mean different things to different people. Some individuals believe a hookup is "anything but intercourse", which would include only non-penetrative sex acts.&lt;ref name="Heldman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heldman | first1 = C. | last2 = Wade | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Hook-up culture: Setting a new research agenda | url = | journal = Sexuality Research and Social Policy | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 323–333 | doi=10.1007/s13178-010-0024-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth control]] may not be utilized if the individuals are not planning on engaging in a sex act. Using birth control and ensuring all individuals present understand that the activity is a hookup with no other expectations can maximize benefits while minimizing risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garcia | first1 = J.

==Health risks==

There is a sociocultural viewpoint that because non-penetrative sex usually does not involve a direct exchange of [[semen]] or [[Vaginal lubrication|vaginal fluids]], and because at no point (in exclusively non-penetrative sex acts) does anything penetrate the vulva, vagina or anus, these acts are risk free. Although the risks associated with non-penetrative sex acts are significantly less than those associated with penetrative sex, there are still risks that can occur.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aids.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;  There is a slight risk for pregnancy and [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) with certain non-penetrative sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clutterbuck | first1 = D.

Pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity where the penis is near the vagina (such as intercrural sex or other genital-genital rubbing) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance of the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=R.

Like non-exclusive non-penetrative sex acts, STI transmission varies for exclusively non-penetrative sexual activities; some common STIs transmitted through exclusively non-penetrative sex acts, and how they are contracted, are the following:&lt;ref name="plannedparenthood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/stds-hiv-safer-sex-101.htm|title=STDs :: Planned Parenthood|publisher=plannedparenthood.org|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chancroid]] is spread through skin-to-skin contact when an infected individual has sores present and these sores come into contact with another individual (generally in the genital area)
*[[Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) is spread through coming into contact with various body secretions (saliva, genital excretions, blood etc.)
*[[Human papillomavirus]] (HPV) is spread through skin-to-skin contact
*[[Molluscum contagiosum]] is spread through close contact with an infected person (sharing personal items or close skin-to-skin contact)
*[[Crab louse]] (also known as pubic lice or crabs) can be spread through close contact with an infected person
*[[Scabies]] is spread through close contact with an infected individual
*[[Syphilis]] can be spread through kissing, but is much more likely to be spread through vaginal, anal or oral intercourse
*[[Trichomoniasis]] (Trich) can be spread through sharing [[sex toy]]s, during mutual masturbation or any time genital fluid are passed from one person to another

With regard to non-exclusive non-penetrative sex acts, the risks somewhat increase because there is penetration (either of the vagina, anus or mouth) and there is the potential for bodily fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva) to be exchanged. In addition to the aforementioned STIs, the following can be transmitted through non-exclusive non-penetrative sex acts:&lt;ref&gt;Choices, N. H. S. (2013). Sex activities and risk-Live Well-NHS Choices. Men's health, 18, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] is generally spread through vaginal or anal intercourse; in rare cases, it may be spread through oral sex
*[[Gonorrhoea]] is generally spread through vaginal or anal intercourse, though it may also be spread through oral sex
*[[Hepatitis B]] can be spread through oral sex

Many individuals are concerned about the risk of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt; Generally, a person must either have unprotected sexual intercourse (vaginal or anal), use an infected syringe or have the virus passed from mother to child to be infected.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;  A person cannot be infected from casual contact, such as hugging; however, there is some risk if HIV-infected blood or genital secretions (semen or vaginal secretions) enter an open wound.&lt;ref name="Hales"/&gt;

The only way for complete protection from pregnancy or STI risk is to completely [[Sexual abstinence|abstain from all sexual activities]]. However, there are several ways to decrease the risk, should a person decide to be sexually active.

Some barrier methods include:
*[[Condom]]s, which can provide STI protection
*[[Dental dam]]s, which offer STI protection during oral sex
*Latex gloves, which can be used during mutual masturbation or fingering to prevent the risk of STI transmission

If a person is concerned about the minor risk of pregnancy from non-penetrative sex, there are also several [[hormonal contraceptive]] birth control methods that can be used. Dual protection (using both a barrier device and hormonal method) can be significantly effective at preventing both pregnancy and STI transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Reprod Health Matters. 2006 Nov;14(28):162-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paleolimnology''' ({{lang-el|paleon}}=old, ''limne''=lake, ''logos''=study) is a scientific subdiscipline closely related to both [[limnology]] and [[paleoecology]].  Palaeolimnological studies are concerned with reconstructing the [[paleoenvironment]]s of inland waters ([[lake]]s and [[streams]]; [[freshwater]], [[brackish]], or [[saline water|saline]]) – and especially changes associated with such events as [[climatic change]], human impacts (e.g., [[eutrophication]], or [[acid rain|acidification]]), and internal ontogenic processes.

Paleolimnological studies are commonly based on meticulous analyses of [[sediment]] cores, including the [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[mineralogy|mineralogical]] properties of sediments, and diverse [[biology|biological]] records (e.g., fossil [[diatoms]], [[cladocera]], [[ostracodes]], [[molluscs]], [[pollen]], [[pigments]], or [[chironomid]]s). One of the primary sources for recent paleolimnological research is the Journal of Paleolimnology.

==History==

===Lake ontogeny===
Most early paleolimnological studies focused especially on the biological [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] of lakes, and the role of internal lake processes in directing lake development.  Although [[Einar Naumann]] had speculated that the productivity of lakes should gradually decrease due to leaching of catchment soils, [[August Thienemann]] suggested that the reverse process likely occurred.  Early midge records seemed to support Thienemann's view.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, I. R. 1987.  Chironomidae (Diptera) in paleoecology. Quaternary Science Reviews 6: 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|Hutchinson]] &amp; Wollack suggested that following an initial oligotrophic stage lakes would achieve and maintain a trophic equilibrium.  They also stressed parallels between the early development of lake communities, and the sigmoid growth phase of animal communities – implying that the apparent early developmental processes in lakes were dominated by colonization effects, and lags due to the limited reproductive potential of the colonising organisms.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

In a classic paper, [[Raymond Lindeman]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R. L. 1942. The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23, 399–418.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a hypothetical developmental sequence, with lakes progressively developing through [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]], [[mesotrophic lake|mesotrophic]], and [[eutrophic]] stages, before senescing to a [[dystrophic lake|dystrophic]] stage and filling completely with sediment. A climax forest community would eventually be established on the peaty fill of the former lake basin.  These ideas were further elaborated by [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.|Ed Deevey]],&lt;ref&gt;Deevey, E. S., Jr. 1955. The obliteration of the hypolimmon. Mem. Ist. Ital. Idrobiol., Suppl 8, 9–38.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that lake development was dominated by a process of morphometric [[eutrophication]].  As the [[hypolimnion]] of lakes gradually filled with sediments, [[oxygen]] depletion would promote the release of iron-bound [[phosphorus]] to the overlying water. This process of internal fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, further accelerating the in-filling process.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, I. R. 2006. Chironomid overview. pp.360–366 in S.A. EIias (ed.) Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science, Vo1. 1, Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

Deevey and Lindemann's ideas were widely, if uncritically, accepted.  Although these ideas are still widely held by some limnologists, they were effectively refuted in 1957 by Deevey's student [[Daniel A. Livingstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, D.A. 1957. On the sigmoid growth phase in the history of Linsley Pond. American Journal of Science 255: 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Whiteside&lt;ref&gt;Whiteside. M. C. 1983. The mythical concept of eutrophication. Hydrobiologia 103, 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt;  also criticized Deevey and Lindemann's proposal, and palaeolimnologists now consider that a host of external  factors are equally or more important as regulators of lake development and productivity.  Indeed, late-glacial climatic oscillations (e.g., the [[Younger Dryas]]) appear to have been accompanied by parallel changes in productivity, illustrating that 1) lake development is not a unidirectional process, and 2) climatic change can have a profound effect on lake communities.

==Limnic Environment==
[[Limnology]] is study of inland water bodies including: lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, wetlands and more.&lt;ref name="limnology book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Alexander J|last2=Goldman|first2=Charles R|title=Limnology|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-07-023673-8|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological properties===

====Anthropogenic eutrophication, acidification, and climate change====
Interest in paleolimnology eventually shifted from esoteric questions of lake ontogeny to applied investigations of human impact. Torgny Wiederholm and Bill Warwick, for example, used [[chironomid]] fossils to assess the impacts of increased nutrient loading (anthropogenic [[eutrophication]]) on lake communities. Their studies reveal pronounced changes in the bottom fauna of North American and European lakes, a consequence of severe oxygen depletion in the eutrophied lakes.

From 1980 to 1990 the primary focus of paleolimnologists efforts shifted to understanding the role of human impacts ([[acid rain]]) versus natural processes (e.g., soil leaching) as drivers of [[pH]] change in northern lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Battarbee, R. W. 1984. Diatom analysis and the acidification of lakes. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 305: 451–477.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[pH]]-sensitivity of [[diatom]] communities had been recognised since at least the 1930s, when [[Friedrich Hustedt]] developed a classification for diatoms, based on their apparent pH preferences. [[Gunnar Nygaard (phycologist)|Gunnar Nygaard]] subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, [[Jouko Meriläinen]] introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function.  Using diatom and [[chrysophyte]] fossil records, research groups led by Rick Battarbee (UK), Ingemar Renberg (Sweden), Don Charles (US), John Kingston (US), and John Smol (Canada) were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified, in parallel with increased industry and emissions.  Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent, anthropogenic acidification.

In recent years palaeolimnologists have recognised that climate is a dominant force in aquatic ecosystem processes, and have begun to use lacustrine records to reconstruct [[paleoclimate]]s.  Sensitive records of climate change have been developed from a variety of indicators including, for example, paleotemperature reconstructions derived from [[chironomid]] fossils, and palaeosalinity records inferred from [[diatoms]].

==== Freshwater [http://extension.usu.edu/waterquality/whats-in-your-water/aquatic_macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates] ====
Freshwater macroinvertebrates ([[invertebrate]]s that can be see by naked eye; &gt; 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm) are a very diverse group of small animals present in [[river]]s, streams, lakes and wetlands. These animals include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, annelids and arachnids. They comprise a functionally and taxonomically diverse group that plays an important role in linking the food web in the [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They serve as a main source of food for the fishes and they depend on different types of algae and bacteria for the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=J. Iwan|last2=Sayer|first2=Carl D.|title=DOES THE FISH–INVERTEBRATE–PERIPHYTON CASCADE PRECIPITATE PLANT LOSS IN SHALLOW LAKES?|journal=Ecology|date=August 2003|volume=84|issue=8|pages=2155–2167|doi=10.1890/02-0422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most aquatic macro-invertebrates are small while some are quite large such as freshwater crayfish. They are very sensitive to different physical and chemical conditions and respond to it accordingly due to their limited mobility. For example, their community will change when a pollutant enters into the water or due to the change of [[water quality]]. Therefore, the water body which is rich with a macro-invertebrate community can be used to provide an estimate of water body health &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Marc|title=Water: Facts without Myths|journal=Water|date=7 August 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–4|doi=10.3390/w1010003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Macro invertebrates termed "benthos" inhabit surfaces of vegetation, rocks and other aquatic sediments. They are widely distributed in the aquatic environment and present at a range of trophic levels. Most  macroinvertebrates taxa are dependent on a range of [[abiotic factor]]s and [[biotic factor]]s and therefore community structure can be used to represent the local ecosystem. These factors may be the availability and quality of food, [[pH]], [[temperature]], salinity, land use pattern and [[water flow]] etc. These factors are interconnected and influence each other. For example, any change in the land use affects the riparian vegetation that may be increased or decreased which changes the inputs into the aquatic ecosystem, affecting the abundance and distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|last2=Gresens|first2=Susan|last3=Kenney|first3=Melissa|last4=Sutton-Grier|first4=Ariana|title=Benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality: The intersection of science and policy|journal=Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|date=1 January 2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=99–128|doi=10.1163/187498209X12525675906077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For all of these reasons, macroinvertabrates are considered as one of the best indicators of water quality.

===== Macroinvertebrates as an indicator of [[water quality]] =====
Macroinvertebrateas are commonly and widely distributed in many types of water bodies and respond with a range of sensitivities to many kinds of stressors. They are commonly used for toxicity testing and ecological assessments in water bodies and many of them complete their life cycles in a single water body so they are exposed directly to physical, chemical, and biological stressors and they also integrate the long and short term changes. When a freshwater source is degraded, the most sensitive invertebrate species are lost initially, followed by species more tolerant to pollution.These species either sustain their existence or their number decreases in response to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.T|first1=Barbour|title=USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols For Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, 1–35|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Macro-invertebrates are an essential part of the food chain. Their strategies for feeding can be clustered into several "functional feeding" groups. For example, shedders feed on leaves and woody materials, some depends on the vegetation growing in the water body. Examples of shredders are amphipods, isopods, freshwater crayfish, and caddisfly larvae.

==Paleoclimate proxies==
Paleoclimatology (or the study of past climates) uses proxy data in order to relate elements collected in modern-day samples to suggest the climatic conditions of the past.

===Sediment cores===
Sediment cores are one of the primary tools for studying paleolimnology because of the role in which lake and river sediments play in preserving biological information.&lt;ref name="sediment book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birks|first1=H. John. B.|last2=Lotter|first2=Andre F.|last3=Juggins|first3=Steve|last4=Smol|first4=John P.|title=Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: Data Handling and Numerical Techniques|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleolimnologists collect [[Core sample|sediment cores]] and observe various proxy indicators in order to reconstruct past limnology of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Some of these indicators include geochemical markers and isotopic data which are found within the various sections of the sediment core.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; In order to calibrate data, a group of around 40 or more calibration lakes are used to reconstruct what the conditions of a new core are likely to reflect.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; The use of these calibration lakes is necessary to identify dramatic differences in a newly collected core compared to normal variations which would be depicted in the calibration lakes. Through the use of sediment cores as a technique, paleolimnologists are able to use other proxies (such as pollen, charcoal, diatoms, chironomids, and other organic matter) in order to reconstruct the past climatic conditions of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Lake sediment cores in particular offer a more comprehensive analysis of an area because of the continual accumulation of sediment as well as other organic matter like pollen and charcoal.

===Pollen records===
Pollen and spores can be analyzed within a lab setting to determine the family, genus, or species which the pollen grains belong. The overall taxonomic assemblage of pollen types reflects the surrounding vegetation of the lake.  [[Palynology|Pollen analysis]] is a major field in [[paleoecology]]. A range of statistical and qualitative treatment of pollen records can be used to reconstruct past vegetation and climate.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt;

=== Diatoms ===
The taxonomic assemblages of [[diatom]]s reflect many aspects of the lake temperature, chemical, and nutrient environment.

=== Organic matter characteristics ===
Organic matter may be characterized in terms of 1) amount (accumulation rate, reflecting productivity), 2) origin (aquatic or terrestrial determined from the C:N ratio), 3) carbon isotopic composition (reflecting plant photosynthetic pathways of C3 vs C4 plants, and reflecting drought and/or aquatic productivity), 4) nitrogen isotopic composition (reflecting sources of nitrogen and nitrogen cycling). There are a range of biomarkers widely used, as well as compound-specific isotopic analyses.  [[Diagenesis]] is an important factor to consider in interpreting organic matter records.

===Chironomids===

==== [[Chironomids]] as a proxy of climate change: Paleolimnology and chironomids ====
One of the major factor that affects the flora and fauna of the earth is the change of climate at the local, regional and global scale. These changes are preserved over the period of time as a fossil record and through paleolimnological methods, these changes can be traced out and also helpful for the prediction of the future climate change. Chironomids are one of the best indicators of climate change. These are two winged flies and belongs to family Chironomidae with 500 to 15,000 species. Ecologically they are considered as [[Bottom feeder|bottom dwellers]] and are very responsive to any fluctuation in the surrounding environment. They are considered as a good indicator of [[salinity]], water depth, [[stream flow]], aquatic productivity, oxygen level, lake acidification, [[pollution]], [[Temperature|temperatur]]e, and overall [[ecosystem health]]. As the assemblage of chironomids is dependent on several [[environmental factor]]s, they can be easily related to those changing factors using a transfer function to connect a particular group of organisms to a specific [[environmental variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilyashuk|first1=Elena A.|last2=Ilyashuk|first2=Boris P.|last3=Tylmann|first3=Wojciech|last4=Koinig|first4=Karin A.|last5=Psenner|first5=Roland|title=Biodiversity dynamics of chironomid midges in high-altitude lakes of the Alps over the past two millennia|journal=Insect Conservation and Diversity|date=1 November 2015|volume=8|issue=6|pages=547–561|doi=10.1111/icad.12137|language=en|issn=1752-4598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake deposits have a rich diversity of fossilized insects that trace back to middle Paleozoic era and more abundance can be found in the Quaternary period.Among aquatic invertebrates, different families of aquatic fly larvae can be traced out in the lake sediments of Quaternary era. Among them, Chironomids are of greatest ecological importance due to their diverse habitat in the aquatic ecosystem, feeding habitat, important component in the food web and above all their usage as a plaeolimnological studies because their head capsule and feeding structures are fossilized in the lake sediments.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew S.|title=Paleolimnology : the history and evolution of lake systems|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195133530|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chironomids complete their larval stage in the water and its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] continues up to several years while adult life span is very short. They have an important role in the degradation of material in the aquatic ecosystem and serve as an important part of the food web during their whole life cycle.&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smol|first1=edited by Reinhard Pienitz and Marianne S.V. Douglas and John P.|title=Long-term environmental change in Arctic and Antarctic lakes|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-2126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Climate change ====
According to [[IPCC]] (2007) reports one of the vital aspect of environment is the continuous climate change due several factors over the period of time which is influential in shaping the biodiversity.
Macroinvertebrates, especially chironomids have been considered as an important [[Indicator organism|indicator]] of the [[climate change]] especially temperature due to their presence in the abundance in the [[lake sediment]] as a fossil. There is a strong correlation between the chironomids assemblage and the water temperature, lake depth, salinity and, nutrients of the lake.Lake water levels over the past time period can be inferred from the chironomids assemblage due to their correlation.It is due to the fact that climate change resulted in the water level change of the lake that is related to change in the pattern of chironomids distribution and abundance.Their strong correlation helps to build the information about the evaporation and precipitation in the past. Past climate change is reconstructed based on the paleolimnology with the help of different [[fossilized]] records especially the lake sediments that helps to find out the regional and local climate change. It is important to differentiate between the impacts that a lake store due to the regional and local level [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Springer"/&gt; 

Recent studies in [[Arctic]] shows that [[biodiversity]] affect more due to the arctic warming than other associated factors like human alteration and [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RAHEL|first1=FRANK J.|last2=OLDEN|first2=JULIAN D.|title=Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Aquatic Invasive Species|journal=Conservation Biology|date=June 2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Himalayan region water bodies are not only affected by the anthropogenic disturbances but also impacted by the different types of pollutants that are transferred to this area over a longer distance.It is vital to understand all the associated factors acting on the aquatic biodiversity while analyzing the impact of climate change over the past years with the help of lake sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=C.M|last2=Sharma|first2=S|last3=Gurung|first3=S|last4=Bajracharya|first4=R.M|last5=Jüttner|first5=I|last6=Pradhan|first6=N.S|title=Global Climatic Change and High Altitude Lakes: Impacts on Aquatic Biodiversity and Pollution Status|journal=Natural Resources Management: Reviews and Research in the Himalayan Watersheds|date=2009|issue=44(977)|pages=103–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to consider that the impact and intensity of different changes due to climate change may have totally different affect on different [[ecosystems]] depending upon its sensitivity to that change &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beniston|first1=Martin|title=Climatic Change in Mountain Regions: A Review of Possible Impacts | journal=Climatic Change|date=2003|volume=59|issue=1/2|pages=5–31|doi=10.1023/A:1024458411589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors influencing chironomids distribution and abundance ====
There are several factors that has been affecting the abundance and distribution pattern of [[Chironomids]] over the past years.Therefore, it is important to be careful while making interpretations from their fossil records.There are several debates for the last many years on the impact of temperature on their abundance and diversity along with other associated factors. For the correct interpretation of the [[Fossil|fossil records]], it is important to understand all the associated factors of an ecosystem.In order to understand the different forces that have been affecting the [[fossil]] data of lake, it important to reconstruct [[Physical property|physical]], chemical and the [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient]] content of the lakes that actually shapes the communities.
Their distribution and abundance is highly influenced by the combination of human disturbance and change in the climate. Both of them influence the catchment area that resulted into the changing of [[Aquatic vegetation|vegetation]], [[hydrology]], and nutrients cycle. Any change at the regional level especially the temperature affects the water quality at the local scale and then at the end it affect the [[habitat]] that is species-specific.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

==== Chironomids and reconstruction of quantitative change in [[Holocene Epoch|Holocene climate]] ====
There is ongoing debate about the main factor that controls the distribution and abundance of chironomids.Several factors are considered as the controlling factor especially temperature that in turn control other supporting factors including Ph, [[salinity]], nutrient flow and productivity especially in the late [[Pleistocene]]/Holocene timer period. For many years research has been carried out on the relationship between temperature and chironomids distribution pattern due to its influence on its emergence. Chironomids are directly and indirectly affected by [[temperature]] during the whole life cycle including their larval emergence, growth, feeding and [[Insect reproduction|reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; According to Eggermont and Heiri (2012) there is indirect impact of temperature on different physic chemical aspects of water resulted into determination of their distribution and abundance. There is also a strong relationship between the chironomids abundance, [[emergence]] and distribution with the mean temperature of the air and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggermont|first1=Hilde|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|title=The chironomid-temperature relationship: expression in nature and palaeoenvironmental implications|journal=Biological Reviews|date=May 2012|volume=87|issue=2|pages=430–456|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00206.x|pmid=22032243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a research conducted by Gunten et al., 2007 at [[Lakes in Switzerland|high altitude lake]] Lej da la Tscheppain Switzerland, seasonal temperature reconstruction can be done with the help of independent chironomids and diatoms.Any change in the assemblage of chironomids reflects change in the temperature and duration of ice cover of that specific water body due to climate change. According to their findings, chironomids respond mostly to the change in the [[Temperature|summer temperature]], so seasonal variation in temperature can be inferred from different cores of the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Gunten|first1=Lucien|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|last3=Bigler|first3=Christian|last4=van Leeuwen|first4=Jacqueline|last5=Casty|first5=Carlo|last6=Lotter|first6=Andr?

&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all discussions of polarization in [[political science]] consider polarization in the context of [[political party|political parties]] and democratic systems of government. When polarization occurs in a [[two-party system]], like the [[United States]], moderate voices often lose power and influence.&lt;ref name = dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=mann-12&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=Thomas E. |author2=Ornstein, Norman J. |title=It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American constitutional system collided with the new politics of extremism | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705154533/http://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2014-07-05 | publisher=[[Basic Books]] | year=2012 | isbn=978-0465031337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|title=Polarized America : the dance of ideology and unequal riches|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|at=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262134644 |author2=Poole, Keith T. |author3=Rosenthal, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and measurements==

Political polarization refers to the cases in which an individual's stance on a given issue, policy, or person is more likely to be strictly defined by their identification with a particular political party (e.g., [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) or [[political ideology|ideology]] (e.g., [[liberalism|liberal]] or [[conservatism|conservative]]).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Is Polarization a Myth?|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 March 2008|volume=70|issue=2|page=542|doi=10.1017/S0022381608080493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bafumi|first=Joseph|author2=Shapiro, Robert Y.|title=A New Partisan Voter|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 January 2009|volume=71|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1017/S0022381608090014|url=http://ftp.columbia.edu/cu/alliance/documents/EDF/Monday/Shapiro_Bafumi_reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DiMaggio et al. (1996), "Polarization is both a state and a process. Polarization as a state refers to the extent to which opinions on an issue are opposed in relation to some theoretical maximum. Polarization as a process refers to the increase in such opposition over time."&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt; Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues based on a consistent set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt; Others argue polarization occurs when there are stark partisan or ideological divides, even if the opinion is polarized only on a few issues.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09/&gt;

Political scientists typically distinguish between two types of political polarization: elite polarization and popular polarization. "Elite polarization" refers to the polarization of political elites, like [[party organizer]]s and [[elected officials]], while "popular polarization" (or mass polarization) refers to the polarization in the electorate and general public. In either context, opinions and policy positions are characterized by strict adherence to [[party line (politics)|party lines]]. Elite polarization and popular polarization can occur at the same time or independent of each other. A central issue in the study of political polarization is investigating the relationship between elite polarization and popular polarization, particularly any causal relationships between the two.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|title=Review Article: Putting Polarization in Perspective|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=17 February 2009|volume=39|issue=2|page=413|doi=10.1017/S0007123408000501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Layman|first=Geoffrey C.|author2=Carsey, Thomas M. |author3=Horowitz, Juliana Menasce |title=Party Polarization in American Politics: Characteristics, Causes, and Consequences|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=1 June 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83–110|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.070204.105138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmines|first=E.

===Elite polarization===

[[File:NOMINATE polarization.jpg|thumb|Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives (DW-Nominate scores)]]
Elite polarization refers to polarization in the party-in-government and party-as-organization.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt; It occurs when party members (both elected government officials and activists within the party organization itself) grow more internally homogenous on policy positions and more divergent relative to members of other parties. Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a [[parliamentary system]] of democratic governance.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt; 

In a [[two-party system]] like the U.S., a polarized [[legislature]] has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across the broad liberal/conservative ideological divide. This leads to the conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of the ideological center.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze [[recorded vote|roll-call voting]] patterns to determine trends in party-line voting and party unity.&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt; Many political scientists studying American politics rely on Poole and Rosenthal's [[NOMINATE (scaling method)|DW-NOMINATE scores]], which assign a single liberal-conservative score to each congressperson, enabling comparisons of members from different Congresses. There is much more research on polarization in Congress than on polarization in the other branches of government or in state governments.&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hetherington-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt; Azzimonti's political polarization index is more comprehensive instead because it is based on media coverage of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about policy in all branches of government.&lt;ref&gt;Azzimonti, Marina "[http://marina-azzimonti.com/papers/Polariz2.pdf The political polarization index]"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy has used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization. They find that polarization has increased dramatically since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gentzkow, Matthew, and Shapiro, Jesse, and Taddy, Matt [http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/politext.pdf Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular polarization===

Popular polarization, or mass polarization, occurs when the electorate's attitudes towards political issues, policies, and people are starkly divided along partisan lines. Members of the electorate and general public typically become less moderate in cases of popular polarization.&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claassen|first=R.L.|author2=Highton, B.|title=Policy Polarization among Party Elites and the Significance of Political Awareness in the Mass Public|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=9 September 2008|volume=62|issue=3|pages=538–551|doi=10.1177/1065912908322415}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., media accounts typically simplify popular polarization to a divide between [[red states and blue states]] or a "[[Culture war#United States of America|culture war]]" between values-voters and progressives. Political scientists, though, generally agree that such accounts are too simplistic and ignore the complex factors that can account for polarization.&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiorina |first=Morris P. |author2=Samuel A. Abrams |author3=Jeremy C. Pope |title=Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America | publisher=[[Pearson Longman]] | year=2006 | isbn=978-0321276407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists consider political polarization a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to – or at least precedes – popular polarization. However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters' preferences.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

Political scientists studying popular polarization typically rely on data from [[opinion polls]] and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents' opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt; Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been.&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt; Oft-cited public opinion polls in the U.S. include those run by the [[Pew Research Center]] and [[Gallup, Inc.]], while political scientists also rely on more academic surveys, like the [[General Social Survey]] and the election surveys and "feeling thermometer" polls conducted by [[National Election Studies]].&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

==Causes==
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, [[redistricting]], the public's [[political ideologies|political ideology]], and the mass media.

===Party polarization===
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the [[United States Congress]], where the [[majority party]] prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its [[party platform]] and political ideology.&lt;ref name=ura-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ura|first=Joseph Daniel|author2=Ellis, Christopher R.|title=Partisan Moods: Polarization and the Dynamics of Mass Party Preferences|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=10 February 2012|volume=74|issue=1|pages=277–291|doi=10.1017/S0022381611001587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]], the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, [[Southern Democrats]] shifted toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Ideological Realignment in the U.S. Electorate|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=August 1998|volume=60|issue=3|page=634|doi=10.2307/2647642|jstor=10.2307/2647642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galston|first=William A.|title=Political Polarization and the U.S. Judiciary|journal=UKMC Law Review|year=2009|volume=77|issue=207|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc77&amp;div=15&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions.&lt;ref name=beniers-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beniers|first=Klaas J.|author2=Dur, Robert|title=Politicians’ motivation, political culture, and electoral competition|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|date=1 February 2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=29–54|doi=10.1007/s10797-006-8878-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the [[United States House of Representatives]]—which political scientists [[Thomas E. Mann]] and [[Norman Ornstein]] refer to as [[Newt Gingrich]]'s "guerrilla war."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as "party fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomsen|first1=Danielle M.|title=Ideological Moderates Won't Run: How Party Fit Matters for Partisan Polarization in Congress|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=2014|volume=76|issue=3|pages=786–797|doi=10.1017/s0022381614000243|jstor=0022381614000243}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme.&lt;ref name=hirano-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirano|first=Shigeo, Jr. |author2=James M. Snyder |author3=Michael M. Ting|title=Distributive Politics with Primaries|journal=Journal of Politics|year=2009|volume=71|issue=4|pages=1467–1480|url=http://www.yale.org/leitner/resources/docs/snyder.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0022381609990247}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Nicholson (2012) found voters are more polarized by contentious statements from leaders of the opposing party than from the leaders of their own party. As a result, political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances.&lt;ref name=nicholson-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Stephen P.|title=Polarizing Cues|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1 January 2012|volume=56|issue=1|pages=52–66|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x|pmid=22400143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to [[multiparty systems]], [[Giovanni Sartori]] (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon [[polarized pluralism]] and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues.&lt;ref name=sartori-66&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=European political parties: the case of polarized pluralism|journal=Political Parties and Political Development|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=Parties and party systems : a framework for analysis|year=1976|publisher=ECPR|location=Colchester|isbn=978-0954796617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=[Nouvelle édition]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnston-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Richard|title=Polarized Pluralism in the Canadian Party System: Presidential Address to the Canadian Political Science Association, June 5, 2008|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=17 December 2008|volume=41|issue=4|page=815|doi=10.1017/S0008423908081110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of [[India]] in the 1970s. Ideological splits within a number of India's major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left, each consisting of multiple political parties.&lt;ref name=davey-72&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Hampton|title=Polarization and Consensus in Indian Party Politics|journal=Asian Survey|date=1 August 1972|volume=12|issue=8|pages=701–716|doi=10.2307/2643110|jstor=10.2307/2643110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through [[Super PACs|Super political action committees]]. Some, such as ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' opinion writer [[Robert G. Kaiser|Robert Kaiser]], argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser-10&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert G.|title=So damn much money : the triumph of lobbying and the corrosion of American government|year=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0307385888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJxU1MzQZVoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns. These scholars argue a single donor who is polarized and contributes large sums to a campaign does not seem to usually drive a politician toward political extremes.&lt;ref name=la-raja-11&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Raja|first=R.J.|author2=Wiltse, D.L.|title=Don't Blame Donors for Ideological Polarization of Political Parties: Ideological Change and Stability Among Political Contributors, 1972–2008|journal=American Politics Research|date=13 December 2011|volume=40|issue=3|pages=501–530|doi=10.1177/1532673X11429845|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/40/3/501.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tam-cho-07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tam Cho|first=Wendy K.|author2=Gimpel, James G.|title=Prospecting for (Campaign) Gold|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1 April 2007|volume=51|issue=2|pages=255–268|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00249.x|url=http://cho.pol.illinois.edu/wendy/papers/krige.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The public===
In democracies and other [[Representative democracy|representative governments]], citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them. Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public's ideology and voting preferences.&lt;ref name=galston-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=garner-10&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garner | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Palmer | first2 = Harvey | title = Polarization and issue consistency over time | journal = [[Political Behavior (journal)|Political Behavior]] | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–246 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11109-010-9136-7 | date = June 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11109-010-9136-7 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=Lilliana |title=The rise of uncivil agreement: issue versus behavioral polarization in the American electorate|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|date=January 2013|volume=57|issue=1|pages=140–159 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi= 10.1177/0002764212463363 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764212463363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murakami-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Michael H.|title=How party polarization affects candidate evaluations: the role of ideology|journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hyatt Regency Chicago and the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, Chicago, Illinois |year=2007|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/1/0/3/3/pages210336/p210336-1.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixit and Weibull (2007) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon. They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise.&lt;ref name=dixit-07&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixit|first1=Avinash K. | last2 = Weibull |first2= Jörgen W. |title=Political polarization|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=1 May 2007|volume=104|issue=18 |pages=7351–7356 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702071104 | jstor = 25427490 | publisher = [[National Academy of Sciences]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0702071104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris P. Fiorina]] (2006, 2008) posits the hypothesis that polarization is a phenomenon which does not hold for the public, and instead is formulated by commentators to draw further division in government.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=born-94&gt;{{cite journal|last=Born|first=Richard|title=[Split-ticket voters, divided government, and Fiorina's policy-balancing model]: rejoinder|journal=[[Legislative Studies Quarterly]]|date=February 1994|volume=19 |issue=1 | publisher = [[American Political Science Association]] |jstor=439804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies indicate that cultural differences focusing on ideological movements and geographical polarization within the United States constituency is correlated with rises in overall political polarization between 1972 and 2004.&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-05&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.dartmouth.edu/~govt/docs/Abramowitz.pdf | last1 = Abramowitz | first1 = Alan | last2 = Saunders | first2 = Kyle L. | title = Why can't we all just get along?

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more [[moderate]] in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly [[evangelical]] candidate than Democratic voters.&lt;ref name=campbell-11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David E.|last2 = Green | first2 = John C. | last3 = Layman | first3 = Geoffrey C. |title=The party faithful: partisan images, candidate religion, and the electoral impact of party identification|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|date= January 2011|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States.&lt;ref name=layman-05&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layman |first1= Geoffrey C. | last2 =Green | first2 = John C. |title=Wars and rumours of wars: the contexts of cultural conflict in American political behaviour|journal=[[British Journal of Political Science]]|date=January 2006|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=61–89 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0007123406000044 | jstor = 4092316 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007123406000044  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, [[coalition]] and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.&lt;ref name=brooks-04&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/A_Great_Divide.pdf|last=Brooks|first=Clem|author2=Manza, Jeff|title=A great divide?

In some post-colonial countries, the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime.&lt;ref name=bhavnani-08&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhavnani|first1=Ravi | last2 =Miodownik | first2= Dan|title=Ethnic polarization, ethnic salience, and Civil War |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |date=February 2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=30–49 |doi=10.1177/0022002708325945 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022002708325945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] in the late 1980s, members of the conservative, pro-apartheid [[National Party of South Africa]] were no longer supportive of [[apartheid]], and, therefore, no longer ideologically aligned with their party. Dutch [[Afrikaners]], white English, and native Africans split based on racial divisions, causing polarization along ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=sisk-89&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisk|first=Timothy D.|title=White politics in South Africa: politics under pressure|journal=[[Africa Today]]|date=January 1989|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=29–39 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] |jstor=4186531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darity-09&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/research/publications/3710| last = Darity | first = William A. | contribution = Economic theory and racial economic inequality | editor-last1 = Dodson | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Palmer | editor-first2 = Colin A. | title = The Black condition | pages = 1–43 | publisher = Michigan State University Press | location = East Lansing, Michigan | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0870138386 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic inequality]] can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-[[World War I]] [[Germany]], the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany|Communist Workers Party]], and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]], a [[fascism|fascist]] party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany's economic problems in drastically different ways.&lt;ref name=sartori-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76/&gt; In [[Venezuela]] in the late 20th century, the entrance of the oil industry into the local economy caused economic disparities that led to sharp ideological divides. As a result, the disenfranchised working class aligned with extreme [[socialism|socialist]] leader [[Hugo Chávez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lombardi |first=John V. |contribution=Prologue: Venezuela's Permanent Dilemma |editor1-last=Ellner |editor1-first=Steve |editor2-last=Hellinger |editor2-first=Daniel |date=2004 |title=Venezuelan politics in the Chávez era: class, polarization, and conflict |publisher=Rienner |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-1588262974 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Venezuelan_Politics_in_the_Ch%C3%A1vez_Era.html?id=uYd4Q1vQluAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redistricting===
[[Gerrymandering]] or the manipulation of the electoral borders to favor a political party or the electoral outcome affect the redistricting process in the U.S. It has been linked to the rise in polarization by some political scientists.&lt;ref name=yoshinaka-11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoshinaka|first=Antoine &amp; Chad Murphy|title=The Paradox of Redistricting: How Partisan Mapmakers Foster Competition but Disrupt Representation|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=June 2011|volume=64|issue=2|pages=435–447|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/873115158/|doi=10.1177/1065912909355716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that the practice of redistricting creates political polarization by making more homogeneous, ideologically distinct districts. This results in elected representatives who represent more polarized beliefs.&lt;ref name=thompson-04&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Dennis F.|title=Election Time: Normative Implications of Temporal Properties of the Electoral Process in the United States|journal=American Political Science Review|date=February 2004|volume=98|issue=1|pages=51–64|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPSR%2FPSR98_01%2FS0003055404000991a.pdf&amp;code=2dc646d4d430ae4fef0a6e06d5ccf9fa|doi=10.1017/s0003055404000991}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carson et al. (2007), this makes it easier for more extreme candidates to win elections (and re-election) as the makeup of the voting block shifts in the direction of a polar extreme. This effect is more modest when analyzed over multiple election cycles and in the United States as a whole.&lt;ref name=carson-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=J.L.|author2=Crespin, M.H. |author3=Finocchiaro, C.J. |author4= Rohde, D.W. |title=Redistricting and Party Polarization in the U.S. House of Representatives|journal=American Politics Research|date=28 September 2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=878–904|doi=10.1177/1532673X07304263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name=mckee-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=SEth C.|title=The Effects of Redistricting on Voting Behavior in Incumbent U.S. House Elections, 1992–1994|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=March 2008|volume=61|issue=1|pages=122–133|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215329960?accountid=10141|doi=10.1177/1065912907306473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kousser-96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kousser|first=J|title=Estimating the Partisan Consequences of Redistricting Plans – Simply|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|date=November 1996|volume=21|issue=4|pages=521–541|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/60821189?accountid=10141|doi=10.2307/440460|jstor=440460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists however, argue that redistricting practices have not played a major role in causing political polarization.

===The media===
The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media's current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=hollander-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=B.A.|title=Tuning Out or Tuning Elsewhere?

(2010). ''Program or be programmed: Ten commands for a digital age.'' Berkeley, CA: Soft Skull Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of personalizing web content results in ''[[filter bubble]]s'', a term coined by digital activist [[Eli Pariser]] that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Pariser, E. (2011). ''The filter bubble: What the internet is hiding from you''. New York, NY: The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentzkow|first=Matthew|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jesse M.|date=2011-11-01|title=Ideological Segregation Online and Offline *|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/4/1799/1924154/Ideological-Segregation-Online-and-Offline?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1799–1839|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr044|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated. Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hohenberg|first=Clemm von|last2=Bernhard|last3=Maes|first3=Michael|last4=Pradelski|first4=Bary S.R.|date=2017-05-25|title=Micro influence and macro dynamics of opinions|ssrn=2974413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duhaime|first=Erik|last2=Apfelbaum|first2=Evan|date=2017|title=Can Information Decrease Political Polarization? Evidence From the U.S. Taxpayer Receipt |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616687126|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=8|issue=7|page=736|language=en|doi=10.1177/1948550616687126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a "Taxpayer Receipt," but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent.  This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted.

===The public===

Opinions on polarization's effects on the public are mixed. Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; but this is not unanimous.&lt;ref name=wilkerson-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbing-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hibbing|first=John R.|author2=Christopher W.

Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics, [[party identification]] and [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government.&lt;ref name="hetherington-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation?

Brady|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Turned Off or Turned On? How Polarization Affects Political Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=brady-06/&gt; which can alienate voters.

On the other hand, others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public's political participation in the United States, citing greater voting and nonvoting participation, engagement and investment in campaigns, and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness.&lt;ref name=hetherington-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=dodson-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kyle|title=The Return of the American Voter? Party Polarization and Voting Behavior, 1988 to 2004|journal=Sociological Perspectives|date=1 September 2010|volume=53|issue=3|pages=443–449|doi=10.1525/sop.2010.53.3.443|url=http://faculty1.ucmerced.edu/kdodson2/docs/Publications/Dodson_Return%20of%20the%20American%20Voter.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarized parties become more ideologically unified, furthering voter knowledge about their positions and increasing their standard to similarly-aligned voters.&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dodson-10" /&gt;

===The media===

As Mann and Ornstein argue, political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have "reinforce[d] tribal divisions, while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation, nor are they shared by the larger public."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;  As other scholars have argued, the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mutz-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Mutz|first=Diana C.|title=Red and blue nation? Volume One: characteristics and causes of America's polarized politics|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0815760832|chapter=How the Mass Media Divide Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience,&lt;ref name=rosenstiel-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenstiel|first=Thomas|title=Red and blue nation? Volume One: characteristics and causes of America's polarized politics|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0815760832|chapter=Two Alternative Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; polarized environments make it easier for the media and [[advocacy group|interest groups]] to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions,&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mutz-06" /&gt; generally healthy for democracy.&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;

===Judicial systems===

[[Judicial system]]s can also be affected by the implications of political polarization. For the United States, in particular, polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; More polarized parties have more aggressively block nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=dionne-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dionne|first=E.J., Jr.|author2=William A. Galston|title=A Half-Empty Government Can't Govern: Why Everyone Wants to Fix the Appointments Process, Why It Never Happens, and How We Can Get It Done|journal=Brookings|date=14 December 2010|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2010/12/14-appointments-galston-dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Sarah Binder (2000) argues that "senatorial intolerance for the opposing party’s nominees is itself a function of polarization."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; Negative consequences of this include higher vacancy rates on appellate courts, longer case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods, nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as "polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; It also influences the politics of senatorial [[advice and consent]], giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench, obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch.&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Ultimately, the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary's credibility.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;  Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges, which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name="wittes-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation? Volume Two: Consequences and Correction of America's Polarized Politics|last=Wittes|first=Benjamin|publisher=Brookings|year=2008|isbn=978-0815760801|editor=Pietro S. Nivola &amp; David W. Brady|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Comments on Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Foreign policy===

Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on [[foreign policy]] and harm a nation's international standing;&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccormick-90&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=James M.|author2=Eugene R. Wittkopf|title=Bipartisanship, Partisanship, and Ideology in Congressional-Executive Foreign Policy Relations, 1947–1988|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=November 1990|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1077–1100|url=http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/McCormick%20Wittkopf%20Bipartisanship.pdf|doi=10.2307/2131683}}&lt;/ref&gt; divisiveness on foreign affairs  strengthens enemies, discourages allies and destabilize a nation's determination.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;

Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy of the United States"]]. First, when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust its promises, enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses, and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises.&lt;ref name="mccormick-90" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson-08&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James Q.|title=Red and blue nation?

Brady|location=Washington, DC|chapter=When Politics No Longer Stops at the Water’s Edge: Partisan Polarization and Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, elite opinion has a significant impact on the public's perception and understanding of foreign policy,&lt;ref name=wilson-08/&gt; a field where Americans have less prior knowledge to rely on.&lt;ref name=mccormick-90/&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=souva-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Souva|first=M.|author2=Rohde, D.|title=Elite Opinion Differences and Partisanship in Congressional Foreign Policy, 1975–1996|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=1 March 2007|volume=60|issue=1|pages=113–123|doi=10.1177/1065912906298630|url=http://mailer.fsu.edu/~msouva/Elite%20Opinion%20Differences%20-%20Souva-Rohde%20PRQ%202007.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728093748/http://mailer.fsu.edu/~msouva/Elite%20Opinion%20Differences%20-%20Souva-Rohde%20PRQ%202007.pdf|archivedate=28 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Perspective ==
Outside of the U.S., there are plenty of modern day examples of polarization in politics. A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|url=|journal=Renewal|volume=24|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|url=|journal=New Statesman|volume=147|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[Populism|populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197–201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|pages=318-334|via=Electronic Journal Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.   

== Critiques ==
There have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.

=== Limitations of the two-party system ===
By solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-06" /&gt; Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;

=== Issue partisanship ===
Despite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,&lt;ref name="abramowitz-08" /&gt; numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Religion, politics, and support for same-sex marriage in the United States, 1988–2008|last = Sherkat|first = Darren|date = 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the "hot topic" or "sensitive" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Polarization, secularization, or differences as usual? The denominational cleavage in U.S. social attitudes since the 1970s.|last = Bolzendahl|first = |date = 2005|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reliance on focusing on opinions regarding social issues to draw conclusion about political polarization is not a valid measurement to fully represent the concept.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;

In regard to views on public policies, Fiorina and Abrams (2008) found virtually no evidence of an increase in widespread political polarization over the past thirty years. Nonetheless, many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them; it is the partisan extremism (i.e. Democrat v. Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Political polarization projection: Social projection of partisan attitude extremity and attitudinal processes.|last = Van Boven|first = |date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religious convictions and political choice|last = Greenawalt|first = Kent|publisher = |year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
Proponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.&lt;ref name="abramowitz-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Purple America|last = Ansolabehere|first = |date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The future of red, blue and purple America.|last = Teixeira|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130123073800/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2013-01-23|title =U.S. elections: How groups voted in 2012|date =2012|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8392|title = Voting behavior based on socioeconomic status|last = Brown|first = |date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.

=== Westernized focus ===
Much like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study. To have a better picture of the presence or absence of political polarization, scholars must consider widening the scope of their studies to the international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Globalization's cultural consequences|last = Holton|first = |date = 2000|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization and culture: Global mélange.|last = Pieterse|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privately owned public space''' ('''POPS'''), or alternatively, '''privately owned public open spaces''' ('''POPOS'''), are terms used to describe a type of [[public space]] that, although [[Private property|privately owned]], is legally required to be open to the [[public]] under a city's [[zoning ordinance]] or other land-use law. The acronym POPOS is preferentially used over POPS on the west coast of the US. Both terms can be used to represent either a singular or plural space or spaces.  These spaces are usually the product of a deal between cities and private [[Real estate development|real estate developers]] in which cities grant valuable zoning concessions and developers provide in return privately owned public spaces in or near their buildings. Privately owned public spaces commonly include [[plaza]]s, arcades, small [[park]]s, and [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]s.  Many cities worldwide, including [[Auckland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Open up hidden public places in Auckland towers |first=Dorie |last=Reeves |url= http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11702774 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=1 September 2016 |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seattle.gov/council/Licata/public_space.htm

| title = Map Of Seattle POPOS 
| work = City Of Seattle
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seoul]], and [[Toronto]], have privately owned public spaces.  Some cities and advocacy groups have created websites about these spaces (see, for example, [http://apops.mas.org/ apops.mas.org]).

Although the term "privately owned public space" was popularized by Harvard professor Jerold S. Kayden through his 2000 book ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience'', written in collaboration with the [[New York City Department of City Planning]] and the [[Municipal Art Society of New York]], the history of privately owned public space commenced in 1961 when New York City introduced an incentive zoning mechanism offering developers the right to build 10 square feet of bonus rentable or sellable floor area in return for one square foot of plaza, and three square feet of bonus floor area in return for one square foot of arcade.&lt;ref&gt;Kayden, Jerold S., The New York City Department of City Planning, and The Municipal Art Society of New York. ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience''. New York: Wiley, 2000.   {{ISBN|978-0471362579}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 2000, 503 privately owned public spaces, scattered almost entirely in downtown, midtown, and upper east and west sides of New York City's borough of [[Manhattan]], were constructed at 320 buildings.  More spaces have been added since then.  The book cited the quantitative success of the program's public space production but reported that 41% of these spaces were of "marginal" quality and roughly 50% of buildings had one or more spaces apparently out of compliance with applicable legal requirements resulting in [[privatization]].

While "privately owned public space" as a term of art refers specifically to private property required to be usable by the public under zoning or similar regulatory arrangements, the phrase in its broadest sense can refer to places, like shopping malls and hotel lobbies, that are privately owned and open to the public, even if they are not legally required to be open to the public.

Most scientists agree that [[religiosity]] is not an independent personality trait, but something that can have the effect of personality traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael C|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=9780123741295|location=Oxford, UK|pages=260–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing religiosity through the lenses of differing personality characteristics provides a relatively empirical way to study a difficult concept. Over time, the act of being religious has been a consistent behavior across almost every culture, and thus provides evidence that our personality can help explain the seeming predisposition of religious people.

With the ability to use modern, empirically tested personality measures, researchers can link results with religiosity. In linking personality measures with religion, it is possible to quantitatively study results, which can provide insight into how and why religion is such an important element of being human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion, Personality, and Social Behavior|year=2014|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|url=http://www.psypress.com/books/details/9781848726659/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more research is needed to definitively say that there is a correlation between certain personality characteristics and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by [[Raymond F. Paloutzian]], Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality |year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=253-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five-factor model of personality==
The [[five-factor model]] of personality is currently accepted as a comprehensive model of personality.&lt;ref name=Digman&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Digman | first1 = J.M. | year = 1990 | title = Personality structure: Emergence of the five-factor model | url = |journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 417–440 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.002221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-factor model (FFM) identifies five broad traits underlying the many narrower traits that can be used to describe personality.  The identified traits are: 1) extraversion, the quantity and intensity of one's interpersonal interactions 2) neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and hostility 3) conscientiousness, the persistence, organization, and motivation exhibited in goal-directed behaviors 4) agreeableness, the quality of one's interpersonal interactions along a continuum from compassion to antagonism 5) openness, the proactive seeking and appreciation of new experiences. The idea behind the big five personality characteristics that makes them compatible to religious study is that each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The personality puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393933482|pages=243–244|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In having the ability to separate each essential trait from the other, it is possible to study each personality characteristic and how it relates to religiosity.

The idea of studying the [[psychology of religion]] through a personality lens is not a new idea, however.  There has been research to both support and refute the ability of personality traits to explain religious or spiritual involvement. Research using [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]]'s model has found that religiosity in general is associated with low openness to experience, as well as low [[psychoticism]],&lt;ref name="psychology of religion"&gt;{{cite journal|first= Robert A.|last=Emmons|author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The Psychology of Religion|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2003|volume=54|pages=377–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024|pmid=12171998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factor associated inversely with agreeableness and conscientiousness.&lt;ref name=Saroglou/&gt; A review of studies examined the relations between the FFM and measures of religiosity, spiritual maturity, religious fundamentalism, and extrinsic religion. General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the big five traits.&lt;ref name=Saroglou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion and the five-factors of personality: A meta-analytic review.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2002|pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a weak positive association with extraversion, and a very small but significant relationship with low openness to experience. This same study also found that the two different concepts of religiosity and spirituality both involve an overall compassionate attitude towards others and positively correlates with agreeableness. Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and with low neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher agreeableness, and lower neuroticism and lower openness to experience. Because of these factors, it was also seen that more religious people seem to be altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael|publisher=Nikki Levy|year=2018|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|location=125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AS, United Kingdom|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. All of these relationships between personality and religion were small. This finding does not necessarily support the concept of personality for being the specific reason for religiosity, however this correlation with the FFM can lead to more in depth research on the topic.

===Strengths and weaknesses===
As previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is the how empirically tested, and accurate the measure actually is in accordance to personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=P|last2=McCrae|title=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|journal=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strength is that the big five is an excellent starting point for beginning to look at links between personality and religiosity because it is simply laid out. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters.  For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piedmont|first=R|title=Strategies for using the five factor model of personality in religious research|journal=Journal of Psychology and Theology|volume=27|pages=338–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more advances in research using the FFM to study religiosity and spirituality come, there will be a clearer cut answer as to whether there is a significant place for the FFM in studying religious behavior.

==Attachment theory==
[[Attachment Theory]] is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality.  The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and depending on the type of attachment, personality and future relationships will be influenced accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and loss: Separation, anxiety and anger|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind how the theory relates to the psychology of religion is that these future relationships can be with the particular god, or higher power.

In attachment theory, there have been three attachment styles identified: 1)secure style- confidence in the availability of attachment figures during times of need 2)avoidant style- insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs 3) anxious-ambivalent style- view of others as being reluctant to get close to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research varies in explaining which type of attachment style yields the individual's particular relationship with God.  For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents will translate into a secure attachment to God, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=L|title=God as a substitute attachment figure: a longitudinal study of adult attachment style and religious change in college students.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|pages=961–973|doi=10.1177/0146167298249004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research has showed that there is a compensatory effect, or the need of people to make up for something that is lacking.  For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1572309229|pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
The idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study.  The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed.  There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results.  The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.

==Object relations theory==
[[Object relations theory]]'s roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects).  The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kernberg|first=O|title=Structural derivatives of object relationships|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|pages=236–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals.  In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply.  One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.

In this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rizzuto|first=A|title=The birth of the living god|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
An important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical.  This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=S |author2=Wood, J |author3=Garb, H|title=The scientific status of projective tests|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|year=2000|doi= 10.1111/1529-1006.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject.  That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study.  By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.

== Religious struggles and personality ==
Research has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on [[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five Factors of Personality]], as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;http://sites.nd.edu/lapseylab/files/2016/08/Grubbs_etal_SelfStruggleAndSoul_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119916300013?via%3Dihub|title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11166-013-9174-8|title=Risk aversion and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and life satisfaction ==
Research done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Individual Differences in Personality|last1=Ashton|first1=Michael C|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|edition=Third|pages=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Marta|last2=Hayward|first2=R. David|date=October 1, 2009|title=Relgion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: The Role of Government Regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/70/3/285/1652126|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=285–310|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself. More research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==
The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the "judging" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/573-the-personality-types-of-christians-and-atheists&lt;/ref&gt;  ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1957.tb00074.x|title=EVIDENCE BEARING ON USE OF THE MYERS‐BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR TO SELECT PERSONS FOR ADVANCED RELIGIOUS TRAINING: A PRELIMINARY REPORT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, although popular, is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=David|title=Measuring the MBTI... And Coming Up Short|journal=Journal of Career Planning &amp; Placement|issue=Fall 1993|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religiosity and paranormal beliefs ==
Most religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits.

== Religion as a personality characteristic ==
While there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example,  has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|date=September 2, 2011|title=Believing, Bonding, Behaving, and Belonging - The Big Four Religious Dimensions and Cultural Variation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022111412267|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=42|pages=1320–1340|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ResearchChannel''' was an [[educational television]] network based at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and operated by a [[consortium]] of leading [[research]] and [[academia|academic]] institutions which contributed science-related programming to viewers in the United States and in other countries via [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]].

The University of Washington subsidized the operation of ResearchChannel since its founding, without direct compensation from the ResearchChannel consortium. This included providing all staff time and efforts, satellite uplink, and commodity internet bandwidth.

In March 2010, citing budget issues, the University of Washington informed the ResearchChannel Board that UW would end this subsidy; and cease programming and uplinking the channel and maintaining the website. The Research Channel board was unable to find a new sponsor and service provider. At midnight on August 31, 2010, ResearchChannel was shut down on [[Galaxy 18]], along with its broadcast on [[Dish Network]], [[Comcast]], and other terrestrial broadcasting services.

It is located in the small town of [[Shirahama, Wakayama|Shirahama]] in [[Wakayama Prefecture]] about 230&amp;nbsp;km from Kyoto. Established in 1922, research at the lab has historically been focused on marine invertebrates. A small island, Hatakejima, belongs to the laboratory and serves as an experimental field site in southeastern Tanabe Bay. The Shirahama Aquarium, open to the public, is located next to the research laboratories and operated by SMBL. In 2003, Kyoto University combined SMBL with the Maizuru Fisheries Research Station, University Forests, and the Subtropical Plant Institute into an administrative unit named the Field Science Education and Research Center (FSERC). The scientific journal ''Publications of the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory'' has been published by SMBL since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seto.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e-enkaku.html Seto marine biological laboratory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206000601/http://www.seto.kyoto-u.ac.jp/e-enkaku.html |date=2015-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheldon Lee Gosline'' is an [[United States|American]] [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who has extensively studied the ancient civilizations of the Far East. He is noted for proposing the existence of a developing literate civilization in southern China dating to the second millennium BCE.

==Biography==
Sheldon Lee Gosline began his professional education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a B.A. degrees in Oriental Studies and Art History in 1985. He later continued his studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he received a B.A. degree 1988 and was awarded an M.A. degree in Oriental Studies in 1993.
He interrupted his stay at Cambridge to study at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an M.A. degree in Egyptology and Near Eastern Archaeology in 1992.
After Cambridge he studied at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. He received his Ph.D. in 2013 from [[University College London]], where he researched at the [[Wellcome Trust]] Centre for the History of Medicine and the [[UCL Centre for the History of Medicine]]. His thesis concerned the intersection of business and medicine.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;[https://www.explorers.org/events/detail/nyc_public_lecture_series_feat_sheldon_gosline ''The Explorers Club''], NYC Public Lecture Series Featuring Sheldon Gosline (8 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gosline is owner of Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts based in Warren Center, PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts|url=http://shangri-la.0catch.com/|publisher=Shangri-La|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.shangri-la.0catch.com|url=http://www.roadurls.com/www.shangri-la.0catch.com|website=Road Url|publisher=Road Url|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline has taught at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and at UW-Madison. He was at Northeast Normal University through 2004.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; 
In 2011, he moved to London to pursue a Ph.D. in the history of medicine, at [[University College London]]. Once he completed the degree, he returned to China to research the writing of the country’s minority groups.  He was first a visiting professor at [[Minzu University of China]] and [[Tsinghua University]], both in Beijing.  Since 2015, he has taught medical humanities at [[Peking University]]. He is a member of several professional associations.

He states that he has become proficient in or conversant with nine contemporary or ancient languages.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://shangri-la.0catch.com/press/vitae.html] ''Vitae of Prof. Sheldon Lee Gosline'' (shangri-la website; accessed 21 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost civilization theory==
IN 2013 Gosline was shown some inscriptions found in [[Guangxi]] province and considered that several were based on the [[Indus script]] and Persian cuneiform. On a field trip to the area where they were found in 2014 he discovered what he considered evidence of further inscriptions made up of large rocks regularly spaced and what he called “a man-made platform of megalithic construction" and something that “appeared to be a carved chair or throne.”   Sitting on it he “sensed a harmony and that I was in the midst of an ancient time calculating device".&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt; He returned to what he called an "observatory complex" with caver including royal burials in June 2014 with a group of researchers who examined the site and stated that “We confirmed most of the things I’d found as potential alignments, and we confirmed that there was artifact evidence in the area that showed human occupation.” He reported this in a talk to the New York Explorers Club later that year, saying that he believed he had found an unknown civilization. 

Reports from Chinese researchers who accompanied him were less positive. Dr. Ye Xiaohong reported that "Two suspected cave tombs are not man-made," "No artificial traces were found on the huge stone in the suspected artificial remains, neither the suspected structures for observation nor the suspected ancient topographic maps" and that what Gosline had interpreted as ancient writing on some rocks "were certainly produced by natural force".&lt;ref name="Ye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ye|first1=Xiaohong|title=Preliminary Observation and Cognition at Gansang|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0714/46829.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese researchers also surveyed the alignments that Gosline thought related to the chair (which they agreed was a natural water-created formation) and concluded that the stone could not have been used as part of an observatory. &lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Fengxian|title=A Survey of Gansang site and Further Discussion|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46710.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Chinese researcher who was part of Gosline's group stated that "Gosline proclaimed that he had found several megalithic sites including observatories, palaces, and ancient cave tombs，petro-glyphs and even plan maps at Gansang, Nadou, and Bupeng in Pingguo county, Guangxi".  The conclusion was that "We have not found any artificial remains, artifacts, and occupation layer both at Nadou and Bupeng sites" and that most of the "scratches, the petro-glyphs and plan maps on the rocks called by Gosline, are natural" with a few that might be artificial and needed microscopic examination. However they did believe that the "Gansang site might have worked as an important settlement in Youjiang River Reach." Commenting on the engraved stones reported by Gosline, they commented that they seemed too new, that they were too intact with "the whole texts just fit to the sizes of the planks", that they lacked an archaeological context and that there were too few repetitions of characters.&lt;ref name="Nu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nu|first1=He|title=Thinking about the Sites in Pingguo county, S China|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46706.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline’s observation that the newly discovered inscriptions seemed to include Persian cuneiform is unproven as of 2016.&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-a-coded-message-lead-an-american-to-a-lost-civilization-in-china?ct=t(Newsletter_4_21_20164_20_2016)&amp;mc_cid=5e86c4b93a&amp;mc_eid=34be11d5e3] Did A Coded Message Lead an American to a Lost Civilization in

[[Image:Snow-cholera-map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map by Dr. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] of [[London]], showing [[cluster (epidemiology)|cluster]]s of cholera cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. This was one of the first uses of map-based spatial analysis.]] '''Spatial analysis''' or '''spatial statistics''' includes any of the formal [[Scientific technique|techniques]]  which study entities using their [[topological]], [[geometric]], or [[geographic]] properties. Spatial analysis includes a variety of techniques, many still in their early development, using different analytic approaches and applied in fields as diverse as [[astronomy]], with its studies of the placement of galaxies in the [[cosmos]], to chip fabrication engineering, with its use of "place and route" [[algorithm]]s to build complex wiring structures. In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of [[geographic data]].

Complex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied.

Classification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take.

== History of spatial analysis ==
Spatial analysis can perhaps be considered{{according to|date=February 2018}} to have arisen with early attempts at [[cartography]] and [[surveying]] but many fields have contributed to its rise in modern form. [[Biology]] contributed through [[botany|botanical]] studies of global plant distributions and local plant locations, [[ethology|ethological]] studies of animal movement, [[landscape ecology|landscape ecological]] studies of vegetation blocks, [[ecology|ecological]] studies of spatial population dynamics, and the study of [[biogeography]]. [[Epidemiology]] contributed with early work on disease mapping, notably [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s work of mapping an outbreak of cholera, with research on mapping the spread of disease and with location studies for health care delivery. [[Statistics]] has contributed greatly through work in spatial statistics. [[Economics]] has contributed notably through [[spatial econometrics]]. [[Geographic information system]] is currently a major contributor due to the importance of geographic software in the modern analytic toolbox. [[Remote sensing]] has contributed extensively in morphometric and clustering analysis. [[Computer science]] has contributed extensively through the study of algorithms, notably in [[computational geometry]]. [[Mathematics]] continues to provide the fundamental tools for analysis and to reveal the complexity of the spatial realm, for example, with recent work on [[fractals]] and [[scale invariance]]. [[Scientific modelling]] provides a useful framework for new approaches.

== Fundamental issues in spatial analysis ==
Spatial analysis confronts many fundamental issues in the definition of its objects of study, in the construction of the analytic operations to be used, in the use of computers for analysis, in the limitations and particularities of the analyses which are known, and in the presentation of analytic results. Many of these issues are active subjects of modern research.

Common errors often arise in spatial analysis, some due to the mathematics of space, some due to the particular ways data are presented spatially, some due to the tools which are available. Census data, because it protects individual privacy by aggregating data into local units, raises a number of statistical issues. The fractal nature of coastline makes precise measurements of its length difficult if not impossible. A computer software fitting straight lines to the curve of a coastline, can easily calculate the lengths of the lines which it defines. However these straight lines may have no inherent meaning in the real world, as was shown for the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]].

These problems represent a challenge in spatial analysis because of the power of maps as media of presentation. When results are presented as maps, the presentation combines spatial data which are generally accurate with analytic results which may be inaccurate, leading to an impression that analytic results are more accurate than the data would indicate.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Monmonier ''How to Lie with Maps'' University of Chicago Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial characterization ===
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|240px|Spread of bubonic plague in medieval Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The colors indicate the spatial distribution of plague outbreaks over time.]]The definition of the spatial presence of an entity constrains the possible analysis which can be applied to that entity and influences the final conclusions that can be reached. While this property is fundamentally true of all [[analysis]], it is particularly important in spatial analysis because the tools to define and study entities favor specific characterizations of the entities being studied. Statistical techniques favor the spatial definition of objects as points because there are very few statistical techniques which operate directly on line, area, or volume elements. Computer tools favor the spatial definition of objects as homogeneous and separate elements because of the limited number of [[database]] elements and computational structures available, and the ease with which these primitive structures can be created.

=== Spatial dependency or auto-correlation ===
{{see also|Spatial association}}
Spatial dependency is the co-variation of properties within geographic space: characteristics at proximal locations appear to be correlated, either positively or negatively. Spatial dependency leads to the spatial [[autocorrelation]] problem in statistics since, like temporal autocorrelation, this violates standard statistical techniques that assume independence among observations. For example, [[Regression analysis|regression]] analyses that do not compensate for spatial dependency can have unstable parameter estimates and yield unreliable significance tests. Spatial regression models (see below) capture these relationships and do not suffer from these weaknesses. It is also appropriate to view spatial dependency as a source of information rather than something to be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knegt | first1 = De | last2 = Coughenour | first2 = M.B. | last3 = Skidmore | first3 = A.K. | last4 = Heitkönig | first4 = I.M.A. | last5 = Knox | first5 = N.M. | last6 = Slotow | first6 = R. | last7 = Prins | first7 = H.H.T. | year = 2010 | title = Spatial autocorrelation and the scaling of species–environment relationships | journal = Ecology | volume = 91 | issue = 8| pages = 2455–2465 | doi = 10.1890/09-1359.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locational effects also manifest as spatial [[heterogeneity]], or the apparent variation in a process with respect to location in geographic space. Unless a space is uniform and boundless, every location will have some degree of uniqueness relative to the other locations. This affects the spatial dependency relations and therefore the spatial process. Spatial heterogeneity means that overall parameters estimated for the entire system may not adequately describe the process at any given location.

=== Scaling ===
Spatial [[measurement]] scale is a persistent issue in spatial analysis; more detail is available at the [[modifiable areal unit problem]] (MAUP) topic entry. Landscape ecologists developed a series of [[scale invariant]] metrics for aspects of ecology that are [[fractal]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=J. M.|last2=Hartley|first2=S.|last3=Kallimanis|first3=A. S.|last4=Kunin|first4=W. E.|last5=Lennon|first5=J. J.|last6=Sgardelis|first6=S. P.|date=2004-03-01|title=Uses and abuses of fractal methodology in ecology|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=254–271|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00568.x|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more general terms, no scale independent method of [[analysis]] is widely agreed upon for spatial statistics.

=== Sampling ===
Spatial [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] involves determining a limited number of locations in geographic space for faithfully measuring phenomena that are subject to dependency and heterogeneity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Dependency suggests that since one location can predict the value of another location, we do not need observations in both places.  But heterogeneity suggests that this relation can change across space, and therefore we cannot trust an observed degree of dependency beyond a region that may be small.  Basic spatial sampling schemes include random, clustered and systematic. These basic schemes can be applied at multiple levels in a designated spatial hierarchy (e.g., urban area, city, neighborhood). It is also possible to exploit ancillary data, for example, using property values as a guide in a spatial sampling scheme to measure educational attainment and income.  Spatial models such as autocorrelation statistics, regression and interpolation (see below) can also dictate sample design.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Common errors in spatial analysis ===
The fundamental issues in spatial analysis lead to numerous problems in analysis including bias, distortion and outright errors in the conclusions reached. These issues are often interlinked but various attempts have been made to separate out particular issues from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ocaña-Riola | first1 = R | year = 2010 | title = Common errors in disease mapping | journal = Geospatial Health | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 139–154 | pmid = 20503184 | doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Length ====
In a paper by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] on the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]] it was shown that it is inherently nonsensical to discuss certain spatial concepts despite an inherent presumption of the validity of the concept. Lengths in ecology depend directly on the scale at which they are measured and experienced. So while surveyors commonly measure the length of a river, this length only has meaning in the context of the relevance of the measuring technique to the question under study.

Image:britain-fractal-coastline-50km.png|Britain measured using a short yardstick
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Locational fallacy ====
The locational fallacy refers to error due to the particular spatial characterization chosen for the elements of study, in particular choice of placement for the spatial presence of the element.

Spatial characterizations may be simplistic or even wrong. Studies of humans often reduce the spatial existence of humans to a single point, for instance their home address. This can easily lead to poor analysis, for example, when considering disease transmission which can happen at work or at school and therefore far from the home.

The spatial characterization may implicitly limit the subject of study. For example, the spatial analysis of crime data has recently become popular but these studies can only describe the particular kinds of crime which can be described spatially. This leads to many maps of assault but not to any maps of embezzlement with political consequences in the conceptualization of crime and the design of policies to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Spatial Fallacies|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/sgam/node/214|website=The Learner's Guide to Geospatial Analysis|publisher=Penn State Department of Geography|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Atomic fallacy ====
This describes errors due to treating elements as separate 'atoms' outside of their spatial context. The fallacy is about transferring individual conclusions to spatial units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Integrating scale in remote sensing and GIS |last=Quattrochi |first=Dale A |isbn=9781482218268|oclc=973767077|date=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ecological fallacy ====
The [[ecological fallacy]] describes errors due to performing analyses on aggregate data when trying to reach conclusions on the individual units. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Errors occur in part from spatial aggregation.  For example, a [[pixel]] represents the average surface temperatures within an area.  Ecological fallacy would be to assume that all points within the area have the same temperature. This topic is closely related to the [[modifiable areal unit problem]].

=== Solutions to the fundamental issues ===

==== Geographic space ====
[[File:Manhattan distance.svg|thumb|200px|Manhattan distance versus Euclidean distance: The red, blue, and yellow lines have the same length (12) in both Euclidean and taxicab geometry. In Euclidean geometry, the green line has length 6×{{radic|2}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;8.48, and is the unique shortest path. In taxicab geometry, the green line's length is still 12, making it no shorter than any other path shown.]]A mathematical space exists whenever we have a set of observations and quantitative measures of their attributes. For example, we can represent individuals' incomes or years of education within a coordinate system where the location of each individual can be specified with respect to both dimensions. The distance between individuals within this space is a quantitative measure of their differences with respect to income and education. However, in spatial analysis, we are concerned with specific types of mathematical spaces, namely, geographic space. In geographic space, the observations correspond to locations in a spatial measurement framework that capture their proximity in the real world. The locations in a spatial measurement framework often represent locations on the surface of the Earth, but this is not strictly necessary. A spatial measurement framework can also capture proximity with respect to, say, interstellar space or within a biological entity such as a liver. The fundamental tenet is [[Tobler's first law of geography|Tobler's First Law of Geography]]: if the interrelation between entities increases with proximity in the real world, then representation in geographic space and assessment using spatial analysis techniques are appropriate.

The [[Euclidean distance]] between locations often represents their proximity, although this is only one possibility. There are an infinite number of distances in addition to Euclidean that can support quantitative analysis. For example, "Manhattan" (or "[[Taxicab geometry|Taxicab]]") distances where movement is restricted to paths parallel to the axes can be more meaningful than Euclidean distances in urban settings. In addition to distances, other geographic relationships such as connectivity''' (e.g., the existence or degree of shared borders) and direction''' can also influence the relationships among entities. It is also possible to compute minimal cost paths across a cost surface; for example, this can represent proximity among locations when travel must occur across rugged terrain.

== Types of spatial analysis ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Spatial data comes in many varieties and it is not easy to
 arrive at a system of classification that is simultaneously
 exclusive, exhaustive, imaginative, and satisfying.
                             -- G. Upton &amp; B. Fingelton&lt;ref name="Upton+:1985"&gt;Graham J. Upton &amp; Bernard Fingelton: '''Spatial Data Analysis by Example Volume 1: Point Pattern and Quantitative Data''' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Spatial data analysis ===
Urban and Regional Studies deal with large tables of spatial data obtained from censuses and surveys. It is necessary to simplify the huge amount of detailed information in order to extract the main trends. Multivariable analysis (or [[Factor analysis]], FA) allows a change of variables, transforming the many variables of the census, usually correlated between themselves, into fewer independent "Factors" or "Principal Components" which are, actually, the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of the data correlation matrix weighted by the inverse of their eigenvalues. This change of variables has two main advantages:
# Since information is concentrated on the first new factors, it is possible to keep only a few of them while losing only a small amount of information; mapping them produces fewer and more significant maps 
# The factors, actually the eigenvectors, are orthogonal by construction, i.e. not correlated. In most cases, the dominant factor (with the largest eigenvalue) is the Social Component, separating rich and poor in the city. Since factors are not-correlated, other smaller processes than social status, which would have remained hidden otherwise, appear on the second, third, … factors.

Factor analysis depends on measuring distances between observations : the choice of a significant metric is crucial. The Euclidean metric (Principal Component Analysis), the Chi-Square distance (Correspondence Analysis) or the Generalized Mahalanobis distance (Discriminant Analysis ) are among the more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;Harman H H (1960) ''Modern Factor Analysis'', University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; More complicated models, using communalities or rotations have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel R J (1970) ''Applied Factor Analysis''. Evanston, ILL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using multivariate methods in spatial analysis began really in the 1950s (although some examples go back to the beginning of the century) and culminated in the 1970s, with the increasing power and accessibility of computers. Already in 1948, in a seminal publication, two sociologists, Bell and Shevky,&lt;ref&gt;Bell W &amp; E Shevky (1955) ''Social Area Analysis'', Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that most city populations in the USA and in the world could be represented with three independent factors : 1- the « socio-economic status » opposing rich and poor districts and distributed in sectors running along highways from the city center, 2- the « life cycle », i.e. the age structure of households, distributed in concentric circles, and 3-  « race and ethnicity », identifying patches of migrants located within the city. In 1961, in a groundbreaking study, British geographers used FA to classify British towns.&lt;ref&gt;Moser C A &amp; W Scott (1961) ''British Towns ; A Statistical Study of their Social and Economic Differences'', Oliver &amp; Boyd, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian J Berry, at the University of Chicago, and his students made a wide use of the method,&lt;ref&gt;Berry B J &amp; F Horton (1971) ''Geographic Perspectives on Urban Systems'', John Wiley, N-Y.&lt;/ref&gt; applying it to most important cities in the world and exhibiting common social structures.&lt;ref&gt;Berry B J &amp; K B Smith eds (1972) ''City Classification Handbook : Methods and Applications'', John Wiley, N-Y.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The use of Factor Analysis in Geography, made so easy by modern computers, has been very wide but not always very wise.&lt;ref&gt;Ciceri M-F (1974) ''Méthodes d’analyse multivariée dans la géographie anglo-saxonne'', Université de Paris-1 ; free download on http://www-ohp.univ-paris1.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the vectors extracted are determined by the data matrix, it is not possible to compare factors obtained from different censuses. A solution consists in fusing together several census matrices in a unique table which, then, may be analyzed. This, however, assumes that the definition of the variables has not changed over time and produces very large tables, difficult to manage. A better solution, proposed by psychometricians,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker L R (1964) « The extension of Factor Analysis to three-dimensional matrices », in  Frederiksen N &amp; H Gulliksen eds, ''Contributions to Mathematical Psychology'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; groups the data in a « cubic matrix », with three entries (for instance, locations, variables, time periods). A Three-Way Factor Analysis produces then three groups of factors related by a small cubic « core matrix ».&lt;ref&gt;R. Coppi &amp; S. Bolasco, eds. (1989), ''Multiway data analysis'', Elsevier, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; This method, which exhibits data evolution over time, has not been widely used in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cant | first1 = R.G. | year = 1971 | title =  Changes in the location of manufacturing in New Zealand 1957-1968: An application of three-mode factor analysis | journal = New Zealand Geographer | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 38–55 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.1971.tb00636.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles,&lt;ref&gt;Marchand B (1986) ''The Emergence of Los Angeles, 1940-1970'', Pion Ltd, London&lt;/ref&gt; however, it has exhibited the role, traditionally ignored, of Downtown as an organizing center for the whole city during several decades.

=== Spatial autocorrelation ===
Spatial [[autocorrelation]] statistics measure and analyze the degree of dependency among observations in a geographic space.  Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics include [[Moran's I|Moran's &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;]], [[Geary's C|Geary's &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;]], [[Getis's G|Getis's]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the [[standard deviational ellipse]]. These statistics require measuring a spatial weights matrix that reflects the intensity of the geographic relationship between observations in a neighborhood, e.g., the distances between neighbors, the lengths of shared border, or whether they fall into a specified directional class such as "west". Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics compare the spatial weights to the covariance relationship at pairs of locations. Spatial autocorrelation that is more positive than expected from random indicate the clustering of similar values across geographic space, while significant negative spatial autocorrelation indicates that neighboring values are more dissimilar than expected by chance, suggesting a spatial pattern similar to a chess board.

Spatial autocorrelation statistics such as Moran's &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and Geary's &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are global in the sense that they estimate the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset.  The possibility of spatial heterogeneity suggests that the estimated degree of autocorrelation may vary significantly across geographic space. '''Local spatial autocorrelation statistics''' provide estimates disaggregated to the level of the spatial analysis units, allowing assessment of the dependency relationships across space. &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; statistics compare neighborhoods to a global average and identify local regions of strong autocorrelation.  Local versions of the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; statistics are also available.

=== Spatial stratified heterogeneity ===
Spatial stratified heterogeneity, referring to the within-strata variance less than the between strata-variance, is ubiquitous in ecological phenomena, such as ecological zones and many ecological variables.  Spatial stratified heterogeneity of an attribute can be measured by geographical detector ''q''-statistic:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = JF | last2 = Zhang | first2 = TL | last3 = Fu | first3 = BJ | year = 2016 | title = A measure of spatial stratified heterogeneity | journal = Ecological Indicators | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 250–256 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.02.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
                              &lt;math&gt; q = 1 - \frac{1}{N\sigma^2}\sum_{h=1}^LN_h\sigma_h^2  &lt;/math&gt;
where a population is partitioned into ''h'' = 1, ..., ''L'' strata; ''N'' stands for the size of the population, σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; stands for variance of the attribute. The value of ''q'' is within [0, 1], 0 indicates no spatial stratified heterogeneity, 1 indicates perfect spatial stratified heterogeneity.The value of ''q'' indicates the percent of the variance of an attribute explained by the stratification.The ''q'' follows a noncentral ''F'' probability density function.

[[File:Q-fig2.jpg|frame|center|A hand map with different spatial patterns.

=== Spatial interpolation ===
[[Spatial interpolation]] methods estimate the variables at unobserved locations in geographic space based on the values at observed locations.  Basic methods include [[inverse distance weighting]]: this attenuates the variable with decreasing proximity from the observed location.  [[Kriging]] is a more sophisticated method that interpolates across space according to a spatial lag relationship that has both systematic and random components.  This can accommodate a wide range of spatial relationships for the hidden values between observed locations.  Kriging provides optimal estimates given the hypothesized lag relationship, and error estimates can be mapped to determine if spatial patterns exist.

=== Spatial regression ===
{{See also|Local regression|Regression-Kriging}}

Spatial regression methods capture spatial dependency in [[regression analysis]], avoiding statistical problems such as unstable parameters and unreliable significance tests, as well as providing information on spatial relationships among the variables involved.  The estimated spatial relationships can be used on spatial and spatio-temporal predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Yong Ge|title=Spatial distribution estimation of malaria in northern China and its scenarios in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050|journal=Malaria Journal|volume=15|issue=1|pages=345|doi=10.1186/s12936-016-1395-2|pmid=27387921|pmc=4936159|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the specific technique, spatial dependency can enter the regression model as relationships between the independent variables and the dependent, between the dependent variables and a spatial lag of itself, or in the error terms.  '''Geographically weighted regression''' (GWR) is a local version of spatial regression that generates parameters disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis.&lt;ref name="Fotheringham1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotheringham | first1 = A.

Spatial stochastic processes, such as [[Gaussian processes]] are also increasingly being deployed in spatial regression analysis. Model-based versions of GWR, known as spatially varying coefficient models have been applied to conduct Bayesian inference.&lt;ref name="Banerjee2014"/&gt; Spatial stochastic process can become computationally effective and scalable Gaussian process models, such as Gaussian Predictive Processes&lt;ref name="Banerjee2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banerjee | first1 = Sudipto | last2 = Gelfand | first2 = Alan E. | last3 = Finley | first3 = Andrew O. | last4 = Sang | first4 = Huiyan | year = 2008 | title = Gaussian predictive process models for large spatial datasets | journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B | volume = 70 | issue = 4| pages = 825–848 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00663.x| pmid = 19750209 | pmc = 2741335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP).&lt;ref name="Banerjee2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Datta | first1 = Abhirup | last2 = Banerjee | first2 = Sudipto | last4 = Gelfand | first4 = Alan E. | last3 = Finley | first3 = Andrew O. | year = 2016 | title = Hierarchical Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process Models for Large Geostatistical Datasets | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 111| issue = 514| pages =  800–812| doi = 10.1080/01621459.2015.1044091| pmid = 29720777 | pmc = 5927603 | arxiv = 1406.7343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatial interaction ===
Spatial interaction or "[[gravity model]]s" estimate the flow of people, material or information between locations in geographic space.  Factors can include origin propulsive variables such as the number of commuters in residential areas, destination attractiveness variables such as the amount of office space in employment areas, and proximity relationships between the locations measured in terms such as driving distance or travel time.  In addition, the topological, or [[Geospatial topology|connective]], relationships between areas must be identified, particularly considering the often conflicting relationship between distance and topology; for example, two spatially close neighborhoods may not display any significant interaction if they are separated by a highway. After specifying the functional forms of these relationships, the analyst can estimate model parameters using observed flow data and standard estimation techniques such as ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood. Competing destinations versions of spatial interaction models include the proximity among the destinations (or origins) in addition to the origin-destination proximity; this captures the effects of destination (origin) clustering on flows. Computational methods such as [[artificial neural networks]] can also estimate spatial interaction relationships among locations and can handle noisy and qualitative data.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Simulation and modeling ===
Spatial interaction models are aggregate and top-down: they specify an overall governing relationship for flow between locations.  This characteristic is also shared by urban models such as those based on mathematical programming, flows among economic sectors, or bid-rent theory.  An alternative modeling perspective is to represent the system at the highest possible level of disaggregation and study the bottom-up emergence of complex patterns and relationships from behavior and interactions at the individual level. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[Complex adaptive systems]] theory as applied to spatial analysis suggests that simple interactions among proximal entities can lead to intricate, persistent and functional spatial entities at aggregate levels.  Two fundamentally spatial simulation methods are cellular automata and agent-based modeling. [[Cellular automata]] modeling imposes a fixed spatial framework such as grid cells and specifies rules that dictate the state of a cell based on the states of its neighboring cells.  As time progresses, spatial patterns emerge as cells change states based on their neighbors; this alters the conditions for future time periods.  For example, cells can represent locations in an urban area and their states can be different types of land use.  Patterns that can emerge from the simple interactions of local land uses include office districts and urban sprawl. [[Agent-based model]]ing uses software entities (agents) that have purposeful behavior (goals) and can react, interact and modify their environment while seeking their objectives.  Unlike the cells in cellular automata, simulysts can allow agents to be mobile with respect to space.  For example, one could model traffic flow and dynamics using agents representing individual vehicles that try to minimize travel time between specified origins and destinations.  While pursuing minimal travel times, the agents must avoid collisions with other vehicles also seeking to minimize their travel times.  Cellular automata and agent-based modeling are complementary modeling strategies.  They can be integrated into a common geographic automata system where some agents are fixed while others are mobile.

Calibration plays a pivotal role in both CA and ABM simulation and modelling approaches. Initial approaches to CA proposed robust calibration approaches based on stochastic, Monte Carlo methods.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=E. A.|last2=Clarke|first2=K.C.|title=Calibration of the SLEUTH urban growth model for Lisbon and Porto, Portugal|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|date=2002|volume=26|issue=6|pages=525–552|doi=10.1016/S0198-9715(01)00014-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silva_EPS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=E A|title=Complexity, emergence and cellular urban models: lessons learned from applying SLEUTH to two Portuguese metropolitan areas|journal=European Planning Studies|date=2003|volume=13|issue=1|pages=93–115|doi=10.1080/0965431042000312424}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABM approaches rely on agents' decision rules (in many cases extracted from qualitative research base methods such as questionnaires).&lt;ref name="silva3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu and Silva|title=Examining the dynamics of the interaction between the development of creative industries and urban spatial structure by agent-based modelling: A case study of Nanjing, China|journal=Urban Studies|date=2017|volume=65|issue=5|pages=113–125|doi=10.1177/0042098016686493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent Machine Learning Algorithms calibrate using training sets, for instance in order to understand the qualities of the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Lun|last2=Silva|first2=Elisabete A.|last3=Wu|first3=Chunyang|last4=Wang|first4=Hui|title=A machine learning-based method for the large-scale evaluation of the qualities of the urban environment|journal=Computers Environment and Urban Systems|date=2017|volume=65|pages=113–125|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.06.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) ===
Spatial analysis of a conceptual geological model is the main purpose of any MPS algorithm. The method analyzes the spatial statistics of the geological model, called the training image, and generates realizations of the phenomena that honor those input multiple-point statistics.

A recent MPS algorithm used to accomplish this task is the pattern-based method by Honarkhah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honarkhah | first1 = M | last2 = Caers | first2 = J | year = 2010 | title = Stochastic Simulation of Patterns Using Distance-Based Pattern Modeling | doi = 10.1007/s11004-010-9276-7 | journal = Mathematical Geosciences | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 487–517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, a distance-based approach is employed to analyze the patterns in the training image. This allows the reproduction of the multiple-point statistics, and the complex geometrical features of the training image. Each output of the MPS algorithm is a realization that represents a random field. Together, several realizations may be used to quantify spatial uncertainty.

One of the recent methods is presented by Tahmasebi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tahmasebi | first1 = P. | last2 = Hezarkhani | first2 = A. | last3 = Sahimi | first3 = M. | year = 2012 | title = Multiple-point geostatistical modeling based on the cross-correlation functions | journal = Computational Geosciences | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 779–79742 | doi=10.1007/s10596-012-9287-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a cross-correlation function to improve the spatial pattern reproduction. They call their MPS simulation method as the CCSIM algorithm. This method is able to quantify the spatial connectivity, variability and uncertainty. Furthermore, the method is not sensitive to any type of data and is able to simulate both categorical and continuous scenarios. CCSIM algorithm is able to be used for any stationary, non-stationary and multivariate systems and it can provide high quality visual appeal model.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tahmasebi |first=P. |last2=Sahimi |first2=M. |year=2015 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.91.032401 |pmid=25871117 |title=Reconstruction of nonstationary disordered materials and media: Watershed transform and cross-correlation function |journal=Physical Review E |volume=91 |issue=3|pages=032401 |bibcode=2015PhRvE..91c2401T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tahmasebi |first=P. |last2=Sahimi |first2=M. |year=2015 |title=Geostatistical Simulation and Reconstruction of Porous Media by a Cross-Correlation Function and Integration of Hard and Soft Data |doi=10.1007/s11242-015-0471-3 |journal=Transport in Porous Media |volume=107 |issue=3| pages=871–905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographical information system usage ===
[[Geographic information system]]s (GIS) — a large domain that provides a variety of capabilities designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data — utilizes geospatial analysis in a variety of contexts, operations and applications.

==== Basic applications ====
Geospatial analysis, using [[GIS]], was developed for problems in the environmental and life sciences, in particular [[ecology]], [[geology]] and [[epidemiology]]. It has extended to almost all industries including defense, intelligence, utilities, Natural Resources (i.e. Oil and Gas, Forestry ... etc.), social sciences, medicine and [[Public Safety]] (i.e. emergency management and criminology), disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM), and climate change adaptation (CCA). Spatial statistics typically result primarily from observation rather than experimentation.

==== Basic operations ====
Vector-based [[GIS]] is typically related to operations such as map overlay (combining two or more maps or map layers according to predefined rules), simple buffering (identifying regions of a map within a specified distance of one or more features, such as towns, roads or rivers) and similar basic operations. This reflects (and is reflected in) the use of the term spatial analysis within the Open Geospatial Consortium ([[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]) “simple feature specifications”. For raster-based GIS, widely used in the environmental sciences and remote sensing, this typically means a range of actions applied to the grid cells of one or more maps (or images) often involving filtering and/or algebraic operations (map algebra). These techniques involve processing one or more raster layers according to simple rules resulting in a new map layer, for example replacing each cell value with some combination of its neighbours’ values, or computing the sum or difference of specific attribute values for each grid cell in two matching raster datasets. Descriptive statistics, such as cell counts, means, variances, maxima, minima, cumulative values, frequencies and a number of other measures and distance computations are also often included in this generic term [[spatial analysis]]. Spatial analysis includes a large variety of statistical techniques (descriptive, [[Exploratory data analysis|exploratory]], and explanatory [[statistics]]) that apply to data that vary spatially and which can vary over time. Some more advanced statistical techniques include Getis-ord Gi* or Anselin Local Moran's I which are used to determine clustering patterns of spatially referenced data.

==== Advanced operations ====
Geospatial analysis goes beyond 2D and 3D mapping operations and spatial statistics. It includes: 
* Surface analysis — in particular analysing the properties of physical surfaces, such as [[gradient]], [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] and [[visibility]], and analysing surface-like data “fields”;
* Network analysis — examining the properties of natural and man-made networks in order to understand the behaviour of flows within and around such networks; and locational analysis. GIS-based network analysis may be used to address a wide range of practical problems such as route selection and facility location (core topics in the field of [[operations research]], and problems involving flows such as those found in [[hydrology]] and transportation research. In many instances location problems relate to networks and as such are addressed with tools designed for this purpose, but in others existing networks may have little or no relevance or may be impractical to incorporate within the modeling process. Problems that are not specifically network constrained, such as new road or pipeline routing, regional warehouse location, mobile phone mast positioning or the selection of rural community health care sites, may be effectively analysed (at least initially) without reference to existing physical networks. Locational analysis "in the plane" is also applicable where suitable network datasets are not available, or are too large or expensive to be utilised, or where the location algorithm is very complex or involves the examination or simulation of a very large number of alternative configurations.
* [[Geovisualization]] — the creation and manipulation of images, maps, diagrams, charts, 3D views and their associated tabular datasets. GIS packages increasingly provide a range of such tools, providing static or rotating views, draping images over 2.5D surface representations, providing animations and fly-throughs, dynamic linking and brushing and spatio-temporal visualisations. This latter class of tools is the least developed, reflecting in part the limited range of suitable compatible datasets and the limited set of analytical methods available, although this picture is changing rapidly. All these facilities augment the core tools utilised in spatial analysis throughout the analytical process (exploration of data, identification of patterns and relationships, construction of models, and communication of results)

==== Mobile Geospatial Computing ====
Traditionally geospatial computing has been performed primarily on personal computers (PCs) or servers. Due to the increasing capabilities of mobile devices, however, geospatial computing in mobile devices is a fast-growing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Ruizhi|last2=Guinness|first2=Robert E.|title=Geospatial Computing in Mobile Devices|date=2014|publisher=Artech House|location=Norwood, MA|isbn=978-1-60807-565-2|pages=228|edition=1st|url=http://www.artechhouse.com/International/Books/Geospatial-Computing-in-Mobile-Devices-2159.aspx|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portable nature of these devices, as well as the presence of useful sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and barometric pressure sensors, make them useful for capturing and processing geospatial information in the field. In addition to the local processing of geospatial information on mobile devices, another growing trend is cloud-based geospatial computing. In this architecture, data can be collected in the field using mobile devices and then transmitted to cloud-based servers for further processing and ultimate storage. In a similar manner, geospatial information can be made available to connected mobile devices via the cloud, allowing access to vast databases of geospatial information anywhere where a wireless data connection is available.

=== Geographic information science and spatial analysis ===
{{further information|Geographic information systems#Spatial analysis}}
'''[[Geographic information systems]]''' (GIS) and the underlying [[geographic information science]] that advances these technologies have a strong influence on spatial analysis.  The increasing ability to capture and handle geographic data means that spatial analysis is occurring within increasingly data-rich environments.  Geographic data capture systems include remotely sensed imagery, environmental monitoring systems such as intelligent transportation systems, and location-aware technologies such as mobile devices that can report location in near-real time.  GIS provide platforms for managing these data, computing spatial relationships such as distance, connectivity and directional relationships between spatial units, and visualizing both the raw data and spatial analytic results within a cartographic context.
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|300px|This flow map of Napoleon's ill-fated march on Moscow is an early and celebrated example of geovisualization. It shows the army's direction as it traveled, the places the troops passed through, the size of the army as troops died from hunger and wounds, and the freezing temperatures they experienced.]]

==== Content ====
*Spatial location: Transfer positioning information of space objects with the help of space coordinate system. Projection transformation theory is the foundation of spatial object representation.
*Spatial distribution: the similar spatial object groups positioning information, including distribution, trends, contrast etc..
*Spatial form: the geometric shape of the spatial objects
*Spatial space: the space objects' approaching degree

'''[[Geovisualization]]''' (GVis) combines scientific visualization with [[digital cartography]] to support the exploration and analysis of geographic data and information, including the results of spatial analysis or simulation. GVis leverages the human orientation towards visual information processing in the exploration, analysis and communication of geographic data and information.  In contrast with traditional cartography, GVis is typically three- or four-dimensional (the latter including time) and user-interactive.

'''Geographic knowledge discovery''' (GKD) is the human-centered process of applying efficient computational tools for exploring massive [[spatial database]]s. GKD includes geographic [[data mining]], but also encompasses related activities such as data selection, data cleaning and pre-processing, and interpretation of results. GVis can also serve a central role in the GKD process.  GKD is based on the premise that massive databases contain interesting (valid, novel, useful and understandable) patterns that standard analytical techniques cannot find.  GKD can serve as a hypothesis-generating process for spatial analysis, producing tentative patterns and relationships that should be confirmed using spatial analytical techniques.

'''[[Spatial decision support system]]s''' (SDSS) take existing spatial data and use a variety of mathematical models to make projections into the future. This allows urban and regional planners to test intervention decisions prior to implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Ainhoa|last2=Donnelly|first2=Alison|last3=Jones|first3=Mike|last4=Chrysoulakis|first4=Nektarios|last5=Lopes|first5=Myriam|year=2012|title=A decision-support system for sustainable urban metabolism in Europe|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2012.06.007|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|volume=38|pages=109–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steve William Fuller''' (born 12 July 1959) is an American philosopher-sociologist in the field of [[science and technology studies]].  He has published in the areas of [[social epistemology]], [[academic freedom]], and the subjects of [[intelligent design]] and [[transhumanism]].

==Biography==

Fuller attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=4 August 2014|last=Fuller|first=Steve |title=Science vs. Religion? Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution |page=9|url= https://books.google.com/?id=1P22AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 |date= 2007|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=9780745673493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admitted as a John Jay Scholar to [[Columbia University]], he majored in History and Sociology and graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1979. Awarded a [[Kellett Fellowship]], he studied at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], and received an M.Phil. in History and Philosophy of Science in 1981. He earned his Ph.D. in the same subject from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1985, where he was an Andrew Mellon Pre-Doctoral Fellow. Fuller's doctoral dissertation, "Bounded Rationality in Law and Science", explored the implications of the views of [[Herbert A. Simon]] for political theory and philosophy of science.

Fuller held assistant and associate professorships at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1994, he was appointed to the chair in sociology and social policy at the [[University of Durham]], [[England]]. He moved in 1999 to the [[University of Warwick]], England. In July 2007 Fuller was awarded a [[D. Litt.]] by Warwick in recognition of "published work or papers which demonstrate a high standard of important original work forming a major contribution to a subject".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/warwickpeople/higher_doctorates_for/  Higher Doctorates for Warwick People], [[University of Warwick]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Fuller served as President of the Sociology section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. In that capacity, he staged a play, "Lincoln and Darwin—Live for One Night Only!", at the BA's annual Festival of Science in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=403503 |title=On stage, On the Origin ... author endures a dramatic trial of faith |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was later produced as a podcast in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |title=Lincoln and Darwin for one night only |publisher=Sci Phi Journal |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215015/http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller has been a visiting professor in Denmark, Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden (where he held a Fulbright Professorship in 1995 at Gothenburg University), and the United States (UCLA).&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/staff/academicstaff/sfuller/fullers_index/cv/ |title=curriculum vitae |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022061915/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/staff/academicstaff/sfuller/fullers_index/cv/ |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Fuller became a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity at the University of North Texas. In 2011, the University of Warwick appointed him to the [[Auguste Comte]] Chair in Social Epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/warwickpeople/steve_fuller_social_epistemology/ |title=Professor Steve Fuller appointed to Auguste Comte Chair in Social Epistemology |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Fuller was appointed a Fellow of the UK [[Academy of Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/warwickpeople/acss_three_awards |title=Academy of Social Sciences appoints three Warwick Academicians |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was appointed to an Honorary Professorship at [[Dalian University of Technology]], China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.dlut.edu.cn/article/2012/0524/42609.shtml (in Chinese)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528165211/http://news.dlut.edu.cn/article/2012/0524/42609.shtml |date=28 May 2012 }}.

==Work==
Fuller is most closely associated with [[social epistemology]] as an interdisciplinary research program. Social [[epistemology]] is a normative discipline that addresses philosophical problems of knowledge using the tools of history and the social sciences. Fuller founded the first journal (1987)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=tsep20#.VJ6H3V4gMA&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the first book (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Philosophy, Rhetoric, and the end of knowledge|date=1993|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-jJmvfREmQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Social+Epistemology%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K4qeVPCNAo3sasbwgrAF&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Social%20Epistemology%22&amp;f=false ]&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to this topic. The most obvious feature of Fuller's approach, already present in his 1988 book, is that he rejects out of hand the Cartesian problem of [[scepticism]].

Along with 21 books, Fuller has written 65 book chapters, 155 academic articles and many minor pieces. He has given many distinguished lectures and plenary addresses, and has presented to academic and non-academic audiences throughout the world, including over 100 media interviews. His works have been translated into fifteen languages. 23 academic symposia have been published on his work. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1994, the year he organized a conference in Durham on "Science's Social Standing".&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Since moving to the UK, Fuller has increasingly oriented himself towards public intellectual expression, including television, radio and internet, which he interprets as a natural outgrowth of his version of social epistemology. Two of his books have been recognised in this regard. ''[[Kuhn vs. Popper]]'' was Book of the Month for February 2005 in the US mass circulation magazine, ''Popular Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mone |first=Gregory |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-02/not-quite-rumble-theoretical-jungle |title=(Not Quite a) Rumble in the Theoretical Jungle &amp;#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=13 July 1965 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Rupert Read]] wrote: "I did not have to read far into this book in order to conclude that it is worthless. ... In sum: this book offers only a cartoon opposition of a fake 'Popper' to a fake 'Kuhn.'"&lt;ref name="2005Read"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Read | first = Rupert | title = Book review: How and how not to write on a "legendary" philosopher | journal = [[Philosophy of the Social Sciences (journal)|Philosophy of the Social Sciences]] | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 369–387 | doi = 10.1177/0048393105279925 | date = September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller responded, coining the word "Kuhnenstein" (Kuhn + Wittgenstein) to capture Read's view of Kuhn, which Fuller calls a "figment of Read's – and other's – fertile imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fuller | first = Steve | title = Kuhnenstein: or, the importance of being read | journal = [[Philosophy of the Social Sciences (journal)|Philosophy of the Social Sciences]] | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 480–498 | doi = 10.1177/0048393105280868 | date = December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Intellectual'' was selected as a Book of the Year in 2005 by the UK liberal-left magazine, ''New Statesman''. He periodically contributes a column to the Project Syndicate, associated with George Soros' Open Society project, which appears in several languages in newspapers across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project-syndicate.org/search?search_string=Steve+Fuller&amp;languageid=1&amp;rm=search&amp;submit=submit&amp;submit.x=17&amp;submit.y=13 Project Syndicate]. Project Syndicate. Retrieved on 14 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he also taught a course on the epistemology of journalism at an international summer school at the [[University of Lund]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomm.lu.se/summerschool/course1.html The Epistemology of Journalism Course Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118133435/http://www.icomm.lu.se/summerschool/course1.html |date=18 November 2006 }}, [[University of Lund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic freedom===

Fuller believes (modeled on what he takes to be the German model) that [[academic freedom]] is a freedom reserved for academics, not a special case of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = Steve | last2 = Haworth | first2 = Alan | title = Academic freedom | journal = [[The Philosophers' Magazine]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 72–77 | doi = 10.5840/tpm20073864 | date = 2007 }} Debating the [http://www.afaf.org.uk/afaf-statement/ "statement of academic freedom"] made by Academics for Academic Freedom (AFAF).&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the right to "cause reasoned offence", if within the terms of reason and evidence appropriate to the academic profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/against-the-grain-it-is-an-academics-right-to-cause-reasoned-offence-455905.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Against the grain: It is an academic's right to cause 'reasoned' offence | first=Nick | last=Jackson | date=5 July 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes it important for academics to be able to express intellectual opinions for further debate which can result in progress. He also argues that students are equally entitled to academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=410297 |title=A clear and present danger |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===
Fuller has made many statements about his support for [[intelligent design]] (ID) and authored two books on the subject. In 2005, in the case of ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', he testified on behalf of a local school system in the United States that required the teaching of intelligent design. The decision of the U.S. District Court held that intelligent design was a form of [[creationism]] and that its inclusion in the curriculum violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]]. The decision repeatedly cited Fuller's testimony to undermine the school system's position. Some of Fuller's critics within the [[Science and Technology Studies]] community described his participation in the trial as "naive" and suggested that the field needs further development before it can constructively engage the legal community on the nature of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lynch | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist) | title = From Ruse to Farce | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 819–826  | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067897 | date = December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmond | first1 = Gary | last2 = Mercer | first2 = David | title = Anti-social epistemologies | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 843–853 | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067900 | date = December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller has said that he does not support intelligent design "but feels that it should have a 'fair run for its money{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corbyn|first=Zoe|title=Steve Fuller: Designer trouble |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/31/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|publisher=The Guardian |location=London|date=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Dissent over Descent'', he says he sees religion in general as a motivating influence in scientific pursuits and believes that the difference between science and religion is more institutional than intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200538&amp;sectioncode=26 Schools for the Enlightenment or epiphany?: Steve Fuller], [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]], 25 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have called his views on science [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], though others characterise them as more closely related to [[Social constructionism#Social constructionism and postmodernism|social constructionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf Brief for Amicus Curiae, Scipolicy Journal of Science and Health Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204245/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Fuller.cfm Steve Fuller and The Hidden Agenda of Social Constructivism], Norman Levitt, Talk Reason&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2007, Fuller debated [[Lewis Wolpert]] at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] on whether evolution and intelligent design should be accorded equal status as scientific theories. Fuller supported the proposition. Fuller endorsed a work in support of Intelligent Design, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s textbook ''[[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreevolution.com/endorsements.php Endorsements], [[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism|Explore Evolution]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing in the 2008 film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', Fuller told an interviewer:&lt;ref name=expelled&gt;''Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed'' (2008 film). Rocky Mountain Pictures. Directed by Nathan Frankowski.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If you take seriously that evolution has to do with the transition of life forms, and that life and death are just natural processes, then one gets to be liberal about abortion and euthanasia. All of those kinds of ideas seem to me follow very naturally from a Darwinian perspective – a deprivileging of human beings, basically. And I think people who want to endorse Darwinism have to take this kind of viewpoint very seriously.}}

Fuller openly acknowledges that while some people simply do not like or accept either 'design in nature' or that human beings were created "in the image and likeness of God" (''imago Dei''), many people do and that it has been a consistent fixture in the progress, development and motivation for doing modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ51gVtJAw | first=Steve | last=Fuller |title="Why some people like the idea of design in nature and others don't" |work=University of Cambridge, |date=14 July 2012 |accessdate= 19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhumanism===
Much of his work focuses on questions around technological enhancements and how they can improve the capacities of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/bio/fuller/ Steve Fuller]. Ieet.org. Retrieved on 14 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller argues that the pursuit for enhancements is based on a need ″to create some distance between ourselves and the other animals.″ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | first=Kevin | last=Holmes | title = Talking to the future humans – Steve Fuller | url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/talking-to-the-future-humans-steve-fuller-transhumanism | work=Vice Media | date= 29 September 2011 | accessdate= 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Fuller, transhumanism offers humanity the prospect "to re-engineer the human body to enable us to live longer so as to work and play harder." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Humanity 2.0|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230233423|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He featured in the 2016 documentary [[The Future of Work and Death]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/03/no-more-death-taxes-but-do-we-really-want-to-live-forever-with-nothing-to-do|title=No more 'death &amp; taxes' – but do we really want to live forever with nothing to do?|last=Beard|first=Matthew|date=2017-03-02|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal works==

===''Science Vs Religion?''===
In 2007, Fuller wrote ''Science Vs Religion?: Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution''. In addition to introductory and conclusionary chapters, it has chapters on the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]], the thesis that modern science has its basis in an attempt by humanity to transcend itself and reach God, how Fuller believes complexity distinguishes ID from "other versions of creationism", legal issues, and the future of "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=13887 Review of ''Science Vs Religion?''], Sahotra Sarkar, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of mathematics at [[Rutgers University]], [[Norman Levitt]] in a review described it as "a truly miserable piece of work, crammed with errors scientific, historical, and even theological".&lt;ref name="2007Levitt"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature | title=Norman Levitt Deconstructs Steve Fuller's Postmodernist Critique of Evolution  | publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)]] |date=19 December 2007  | first=Norman | last= Levitt   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt took issue with the following points:&lt;ref name="2007Levitt"/&gt; 
*Fuller's acceptance at face value of [[William Dembski]]'s claims on complexity and randomness, and his failure to come to grips with the wealth of results that this field has generated and with the trenchant criticism of Dembski's claims (or even to describe these claims accurately);
*Fuller's disparagement of [[evolutionary biology]], without doing "serious analysis of the working methods and logical structure of biology itself" on which to base it;
*Fuller's misrepresentation of [[Isaac Newton]]'s religious beliefs in order to make a point that is in fact antithetical to Newton's views;
Levitt infers that Fuller's views arise from an "animosity to science as such and to its cognitive authority [that] still pervades academic life outside the dominion of the science faculty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature The Painful Elaboration of the Fatuous], Norman Levitt, eSkeptic, [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Fuller later responded to these points, accusing Levitt of axe-grinding and questioning his understanding of the book, which Fuller claimed was less a defense of contemporary intelligent design theory than a demonstration of its rootedness in the history of science.

===''Dissent Over Descent''===
In 2008 Fuller's book on the intelligent design controversy, ''Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism'' was published. Steven Poole of [[The Guardian]] wrote: "book is an epoch-hopping parade of straw men, incompetent reasoning and outright gibberish, as when evolution is argued to share with astrology a commitment to "action at a distance", except that the distance is in time rather than space. It's intellectual quackery like this that gives philosophy of science a bad name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview7 | title=Trivial pursuits Steve Fuller's Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism  | publisher=The Guardian |date=12 July 2008  | first=Steven | last=Poole | accessdate =10 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]], Philosopher of Science at [[Florida State University]] wrote in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that Fuller's book "is completely wrong and is backed by no sound scholarship whatsoever. In at least one case, Fuller makes his case by an egregious misreading—of something I wrote about the role of genetic drift in Sewall Wright's shifting balance theory. For the record, Charles Darwin set out to provide a cause, what he called—following his mentors like William Whewell (who in turn referred back to Newton)—a true cause or ''vera causa''. Darwin felt, and historians and philosophers of science as well as practicing evolutionary biologists still feel, that he succeeded…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/322/5898/47.pdf |format=PDF| title=A Challenge Standing on Shaky Clay  | publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 October 2008  | first=Michael | last=Ruse   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a "book of the week" review by retired Divinity Professor [[Keith Ward]] in the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]],'' the book was praised for providing often overlooked information and provocative interpretations, but was criticised for a number of inaccuracies and misrepresentations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=402929 The book of the week: Dissent over Descent], [[Times Higher Education Supplement]], 24 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of Suzuki method students performing on violin.]]
{{Music Education|major}}
The '''Suzuki method''' is an internationally known music curriculum and teaching philosophy dating from the mid-20th century, created by Japanese [[violin]]ist and pedagogue [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]] (1898–1998). The method aims to create an [[Nature versus nurture|environment]] for learning music which parallels the linguistic environment of acquiring a native language. Suzuki believed that this environment would also help to foster good [[moral character]].

==Background==
{{quote|I want to make good citizens.  If a child hears fine music from the day of his birth and learns to play it himself, he develops sensitivity, discipline and endurance.  He gets a beautiful heart.|Shinichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Suzuki Method was conceived in the mid-20th century by Suzuki, a Japanese [[violin]]ist who desired to bring beauty to the lives of children in his country after the devastation of [[World War II]]. As a skilled violinist but a beginner at the [[German language]] who struggled to learn it, Suzuki noticed that children pick up their native language quickly, and even dialects adults consider "difficult" to learn are spoken with ease by children at age five or six. He reasoned that if children have the skill to acquire their [[first language|native language]], they have the necessary ability to become proficient on a musical instrument.  

He pioneered the idea that preschool age children could learn to play the violin if the learning steps were small enough and the instrument was scaled down to fit their body.  He modeled his method, which he called {{nihongo|"Talent Education"|才能教育|sainō kyōiku}}, after his theories of natural [[language acquisition]]. Suzuki believed that every child, if properly taught, was capable of a high level of musical achievement. He also made it clear that the goal of such musical education was to raise generations of children with "noble hearts" (as opposed to creating famous musical [[child prodigy|prodigies]]).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|''...all'' children can be well educated...|Shin'ichi Suzuki}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The central belief of Suzuki, based on his language acquisition theories, is that all people can (and will) learn from their [[Nature versus nurture|environment]].  The essential components of his method spring from the desire to create the "right environment" for learning music (he believed that this positive environment would also help to foster excellent [[moral character|character]] in every student).  These components include:

*Saturation in the musical [[community]]. 
::This includes attending local classical music [[concert]]s, developing friendships with other music students, and listening to recordings of professional musicians in the home every day, starting before birth if possible.
*Deliberate avoidance of musical aptitude tests or [[audition]]s to begin music study. 
::Suzuki believed that teachers who test for musical aptitude before taking students, or who look only for "talented" students, are limiting themselves to people who have already started their music education. Just as every child is expected to learn their native language, Suzuki expected every child to be able to learn to play music.
*Emphasis on playing from a very young age,
::typically starting formal instruction between the ages of three and five years old.  (See [[Suzuki method#Technique|Technique]]).
*Using well-trained teachers.
::Suzuki believed in training musicians not only to be better musicians but also to be better teachers. Suzuki Associations worldwide offer ongoing teacher-training programs to prospective and continuing Suzuki teachers.  
*In the beginning, [[learning music by ear]] is emphasized over reading written [[musical notation]].  
::Suzuki observed that children speak before learning to read, and thought that children should also be able to play music before learning to read. To support learning by ear, students are expected to listen to recordings of the music they are learning daily. Other methods—such as [[Simply Music]], the Gordon Music Learning Theory, and Conversational Solfège—have students playing before reading notes, but may not have the same focus on daily listening and learning by ear.
*Memorization of all solo repertoire is expected.
::The focus on memorization continues even after a student begins to use [[sheet music]] to learn new pieces. 
*Music theory and note reading are left to the teacher. 
::The Suzuki method does not include a formal plan or prescribe specific materials for introducing music theory &amp; reading, in part because Suzuki created the method in a culture where music literacy was routinely taught in schools.
*Regular playing in groups (including playing pieces in [[unison]]) is strongly encouraged.
*Retaining and reviewing every piece of music ever learned is also strongly encouraged. 
::This is intended to raise technical and musical ability. Review pieces, along with "preview" parts of music a student is yet to learn, are often used in place of the more traditional [[etude]] books.  Traditional etudes and technical studies are not used in the beginning stages, which focus almost exclusively on a set of performance pieces.
*Frequent public performance makes performing feel like a natural and enjoyable part of being a musician.

The method discourages competitive attitudes between players, and advocates collaboration and mutual encouragement for those of every ability and level.  However, this does not mean the elimination of auditions or evaluations of student performances.

The parent of the young student is expected to supervise instrument practice every day, instead of leaving the child to practice alone between lessons, and to attend and take notes at every lesson so they can coach the student effectively. This element of the method is so prominent that a newspaper article once dubbed it "The Mom-Centric Method."&lt;ref name="meyermom"&gt;Meyer, Constance (2003-09-07). The Mom-centric method. LA Times, 7 September 2003. Retrieved from http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/07/entertainment/ca-meyer7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Although Suzuki was a violinist, the method he founded is not a "school of violin playing" (like the French or the Russian schools of playing) whose students can be identified by the set of techniques they use to play the violin.  However, some of the technical concepts Suzuki taught his own students, such as the development of "tonalization", were so essential to his way of teaching that they have been carried over into the entire method.  Other non-instrument specific techniques are used to implement the basic elements of the philosophy in each [[academic discipline|discipline]].

*'''Tonalization''' is a term coined by Suzuki, and is deliberately similar to the word "vocalization" (as it is used by singers when they talk about warming up their voices).  Tonalization is defined as the student's ability to produce and recognize a beautiful, ringing tone quality on their instrument. While initially developed for violin education, the tonalization technique has been applied to other instruments such as the piano. Suzuki believed that a student must learn tonalization in order to properly reproduce and perform music (Lavie, Karen, New Zealand Suzuki Journal, 2005).  Outside the Suzuki method, the term used is "tone production," and is part of Western music education stretching back to its beginning. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
*Using '''[[sound recording]]s''' is another technique common to all the musical instruments taught in the Suzuki method.  Thibeault's (2018) history of Suzuki's mediated pedagogy presents Suzuki as a technological innovator who created new ways of learning from sound recordings. Pre-recorded music is used to help students learn notes, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[rhythm]], and beautiful tone quality [[learning music by ear|by ear]]. Suzuki pointed out that great artists (such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) were surrounded with excellent performances from birth, and that the advent of recording technology made this aspect of their environment possible to achieve for large numbers of "ordinary" people whose parents were not themselves great musicians &amp; music teachers like [[Leopold Mozart|Mozart's father]] was.  So-called "traditional" (that is, not Suzuki trained) music educators have used this technique since the earliest days of recording technology; the difference in the Suzuki method is the scale on which Suzuki systematically insisted on daily listening in the home, from before birth if possible, and his focus on using recordings of beginner's repertoire alongside recordings of advanced repertoire.
*"Adult" sized '''instruments are adapted''' to meet the demands of a small child's body in various ways.  This lowers the age at which people are developmentally ready to begin studying an instrument.  Scaled down instrument sizes are used for children studying [[stringed instruments]]. Curved headjoint flutes with displaced keys which are closer together than normal flute keys &amp; holes are also available making it possible for children as young as 3 years old to study the flute through the Suzuki method.  Height adjustable chairs, benches, and footrests are used for piano, guitar, cello, and string bass.  Although fractional sized student violins were available when Suzuki began to teach, the success and popularity of his idea that pre-school aged children could also learn to play prompted [[luthier|violinmakers]] to scale violins down to even smaller [[violin#Sizes|sizes]] than before.
*'''Suzuki Institutes''' were established to encourage a musical community, train teachers, and provide a place where master teachers' ideas can be spread to the whole community of Suzuki students, teachers and parents.  These short term music festivals began in Matsumoto, Japan, where teachers &amp; students came to learn from Suzuki.  In the US, they often last for a week or two and include daily [[masterclass]]es; repertoire (group) classes; teacher training courses; concerts; discussion sessions; seminars; and various 'enrichment' classes in different musical styles, instruments, or non-musical (usually arts, crafts, or dancing) activities.  As at any music festival, participants must pay registration and tuition fees to the institute they are attending.  Each national Suzuki association handles registration for teacher training, and policies differ from country to country.
*A '''common repertoire''' for all students of an instrument was established.  This body of music allows each student to participate in group classes, helps foster local and international musical community and camaraderie, and provides motivation for students to learn new music while keeping the 'old' pieces they have learned in top form.  This is in direct contrast to music education outside of the method, in which teachers tailor the repertoire to the current need and level of the individual student.

{{quote|...If it is true that "everything in music is preparation" (Gerhart Zimmermann), then the genius of Suzuki is truly expressed in the scope and sequencing of the music....|Edward Kreitman}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The core Suzuki literature is published on [[sound recording|audio recordings]] and in [[sheet music]] books for each instrument, and Suzuki teachers supplement the repertoire common to each instrument as needed, particularly in the area of teaching reading.  One of the innovations of the Suzuki method was to make quality recordings of the beginners' pieces widely available, performed by professional musicians. Many traditional (non-Suzuki trained) music teachers also use the Suzuki repertoire, often to supplement their [[curriculum]], and they adapt the music to their own philosophies of teaching.

Another innovation of Suzuki was to deliberately leave out the large amount of technical instructions and exercises found in many beginners' music books of his day.  He favored a focus on melodic [[song]]-playing over technical exercises, and asked teachers to allow students to make music from the beginning, helping to motivate young children with short, attractive songs which can themselves be used as technique building exercises.  Each song in the common repertoire is carefully chosen to introduce some new or higher level of technique than the previous selection.

Suzuki teaching uses a common core repertoire for students of the same instrument worldwide, and although it focuses on Western European "classical" music, it emphasizes that this music can be a bridge across cultural and language barriers: one does not have to share the ethnic or national origin of the composers in order to learn or share the music. Suzuki created a series of rhythmic variations on the theme "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star", using rhythms from more advanced literature in units small enough for a beginner to grasp quickly.  Although these variations were created for violin, most of the instruments use them as a starting point for their repertoire.

===Violin===
The violin method was compiled and edited by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Suzuki]].  In ten volumes, beginning with Suzuki's [[Variation (music)|Variations]] on "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]" and ending with two [[Mozart]] concertos.  The first 3 books are mostly graded [[arrangements]] of music not originally written for solo violin, although book 1 contains several original compositions by Suzuki for violin &amp; piano. These arrangements are drawn from folk tunes and from composers such as [[Bach]], [[Telemann]], [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Beethoven]], [[Schubert]], [[Handel]], [[Paganini]], [[Boccherini]] and [[Brahms]]. Books 4–10 continue the graded selection by incorporating 'standard' or 'traditional' student violin solos by [[Fritz Seitz|Seitz]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Bach]], [[Veracini]], [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf|Dittersdorf]], [[Rameau]], [[Handel]], [[Mozart]], [[Fiocco]], and others. The Suzuki violin repertoire is currently in the process of being revised by the International Suzuki Association, and as part of the revision process, each regional Suzuki Association provides a recommended list of supplemental repertoire appropriate for students in books 6-8. The SAA supplemental repertoire list includes pieces by Bach, [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]], [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], and others (Suggested Supplementary Repertoire, 2013, and Preucil, 1985).

Audio recordings for books 1–4 are available in separate albums by artists such as [[David Nadien]], [[David Cerone]], Yukari Tate and Shin'ichi Suzuki. More recent recordings of volumes 1–4 by William Preucil, Jr. were released in 2007, along with revised versions of the first 4 books.  Recordings for books 5–8 have been made by [[Koji Toyoda]], although many of the pieces can be found separately on other artist's albums. In 2008 [[Takako Nishizaki]] made a complete set of recordings of Books 1-8 for [[Naxos Records]]. There are no official recordings of books 9 and 10 but these books, simply being Mozart's A major and D major violin concertos, have readily available recordings by various violinists. Completing the 10 volumes is not the end of the Suzuki journey, as many Suzuki violin teachers traditionally continue with the [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] concertos, along with pieces from other composers such as [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]],
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]].

===Viola===
The viola repertoire is in nine volumes, compiled and edited by [[Doris Preucil]]. Like the violin repertoire, much of the viola repertoire is drawn from the [[Baroque]] period. The first 3 volumes have been arranged (or [[transposition (music)|transposed]]) almost directly from the first 3 violin volumes, and the rest differ significantly as they delve into standard viola literature.  The viola books introduce shifting and work in higher positions earlier than the violin volumes, in anticipation of viola students being asked to play in ensembles sooner in their studies than violinists, and needing these skills to better handle orchestral or chamber music parts (Preucil, 1985). Viola volumes 4-8 include works by [[Telemann]], [[Henri Casadesus|Casadesus]], [[Bach]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Vivaldi]], [[Jean-Marie Leclair|Leclair]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]],and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]. Books 1–4 have been recorded on two albums by [[William Preucil]], and the rest are available in separate albums.

===Cello===
The cello repertoire is in ten volumes, with some early pieces arranged from the early violin volumes, and the first distinct piece (the second) being "French Folk Song".  Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi performs volumes 1 through 4. Volumes 4–10 contain works by: [[Vivaldi]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], [[David Popper|Popper]], [[Breval]], [[Goltermann]], [[William Henry Squire|Squire]], [[Bach]], [[Maria Theresa von Paradis|Paradis]], [[Henry Eccles|Eccles]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[von Goens]], [[Sammartini]], [[Haydn]], and [[Boccherini]].

===Piano===
The piano repertoire is composed of seven volumes. The first book begins with Variations on "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (as with the violin books) and continues with many folk songs and contemporary songs. As one progresses to the second book, there are pieces written by [[classical period (music)|romantic, classical]] and [[baroque music|baroque]] composers, such as Robert Schumann, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The third book is early intermediate level with several sonatinas and beginning with Sonatina in C Major, Op. 36, No. 1 by Muzio Clementi. The fourth book includes Sonata in G Major, Op. 49, No. 2 by Ludwig van Beethoven and ends with Minuet 1,  Minuet 2 and the Gigue from Partita in B{{Music|b}} by J.S. Bach.  The fifth book begins with the famous "[[Für Elise]]" by Beethoven and includes Sonata in C Major, Hob. XVI/35 by Franz Joseph Haydn.  The sixth book begins with the Sonata in C Major, K.545 by W.A. Mozart, and the seventh book begins with the Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major by [[Mozart]].  This book also includes "[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]" by [[Handel]] and Romanian Folk Dances by Béla Bartók. There are also many [[minuet]]s in the second book. The New International Edition adds some more recent compositions to the books, such as the music of Béla Bartók. Revised versions of the piano books have now been published.  The new volumes are collections of piano repertoire from all eras representing works by composers such as Mozart, Burgmüller, Beethoven, Bach, Tcherepnin, Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Daquin, Grieg, Granados, Villa-Lobos, Scarlatti, Handel, Bartók, and Debussy. Many pieces from the original books remain; some have been shifted to another volume.  The book/CD combo for Revised Books 4-7 is now available, and was performed by Japanese concert artist Seizo Azuma.

===Bass===
Currently there are five printed volumes in the [[double bass]] series, with the first three volumes also available on recordings. Nine volumes are planned and being compiled and edited by Dr. S Daniel Swaim (SAA, Chair), Virginia Dixon (SAA), Michael Fanelli (SAA), Domenick Fiore (SAA), and Eugene Rebeck (SAA). Volume 1 and 2 contain arrangements of the traditional Suzuki violin pieces mixed in with some new arrangements of other pieces. Volume 3 contains some new transcriptions of jazz, Gaelic, and folk songs; plus works by [[Handel]], [[Gossec]], [[Beethoven]], [[Bach]], Webster, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]. Famous pieces include: The Elephant from [[Carnival of the Animals]] by Saint-Saëns, [[Ode to Joy]] by Beethoven, and Largo from the [[New World Symphony]] by Dvořák.

===Flute===
The flute repertoire is compiled and edited by Toshio Takahashi. In fourteen volumes, beginning with [[Mary Had a Little Lamb]] and ending in the Flute Concerto by [[Otaka]]. Also included are concerti by [[Mozart]], [[Cimarosa]], [[Ibert]] and [[Quantz]]. Students also study music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Handel]], [[Michel Blavet|Blavet]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and other major composers.

===Recorder===
There are eight volumes of recorder repertoire for both soprano and alto recorder.  The recorder repertoire shares some early repertoire with other instruments, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", several Bach Minuets, etc.  Later books delve into more complex Renaissance and Baroque music, including instruction in intense Baroque ornamentation along with 17th-century Dutch and Italian articulation techniques.

===Guitar===
The [[classical guitar]] repertoire was compiled through a collaborative process involving teachers from the United States, Europe and Australia, and edited by Frank Longay.  The nine volumes begin with Twinkle Variations and many folk songs, and adds pieces originally written for the [[lute]] in the Renaissance, and spanning all musical time periods, including pieces by [[Gaspar Sanz|Sanz]], [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Matteo Carcassi|Carcassi]], [[Mauro Giuliani|Giuliani]], [[Fernando Sor|Sor]], [[Francisco Tárrega|Tarrega]], [[Isaac Albéniz|Albéniz]], [[Alonso Mudarra|Mudarra]], and Yocoh's [[Sakura Sakura|Sakura]] Variations.  Music in book one is performed by Frank Longay and Bill Kossler, with books two through four recorded by Seth Himmelhoch, Andrew LaFrenier, and Louis Brown.  George Sakellariou has recorded books five, six and seven and [[William Kanengiser]] recorded books 8 and 9, with the exception of [[Recuerdos de la Alhambra]] in book 9, which was recorded by [[Scott Tennant]].

===Harp===
The harp repertoire is in five volumes. These books are suitable for learning to read and play music on the pedal harp or the lever harp (folk harp, Irish/Celtic harp, etc. that preferably has 30 or more strings). Most of the music is arrangements of either folk music or classical music. Students of the lever harp will find some of the pieces in the later books to have challenging lever changes.  This series ultimately leads to more in-depth study of the pedal harp and its repertoire and teaches more of a classical style technique.  Those pursuing traditional Celtic music can use this as a foundation, however, the traditional style of teaching focuses on relying on the ear rather than on the written note.  Repertoire for volume six is selected, though the music is not published in a single book.&lt;ref&gt;http://suzukiharpinfo.com/whats-new-suzuki-harp/book-status/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
The voice repertoire is in five Levels.  Developed in Finland since 1986, the vocal repertoire of the Suzuki method has spread to over 20 countries including The United States, Australia, Europe, Asia and New Zealand. Teacher training courses are scheduled yearly in Europe, US and Australia.

===Organ===
The [[pipe organ]] repertoire was compiled and edited by Gunilla Rönnberg and Lars Hagström beginning in 1998.  Currently Volumes 1-4 have been published, Volumes 5 &amp; 6 will be published shortly, and material for Volumes 7 &amp; 8 is being researched. (Suzuki Organ website, 2010). As of 2011, an active Suzuki-training organ scheme is under way in the Australian city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]].

===Mandolin===
The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the mandolin is currently being researched in Italy by Amelia Saracco.

===Early childhood education and Suzuki in the schools===
Although [[early childhood education]] (ECE) is not an instrument, a curriculum for (pre-instrumental) ECE has been developed within the Suzuki philosophy by Dorothy Jones (SAA), Jeong Cheol Wong (ASA), Emma O'Keefe (PPSA), Anke van der Bijl (ESA), and Yasuyo Matsui (TERI).  Also, a "modified" Suzuki philosophy curriculum has been developed to apply Suzuki teaching to heterogeneous instrumental music classes &amp; string orchestras in schools.

===Trumpet===
Trumpet was added to the International Suzuki Association's list of Suzuki Method instruments in 2011. The application of Suzuki's teaching philosophy to the trumpet is currently being researched in Sweden; the first Trumpet teacher training course to be offered by the European Suzuki Association in 2013. (Suzuki Teacher Training for Trumpet, 2013).

===Supplemental materials===
Supplementary materials are also published under the Suzuki name, including some etudes, note-reading books, piano accompaniment parts, guitar accompaniment parts, [[duet]]s, [[trio (music)|trio]]s, [[string orchestra]], and [[string quartet]] arrangements of Suzuki repertoire.

==Historical notes==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
In the late 19th century, Japan's borders were [[Meiji period#Economy|opened to trade with the outside world]], and in particular to the importation of [[Western Culture]].  As a result of this, Suzuki's father, who owned a company which had manufactured the [[Shamisen]], began to manufacture [[violin]]s instead. (''Nurture by Love'' Documentary) In his youth, Shin'ichi Suzuki chanced to hear a [[phonograph]] recording of [[Franz Schubert]]'s Ave Maria, as played on violin by [[Mischa Elman]].  Gripped by the beauty of the music, he immediately picked up a violin from his father's factory and began to teach himself to play the instrument "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]".  His father felt that instrumental performance was beneath his son's social status, and refused to allow him to study the instrument.  At age 17, he began to teach himself by ear, since no formal training was allowed to him.  Eventually he convinced his father to allow him to study with a violin teacher in Tokyo. (Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

At age 22, Suzuki travelled to Germany to find a violin teacher to continue his studies.  While there, he studied privately with [[Karl Klingler]], but did not receive any formal degree past his high school diploma.  He met and became friends with [[Albert Einstein]], who encouraged him in learning classical music.  He also met, courted, and married his wife, Waltraud.(Suzuki, ''Nurtured by Love'')

In 1945, Suzuki began his Talent Education movement in [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], [[Japan]] shortly after the end of [[World War II]].  Raising children with "noble hearts" (inspired by great music and diligent study) was one of his primary goals; he believed that people raised and "nurtured by love" in his method would grow up to achieve better things than war. One of his students during this post-1945 period was violinist Hidetaro Suzuki, no relation, who later became a veteran of international violin competitions (Tchaikovsky, Queen Elizabeth, Montreal International) and then the longtime concertmaster of the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]]. (Hermann, 1981)

Eventually, the center of the Suzuki movement in education was established as the Talent Education Research Institute (TERI) in Matsumoto.  TERI hosts thousands of people each year—students, parents, teachers, (and teacher trainees).  Other organizations have sprung up all over the world to help oversee the movement and train teachers.  These include the Asia Suzuki Association, the Suzuki Association of the Americas, the European Suzuki Association (which is currently assisting in the beginnings of the Suzuki movement in [[Africa]]), and the Pan-Pacific Suzuki Association.(International Suzuki Association, 2016).

[[John D. Kendall]] of [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] brought the Suzuki method, along with adaptations to better fit the requirements of the American classroom, to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s (''Nurtured by Love'' Documentary). [[Vilem Sokol]] of the [[Seattle Youth Symphony]] hosted Suzuki in Seattle. The majority of American Suzuki pedagogues and teaching methods are grounded in the Suzuki-Kendall system.  Other pioneers of the Suzuki Method in the US include [[Roland and Almita Vamos]], Elizabeth and Harlow Mills, [[Betty Haag]], Louise Behrend, Dorothy Roffman, William Starr, Anastasia Jempelis, and Margery Aber.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The '''Tehran Monolingual Corpus''' (TMC) is a large-scale Persian monolingual corpus. TMC is suited for [[Language model|Language Modeling]] and relevant research areas in [[Natural Language Processing]].

The corpus is extracted from [[Hamshahri Corpus]] and [[Iranian Students News Agency|ISNA news agency]] website. The quality of Hamshahri corpus is improved for language modeling purpose by a series of [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]] and spell-checking steps.

TMC comprises more than 250 million words. The total number of unique words (with frequency of two or more) of the corpus is about 300 thousand, which is relatively good for a highly-inflectional language like Persian.

TMC is created by Natural Language Processing Lab of [[University of Tehran]]. The corpus is free for research use, after obtaining permission from the corpus aggregator.

"'''The Art of Donald McGill'''" is a critical essay first published in 1941 by the English author [[George Orwell]]. It discusses the genre of English saucy [[Seaside postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]]s that were sold mostly in small shops in British coastal towns, and particularly the work of its prime exponent, [[Donald McGill]]. Orwell notes the role of this type of humour as a rebellion against convention in society and states that, despite the vulgarity, he would be sorry to see the postcards vanish.

==Background==
Seaside postcards represent the low humour and wordplay that was characteristic of the Victorian [[music hall]]. They were sold by newsagents and at booths along the front at British seaside holiday resorts.

McGill created an estimated 12,000 of the colour washed drawings which were then reproduced as postcards and an estimated 200 million were printed and sold.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/postcard_censorship_20040714.shtml BBC Radio 4 Postcard Censorship]&lt;/ref&gt; His career began in 1904 when he was encouraged by a relation who saw an illustrated get-well card McGill had made for a sick nephew. Within a year it was his full-time occupation.&lt;ref name=Ind&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/sun-sea-and-censorship-551680.html The Independent Rhoda Koenig ''Sun, Sea and Censorship'' 1 July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; McGill studied art and married the daughter of the owner of [[Greenwich Theatre|Crowder's Music Hall]] in [[Greenwich]]. Such postcards were associated with embarrassment and McGill noted that his two daughters "ran like stags whenever they passed a comic postcard shop".

Orwell's interest in such postcards began in his schooldays in [[Eastbourne]]. [[Jacintha Buddicom]] recalls him around the age of twelve at Shiplake and Henley when he kept a collection in an album. She recalls that some were kept in a manilla envelope because they were "too vulgar" to be put on display.&lt;ref&gt;Jacintha Buddicom ''Eric &amp; Us'' 1974 Leslie Frewin&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Such, Such Were the Joys]]" Orwell reports his alarm at being stared at with suspicion by a man as he came out a [[newsagent's shop]] in Eastbourne, although he says in the essay that he was buying sweets.

==Publication==
"The Art of Donald McGill" was first published in ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' in September 1941. The article has appeared in many anthologies including ''[[Critical Essays (Orwell)|Critical Essays]]'' (1946), ''Collected Essays'' (1961), ''[[Decline of the English Murder]] and Other Essays'' (1965) and ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' (1968), republished by the Donald McGill Museum &amp; Archive Ryde (2010) with for the first time examples of the cards discussed accompanying the text.

==Summary==
Orwell identifies the overpowering vulgarity, the crude drawing and unbearable colours of the seaside postcard which specialises in very 'low' humour. He selects McGill because he sees his work as the most representative and perfect in the tradition, although he is ignorant of whether McGill is a real individual or just a corporate name.

Orwell picks out the main subjects of the postcards as sex, home life, drunkenness, [[Toilet humour|WC jokes]], snobbery within the working-class, stereotypical figures and topical politico-social fads. They feature illegitimacy, the mother-in-law, the hen-pecked husband, the middle-aged drunk, chamber pots, the nervous clergyman who says the wrong thing, [[malapropism]]s and "an endless succession of fat women in tight bathing-dresses." He concludes that this reflects, on a comic level, the working-class outlook that youth and adventure, and even individual life, end with marriage.

Orwell considers that in England under censorship laws there is a wide gap between what can be said and what can be printed. He sees comic post cards as the only medium in which really "low" humour is printable although similar jokes are part and parcel of the revue and music-hall, and can be heard on the radio.

Orwell presents a thesis of duality in human nature which he calls the [[Don Quixote]]–[[Sancho Panza]] combination—the conflict between high-minded respectability and vulgar buffoonery. "Society has always to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice—that they should work hard, pay their taxes, and be faithful to their wives, men should think it glorious to die on the battlefield and women should want wear themselves out with child-bearing. The postcards represent the worm's-eye view of life where "marriage is a dirty joke or a comic disaster... where the lawyer is always a crook and the Scotsman always a miser, where the newly-weds make fools of themselves on the hideous beds of seaside lodging-houses and the drunken, red-nosed husbands roll home at four in the morning to meet the linen-nightgowned wives who wait for them behind the front door, poker in hand". Orwell brings in a quotation from [[Ecclesiastes]] (vii 15).

Such postcards are therefore symptomatically important as a sort of [[saturnalia]], a harmless rebellion against virtue. Orwell notes that the mood of the comic post card could appear between the murders in Shakespeare's tragedies&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Macbeth'', Act 2, scene 1&lt;/ref&gt; but that this type of humour in literature had been repressed from the beginning of the 19th century and has dwindled to these "ill-drawn post cards, leading a barely legal existence in cheap stationers' windows".

==Postscript==
In 1954, under a government crackdown on declining morals, McGill was prosecuted and fined under the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;"The World of Donald McGill" Buckland,E: London, Blandford, 1990 {{ISBN|0-7137-1400-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This almost wiped out the industry. In 1957 he gave evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee which was revising the legislation.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

In the light of an exhibition of the work of McGill in 2004, various critics have challenged Orwell's dismissive view of the quality of the art.&lt;ref name=Ind/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000824.php The Social Affairs Unit – Christie Davies "Donald McGill was a far better artist than Orwell acknowledges"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended''''' is an approximately 87,000-word composition written by Sir [[Isaac Newton]], first published posthumously in 1728 in limited supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaac |last= Newton |title=The chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended : To Which is Prefix'd, A Short Chronicle From the First Memory of Things in Europe, to the Conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great  |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-37430|year=1728|publisher= Printed for J. Tonson ; J. Osborn ; T. Longman |place=London |edition=1 |volume=|access-date= June 17, 2016| via=e-rara.ch (ETH-Bibliothek Zürich)|doi= 10.3931/e-rara-37430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it had been republished in mass paperback format.  The work represents one of Newton's forays into the topic of [[chronology]], detailing the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms throughout antiquity.

The treatise is composed of eight primary sections.  First is an introductory letter to [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the [[List of English consorts|Queen of England]] by Newton's estate manager [[John Conduitt]], followed by a short advertisement.  After this is found a section entitled "''A Short Chronicle''" which serves as a brief historical list of events listed in chronological order, beginning with the earliest listed date of 1125 BC and the most recent listed at 331 BC.  The majority of the treatise, however, is in the form of six chapters that explore the history of specific civilizations.  These chapters are titled:

*Chap. I. Of the Chronology of the First Ages of the Greeks.
*Chap. II. Of the Empire of Egypt.
*Chap. III. Of the Assyrian Empire.
*Chap. IV. Of the two Contemporary Empires of the Babylonians and Medes.
*Chap. V. A Description of the Temple of Solomon.
*Chap. VI. Of the Empire of the Persians.

According to John Conduitt's introductory letter, ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' was Isaac Newton's last personally revised work before his death but had actually been written much earlier.  Some of its subject material and contents have led many people to categorize this work as one of [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].

==Summary==

The book attempts to revise the accepted ancient chronology of Newton's day, in order to prove that [[Solomon]] was the earliest king in the world, and that his Temple the first ever built, with all others being copies, beginning with [[Sesostris]], King of Egypt, followed by others. Newton's results, therefore, diverge widely from presently accepted dates, often more widely than the system that he attempted to displace.

Newton attempted to [[Euhemerism|identify various mythological figures as historical]] or Biblical individuals, such as arguing that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] was [[Noah]], the [[Sky deity|god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was [[Shem]], and [[Osiris]] and [[Dionysus]] were [[Sesostris]].&lt;ref name="Ernest"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cs.nyu.edu/davise/papers/Newton.pdf |title=Review of Newton and the Origin of Civilization, by Jed Z.
